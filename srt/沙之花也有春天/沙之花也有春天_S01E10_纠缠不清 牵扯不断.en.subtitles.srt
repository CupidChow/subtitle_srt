1
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,962
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

2
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,675
I'm going to training.
Don't skip breakfast.

3
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:22,582
When I was little,
people often used to tell me,

4
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,169
"You must be lonely, Du-sik."

5
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,755
"You must be so bored alone."

6
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,553
But they had no idea
what they were talking about.

7
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,518
I never had time
to be lonely or bored back then.

8
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,816
-That hurts!
-First of all,

9
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,151
I had Kim Baek-du, whom I hung out with.

10
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,070
-Wait up!
-All day long.

11
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,613
Hey, Oh Du-sik!

12
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,073
-You didn't comb--
-It's fine.

13
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,658
Wait. Eat this.

14
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,784
-I'm good.
-Eat one more.

15
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,119
I had Jin-su too.

16
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,496
-Hey, Baek-du.
-Jin-su!

17
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,290
Hey, kiddos.

18
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,836
Don't forget your notebook.
Did you do your homework?

19
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,838
-I've got to go.
-Hold this.

20
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,589
Chew it well.

21
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,217
And don't eat what fell on the ground.

22
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,219
-Fine.
-Wait!

23
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,054
No fights! No idling!

24
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,723
You're like a boy.

25
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,724
You are a boy.

26
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,937
-I had Seok-hui too.
-Did you do homework?

27
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,188
Did you forget about it?

28
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,150
It was easy for me.
I solved so many problems.

29
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,904
What's the answer?

30
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,739
It's one.

31
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,533
-I'm like a grandma.
-That's not it!

32
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,786
I had Mi-ran too.

33
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,501
Mi-ran!

34
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,883
We were always together.

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,519
EPISODE 10 - ENDLESSLY TANGLED,
PERSISTENTLY INTERTWINED

36
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,814
I really like you.

37
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,151
I really do.

38
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,824
So…

39
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,995
you're saying

40
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,414
that you…

41
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,000
-have those feelings?
-Yes.

42
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,752
-I like you.
-All right. Jeez.

43
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,545
Stop saying that.

44
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,923
I heard what you said.

45
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,468
Okay.

46
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,762
Seriously.

47
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,182
I did not see this coming.

48
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,603
You really have a knack

49
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,981
of baffling me.

50
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,399
I know, right?

51
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,902
When I realized that I liked you,

52
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,612
-I also--
-Gosh, please!

53
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:03,201
Stop saying that you like me.

54
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,163
It's too cheesy.

55
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,714
Why are you staring at me like that?

56
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,350
Hey.

57
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,686
Baek-du.

58
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,899
-I--
-Not yet!

59
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,194
I don't want to hear your answer yet.

60
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,947
You don't want to hear it?

61
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,575
Then why did you say it?

62
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,537
As I just said,

63
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,580
I don't want to have any regrets.

64
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,125
If I don't do anything again

65
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,086
and just let you go back to Seoul,

66
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,380
then this time,

67
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,092
it won't be 20 years of regret.
I'll regret it for 200 years!

68
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,722
So let me join you.

69
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,140
No.

70
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,726
I will join you.

71
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,818
Seriously, Baek-du, that brat,

72
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,405
makes my heart sink all the time.

73
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,698
TODAY, IMMA GET DRUNK!

74
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,617
Your liver will sink first.

75
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,000
Jeez, you're going
to regret this tomorrow.

76
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,127
When you wake up tomorrow morning…

77
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,629
Gosh.

78
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,425
Hyeon-ja.

79
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,011
Do you ever think about Du-sik?

80
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,598
Of course I do.

81
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:55,521
The kids used to hang out together
all the time.

82
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,441
I think about her from time to time.

83
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,360
I wonder where she is,

84
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,280
how she's doing,

85
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,032
and if she's married.

86
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,576
What about you?

87
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,789
Something's always been

88
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,249
weighing on my heart.

89
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,421
Du-sik, that girl,

90
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,717
was the same age as Baek-du,
but she was much brighter.

91
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,596
She seemed tough on the outside,
but she was soft inside.

92
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,931
Right.

93
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,684
She must have been

94
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,396
really hurt then.

95
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,113
Gosh, stop.

96
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,824
-No, let me.
-Let me pour you a glass.

97
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,912
Let's drink together.

98
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,587
But people change, apparently.

99
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,549
I used to think about her 100 times a day.

100
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,094
Then, after some time,
it became 50 times a day.

101
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,682
Then, after a while,
ten times, maybe less.

102
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,601
Then some days,

103
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,105
I wouldn't even think about her.

104
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,068
I know. That's what time does.

105
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,572
You see, my boy Baek-du…

106
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,034
What? Oh, you…

107
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,661
Back then,

108
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,039
after Du-sik left like that,

109
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,421
he cried for a few days.

110
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,466
Then he seemed okay,

111
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,138
so I thought he just forgot about her.
I thought he forgot because he was young.

112
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,892
Can you believe it?

113
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,358
I'm his mother,

114
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,364
and I had no idea
what my own son was going through.

115
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,867
Seriously.

116
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,579
I'm the worst mom in the world.

117
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,667
Seriously…

118
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,213
-Jin-suk.
-This is driving me crazy.

119
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,298
You're completely wasted.

120
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,553
I should just die.

121
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,181
-Don't say that.
-Gosh.

122
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,685
What's the point of living?

123
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,686
Jeez.

124
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,063
-Okay.
-Am I right?

125
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,356
Stop drinking.

126
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,273
Suk.

127
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,653
Goodness. Hi.

128
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,239
-Jin-suk.
-Wait.

129
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,368
I know this man.

130
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,037
Why did you drink so much?

131
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,831
This man looks familiar.

132
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,376
Where have I seen him?

133
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,337
-Oh, my.
-Gosh, I'm drunk.

134
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,590
It's just that…

135
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,842
She's a little upset today.

136
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,553
Jin-suk.

137
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,806
Well…

138
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,642
In front of everyone, Baek-du said

139
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,394
-Du-sik--
-I heard about it.

140
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,478
On my way here.

141
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,063
I see.

142
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,276
In people's eyes,

143
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,112
Baek-du might have just seemed angry,

144
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,240
but his mom could see

145
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,867
how heartbroken he was.

146
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,208
Hey.

147
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,961
Kim Tae-baek.

148
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,799
What?

149
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,639
What?

150
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,186
We adults…

151
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,608
have done so much wrong.

152
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,319
Right?

153
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,032
Right.

154
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,161
Adults do so much wrong indeed.

155
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,588
Gosh, I'm so tired.

156
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,333
Hey, Dad. What's up?

157
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,712
You're awake.

158
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,843
I heard everything.

159
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,766
I see.

160
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,398
I guess word's spread already.

161
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,818
How fast.

162
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,364
Is that why you said that?

163
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,033
What?

164
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,414
You said that we shouldn't have
let Du-sik go like that

165
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,586
and that we should've done
whatever it took to make her stay.

166
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,841
Well, that's…

167
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,428
Baek-du.

168
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,347
Back then,

169
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,933
I had no choice.

170
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,853
In life,

171
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,857
there are moments
where you need to make decisions.

172
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,611
And I don't always
make the right decisions.

173
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,699
I just try to find the best answer

174
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,828
in the given situation.

175
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,166
And back then,

176
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,752
that was my best choice.

177
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,009
But today, I realized

178
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,929
maybe it wasn't the right answer.

179
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,989
I really like you.

180
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,160
I really do.

181
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:11,040
Do you know
how often I think of that night

182
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,125
and how much I regret it?

183
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,711
"I should've run faster."

184
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,756
"I should've called your name out louder."

185
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,799
"I should've run out
of the house earlier."

186
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,011
No. "I should've taken the hint

187
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:28,516
when you came to my house."

188
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,520
I've regretted it
hundreds of thousands of times.

189
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,439
But I don't want
to regret anything anymore.

190
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,778
I was too young back then

191
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,199
to do anything to stop you.
I had to let you go.

192
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,867
But this time, I won't let you.

193
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,668
So let me join you.

194
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,921
No. I will join you.

195
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,109
God damn it!

196
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,404
Gosh, you scared me!

197
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,282
Why are you standing there like that?

198
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,368
I thought I got kidnapped or something.

199
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,204
Gosh, my head.

200
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,126
It feels like my head's going to explode.

201
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,295
I heard you drank a lot yesterday.

202
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,212
Where?

203
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,466
Jin-su's Restaurant. Where else?

204
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,510
Right? I told you.

205
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,266
Gosh, my head hurts.

206
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,811
What time did I come home last night?

207
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,941
Did Hyeon-ja take me home?

208
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,651
I always feel like

209
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,946
you don't have any right
to nag about Baek-du's drinking habits.

210
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,615
They're obviously from you.

211
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,408
Hey, move.

212
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,452
Get out of the way.

213
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,164
Seriously, you shouldn't nag him
about his drinking habits.

214
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,540
Gosh, my head.

215
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,627
Why? Did something happen yesterday?

216
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,962
Dad carried you home last night.

217
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,797
He put pain relief patches on.

218
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,383
-Right.
-He put the patches all over his back,

219
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,511
and they almost look like tiles.

220
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,846
Right.

221
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,726
By the way,
when we went jogging this morning,

222
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,437
we heard something strange.

223
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,650
We heard that Baek-du talked
about Du-sik in front of people

224
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,235
and got really angry yesterday.
Is that true?

225
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,494
Where's Baek-du?

226
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,496
He went out this morning.

227
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,206
He must be embarrassed.

228
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,167
Everyone's talking about that.

229
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,798
All right. Let's see.

230
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,718
Right. Baek-du got furious yesterday.

231
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,553
No way.

232
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,639
I've never seen him angry.

233
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,182
It was my first time too.

234
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,435
He said we didn't believe
Du-sik's family and kicked them out.

235
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,770
He was so angry.

236
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,314
-What? Really?
-Yes.

237
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,525
But why did he suddenly bring Du-sik up?

238
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,860
I don't know. When his mom asked

239
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,947
if he was dating this Yu-gyeong girl,

240
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,324
he suddenly lost it.

241
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,284
-Really?
-Yes.

242
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,121
That doesn't sound like him.

243
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,747
-I know.
-He's a good boy.

244
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,041
-I know, right?
-Jeez.

245
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,513
I did not lose it.

246
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,140
That's exaggerated.

247
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:03,856
All right.

248
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,816
Let's put the ledger aside and think.

249
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,195
There were signs of strangulation on Choi,
and given the circumstances,

250
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,156
the last person to call Choi,

251
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,658
from the number that starts with 056,

252
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,327
seems to be our prime suspect.

253
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,871
It's just natural to think

254
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,207
Choi went to meet that person
before he died.

255
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,003
Right? But what if…

256
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,255
What if the number was

257
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:33,177
the same as the payphone number
on Coach Yeon's call history?

258
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,890
That means that person's
the one who asked Yeon to fix the match.

259
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:43,645
And think about the last thing
Choi said to the café owner.

260
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,190
"The person
who killed Joo Cheol-yong is here."

261
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,941
Doesn't that sound like

262
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,821
the person is connected
to the incident from back then?

263
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,826
Yu-gyeong?

264
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,541
Excuse me, Ms. Oh Du-sik.

265
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,961
Don't you play games with me.

266
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,547
So focus. I'm here because of you.

267
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,092
What? I was listening.

268
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,428
What did you hear?
What did I say just now?

269
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,055
Tell me what I just said.

270
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,144
See? You were zoning out.

271
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,231
Yu-gyeong, if you have a conscience…

272
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,526
Wait.

273
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,655
Did you put on blusher?

274
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,034
Blusher? What are you talking about?

275
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,538
Gosh, I can't believe
I'm seeing you with blusher on.

276
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,211
Hi, Su-chan.

277
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,214
You were right about the used car agency.

278
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,383
They do sell fake plates.

279
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,717
Really?

280
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,929
Then what about Choi Chil-seong's number?

281
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,599
We might be able to find it out too.

282
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,186
I showed Choi's photo to the owner,
and he recognized him.

283
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,688
Once I get the number,

284
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,399
I'll ask the carrier
for the call and GPS log.

285
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:14,528
Okay. Call me
as soon as you find something.

286
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:16,905
Okay. Bye.

287
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,827
What's up? What did he say?

288
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,787
I think we found Choi's phone number.

289
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,455
Really? How?

290
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,000
He found the person
who sold the fake plate to him.

291
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,005
Then, once we get the call log,
we'll find everything.

292
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,215
It'll be game over.

293
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,427
We never know.
If he hadn't used this number for long,

294
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,636
we might get nothing.

295
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,055
Right.

296
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,225
Still,

297
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,936
I think we might find something.

298
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,274
-I'll see you later.
-Don't skip meals.

299
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,651
Hey, Jin-su.

300
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,321
Sit down here for a moment.

301
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,655
Why? I don't want to.

302
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,909
It won't take long.
There's something I want to tell you.

303
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,622
Make it quick. I need to go to the gym.

304
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,957
Jeez, stop acting all busy.

305
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,667
Did you hear that?

306
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,461
-Yesterday, Baek-du--
-Yeah, I did.

307
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,670
You heard?

308
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,464
What's wrong with him?

309
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,466
We were Du-sik's friends too,

310
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,801
but what's the point
of bringing that up now?

311
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,054
Well, that was…

312
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,514
He didn't mean to talk about Du-sik.

313
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,977
Seeing everyone gossiping about him

314
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,147
probably reminded him
of how she must've felt.

315
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,523
Do you think so?

316
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,442
Well, I don't.

317
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,528
Baek-du is using Du-sik to trick us.

318
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,446
What?

319
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,156
Ms. Lim.

320
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,409
I told you many times
that I don't eat runny eggs.

321
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,413
And you've been making them runny
for 30 years now.

322
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,581
For 30 years?

323
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,875
Well, I didn't know

324
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,420
you had fried eggs for dessert
after suckling as a baby.

325
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,797
Seriously, fried eggs?

326
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,926
Fine. I'll go fry it more.

327
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,512
Where was I?

328
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:08,100
Right. I think Baek-du
is using Du-sik to trick us.

329
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,643
What do you mean?

330
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,814
I knew something was off.

331
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,774
Now, everything falls into place.

332
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,277
What on earth are you talking about?

333
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,696
You see…

334
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,080
Training hasn't even started,
and I'm already exhausted.

335
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,144
Hey, you came.

336
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,354
Yeah, I'm here.

337
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,025
I see. You are here.

338
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,617
Would you like to drink some?

339
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,954
No, you can have it all.

340
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,171
So…

341
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:24,426
About what I said yesterday,
did you think about it?

342
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:26,928
What?

343
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,639
You said you didn't want the answer.

344
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,477
No, not that. Not my love confession--

345
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,686
Gosh, be quiet.

346
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,607
People can hear you. Keep it down.

347
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,652
Not that.

348
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,906
Yesterday, I said I'd join you.

349
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,574
Did you think about that?

350
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,909
Oh.

351
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,953
That's what you meant.

352
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,830
-Yeah.
-I see.

353
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:58,585
I mean, you're leaving soon anyway,

354
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,922
so why not let me help you?

355
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,008
I don't think so. You can't help me.

356
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,011
Hey, that's not fair.

357
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:12,140
Don't you remember
you asked me to ask Beom-su

358
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,186
about who Coach Yeon was arguing with
on the day of the match.

359
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,938
And… What else?

360
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,231
Dong-seok!

361
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,943
I let you hear the important information
from Dong-seok that day.

362
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,113
What else? There's more.

363
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,615
Han-ra's video.

364
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,284
I let you watch all that.

365
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,578
-So you can't--
-I found nothing from it.

366
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,581
-My eyes just got tired.
-That's what you have to say?

367
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,835
You're pretty cold, you know.

368
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,420
So you won't let me join you?

369
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,926
You really won't?

370
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,429
By the way,

371
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,808
when was it?

372
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,393
What do you mean?

373
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:03,400
When did you start feeling that way?

374
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,694
-That way?
-Yeah.

375
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,863
Oh, that.

376
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:14,161
Hey, you're talking as if my feelings
are a taboo word or something.

377
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,080
Why can't you just say the word "like"?

378
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,044
All right. Let me think.

379
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,423
Well…

380
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,055
Why does it take that long?

381
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:39,227
Well… About 30 years?

382
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,187
What?

383
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,023
We're 32 now.

384
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,651
I know. Wait, no.

385
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,238
It's 31 years.

386
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,410
You're crazy.

387
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,456
You think that makes any sense?

388
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,586
You see…

389
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,383
The other day, Baek-du told me

390
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,761
that he was possessed by some evil girl.

391
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,179
Some evil girl?

392
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,433
And I thought hard
about who that could be,

393
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,851
and it's your manager.

394
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,394
How do you know?

395
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,855
The day after she moved to this town,

396
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,608
Baek-du came to our station in the morning

397
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,527
and asked me if I could do
a background check on someone.

398
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,820
Background check?

399
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,949
He said he thought the new manager was Du…

400
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,203
Du-sik, so I should have a look.

401
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,829
So did you?

402
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,539
You idiots.

403
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,460
You think background checks are so easy?

404
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,880
Instead, I checked her childhood photos.

405
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,427
And it wasn't her.
Those two can't be the same person.

406
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:58,431
They have nothing in common, except that
they have eyes, noses and mouths.

407
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,977
Anyway, here's what I think.

408
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,480
Baek-du is indeed
in a love affair with the manager.

409
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,359
And to shut the mouths of the people
who were accusing him,

410
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:12,862
he randomly brought Du-sik up. Why?

411
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,699
Because it'd make them feel uncomfortable.

412
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,163
Stop saying that.

413
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,374
Why won't you let me say it?

414
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,293
Why is it so absurd that I like you?

415
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,004
There you go again. Stop saying that.

416
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,423
Why should I? What's wrong with that?

417
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,757
It gives me the creeps.

418
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,426
I don't think so.

419
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,969
Stop it.

420
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,512
We can't do this.

421
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:40,056
-You're so annoying.
-What's wrong with liking you?

422
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,182
I don't know!

423
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,893
What do you know? It gives me the creeps.

424
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,480
-Why won't you let me even say it?
-Don't say it. Just listen to me.

425
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,441
You asked me, so I said it.

426
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,192
Why is it absurd that I like you?

427
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,195
There you go again. Stop saying that.

428
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,199
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

429
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:03,038
Captain, I think we should ask for backup…

430
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,875
Why don't you just call Yu-gyeong
and Hyeon-uk back here?

431
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,669
Investigating this ledger
is our top priority now.

432
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,005
They don't know what should come first.

433
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,716
Where's the record after 2020?

434
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,093
-2020?
-2020…

435
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,639
I don't have it.

436
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,935
Oh, right. You must have it.

437
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,313
I gave you the most recent records.

438
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,272
I see.

439
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,066
But I don't see it.

440
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,493
Wait. Captain.

441
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,871
We got the call log
from Choi's burner phone.

442
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,999
CALL LOG

443
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,338
One, two, three, four.

444
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,716
One, two, three, four.

445
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,843
Geosan!

446
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,642
One, two, three, four.

447
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,852
-One, two…
-What's he doing?

448
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,105
What are you doing? Run!

449
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,315
Seven more laps to go. Come on.

450
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,651
If you slack off, you'll go to hell!

451
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,487
-What are you looking at?
-What is it?

452
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,364
-You'll go to hell.
-Hell.

453
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,991
Geosan!

454
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,662
The number is 056-255-4005.

455
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,498
It's the same number
as the one from Yeon's call log.

456
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,294
Choi had many calls from this number too.
And it was the last call.

457
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,755
Good luck, then.

458
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,426
One, two, three, four.

459
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,010
Geosan!

460
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,940
Snowball must've run away again.

461
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,442
Jeez.

462
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,625
Thank you.

463
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,506
Do you like Du-sik?

464
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:21,968
Me?

465
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:26,639
You could've headed back to Seoul,
but you decided to stay with her.

466
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,183
That's not what it is.

467
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:39,527
I know. I may look cold, haughty…

468
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,321
And how can I put it?

469
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,032
A little unapproachable.
I know I look like that.

470
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,493
But I'm not like that inside.

471
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,621
Despite appearances, I'm incredibly loyal

472
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,039
-and responsible--
-I see.

473
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:52,916
Okay.

474
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,252
By the way,

475
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,381
do you know anyone here

476
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,843
who might have known
Choi Chil-seong for a while?

477
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,762
What?

478
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:11,267
I mean, Choi said that the culprit
from 20 years ago was here,

479
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,895
and the phone call from that day.

480
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,774
Choi's phone had
several calls from that number.

481
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,736
Someone called him
from a payphone at that hour.

482
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,113
It means it's likely one of the villagers.

483
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:29,744
And that means one of the villagers
knew Choi and called him. Right?

484
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,290
So I was wondering
if it would ring any bells for you.

485
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,422
No.

486
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,633
I don't know.

487
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,595
I see.

488
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,398
-Go.
-Come on.

489
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,028
What is it, Beom-su?

490
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,823
Baek-du.

491
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:12,579
I'm not asking this because I'm curious.

492
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,580
What is it?

493
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,748
Are you

494
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,543
and Ms. Oh…

495
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,176
-Ms. Oh…
-What about Ms. Oh?

496
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,344
Oh, my.

497
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,596
-Ms. Oh…
-Hey.

498
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,764
Step aside. Gosh, you're frustrating.

499
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,892
Baek-du, I'll ask you point-blank.

500
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,021
Do you like Ms. Oh?

501
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,317
Gosh, you…

502
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,818
It seems like you've been

503
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,904
-hearing stuff from people.
-"Stuff"?

504
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,531
So there is "stuff" going on?

505
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,782
What stuff did we hear?

506
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,577
You see, it isn't true.

507
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,245
-It's not?
-No?

508
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,918
I have a crush on someone else.
It's Du-sik!

509
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,420
Du-sik?

510
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,006
-I like Du-sik.
-Du-sik?

511
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,884
-Du-sik?
-Du-sik?

512
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,387
So it's not Ms. Oh.

513
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,597
-Then…
-It's Du-sik.

514
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,307
Is he lying to us?

515
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,683
So he isn't straight.

516
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,310
Is Du-sik a man?

517
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,609
I'm so tired.

518
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:29,155
How can a dog
unleash herself like that every time?

519
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,366
She doesn't even chew it off.

520
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,326
She unleashes herself so smoothly.

521
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,206
All of my family is smart.

522
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,919
But you didn't give birth to her.

523
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,339
About Snowball…

524
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,636
I feel like someone might be
unleashing her on purpose.

525
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,971
What?

526
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,847
There you go again.

527
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,810
I mean, just think about it.

528
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:02,563
How can a dog unleash herself
so smoothly like that every time?

529
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,857
There's got to be someone unleashing her.

530
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,695
Do you know what's even odder?

531
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:12,699
The most logical reason
for this person to unleash the dog

532
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,827
would be to either keep her themselves
or sell her.

533
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:20,790
But all they do
is unleash the dog and leave.

534
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,876
Why do you think they're doing that?

535
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,756
Tell me. Why is that?

536
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,844
I know, right? Why did they do that?

537
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:37,515
What an idiot. Stop talking nonsense.

538
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,108
Didn't you know?

539
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,901
I heard they secretly ran away.

540
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,486
Why did they run away?

541
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,448
-Who knows?
-Look at them, all excited.

542
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:58,327
They must've been dying
to talk about Du-sik all this time.

543
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,874
I'm telling you, Baek-du, that kid,
is the trendsetter of the town.

544
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,419
The entire town is buzzing
with Du-sik's story now.

545
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,628
Don't be like that.

546
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,673
If it weren't for him,

547
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,551
we wouldn't be able to talk
about Du-sik either.

548
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,931
In fact, we didn't talk about it
because it felt weird,

549
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,059
but everyone has been curious about it.

550
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,187
About what exactly happened then.

551
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,649
But I still have my doubts.

552
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,111
If Du-sik's family really
hadn't done anything wrong,

553
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,114
why did they secretly run away?

554
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,326
Because they hated this town.

555
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:43,039
I know it's too late, but imagine
how frustrating it must've been.

556
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,208
They were officially acquitted

557
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,710
after the police investigation,

558
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,796
and yet people still went on a witch hunt.

559
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,091
Jeez, do you even hear yourself?

560
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,843
Excuse me, Suk-hui.

561
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,388
You were one of the witch hunters too.

562
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,182
-Exactly.
-Come on.

563
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,976
I never initiated anything.

564
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,939
All I did was nod
when people were gossiping.

565
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,774
Same difference.

566
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,484
Hey.

567
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,486
By the way,

568
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,322
did you hear about the other story too?

569
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,240
What story?

570
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,536
I remember hearing some rumor
after Du-sik's family left.

571
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,954
-What rumor?
-What is it?

572
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,750
That the person who killed Cheol-yong…

573
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,001
Yeah?

574
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,797
…was Cheol-yong's old childhood friend.

575
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:42,849
I don't know who said this,
but I heard it's bad to think too much.

576
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,851
Too many thoughts are bad.

577
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,646
Do you know what my favorite proverb is?

578
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,524
"Many hands make light work."

579
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:56,737
Seriously, this is the most wise saying
in the entire world.

580
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,656
It means we should help each other.

581
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,784
Isn't it amazing?

582
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,286
By the way,

583
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,664
why did you
keep marking your height on our wall?

584
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,042
What? How did you know?

585
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,005
When we were young,
we used to mark our heights

586
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,258
on the wall every month
to see how much we'd grown.

587
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,136
When I came back, I saw the wall,

588
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,763
and you've been marking
your heights alone.

589
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,266
-Well, that's--
-Why did you do that?

590
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,936
You could've done it on your wall.

591
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,983
So I could imagine.

592
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,652
Seeing how much I grew,

593
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,947
I imagined how much you must have grown.

594
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,701
You know what's funny?

595
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,079
When we're young,
girls grow faster than boys.

596
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,123
But I didn't think that through.

597
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,919
So I always marked your height
a little higher than mine.

598
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,338
Then, when I was about 17,

599
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,341
my imaginary Du-sik was

600
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,594
over two meters. Two meters.

601
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,721
Can you believe it?

602
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,808
Maybe that's why

603
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,312
whenever I saw you in my dreams,

604
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,440
I was looking up to you like this.

605
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,448
I…

606
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,953
want to find the culprit no matter what.

607
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,663
What?

608
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,875
Just like how you've been thinking

609
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,088
about the night I left,

610
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,800
I've been thinking

611
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,013
about why I had to be
kicked out of this town.

612
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,558
All my life,

613
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,729
I felt wronged and frustrated.

614
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:57,900
So…

615
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,612
I want to find the truth

616
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,242
and bring everything back.

617
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,007
Choi Chil-seong

618
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:26,012
is a match-fixing criminal
my team has been chasing for a long time.

619
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,015
He had an illegal gambling website too.

620
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,516
Who is Choi Chil-seong…

621
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,519
Oh, the 40,000-won man?

622
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,189
About two months ago,

623
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,609
he started to visit Geosan
every now and then.

624
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,486
Then he suddenly died.

625
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,905
And there were even signs of foul play.

626
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,492
So Seok-hui wasn't completely wrong.

627
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,875
But why are you telling me all this now…

628
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,502
Really?

629
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,757
Really? I can really join you?

630
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,968
Oh, my gosh. I'll do my best. I promise.

631
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,595
You know I'm good.

632
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,180
I know all the information.

633
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,057
-I…
-What are you doing there?

634
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,561
Well, as you can see, we're talking.

635
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,273
Go on. Let's talk about it tomorrow.

636
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,485
Bye.

637
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,905
Wait, I…

638
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,616
I have something to tell you.

639
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,369
What is it?

640
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,787
Well…

641
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,581
You know, earlier…

642
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,292
I don't think
you have anything to say, though.

643
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,129
Excuse me.

644
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,842
Isn't it about time
for you to go back to Seoul?

645
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,012
You don't need to stay here.
The house is small enough as it is.

646
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,349
I can't leave my wife here alone.
I'll miss her too much.

647
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,394
-Hey, did you hear that?
-Gosh, here we go again.

648
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,187
This is just strange--

649
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,688
Hey, just go home now.

650
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,566
-Go.
-Why do you always tell me to go?

651
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,028
Because you're the only one
who doesn't live here.

652
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,446
Makes sense? Bye now.

653
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,243
Hey, wait! Then…

654
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,162
A cup of coffee.

655
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,956
Let me have a cup of coffee. Okay?

656
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,582
-Wait.
-Hey.

657
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,098
Seriously, coffee?

658
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,518
Why should I make coffee for him?

659
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,130
Do you keep the door closed
when you sleep?

660
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,382
Even if I don't, he won't come in.

661
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,551
Are you crazy?

662
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,220
You keep it open? That's really dangerous.

663
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,806
Hang on.

664
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,518
You need to put a lock on the door.

665
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,020
I can do it tomorrow.

666
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,314
You can't. This is police property now.

667
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:34,492
Also, don't forget to bring your phone
when you use the bathroom.

668
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,745
So you can call the police immediately
if someone breaks in.

669
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,788
You need a phone so that--

670
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,958
Then, Officer Cho Seok-hui
will come running.

671
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,588
Finish your coffee and leave.

672
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:51,425
We need to talk about the case now,
and you're not supposed to see this.

673
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,552
Oh, yeah? I don't need to see it.

674
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,096
I already know roughly what it's about.

675
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,724
Also, we're on the same team now.

676
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,185
I can totally see these things.
Right, Du-sik?

677
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,688
What does he mean, the same team?

678
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,982
Gosh, who put this up so crooked?

679
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:07,900
Yu-gyeong?

680
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,739
What's the problem?

681
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,116
He's helped us a lot already.

682
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:20,329
He got
Beom-su and Lim Dong-seok's statements.

683
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,747
-Right.
-Also, Han-ra's video.

684
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,499
He got us all of that. Remember?

685
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,708
But still--

686
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,877
There's more.

687
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,587
As you have seen it already,

688
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,215
-he's got a sharp eye.
-Right.

689
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,802
No one recognized me,
but he knew I was Du-sik immediately.

690
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,221
I had zero doubts, you know.

691
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,432
I have that sharp eye!

692
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,601
I see. Well, then…

693
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,689
why don't we have a drink to welcome you?

694
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:50,150
Drink? No, not anymore.

695
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,236
What about it? It's our team tradition.

696
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,532
Remember who got me completely wasted
when I first joined this team?

697
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:00,369
Sorry. I apologize.

698
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,621
-But he really can't drink--
-Let's do it.

699
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:04,873
You want to drink?

700
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,334
Sure. It sounds refreshing.

701
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,086
I was thirsty anyway.

702
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,007
Jeez, what's wrong with these guys?

703
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,520
Mr. Kim Baek-du.

704
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,314
Don't overdo it.

705
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:33,110
I heard that even one glass of booze
can make you black out.

706
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,821
That's nonsense. I…

707
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,074
This…

708
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,166
Jeez.

709
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:51,128
Yu-gyeong, I know
he's joining us just temporarily,

710
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:54,256
but are you sure
you want to work with someone

711
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,009
who can't even remember things?

712
00:43:57,092 --> 00:44:01,513
It'll be a dishonor
to our proud Investigation Team 3.

713
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:07,102
I don't think you have
a very honorable drinking habit yourself.

714
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:12,191
Jeez, you guys are too weak.

715
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,984
I can't drink with you guys.

716
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,362
You get wasted from this one bottle?

717
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,073
Just give that to me.

718
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,075
-Hey, what are you…
-I'm okay.

719
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,368
I'll drink for him.

720
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:23,786
What?

721
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,621
I'll drink for him from now on.

722
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,206
Now, you're drinking with me.

723
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:30,668
My gosh. Du-sik, you're…

724
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,129
You're the best.

725
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,508
You're so cool.

726
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,968
Hey, I almost won.

727
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,137
Why are you butting in now?

728
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,810
You promised, though.

729
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,147
If you lose, he'll join our team.

730
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,866
Great.

731
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,663
You just can't let me
have it my way, can you?

732
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,041
Yu-gyeong.

733
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,210
Tell me.

734
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,255
What's the real reason?

735
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,465
What do you mean?

736
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,805
The reason why you're letting
Kim Baek-du join this investigation.

737
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,100
I know you.

738
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,646
There must be another reason.

739
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,565
No, there isn't.

740
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,567
Yes, there is.

741
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,402
Are you crazy?

742
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,406
Sorry.

743
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,159
Yu-gyeong.

744
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,875
You have feelings for Kim Baek…

745
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,087
Hey.

746
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,591
You fell asleep?

747
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:21,778
Who am I to decide
to let him join us, really?

748
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,450
I wasn't the only one who felt wronged.

749
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,706
I had no idea

750
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:37,711
he'd been regretting that day
for such a long time.

751
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,844
He has every right.

752
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,434
It's only right
for him to do this with me.

753
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,736
I…

754
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,460
Jeez, did you guys sleep
like that the whole night?

755
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,297
You're so close.

756
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,132
I'm jealous.

757
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,342
What…

758
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,678
Jeez, what's this man doing here?

759
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,598
Oh, boy.

760
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,519
How could you lie on my belly?

761
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,652
You know you can't handle alcohol well.

762
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,113
Why did you drink so much?

763
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,073
Jeez.

764
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,284
You must be a lightweight.

765
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,245
I'm totally fine.

766
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,164
This is ridiculous.

767
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,375
Last night, it was you two against me.

768
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,337
And you didn't mix
my makgeolli with soda--

769
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,755
Enough.

770
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,382
We really don't have much time left now.

771
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:51,178
You, check with the team
on any updates in Seoul.

772
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,929
And you.

773
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,515
There's a payphone
at the end of the market.

774
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,644
I want you to see
if there's anyone using it.

775
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,562
-Okay.
-Wait.

776
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,439
I didn't agree to work with him.

777
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,274
You did.

778
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,277
I did? No way.

779
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,071
This is exactly why I said

780
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,866
I'd take all the money in your safe
if you changed your mind.

781
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,117
Then you said, "Okay."

782
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,869
The passcode is 0528.

783
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,415
You should come over

784
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,833
to my place sometime.

785
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,502
I'll give you some red ginseng.

786
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:27,881
You see, you need to take a lot of it
to see the effects.

787
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:30,509
But it'll surely help you
get back your memories.

788
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,386
-I assure you.
-Come on.

789
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,346
He knows everything now.

790
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:37,265
We should be grateful
to have a helping hand.

791
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:38,975
Okay?

792
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,772
-Eat up.
-You should eat.

793
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,233
You're so hung over,
you can't even eat ramyeon.

794
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,576
Ma'am, please consider
setting up a CCTV here, okay?

795
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,538
I'm serious. Let's find out
if it's a human or a ghost

796
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,415
that has been unleashing her.

797
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,168
Come on. That won't be necessary.

798
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,087
As long as she comes back safely.

799
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,589
Don't fuss about it.

800
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,634
Then don't report her missing.

801
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:16,555
Whenever she's missing, you call me
immediately and nag me to find her.

802
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,350
What a good girl. Eat up.

803
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,309
Eat slowly.

804
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,147
You must be tired from all the running.

805
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,732
Good girl.

806
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:31,027
How did you find her today?

807
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,612
Where was she?

808
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,656
In front of the reservoir.

809
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,615
Again?

810
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,618
She keeps going there.

811
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,663
Right.

812
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:47,335
Didn't you say you were looking
for the witness of the reservoir incident?

813
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,129
Yes. What about it?

814
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,007
I heard this just yesterday.

815
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,259
You know the duvet store, right?

816
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,053
-Yes.
-The owner of the store said

817
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:01,224
he heard a dog barking near the reservoir
that night on his way back

818
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,143
from his friend's funeral.

819
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:07,814
-Barking? Could it have been Snowball?
-Apparently, it was.

820
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,860
He said he got curious and looked around.

821
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,613
Then Snowball appeared.

822
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:19,951
That makes Snowball a witness, right?

823
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,495
Is that so?

824
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,345
Jeez, I reek of alcohol.

825
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:42,432
-Hey, what took you so long?
-I was getting ready.

826
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,060
Why is Baek-du coming out of that house?

827
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,228
-It's my house.
-Hey.

828
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,063
Do you always take a shower

829
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,648
for one…

830
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,150
-No, two hours?
-Forty minutes.

831
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,486
I couldn't use the bathroom
for 40 minutes.

832
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,780
Why do you have to use
the bathroom so often?

833
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,490
Because I drank a lot of water.

834
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,033
You drank alcohol, not water.

835
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,538
Hey, your hair's all disheveled.

836
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,248
It's because I couldn't wash it.

837
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,875
Liar. All you do is lie.

838
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,502
Make it look cool.

839
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,712
You're asking for the impossible.

840
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,965
Why are they coming out of the same house?

841
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,009
And why are they all lovey-dovey?

842
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,361
What now?

843
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,196
See? I told you.

844
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,366
What are you talking about?

845
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:44,327
Baek-du and your manager
definitely have something going on.

846
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:46,705
There you go again.

847
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,124
Guess what I just saw?

848
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,169
I saw the two
coming out of the same house.

849
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,506
Coming out of the same house
in the morning.

850
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,091
What do you think that means?

851
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:02,470
Also, Baek-du's hair was all disheveled.

852
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,763
Now say I'm wrong again.

853
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,351
What do you say?

854
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:11,062
Don't you think we should step up?

855
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,107
Our friend is going off track.

856
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:17,819
We should do whatever it takes
to stop this madness, shouldn't we?

857
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,698
Are you listening to me?

858
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,367
Hey, Kwak Jin-su.

859
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,203
Hey.

860
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,880
What was that?

861
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,715
He hung up on me?

862
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,425
Are you kidding me?

863
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,138
Gosh, what do I do about Baek-du?

864
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:48,683
I mean, why did Baek-du
suddenly bring Du-sik up?

865
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:52,520
I know, right?
Everything we said was true.

866
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,147
Tell me about it.

867
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,691
But the police didn't find
anything suspicious.

868
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,817
-Right.
-Here.

869
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:58,777
Thanks.

870
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,197
No, they didn't.

871
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,908
Then why did they run away?
Isn't it strange?

872
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:08,912
Do you still think
Jun did that to Cheol-yong?

873
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:16,002
Jeez. They've been talking
about it for days now,

874
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,338
and apparently, they're not done yet.

875
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,924
I'm sick of hearing this.

876
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,677
Leave them alone. They'll stop eventually.

877
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:28,056
I mean, they're all saying
different things too.

878
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,058
I'm fascinated, you know.

879
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,893
Is that so? What are they saying?

880
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:36,231
If you really listen to it,
it's all nonsense.

881
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:40,026
Some say that Cheol-yong

882
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:44,072
was being threatened and asked
to join some gangsters,

883
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:47,826
and some others say that they actually saw

884
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,745
people in dark clothes
frequenting Cheol-yong's place.

885
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,081
Talk about creativity, right?

886
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,709
Jeez. That's just…

887
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,837
And guess what they say to me.

888
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,796
They…

889
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:05,343
They ask me if I was the last one
to see him alive.

890
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,636
God damn it.

891
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,224
I never saw Cheol-yong that day.

892
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,688
Wait a second. I thought it was you.

893
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:20,191
That's what I've been thinking until now.

894
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,862
Was it me? It's been so long,

895
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,530
I don't remember it.

896
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:26,906
I see.

897
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:31,911
You're right.
Even yesterday feels like a past life.

898
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,496
So how can you remember it?

899
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:41,755
Man, everyone especially loves
the bean sprouts today for some reason.

900
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,299
I should go make some more…

901
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,510
I wonder what I was in my past life.

902
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:48,970
A cow?

903
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,890
Wait here, okay?

904
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,142
I'll go make some more.

905
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,145
Let me know if you need anything.

906
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:07,072
The person
who killed Joo Cheol-yong is here.

907
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,992
Someone contacted
Yeon Sang-cheol and Choi Chil-seong

908
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:15,288
from the payphone in town.

909
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:20,210
And Choi Chil-seong died
after getting the call that day.

910
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,130
If this person knew Choi's number,

911
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:29,010
that means they most likely
knew each other.

912
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,346
That means the culprit

913
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:37,393
is one of the people in this town
who knew Choi Chil-seong.

914
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,654
1 UNREAD MESSAGE

915
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,077
LOCATION OF THE REQUESTED DEVICE

916
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,164
LOCATION OF THE REQUESTED DEVICE:
1106-6, JUNGANG-RO, GEOSAN

917
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,251
Jungang-ro in Geosan?

918
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,545
Jungang-ro in Geosan?

919
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,271
What did I do?

920
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,155
Mix that with what you learned.
It'll balance out.

921
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:59,601
Well, I think I need to use the bathroom.

922
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:05,273
Wow, so it was true.

923
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,119
What's going on?

924
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,499
Now they're having tea together.

925
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,794
Come on. It's normal
to have a cup of tea with a colleague.

926
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,964
Look. Have you ever had a cup of tea
with a female colleague?

927
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,928
Gosh, I'm so disappointed in him.
What do I do?

928
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,347
Hang out with other friends.

929
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,974
There comes one.

930
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:44,687
Jin-su!

931
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:46,689
Hey.

932
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,860
Why is he not answering me today?

933
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,154
You head back first.

934
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,073
I need to talk to him.

935
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,032
Okay.

936
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,284
Hey! Kwak Jin-su!

937
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,578
Hey!

938
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,333
Can't you hear me?

939
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,255
-What is it?
-Is something wrong?

940
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,298
You hung up on me without saying anything.

941
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,135
What's going on?

942
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,389
-Seok-hui.
-What?

943
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,266
I think…

944
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,936
the manager really is Du-sik.

945
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,814
No, not this one. This is…

946
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,697
All right.
Now we're all here, let's start--

947
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,657
Wait. Did you lock the door?

948
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,535
Don't be dramatic. We don't have customers

949
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,787
-even when we're open.
-But we have to be sure.

950
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,747
Mi-ran, I want to ask you something.

951
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,541
Do you use old coffee beans?

952
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,668
Did you know the coffee smells stale?

953
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,877
Just drink it.

954
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,629
Is that the lock? I'll lock it.

955
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:52,589
-No.
-I'm sure.

956
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,881
You should smell it.

957
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,801
Let's have a vote to decide.

958
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,595
-Is there a key?
-I said it's okay.

959
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,054
-This…
-Jeez.

960
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,807
I'm already tired.

961
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,559
Because it smells…

962
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,769
-My head hurts.
-Try it.

963
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,354
You're crazy.

964
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,190
What's wrong with you guys?
Is it heatstroke?

965
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,068
I know we haven't seen her for a while,

966
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,321
but how could you forget
your friend's face…

967
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,114
Right.

968
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,033
Take a look.

969
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:24,912
I checked this photo
after hearing Baek-du's nonsense.

970
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,540
I've been meaning to show you this.

971
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,959
What do you think?

972
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,339
Aren't you ashamed to have thought
they might be the same person?

973
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,216
She looks just like her.

974
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:40,762
Where?

975
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,139
Which part looks alike?

976
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:48,394
Now that I know she's Du-sik,
I can see she's just like Du-sik.

977
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,188
Gosh, I can't believe this.

978
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,567
Why don't we go check then?

979
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,570
Your manager is in there now.

980
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,364
Let's go ask her.

981
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:02,784
Let's ask her if she's Oh Du-sik or not.

982
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,287
I think…

983
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:10,958
someone in this town
has Choi Chil-seong's phone.

984
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,669
What? How do you know that?

985
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:17,298
Just now,
Choi's phone was turned on for a while.

986
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:19,759
I heard…

987
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,304
Hey, what do we do now?

988
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:26,557
Hey! What are you doing here?
The café's closed.

989
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,893
And what are you doing in a closed café?

990
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,770
With these people?

991
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,647
I told you we should lock the door.

992
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,483
That's none of your business.
The café's closed. Go.

993
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:37,485
-Go now.
-Step aside.

994
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:38,778
-Today,
-Hey.

995
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,988
I need to talk with your manager.

996
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:43,866
Me?

997
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,411
Yes, Ms. Oh Yu-gyeong.

998
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,579
Hey, you can ask her in private later.

999
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:52,208
No, I've got to do this,
or I won't be able to sleep tonight.

1000
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,378
What's this about? Come on out with it.

1001
01:01:56,629 --> 01:02:00,091
Are you Du-sik?

1002
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,637
-What…
-Answer me.

1003
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,932
Are you the Oh Du-sik
who used to live here?

1004
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,855
You're not, right? Of course not.

1005
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,399
The question sounds dumb even to me.

1006
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:20,737
Well, you don't know Du-sik,
so you must not know what this all means.

1007
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:25,283
I don't want to talk about someone
behind their back,

1008
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:29,537
but since I brought it up,
I'll talk about her a little.

1009
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:33,082
Seok-hui, you might not necessarily
be talking behind someone's back.

1010
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,709
So watch what you say.

1011
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:37,336
A long time ago,
someone named Du-sik lived here.

1012
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,464
I don't know if you know,

1013
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:43,384
but she was the daughter of this legendary
ssireum wrestler named Oh Jun.

1014
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:47,263
She was supposed to be a girl,
but she wasn't.

1015
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:48,848
Why not?

1016
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,808
Because she was ugly.

1017
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,478
I know not all girls have to be pretty.

1018
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:56,439
I'm not that old-school, you know.

1019
01:02:56,522 --> 01:03:00,526
But Du-sik was completely out of line.
She was an extreme case.

1020
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,196
On the day you moved here,

1021
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:07,158
Baek-du said you might be Du-sik,

1022
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,870
saying you looked just like her.

1023
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:12,997
That's an insult, man.

1024
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,291
But that's Baek-du.

1025
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:19,086
He talks nonsense all the time,
so I understand.

1026
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,632
Then today,
even Jin-su is saying the same thing.

1027
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,759
Ms. Oh.

1028
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,137
You should sue them for defamation.

1029
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:32,433
Once the judge sees Du-sik's photo,
they'll each get ten years in jail.

1030
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:33,851
-Seok-hui.
-Yes?

1031
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:35,520
What?

1032
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:38,105
You really haven't changed one bit.

1033
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:39,774
Excuse me?

1034
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:42,693
You always ran your mouth cluelessly

1035
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,446
until I beat some sense into you.

1036
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,366
I thought about it from time to time.

1037
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,202
Do you know me?

1038
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:56,123
Jeez, she does sound like Du-sik now.

1039
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,793
That was really close. You got me.

1040
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,800
Come on, you're not Du-sik.

1041
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,389
You're Du-sik?

1042
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,146
-Please don't.
-Wait.

1043
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,231
-You!
-Du-sik, don't.

1044
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:21,566
-What on earth?
-Don't.

1045
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:22,817
I'm sorry.

1046
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,235
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, Du-sik.

1047
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:25,987
-Say you're sorry.
-Hey, Cho Seok-hui!

1048
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:32,201
And after 20 years,

1049
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:35,371
we're still together.

1050
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:36,497
Say you're sorry.

1051
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,124
I'm so sorry.

1052
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,084
-Please accept my apology.
-Come here!

1053
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:43,045
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

1054
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:09,030
-What?
-I think

1055
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:10,990
I saw someone in my yard last night.

1056
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,617
It just feels strange.

1057
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:16,495
The person who did such a horrible thing
is someone I know.

1058
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,749
Maybe we can find who it is
by comparing everyone in this town

1059
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,167
with the video.

1060
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,628
I'm Joo Cheol-yong's daughter.

1061
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:26,088
He died here 20 years ago.

1062
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:30,301
Then why has she never said
who she was until now?

1063
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:33,346
Why am I here?

1064
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,849
