00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:46,004
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

2
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:50,675
KIM BAEK-DU, OH DU-SIK IS A GOOFBALL

3
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,926
I can't believe this.

4
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,970
What kind of homework is this?

5
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:59,350
My grandma said you never know
where life will take you.

6
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,229
So how can I possibly know
what I'll be like in 20 years?

7
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,024
Just write whatever you want.

8
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,652
It's not like the teacher's going to check
20 years later.

9
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,447
What? Is that so?

10
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,494
Right!

11
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,583
I'll live long without standing out.

12
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,293
Done.

13
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:32,884
"I'll become a great ssireum wrestler
that will go down in history."

14
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,429
Goodness. That's so lame.

15
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,476
Don't look. I'll kill you.

16
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,520
Relax, I won't look.

17
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,480
It's just obvious.

18
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,690
What was it again? 24-Hour Scene?

19
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,652
I'm sure you wrote
you'd become a police officer.

20
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:55,240
I'll have become a cool police officer
like Mi-suk on 24-Hour Scene.

21
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,866
I'm right, aren't I?

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,535
You wrote that, right?

23
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,248
Look, Du-sik,

24
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,792
it'll be a relief
if you don't become a criminal.

25
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,629
A person like you
becoming a police officer? Dream on.

26
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,512
Darn it!

27
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,014
It's obvious what you wrote too.

28
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,102
I'm sure you wrote that you'll become
a ssireum champion like your dad or…

29
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:25,895
What?

30
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,189
Hey, what is this?

31
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,399
Give it back!

32
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,776
Why did you write such…

33
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,904
Seriously? Is that really your dream?

34
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,615
Yeah, that's my dream.

35
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,957
In 20 years, I want to…

36
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:57,510
EPISODE 12
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

37
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,644
Mi-ran.

38
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,067
What is the evidence you have?

39
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,945
What?

40
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,406
You said you had some evidence.

41
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,868
Choi Chil-seong's phone?

42
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,667
So that's what you have.

43
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,049
Damn it. It was nowhere to be seen
when I tried so hard to find it.

44
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,884
Mi-ran, you…

45
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,054
Where did you get it?

46
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,972
Tell me.

47
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,312
Are you sure you have it?

48
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:55,526
Did you… kill my dad?

49
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,327
Well, I…

50
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,871
I didn't mean to kill him.

51
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,957
It was a mistake.

52
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,089
So how could he go back on his word?
It made me mad.

53
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,098
I don't think I can do it.

54
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,683
Sorry, Chil-seong.

55
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,442
You suddenly go back on your word?

56
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,861
Are you insane?

57
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,656
Do you know how much money is at stake?

58
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,538
Cheol-yong, this is not that dangerous.

59
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,501
You and I grew up together.

60
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,754
I wouldn't have gotten you involved
if it were dangerous.

61
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,381
Chil-seong.

62
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,218
It isn't because it's dangerous.

63
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,889
I just shouldn't have gotten involved
in the first place.

64
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,099
That little…

65
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,476
Yes, it might make me big money.

66
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,438
But my Mi-ran…

67
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:20,069
I don't think I'll be able
to look Mi-ran in the eye if I do this.

68
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,697
So please understand, Chil-seong.

69
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,097
You…

70
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,310
You killed him just for that?

71
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,396
Well… No, that's not it. It was…

72
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,523
I told you, it was a mistake.

73
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,028
Oh, no.

74
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,573
I guess you could've thought
that it was intentional.

75
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,617
Sorry.

76
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,827
Oh, no.

77
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,623
Why?

78
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,087
Why was he there at the time?

79
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,589
What? What did the rice cake guy do?

80
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,965
Back then,

81
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,427
he was the guy
who took this picture for us.

82
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,639
I'll take it now.

83
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,267
One, two… You should smile.

84
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,061
Three.

85
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,980
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

86
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,315
Sure.

87
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,777
Here. By the way,
who uses a film camera these days?

88
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,195
There are digital cameras.

89
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,906
What are you doing, punk? Let's go.

90
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,952
He already knew Choi Chil-seong.

91
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,130
It all makes sense!

92
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,006
Mi-ran is at the café?

93
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,633
-Yes.
-Let's go.

94
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,218
What? Wait.

95
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,432
Yu-gyeong, she's not answering.
What do we do?

96
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,685
-Hey.
-You follow us.

97
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,687
-What?
-Follow us!

98
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,689
Okay.

99
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,984
The number you have dialed
is not responding.

100
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,331
Then what about Choi Chil-seong?

101
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,585
Did you kill him too?

102
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,466
Do you want to know?

103
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,092
Do you?

104
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,720
Well…

105
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,774
About that…

106
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,989
Chil-seong.

107
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,577
I already have a coach
named Yeon Sang-cheol on board.

108
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,205
I knew right away he was one of our kind.

109
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,915
You know,

110
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,793
I have a good eye for people like that.

111
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,836
I looked into it,

112
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,673
and it seems he gambles. He has
debts of hundreds of millions of won.

113
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,259
So what did I do?

114
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,595
Commission.

115
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,351
I told him I'd give him a handsome
commission, and he took the bait.

116
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,477
So, Chil-seong,

117
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,233
why don't you get some rich guys on board
and raise the stakes?

118
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,361
I mean,

119
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,030
I lost my connections,
so I only got small fry--

120
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,782
After what you did to Cheol-yong,

121
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,077
I thought you quit all this.

122
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,707
What? Me?

123
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,627
I did quit.

124
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,799
Chil-seong, you'd be so surprised
if you knew how honestly I'm living here.

125
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,093
What is it?

126
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,719
Don't tell me

127
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,307
you're still upset over
what I did to your old friend.

128
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,602
But that was really a mistake.

129
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,021
And I've regretted it a lot.

130
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,691
So let's leave
what happened back then behind…

131
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,569
God damn it! This is so annoying!

132
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,028
So annoying!

133
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:35,366
Why the hell do you keep
bringing up the past?

134
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,745
It was a mistake! A mistake!

135
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,583
I already told you it was a mistake.

136
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,004
Whatever.

137
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,924
I've washed my hands of it,
so you're on your own.

138
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,467
Oh, you were recording.

139
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,636
No wonder.

140
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,602
He was recording.

141
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,521
I mean, it was all in the past.

142
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,206
Die already.

143
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,760
Damn it.

144
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,104
Hey.

145
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:35,611
So why did you have to provoke me?

146
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,822
Why?

147
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,492
You made me make a mistake again.

148
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,745
Damn it.

149
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,887
Where is it?

150
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,310
Damn it.

151
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,294
That was so…

152
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,963
Isn't it really crazy?

153
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:41,635
I mean, what the hell
was that dog doing there?

154
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,017
You know,

155
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:53,439
it was really tough chasing
after that damn dog to find the phone.

156
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,901
Right. By the way, that kid…

157
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,527
What was his name? Seok-hui.

158
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,698
God, he's such a master at catching dogs.

159
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,327
Every time I let the dog loose,

160
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,289
he shows up out of nowhere,
catches her, and takes her home. God…

161
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,376
I'm so sick of it.

162
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:22,927
Right. Anyway, you have the phone?

163
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,891
Give it to me.

164
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,311
Give it.

165
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,564
Mi-ran?

166
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,695
The phone! Give it to me.

167
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,489
I don't have it.

168
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,203
-Why not?
-The police have it.

169
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,915
It should be all restored by now.

170
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,752
If so, you're done for.

171
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:02,091
If the recording file is restored,
the whole world will know what you did.

172
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,302
Is that so?

173
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,310
Gosh.

174
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,896
Like father, like daughter.

175
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,149
You'll end up just like your dad.

176
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,777
Listen, Mi-ran.

177
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:27,741
If you keep being like this, I have
no choice but to make a mistake again.

178
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,914
I mean, you guys keep forcing me

179
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,377
to be a bad guy who murders on purpose.

180
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,338
You little…

181
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,485
The rice cake guy? Really?

182
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,029
What? The lights are off.

183
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,364
She would've called us
if she was closing up.

184
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,449
Baek-du!

185
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,868
Hey, why did you leave Mi-ran alone?

186
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:11,952
-Du-sik.
-Yeah?

187
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,287
I can't reach Mi-ran.

188
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,832
Hurry up!

189
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,088
What's going on?

190
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,548
Mi-ran.

191
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,008
-Mi-ran.
-There she is.

192
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,470
Are you okay?

193
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,063
It was him.

194
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,191
The owner of the rice cake shop.

195
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,753
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,507
What's going on? What happened?

197
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,509
-What happened?
-Are you okay?

198
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,948
Did you find him?

199
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,450
-No.
-No.

200
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,618
Damn it.

201
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,870
Where did he run to so fast?

202
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,416
Let's split up and look for him.

203
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,792
-Okay.
-Okay.

204
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,673
It's me.

205
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,175
I need to put out an APB.

206
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,136
Name, Lee Gyeong-mun.

207
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,221
Forty-six years old.

208
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,142
Okay.

209
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,864
He said it was all his doing.

210
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,202
He said he killed my dad
and Choi Chil-seong.

211
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,914
And that there was
a recording file on the phone.

212
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:29,006
The real culprit in ssireum wrestler
Joo's murder case in Geosan

213
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,467
has finally been revealed after 20 years.

214
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,136
The Seoul Violent Crimes Unit

215
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,513
has identified
a man in his forties named Lee

216
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,768
as the culprit in the murder of Joo,
from the Geosan-gun Ssireum Team,

217
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,730
who was found dead
in a mountain in Geosan in June of 2002.

218
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,817
It's been revealed
that Lee also murdered Victim C,

219
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,613
who worked with him
in the same crime ring in the past,

220
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,115
and disposed of his body at a reservoir.

221
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,452
Lee is still at large,

222
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,163
and the police have put out
a nationwide APB on him.

223
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,875
It may take a while,
but I'll keep my promise.

224
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,169
I'll catch him no matter what.

225
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,967
Next news.

226
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,429
The police recently obtained
a ledger of a match-fixing broker

227
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,307
who ran one of
the biggest illegal gambling websites.

228
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,936
And it has revealed names of
over 100 political and financial figures,

229
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,438
which is expected
to cause great repercussions.

230
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,524
…was the key to solving the case.

231
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,362
I've only seen
something like this in movies.

232
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,699
Hey, it's a first for the rest of us too.

233
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,828
I didn't know they did
undercover investigations in real life.

234
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:41,745
Me neither.

235
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,914
But why come as a ssireum team's manager?

236
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,291
The culprit is one of the villagers.

237
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,545
Why didn't she run a chicken store
in the market instead?

238
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,549
That's because of the match-fixing
involved with Coach Yeon…

239
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,138
Hey, do you guys know who her father is?

240
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,682
-Who?
-Who is it?

241
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,142
Oh Jun.

242
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,309
-What?
-Oh Jun?

243
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,644
-You don't know?
-Oh Jun?

244
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,230
Kim Tae-baek's rival, Oh Jun.

245
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,731
The Oh Jun we know?

246
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,899
Yeah!

247
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,317
-No way!
-Really?

248
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,194
No wonder.

249
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,405
Remember when she threw me?

250
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,990
-You cried all day.
-You flew.

251
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,116
No, I didn't.

252
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:23,871
Anyway, her grip was strangely strong,
you know?

253
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,249
You don't get that strong
if you haven't worked out consistently.

254
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,459
-He's making an excuse.
-No wonder.

255
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,129
-It feels emptier than I thought.
-Why?

256
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,133
Why?

257
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,761
Because she was here with us
almost every day.

258
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,306
Is it just me? Don't you guys feel sad?

259
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,475
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

260
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,313
She was here every day at the beginning.

261
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,899
We would've thrown her a farewell party.

262
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,600
Not long after Du-sik went back to Seoul,

263
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,436
it suddenly occurred to me

264
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:35,025
that maybe the short period of time
she was here

265
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,528
was just a dream.

266
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:55,212
2023.8.2. OH DU-SIK

267
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,466
Maybe she knew I felt that way.

268
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,219
Du-sik said…

269
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,348
it wasn't a dream,

270
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,269
but that our time together
felt like a dream.

271
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:16,191
DU-SIK

272
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,736
What's with her?

273
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,157
Does she leave her phone at home?
Why won't she reply me?

274
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,077
The soup looks especially delicious today.

275
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,413
-It smells amazing.
-You like the soup?

276
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,914
I love it.

277
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,457
The meeting is today?

278
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,669
-Give me a lot of broth.
-Hey, how about you do nothing?

279
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,254
I should help.

280
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,256
But you keep switching the bowls…

281
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,841
The meeting is today?

282
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,467
That's no good.

283
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,431
Hey, you're here.

284
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,516
-What are you doing…
-I'll do it.

285
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,851
-Don't.
-You're a guest.

286
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,853
Then why don't you go talk with Dad?

287
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,604
-Should I?
-Yes, go inside.

288
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,023
-What…
-It should be this way.

289
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,904
By the way, why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

290
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,115
You came unannounced, so I was surprised.

291
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,825
I didn't come unannounced.

292
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,993
You didn't tell me.

293
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,578
During the day,

294
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,497
I called your mom
and said I'd come over to eat.

295
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,500
Why did you tell my mom?
You should've told me.

296
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,711
And why did you ignore my texts?

297
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,254
Texts?

298
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,257
Oh, right. Earlier, I was…

299
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,262
Anyway, you enjoyed the meal earlier.

300
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,680
Why whine now?

301
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,557
It's not that.

302
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,226
You kept ignoring my texts,

303
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:38,690
so I was worried that you might
never come back from Seoul.

304
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,319
Hey, what are you going to do?

305
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,403
What do you mean?

306
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:49,451
Once I go back to Seoul,
you won't be able to reach me often.

307
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,371
Are you going to pout
like a kid every time?

308
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,416
Of course not. I won't.

309
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,715
Listen. Speaking of which…

310
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,550
Hey, about my wish…

311
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,636
What?

312
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,640
You promised
to grant me one wish last time.

313
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,477
Can I say my wish now?

314
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,022
What's your wish?

315
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,817
About…

316
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,655
About you going back to Seoul…

317
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,535
Gosh. You use that as your wish
now of all times?

318
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,661
-Seriously, I--
-Go.

319
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,622
What?

320
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,251
Forget about this place.

321
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,838
Go to Seoul
and finish what you were doing.

322
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,175
Hey, Baek-du.

323
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,596
Of course, I'd honestly like it
much better if you stayed here.

324
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,642
But I know
what you've wanted to do all your life.

325
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,727
So,

326
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,188
go to Seoul

327
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,900
and become like Mi-suk
just like you always talked about.

328
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,705
Gosh.

329
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,752
You're so cool about it.

330
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,883
I was going to reconsider
if you tried to stop me.

331
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,557
I thought of doing so,

332
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,185
but that…

333
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,937
just wouldn't be right.

334
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,195
But you have to come see my match.

335
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,532
I'll win the championship that day
no matter what.

336
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:58,413
So come and give me your answer that day.

337
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,834
What answer?

338
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,422
I confessed my feelings for you.

339
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,008
Your answer to that.

340
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:58,390
At first, your mom
opposed to you doing ssireum.

341
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,474
I know.

342
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,435
She still says it often.

343
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,563
But I argued with her

344
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,401
for the first time and won.

345
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,112
In my eyes,

346
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,615
you looked more talented
than your brothers.

347
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,662
Don't feel rushed.

348
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,164
Some flowers bloom later.

349
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,168
What was it?

350
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:31,339
In The Three Little Pigs

351
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,925
and Princess Bari,

352
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,137
it's the third child
that throws the big punch.

353
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,312
Then, Dad,

354
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:51,192
maybe there's one more child
between me and Han-ra.

355
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,117
All right, then.

356
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,245
I should throw a big punch too.

357
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,416
I have to do it this time.

358
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,430
Let's meet at the gym right now.

359
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,098
At this hour?

360
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,697
He told me to come. Why isn't he here?

361
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,077
Jeez.

362
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,460
Jin-su.

363
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,922
What, are you filming a movie
or something?

364
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,715
What are you doing in the dark?

365
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,760
What?

366
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,930
Why did you call me here?

367
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,266
Why did you call me?

368
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,810
Are you confident about the match?

369
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,397
Did you call me here to ask me that?

370
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,648
Are you confident?

371
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,984
I'm confident. Why do you ask?

372
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,822
I am confident. So what?

373
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,366
Then how about we have a match?

374
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:22,992
What?

375
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,794
The third round we left off last time.
Let's do it now.

376
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,465
What? You don't think you can win?

377
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,218
What? How could you and I…

378
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,513
It's not a matter of confidence. It's…

379
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,149
All right. Let's do it.

380
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,946
I say, let's do it. All right?

381
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:04,993
Ready.

382
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:07,787
Go!

383
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,748
What did I say?

384
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,167
I said I was confident!

385
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,005
It's 2-1. I beat you, okay?

386
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,675
No takebacks.

387
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,469
God, you bastard.

388
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,180
You never let me win.

389
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,934
Jeez.

390
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,796
How do you feel?

391
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,422
What's going on?

392
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,465
It's Lim Dong-seok.

393
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,425
Gosh.

394
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,554
What is he, the Pied Piper?

395
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,141
By the way, I hear
that bastard's in great shape.

396
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,602
When was he not?

397
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,980
Not like before.

398
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,899
I hear he's training
with guys in Halla class.

399
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,569
-In Halla class?
-I heard something different.

400
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,196
He's competing
in Geumgang class next year.

401
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,447
-Geumgang?
-Seriously?

402
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,615
Goodness.

403
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,618
Then he's saying
he's already dominated Taebaek class?

404
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,079
He is. Am I wrong?

405
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:19,168
Goodness. Lim Dong-seok
is such an arrogant bastard.

406
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,380
He hasn't dominated it yet.
He's got a long way to go.

407
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,802
To be blunt, he didn't
really beat Baek-du. Am I right?

408
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,013
You're right.

409
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,765
That's true.
And Baek-du sometimes trains with me too.

410
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,058
-Right.
-Come on, Beom-su.

411
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,477
That was more like playing.
It wasn't training.

412
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,357
Anyway, I think it's partially
thanks to his supporters. Am I right?

413
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:46,863
Look. His fangirls scream his name
so passionately in the stand.

414
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,365
It helps him power through.

415
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,159
-You're right.
-I'm not jealous.

416
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,536
Baek-du's fans are just as good.

417
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,121
They're just a different kind.

418
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,707
All the great champions over there…

419
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,793
-They didn't come.
-Where?

420
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,005
-Do we do this for the fans?
-Right.

421
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,256
We just do it.

422
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,424
Let's just go.

423
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,012
Darn it. It must've broken down.

424
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,972
Will it take long?

425
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,308
I'm sorry. I'll take care of it soon.

426
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,527
-Why aren't they going?
-This is frustrating.

427
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,447
-Look at the time.
-Why is there so much traffic?

428
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,325
A dump truck broke down,
so it'll take some time.

429
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,036
-Broke down? Goodness.
-I knew something was wrong.

430
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,746
Let's go and push it out of the way.

431
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,749
Stop talking nonsense. We can't do that.

432
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,834
It's downhill, so it's dangerous.

433
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,127
-But still…
-I said no.

434
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,130
HALF-DAY OFF
THE DAY KIM BAEK-DU WINS CHAMPIONSHIP!

435
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,721
Darn it.

436
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,475
Oh, right.

437
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,524
-Captain.
-What?

438
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,779
Today, I have an important occasion--

439
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:10,989
Captain.

440
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,282
I think we should go to the scene.

441
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,542
Kim Baek-du in the blue satba!

442
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,503
He counters Joo Jin-ho's inner leg skill

443
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,590
with an inner leg skill
and breezily advances to the round of 16!

444
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,431
It's 1-0,

445
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,933
and the second round
of the round of 16 begins.

446
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:39,976
I'm so nervous.

447
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,234
-Stop fidgeting.
-All right.

448
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,653
Kim Baek-du, Lifting Throw!

449
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,825
Oh, Jung Seung-mo holds out

450
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,827
-and uses Left Knee Hook.
-What?

451
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,996
Did he lose? Did he win?

452
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,416
Oh, Kim Baek-du!

453
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,584
-What?
-What happened?

454
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,672
Just say it already. Come on.

455
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,633
He was amazing!

456
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,554
He used his rotational force to dodge
the attack and used Push and Throw.

457
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,306
He advances to the quarterfinals.

458
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,809
Oh, my God! Baek-du!

459
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,780
-Kim Baek-du!
-Kim Baek-du!

460
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,741
-Kim Baek-du!
-Kim Baek-du!

461
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,793
INN

462
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,226
What on earth is going on?

463
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,479
Kim Baek-du is on fire.

464
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,524
He easily beat his opponents
and advanced to the semifinals.

465
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,943
-He wins by 2-0.
-Yes?

466
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,569
He advances to the finals.

467
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,695
Want a room?

468
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,531
Yes, I'd like a room.

469
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,284
What took you so long?

470
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,036
He's on the second floor.

471
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,373
Follow me.

472
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,856
Could you open the door for a moment?

473
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,072
Could you come out for a moment?

474
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:04,912
Let's go!

475
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,632
Gosh. Earlier, my shoulder…

476
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,301
Baek-du, you're so cool.

477
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,720
You were great. You were awesome!

478
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:30,354
THE 27TH SEOAN SSIREUM CHAMPIONSHIPS 2023

479
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,320
God, this is awkward.

480
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,448
Why are you resting here of all places?

481
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,327
I was here first.

482
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,495
Is that so?

483
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,876
Darn it. Is this
the only place to rest? Jeez.

484
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,171
Gosh.

485
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,715
Baek-du, you're good.

486
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:59,675
What?

487
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,803
I watched all of your matches
from the back.

488
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,305
I got a bit scared.

489
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,516
Hey, are you teasing me or what?

490
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,394
I heard what other guys said earlier.

491
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:15,107
I heard you'll move up a class next year.
And that you're in great shape.

492
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,400
Well…

493
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,654
So it's true.

494
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,992
Goodness.

495
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,872
Anyway, Dong-seok,

496
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,543
remember what I told you last time?

497
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,422
That I can be really good
if I set my mind on something,

498
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,840
so you should be nervous.

499
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,680
My heart is set today.

500
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:49,809
Because…

501
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:56,482
I have to win the championship today.

502
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,653
Is that so?

503
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:13,874
The 2023 Seoan Ssireum Championships
here at Seoan Arena.

504
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,086
Only the finals for Taebaek class remain.

505
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,089
Yes. Kim Baek-du
from Geosan-gun Ssireum Team

506
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,718
and Lim Dong-seok from Seongwon
City Hall Ssireum Team are in the finals.

507
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,346
The two faced each other
at the Dano Championships too,

508
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,225
and Lim Dong-seok won
after a video review.

509
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,603
Once again, these two meet in the finals.

510
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,939
That's right. The only difference

511
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,443
is that the two were both
on the Geosan-gun Team at the time,

512
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:44,196
and now, since Lim moved
to the Seongwon City Hall Team,

513
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,490
they're on different teams.

514
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,786
But the two were
on the same team for a long time,

515
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,706
so they must know each other very well.

516
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,583
That's right.

517
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,131
The blue satba will enter first.

518
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,884
Kim Baek-du
from Geosan-gun Ssireum Team.

519
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,680
He's going
for his first championship title.

520
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,975
He is 32 years old
and 178 cm tall at 78 kg.

521
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:17,355
He finished fourth
at the Namhang Ssireum Championships.

522
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,232
Yes. This wrestler isn't young anymore.

523
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:25,404
But judging by his recent performances,
he seems to be in better shape than ever.

524
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,449
It reminds me of the days
he was called a ssireum prodigy.

525
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,826
He's delivering great performances.

526
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,496
Next is the red satba.

527
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,040
Lim Dong-seok
from Seongwon City Hall Ssireum Team.

528
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,503
He's the strongest wrestler
in Taebaek class at the moment.

529
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:44,465
Yes, he's 24 years old,
185 cm tall and weighs 78.2 kg.

530
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,927
-He's won nine championship titles.
-This is the last one.

531
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,970
After this match,

532
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,433
will he become a ten-time champion?
We'll find out soon.

533
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,362
Don't be nervous!

534
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,660
Attention, bow!

535
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,001
Knees down.

536
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,465
Grab satbas.

537
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,555
Hold the satba tight, Baek-du!

538
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,391
Grab the satba tight, Baek-du!

539
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,809
The satba!

540
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,811
Grab.

541
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,856
-Okay!
-Lower your body.

542
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,983
Hold the satba tight and lower your body.

543
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,402
Stand up.

544
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,369
Kim Baek-du lifts Lim Dong-seok high.

545
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,912
He lifted him easily.

546
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,373
Now, Lim is holding out!

547
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,168
-Push!
-Push!

548
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,963
Popliteal Pull!

549
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:11,594
Yes. Kim Baek-du tried Lifting Throw,
and then Popliteal Pull.

550
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,095
He wins the first round.

551
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,347
-It was so quick.
-Good job!

552
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,515
-That's right.
-Nice!

553
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,476
Lim tried to hold out,

554
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,646
but Kim was so fast
that Lim was a bit taken aback, it seems.

555
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,315
He was incredible.

556
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,691
Good job!

557
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:29,236
See? You're great.
Why have you been like that all this time?

558
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,864
Don't get too excited.
It was just the first round.

559
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,824
Stay calm, understand?

560
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,161
Yes, he's right. Stay calm.

561
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,538
Stay calm and keep it up.
You're doing well.

562
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,373
Hold out a bit longer. That's it.

563
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,543
You just need to twist a bit more.
And hold out longer.

564
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,628
Good.

565
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,297
Let's go!

566
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,090
Go, Baek-du!

567
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:56,222
Kim Baek-du in the blue satba
is leading 1-0.

568
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,182
The second round begins.

569
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,186
-Now, grab the satba.
-Let's go!

570
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,105
Baek-du, grab the satba first.
Grab it first!

571
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,777
Dong-seok, watch your shoulders!

572
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,862
Good!

573
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,197
Nice!

574
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,205
Left knees up!

575
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,791
-Lower yourself!
-Stand up!

576
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,959
Lower!

577
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,889
-Kim lifts Lim for Lifting Throw again.
-Yes, good!

578
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,600
Will he be able to win this one too?

579
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,819
Oh, Front Knee Takedown!

580
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,738
Lim's move was really sharp.

581
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,701
Yes, Lim is second to none
when it comes to strength.

582
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,507
Baek-du, you did well. You did.

583
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,843
But you should
pull his satba closer to you

584
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,053
and utilize your core strength.

585
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,513
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

586
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,681
And focus!

587
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,269
You've got this.

588
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,646
Let's go!

589
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,523
Let's go!

590
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:42,995
Grab the satba.

591
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,166
Grab the deeper part!

592
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,669
Baek-du, pull the satba closer. Yes!

593
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,630
Good!

594
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,883
Stand up!

595
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,554
Ready.

596
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:03,432
Lifting Throw!

597
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,808
He's lifted him!

598
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,894
But Kim holds out!

599
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,982
Kim lifts Lim this time.

600
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,943
Clenched Interception!

601
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:46,266
You did well. Don't feel pressured.
You've been doing well.

602
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,603
Just push. Pretend to play along
with his attack and counter.

603
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,481
Okay? Focus.

604
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,358
You're doing well.

605
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,860
Grab the satba deeper this time.

606
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,362
And lower your body.

607
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,782
You got this!

608
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,868
Do what you're good at.

609
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,872
Don't try to overpower him.
Just do what you're good at.

610
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,045
Go, Kim Baek-du!

611
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,964
Go, Kim Baek-du!

612
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,551
Get ready.

613
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,977
Be your old self.

614
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,230
Just wrestle like Kim Baek-du used to.

615
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,318
Grab satbas!

616
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,544
Grab the satba deeper! Deeper!

617
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,589
Fix your shoulders!

618
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,508
Left knees up!

619
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,093
Good.

620
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,679
Stand up!

621
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,517
Ready.

622
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,148
Abdomen Throw! They try to lift!

623
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,025
Who's going to be lifted?

624
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,610
Lim with Clenched Interception!

625
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,904
Oh, Kim lost his grip on the satba!

626
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:22,988
Hey, the satba…

627
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,242
Now, Lim tries Left Knee Hook.

628
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:32,122
Oh, Kim counters with Abdomen Throw!

629
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,624
Yes!

630
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,340
KIM BAEK-DU: 2
LIM DONG-SEOK: 2

631
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:47,095
-There seems to have been an injury.
-What's wrong?

632
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,805
What's wrong with him?

633
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,441
Kim Baek-du

634
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,319
walks off looking to be in pain.

635
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,405
Are you hurt?

636
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,700
Will you be okay?

637
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,911
It's the last round.

638
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,621
-Give him some water.
-Baek-du.

639
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,040
It's the last round.

640
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,919
You're almost there.
You can win the title!

641
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:24,841
You have to come see my match.

642
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,887
So come and give me your answer that day.

643
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,601
-Let's go. This is the last one.
-Let's go, Baek-du!

644
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,020
Let's go!

645
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,822
This is the final round. Do your best.

646
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,324
On your knees.

647
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:08,802
Grab satbas!

648
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,932
Grab deeper!

649
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,185
Don't let him get a good grip!

650
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,068
Don't give him a head start!

651
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,825
Stand up!

652
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,710
Push and Throw! Inner leg!

653
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,886
-Lean to your right!
-Don't lose your grip!

654
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,476
It looks like
it's going to be a long battle.

655
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,728
Who's going to attack first?

656
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,730
Let's wait and see.

657
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,077
Kim Baek-du, Suplex!

658
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,704
They touched the sand at the same time.

659
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,561
The referee can't decide the winner.

660
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,441
-We won!
-His waist touched it later!

661
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,872
Now, the 2023 Seoan Ssireum Championships.

662
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:05,293
Kim Baek-du from the Geosan-gun Team
wins the Taebaek championship title!

663
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,275
-Kim Baek-du!
-Kim Baek-du!

664
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:32,738
-Kim Baek-du!
-Kim Baek-du!

665
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:27,209
Promise me that you'll be a champion
when you grow up.

666
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,169
And when you become a champion,

667
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:32,005
don't forget to tell people about me.

668
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,007
Okay?

669
00:51:57,113 --> 00:52:02,244
CONGRATULATIONS
KIM BAEK-DU, TAEBAEK CHAMPION

670
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,374
Mr. Kim Baek-du, tell us how you feel.

671
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,709
Du-sik!

672
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,757
I can't believe I'm talking about you
after winning the championship.

673
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,387
Hey, Oh Du-sik.

674
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,013
I kept my promise.

675
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,809
So you have to
keep your promise too, okay?

676
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,770
Are you watching?

677
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,856
I'll be waiting.

678
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,733
Du-sik, are you watching?

679
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,945
Why is he doing that?

680
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,697
Right? He's embarrassing.

681
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,242
What on earth is he doing on TV?
Everyone's watching.

682
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,619
Du-sik must hate it so much.

683
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,204
Not just hate it.

684
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:51,209
If she watches this, she won't see us
for 20… No, 40 years.

685
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,545
We'll be able to see her when we're 70.

686
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,755
He's taking it too far again.

687
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,633
What?

688
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,470
There they come.

689
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,912
Something urgent came up,
so I can't come to your match.

690
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,540
Just win the championship and wait.

691
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,918
Good luck!

692
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,800
What urgent thing?

693
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,554
I should be her top priority.

694
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,724
I mean, it's only

695
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,228
the day I might win my first championship.

696
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,814
And she promised me.

697
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,907
I'm really late, aren't I?

698
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:56,626
I didn't know I'd feel so empty
after you were gone. I missed you.

699
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,838
Me too. So I went shopping
and bought a lot in Seoul.

700
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,048
But what brought you down here?

701
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,926
I came down for a case
and thought I'd stop by.

702
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,137
You come here to investigate from Seoul?

703
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,722
You go everywhere!

704
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,474
Another team could've come instead,

705
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,019
but someone wanted
to catch the culprit herself.

706
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,103
Who?

707
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,022
Yu-gyeong did.

708
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,026
Then did Du-sik come too?

709
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,112
Yes, but she had somewhere to go first,
so I came alone.

710
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,199
Oh, and…

711
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,120
She asked me
to make sure to tell you this.

712
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,956
That she kept her promise.

713
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,673
We arrested Lee Gyeong-mun earlier today.

714
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,468
He's being interrogated now.

715
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,972
Wow, that's great.

716
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,183
That's great.

717
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,603
Let's have a drink.

718
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,906
How did you come here?

719
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,659
I saw you from the car earlier.

720
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,913
You were headed this way,
so I hurried here.

721
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,122
To surprise you.

722
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,542
Surprise? Who would be surprised
by something like this?

723
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,377
Wait. Your lips!

724
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,756
Hey, what happened to your lips?
Did someone hit you?

725
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,257
Don't worry. It's nothing.

726
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,468
It's not nothing! Hey.

727
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,054
How did it happen? Tell me.

728
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:36,351
I caught Gyeong-mun today.

729
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,019
Who?

730
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,980
The rice cake guy.

731
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,858
He was hiding in Yeongseon.
I arrested him a while ago.

732
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:50,490
And that's why
I couldn't watch your match today.

733
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,369
Sorry.

734
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,871
Is that important right now?

735
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,623
Your lips…

736
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:02,252
Hey, it must hurt a lot.
It won't leave a scar, will it?

737
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,336
Can you eat?

738
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,589
Don't laugh. I'm being serious.

739
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,594
Your family must be so happy.

740
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,852
A championship title in my family?

741
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,270
It's nothing new.

742
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,315
But it seemed my mom

743
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,277
cried earlier.
It's not that big of a deal.

744
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:31,948
Imagine how much she has worried
about you all this time.

745
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,159
You were a really good son today.

746
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,910
Really?

747
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,957
Gosh, it would've been really nice
if you'd watched me wrestle.

748
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:45,378
Then you didn't watch
my interview after the match either?

749
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,213
What?

750
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,257
No, I didn't.

751
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,341
Why?

752
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:55,388
Well, I had an interview with some channel
and talked about you.

753
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,514
Hey.

754
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,893
Why would you talk about me on TV?

755
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,144
I can't believe you.

756
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:05,398
You told me to tell people about you
if I became a champion.

757
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,150
When?

758
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,693
Don't act like you didn't.

759
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,573
When you left this town
early in the morning, 20 years ago,

760
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,783
you came to me

761
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:19,120
and told me to tell people about you
if I became a champion.

762
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,873
No, that was just…

763
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:26,294
"Is there anyone you want to thank?"
"Yes, I want to thank my friend Du-sik."

764
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,879
I meant something like that.

765
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:31,174
I didn't mean that you should talk
about our promise

766
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:34,052
on a nationwide channel
the whole country watches!

767
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,595
So you saw it.

768
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,015
Hey.

769
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:40,934
You saw it.

770
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,769
You saw it, didn't you?

771
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,731
Yeah! Yes, I did.

772
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,859
What about it? What do you want?

773
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,781
What do I want? I want your answer.

774
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,491
What answer?

775
00:58:56,574 --> 00:59:00,537
To my confession.
You promised to give your answer today.

776
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,210
So?

777
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,963
What's your answer?

778
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,971
Well, I also…

779
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:23,184
I've also had feelings for you…

780
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,436
What? I can't hear you.

781
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,897
I mean,

782
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,400
I've also

783
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:34,445
had feelings for you.

784
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:38,199
What are you saying? Just speak clearly!

785
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,496
I like you too!
I like you! I like you too!

786
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:56,968
Who in the world
says they like someone so angrily?

787
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,304
Jeez.

788
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,396
Gosh.

789
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,150
Anyway, I must be insane.

790
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,986
Even though you said it like that,

791
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,614
my heart is racing.

792
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,121
Kim Baek-du…

793
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,585
I like you a lot.

794
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,056
Du-sik, you know what?

795
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:49,896
Today, I'm the happiest man in the world.

796
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:53,316
Because of you.

797
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,352
But where did they go?

798
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,562
I'm sure the two are together right now.

799
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:35,149
They were joined at the hip
when we were kids too.

800
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:39,070
Right? What's taking Baek-du so long?
Maybe he's really with her.

801
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,988
Oh, right. Do you remember, Jin-su?

802
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:44,575
-Remember what?
-The homework we had when we were kids.

803
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:47,704
"What do you want to become
20 years later?"

804
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:49,580
I remember.

805
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:53,334
We've all become what we wrote.

806
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,253
What did you write?

807
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,464
He wanted to become
a great ssireum wrestler.

808
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,508
And Du-sik. Who was that?

809
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,678
The female detective on 24-Hour Scene.

810
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,472
Mi-suk? Don't tell me it's Chu Mi-suk.

811
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,765
Yes! I think it was her.

812
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,726
That's our captain.

813
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:13,062
Du-sik always said
she'd become like Mi-suk.

814
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,564
Wow, what is this?

815
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:17,567
We've all become what we wrote.
It's amazing.

816
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,318
What did you write?

817
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,654
Me? I wrote

818
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,490
I wanted to live long
without standing out.

819
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,409
But I wrote that for fun.

820
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,327
You just need to live long now.

821
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,625
Mi-ran, that was so harsh.

822
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,836
Then what about Baek-du?

823
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,838
-What did he write?
-Baek-du?

824
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:43,092
Strangely enough,
I don't remember what he wrote.

825
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,595
He wrote something really long.

826
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,721
Hey, guys.

827
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,347
There he is. Hey.

828
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,725
-What did you write?
-Write what?

829
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,810
The homework we had when we were kids.

830
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,563
"What do you want to become
20 years later?"

831
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:57,106
We had to write that.

832
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,192
What? Did we have such homework?

833
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,485
-Yeah.
-I don't remember.

834
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,695
Oh, that.

835
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,447
You remember? What did you write?

836
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,412
In 20 years, I want to…

837
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:14,749
It's a secret.

838
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,376
You punk, why is it a secret?

839
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,670
Then just tell me this.

840
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,923
Did it come true or not?

841
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,841
It did.

842
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,886
What is it? Just tell us.

843
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,679
-It's a secret!
-Just tell us.

844
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,473
-Tell us.
-Are you drunk?

845
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,058
-Just let it go.
-What happened?

846
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:37,021
This? I got hurt a little earlier.

847
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:39,482
No, that's not what I meant. Your lips…

848
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,945
There's something
on your lips too, Baek-du.

849
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,738
-What?
-Is that lipstick?

850
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:46,948
He must be drunk.

851
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,741
-Gosh.
-Hey, this is…

852
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,077
-What? Hey.
-This is…

853
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,205
What did you two do?
Don't tell me you kissed.

854
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:56,165
What? They did. They kissed.

855
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,043
God, after all those fights
they had as kids?

856
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:02,463
No, they must've developed
feelings for each other while fighting.

857
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,423
They say that happens!

858
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,800
-Seok-hui.
-God.

859
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:07,134
-Stop.
-They kissed!

860
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,261
-He caught us.
-They did.

861
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,555
-You should stop. Seriously.
-How many times?

862
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,306
-No wonder--
-Hey, Cho Seok-hui!

863
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,808
Get over here. You…

864
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,518
Stop it.

865
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,022
In 20 years, I want to…

866
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,024
I want to hang out with Du-sik…

867
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:26,863
No, with my friends every day,
just like we're doing today.

868
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,406
Forever!

869
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,199
Stop it.

870
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,761
Sometimes I thought about how…

871
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:56,183
even though I was over 30,
before I knew it,

872
01:04:56,726 --> 01:05:00,730
I was still like an 11-year-old kid
on the inside.

873
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,399
You can drink.

874
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,361
Are there any good places in Seoul?

875
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:12,867
I thought I'd never have
those bright, happy, and shiny days

876
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,620
again in my life,

877
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,039
and I even tried not to recall them.

878
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,375
Let's go have some whale meat.

879
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,710
I know a good place.

880
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,212
One is from Gangwon.

881
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,756
Come on. Hurry up.

882
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:30,801
-Let's run.
-What?

883
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:31,928
-Come on.
-Hey!

884
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,804
-Don't follow us!
-What's with them?

885
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:34,889
Where are you going?

886
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:36,682
-Where are you going?
-I'm the fastest.

887
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:41,896
Life is unpredictable.

888
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,984
It turns out that the brightest
and happiest time of my life

889
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:49,070
is right this moment.

890
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,572
-Hey, come over here.
-What?

891
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,199
Hey, let's throw someone in the water.

892
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,329
-Hey, come here for a second.
-Come over here!

893
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:07,838
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

894
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,943
