Every time we meet,

6
00:00:16,154 --> 00:00:17,604
I like you more.

7
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:20,105
I accept all of it.

8
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:21,068
Your thanks

9
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:22,204
and your love confession.

10
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:26,708
But if we lived far from each other,

11
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:30,183
I don’t want everything we’ve done to be together

12
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:31,186
to go to waste.

13
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:32,730
Nothing will go to waste, Achi.

14
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:34,102
You’ll be away for only a while.

15
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:35,600
And I promise

16
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:37,808
you won’t lose me because of it.

17
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:57,305
You’re always right on time, Karan.

18
00:00:58,478 --> 00:01:02,702
We promised we’d video call each other every day at 7 p.m.

19
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:04,001
How are you, Achi?

20
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:05,650
Are you lonely by yourself?

21
00:01:06,343 --> 00:01:07,354
How’s the weather over there?

22
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:08,213
Is it cold?

23
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:09,001
Hey.

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,503
I haven’t even moved to Nakhon Si Thammarat yet.

25
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,108
I just moved back home.

26
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:17,903
I’m just worried about you.

27
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,017
Oh.

28
00:01:20,891 --> 00:01:23,402
This morning, I found the toothbrush you forgot.

29
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,029
Do you need it? I can bring it to you.

30
00:01:25,038 --> 00:01:26,509
No need to trouble yourself.

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,706
I already bought a new one.

32
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:29,211
Really?

33
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:35,002
Oh, there’s another thing you forgot.

34
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,404
I’ll bring it to you.

35
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,500
It’s okay.

36
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:38,905
I have some at home.

37
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:40,905
You can eat that one.

38
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:55,182
I just saw

39
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:56,706
that you forgot your socks too.

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,604
I know you’re finding an excuse to come and see me.

41
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:03,906
I want to see you too

42
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:08,740
but everything we’re trying to do right now was your idea.

43
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:09,742
Huh?

44
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:11,515
Live apart?

45
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:12,216
Yes.

46
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:16,204
I think we should practice our long distance relationship

47
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,511
so when you work far away, we can deal with it.

48
00:02:20,213 --> 00:02:21,416
Oh.

49
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,416
I’m not sure

50
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:25,602
living alone again would be alright.

51
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:27,400
I know it’s hard

52
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:29,400
but you must try.

53
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,054
You’ll still see me in the office before you leave.

54
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:35,607
It’s you I’m worried about.

55
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,109
Are you sure you’ll be okay?

56
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,057
Of course, I will.

57
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:44,106
I’ll let the feeling of missing you work its magic.

58
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:47,611
I hope you won’t show up in front of my house every day.

59
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,305
I’ve promised myself

60
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:55,611
that no matter how much I miss you,

61
00:02:55,648 --> 00:02:56,902
I won’t visit you.

62
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:58,860
When you move to the South,

63
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:01,022
I won’t be able to visit you easily

64
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,906
so no matter how tough it is,

65
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,017
I must bear with it.

66
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:18,903
Even though we’re not that far apart,

67
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,204
I’m starting to miss you already.

68
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,303
I miss you too.

69
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,401
Oh.

70
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:30,357
I have to get ready for my online meeting with the Nakhon team tomorrow.

71
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:31,106
Oh?

72
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:32,808
But tomorrow is a weekend.

73
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,300
Aren’t you getting any rest at all?

74
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:38,019
Well, the construction team needs to hurry and finalize things.

75
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:41,004
I’m sorry I’ve been so busy with work

76
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,660
that I have no time for you.

77
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:43,506
It’s okay.

78
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:44,820
You should get to work.

79
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,106
I won’t keep you any longer.

80
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,100
Good night then.

81
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:49,816
Good night.

82
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:06,834
No.

83
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,503
You must hang in there.

84
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,503
You can’t just visit him as you please.

85
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:20,909
What now, Madam Noi?

86
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:23,211
I’ve always thought that when I have a lover,

87
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,708
we’ll have romantic moments

88
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:25,922
and be together all the time.

89
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,205
But what is this?

90
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,706
I’ve only been dating for three days and I’m left alone already.

91
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:36,112
We won’t get to see each other much for a while.

92
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:38,705
Why not?

93
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:40,503
Have I done something wrong?

94
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,804
Don’t you want to see me?

95
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:43,804
It’s not that.

96
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:46,408
Do you remember the contest I joined?

97
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:48,902
They're having an audition this Friday.

98
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,902
So my team and I have to practice hard.

99
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,805
I might not have time to visit you and Madam Noi as often as before.

100
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,706
And I probably won’t have time to talk on the phone either.

101
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:00,204
That’s okay.

102
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:02,608
I’ll visit you then.

103
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,657
You can’t.

104
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,602
If you come, how can I focus on my practice?

105
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:11,004
I’d rather you stay here and root for me.

106
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,737
- But I…
- This contest

107
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:14,405
is very important to me.

108
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:17,408
Please understand.

109
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:21,607
How about this?

110
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:23,205
Once the audition is over,

111
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:25,608
I promise

112
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,505
I’ll stick with you all the time

113
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:28,908
to make it up for you, okay?

114
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,900
Do you really mean all the time?

115
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:32,622
Yes, I mean it.

116
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:33,986
Okay.

117
00:06:33,997 --> 00:06:36,100
Do your best, Min.

118
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:38,620
It’s only a week. I can wait.

119
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:39,607
I’ll be totally fine.

120
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,422
Only a week?

121
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:46,810
Only half a day has passed and I miss him so badly.

122
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:48,400
Should I call him?

123
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:50,684
No, I can’t.

124
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:52,456
I don’t want to distract him.

125
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:56,908
Well, then.

126
00:06:58,124 --> 00:07:00,302
Let me see what he’s up to so I can stop missing him.

127
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:07,306
When he dances, he gets 10 times cuter.

128
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:11,405
(Huh?)

129
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,405
(ShayMin Forever?)

130
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:17,684
[Hello. If you want to board the ShayMin ship, put your life jacket on]

131
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:19,709
[because it’s sailing so fast.]

132
00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:22,702
What?

133
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:24,688
Who is this Shay guy?

134
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:26,805
Doesn’t he know Min is taken?

135
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:34,807
Thank you so much.

136
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,690
[Karan: Keep working hard, Achi. Rooting for you :)]

137
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,100
I miss him too.

138
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,121
Don’t tell me…

139
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:09,405
Oh.

140
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,939
That Shay guy! That Shay guy! That Shay guy!

141
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:13,934
That Shay guy!

142
00:08:14,638 --> 00:08:15,595
Who’s Shay?

143
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:18,608
That Shay guy is the friend in the same dance team as Min.

144
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:20,281
He acts like he’s super close to Min.

145
00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:22,527
The other day, he even wiped off his sweat.

146
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,487
Now the fans are shipping ShayMin!

147
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:25,798
“ShayMin! ShayMin! ShayMin!”

148
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:26,942
“ShayMin is so cute.”

149
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:28,533
It’s totally inconsiderate to me as Min’s boyfriend.

150
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,371
They should be shipping JinMin instead.

151
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:32,303
Our names rhyme and sound a lot cuter.

152
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:34,845
I thought you guys had a problem.

153
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:36,702
So, to sum up, you’re jealous.

154
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:37,737
Of course, I’m jealous.

155
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,880
How can I not be jealous?

156
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:40,260
Look at this.

157
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:43,702
Maybe they’re playing as best friends.

158
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:47,106
Here. His sweat got in his eyes during the dance practice,

159
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:49,082
so his friend wiped it off for him.

160
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:50,225
I can wipe sweat off my friend’s face too.

161
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:51,303
Like this.

162
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:55,601
If you’re worried,

163
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,183
why don’t you talk to Min?

164
00:08:58,192 --> 00:08:59,410
I can’t talk to him.

165
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:01,700
He’s practicing very hard these days.

166
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:03,700
I don’t want to distract him.

167
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,505
Then how about waiting to talk after he finishes his practice?

168
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:09,208
A week?

169
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:12,004
I’m going to die before it’s over.

170
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:14,657
Oh, what are you going to do then?

171
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,059
I don’t know.

172
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,300
And how about you?

173
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:25,109
You’ll have to be away from Mr. Karan for a month.

174
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,257
Aren’t you afraid at all?

175
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:31,109
Of course, I’m afraid.

176
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,005
When I’m far from him,

177
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,546
I won’t be able to read his mind

178
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,305
and that makes me even more afraid.

179
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,487
Then how can you be sure that your love will remain the same?

180
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,005
This is my first time being in love

181
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:57,503
so I don’t know how much I can trust in love.

182
00:09:57,942 --> 00:09:59,897
If I felt there was a problem,

183
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:02,300
I’d tell you honestly

184
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,500
to make it feel like you’re reading my mind.

185
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:11,457
But Karan reassures me.

186
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:20,804
I’ll see you, friend.

187
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:21,801
See you.

188
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:22,620
Thank you so much.

189
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,902
Hang in there.

190
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:25,481
Bye-bye.

191
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:26,909
See you.

192
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:45,611
Karan.

193
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:46,308
(Achi.)

194
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:48,410
Oh.

195
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,706
Why are you in the car?

196
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:55,414
(Oh, I came down to get some stuff.)

197
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,782
(By the way, when do you start at the new branch?)

198
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:01,980
Towards the end of the month.

199
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:03,720
Probably after the 25th.

200
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:04,200
Why?

201
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,506
[Loy Krathong Cruise on Chao Phraya River, 23 November]
Why?

202
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:06,050
[Loy Krathong Cruise on Chao Phraya River, 23 November]

203
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,290
So you have some free days before that, right?
[Loy Krathong Cruise on Chao Phraya River, 23 November]

204
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:09,705
So you have some free days before that, right?

205
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:13,512
(I’ll be very busy.)

206
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,500
(I have to finish up the work in Bangkok)

207
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:18,002
(and prepare for the work in the South.)

208
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:20,897
You’re right.

209
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,601
Is something the matter?

210
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,897
No, nothing.

211
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,102
Every time you say there’s nothing, there’s something.

212
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:35,740
Please tell me what it is.

213
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:37,801
Okay.

214
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,508
I want to invite you to go Loy Krathong with me

215
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:45,005
but if you’re busy, it’s okay.

216
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:49,786
I don’t want you to be distracted by nonsense.

217
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:50,408
Hey.

218
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:54,108
Nothing about you is ever nonsense to me.

219
00:11:54,651 --> 00:11:57,802
Besides, the event is held before my travel date.

220
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,802
Don’t worry, Karan.

221
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:02,804
(I won’t let you miss our first Loy Krathong.)

222
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:05,619
You mean…

223
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:06,402
Mm.

224
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:08,700
Will you go Loy Krathong with me?

225
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:15,468
♪ My heart shouts out loud, I love you ♪

226
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,930
♪  Can you hear it? ♪

227
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,220
It’s nothing.

228
00:12:23,936 --> 00:12:26,499
Achi said friends can wipe off each other’s sweat.

229
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:31,422
Nothing can ever come between the relationship I have with Min.

230
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:35,325
They’re friends.

231
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:36,927
It’s understandable.

232
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:43,293
They’re friends.

233
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:44,896
They can share drinks.

234
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,920
Let’s take a shower.

235
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:48,028
Let’s go.

236
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:54,662
Friends cannot take a shower together.

237
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:56,228
Why are they so close?

238
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,672
I can’t take it anymore.

239
00:12:58,435 --> 00:12:59,376
Where’s my bag?

240
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,437
Damn, I forgot my phone.

241
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:18,660
If Min finds out I secretly came to see him, he’d be angry with me

242
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:20,028
but whatever.

243
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:21,527
Just let me see a bit.

244
00:13:21,628 --> 00:13:23,460
I just need to see with my own eyes that nothing is going on

245
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:24,930
then I’ll leave right away.

246
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,299
Are you done?

247
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:33,826
Hurry up.

248
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:35,426
It’s clear now.

249
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:37,626
It’s clear that they’re not just friends.

250
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,425
Jinta, you’re so stupid.

251
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:42,059
You got lied to.

252
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:46,228
What are you looking at?

253
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:49,028
Let’s go.

254
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:50,324
Let’s.

255
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:54,823
Achi, look.

256
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:56,423
This is our Krathong.

257
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:58,127
It’s made of bread

258
00:13:58,266 --> 00:13:59,422
so the fish can eat it.

259
00:13:59,595 --> 00:14:01,617
The fish might not get to eat it.

260
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:02,971
The water could go bad first.

261
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,022
Oh.

262
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:07,777
I’ll think of something new then.

263
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,429
This one is just a practice.

264
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,223
You even practice making a Krathong?

265
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:15,622
It’s our first Loy Krathong together.

266
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:17,222
I have to take it seriously.

267
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:27,099
Sorry.

268
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:29,026
That’s the time-telling bell in my neighborhood.

269
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:33,026
Wait.

270
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:37,022
Why can I hear the sound from your side too?

271
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:38,380
Where are you?

272
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:42,300
Try opening your window.

273
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:44,222
Seriously?

274
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:46,939
I’m just kidding.

275
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:49,339
It’s probably an echo from your side.

276
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:51,539
I won’t break our promise.

277
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:52,583
Oh.

278
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:54,019
You startled me.

279
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:55,124
Why?

280
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:57,134
Do you want me to come over?

281
00:14:57,882 --> 00:14:58,977
No.

282
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:03,429
Hey, Karan.

283
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,330
I have to join an online meeting with the team from the new branch.

284
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:07,337
Really?

285
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:11,339
Good night in advance then.

286
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:13,423
Good night.

287
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,820
Bye-bye.

288
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:24,023
He really didn’t come.

289
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:28,260
Who really is the one who can’t deal with missing the other?

290
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:54,829
(Come on.)

291
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:59,525
(No matter what happens today, I must let Pai know my feelings.)

292
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,577
[I like you.]

293
00:16:23,622 --> 00:16:24,626
Hey, Pai.

294
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,579
I bought you this.

295
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:28,933
This is weird.

296
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:30,561
Did you do something wrong?

297
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:31,330
Nonsense.

298
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,124
I really wanted to buy this for you.

299
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,903
I can be generous, you know.

300
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:36,229
Fine, I’ll believe you.

301
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,539
Thanks.

302
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:40,976
Enjoy your candies.

303
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:42,173
Okay.

304
00:17:11,411 --> 00:17:12,223
Rock.

305
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:15,029
I saw it.

306
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:16,423
Yes!

307
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,416
So what do you say?

308
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,854
I knew this would happen.

309
00:17:35,992 --> 00:17:38,525
You sent them the wrong poster file again, didn’t you?

310
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:39,924
What did you see?

311
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:42,524
The poster file the printing house sent back, obviously.

312
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:43,539
No.

313
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,845
You had one job but forgot how to do it right.

314
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:48,142
You got promoted but are still as careless as before.

315
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:49,405
What is this?

316
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:50,456
You bought this to make up for your mistake, right?

317
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:51,321
No.

318
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:52,365
Take it back.

319
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:53,540
Pai, wait.

320
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:54,823
Didn’t you see anything else?

321
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:55,659
Pai.

322
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:56,853
Hey.

323
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,057
What did you see?

324
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,259
What’s going on?

325
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:04,896
Whose candies are these?

326
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:05,862
Can I have some?

327
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:16,577
“I like you.”

328
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,722
Excuse me.

329
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,171
Is this for…?

330
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:25,631
I’m trans.

331
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,585
[I booked a restaurant for this evening. See you soon.]

332
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,626
[Got it.]

333
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:01,842
[After eating,]

334
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:03,863
[let’s go shopping for Loy Krathong outfits.]

335
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:11,029
Achi.

336
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:13,220
Boss wants to see you.

337
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,226
What’s going on?

338
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:16,422
I don’t know.

339
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,939
You plan to launch this batch of new products from Japan

340
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,226
at the same time as the new branch?

341
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,131
Yes.

342
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:35,339
That’s why I want you to go to the new branch sooner.

343
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:42,328
To be ready in time, I’ll probably have to do that.

344
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:45,099
I think the 20th is the latest you should leave.

345
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,127
Huh?

346
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,776
The 20th?

347
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,629
Is something wrong?

348
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:54,097
Oh, no.

349
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:55,626
Nothing.

350
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,423
(Oh, no.)

351
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:00,724
(I made a promise about Loy Krathong.)

352
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,925
(I don’t want to disappoint Karan.)

353
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,552
How are you?

354
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:18,502
Did you miss me?

355
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:28,007
What’s wrong?

356
00:20:29,404 --> 00:20:31,340
Are you in a bad mood?

357
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:33,109
No.

358
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,936
Nothing is wrong.

359
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,111
Oh, for the audition this Friday,

360
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:42,607
don’t forget to cheer me on from right next to the stage.

361
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:44,543
I’ll see.

362
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,862
I think I have a meeting with my editor.

363
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:57,005
What’s wrong?

364
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,911
Are you mad about Shay?

365
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:02,619
That Shay guy?

366
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,000
Who’s Shay? I don’t know him.

367
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:09,820
I haven’t heard that name before.

368
00:21:10,724 --> 00:21:11,503
Really?

369
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:15,207
Then why did you come to the practice room to spy on me?

370
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,254
Don’t think I didn’t see you.

371
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:19,105
I recognized you at a glance.

372
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:22,906
So it’s because of Shay, isn’t it?

373
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:26,140
You guys are so close.

374
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:28,062
Anyone would get possessive if they were me.

375
00:21:28,444 --> 00:21:31,579
Shay and I have been friends since secondary school.

376
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,708
We’re close but nothing more.

377
00:21:34,797 --> 00:21:37,497
Besides, he’s already dating someone.

378
00:21:41,454 --> 00:21:43,204
This is his girlfriend.

379
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,100
If you don’t believe me,

380
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:48,779
I can call and ask him for you.

381
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:55,103
No need.

382
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,102
I believe you now.

383
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,377
I know what I do requires me to meet a lot of people

384
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:04,705
and it makes you paranoid

385
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:06,608
but believe me

386
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,383
that I’ll never hurt you.

387
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,204
I promise.

388
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,410
(Oh, Uncle. How could you think I’d cheat on you?)

389
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,807
(Don’t you know how much I love you?)

390
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,508
I love you too.

391
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,194
Huh?

392
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,534
Nothing.

393
00:22:33,543 --> 00:22:36,071
Did you just say you love me?

394
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:36,805
No.

395
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:38,459
I didn’t say anything.

396
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:41,379
Really?

397
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:44,422
Hey, Madam Noi!

398
00:22:45,173 --> 00:22:46,640
Are you in your house?

399
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,001
I didn’t see you at all.

400
00:22:48,122 --> 00:22:49,905
How are you? Have you eaten?

401
00:22:51,294 --> 00:22:52,269
Have you eaten?

402
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,505
Madam Noi!

403
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:12,802
Pai.

404
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:15,102
Can I get your opinion on something?

405
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:16,411
Sure.

406
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:17,903
What is it about?

407
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:21,536
Between this one and this one,

408
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:23,702
which one do you think is better?

409
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,903
Krathong?

410
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:26,822
Mm.

411
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:32,002
Don’t tell me you’re going Loy Krathong with Achi.

412
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,143
Okay, let me help.

413
00:23:37,158 --> 00:23:38,414
I’ll do my best to help you.

414
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:40,308
For you two, I’ll always do my best.

415
00:23:42,077 --> 00:23:42,920
This is cute.

416
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:43,965
- But not this one, right?
- Not this one.

417
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:45,005
Don’t go with this one.

418
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:46,108
It’s not cute enough.

419
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:54,900
I’ve picked about three styles.

420
00:23:55,426 --> 00:23:56,900
See which one you like.

421
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,128
Karan,

422
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:03,620
I have something to tell you.

423
00:24:06,674 --> 00:24:07,508
What is it?

424
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:11,204
Uh…

425
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:14,601
Uh…

426
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:20,108
I’m hungry.

427
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:21,702
Can we order food first?

428
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,202
No big deal.

429
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:26,905
Of course, we can.

430
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:37,602
Achi,

431
00:24:38,037 --> 00:24:39,401
I looked it up.

432
00:24:40,053 --> 00:24:43,000
They say when we Loy Krathong together,

433
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,739
we have to try to keep both of our Krathongs together.

434
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:46,896
It’s believed that

435
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,407
it’ll keep us together forever.

436
00:24:49,817 --> 00:24:50,253
Nothing will…

437
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,309
I’m afraid I can’t go Loy Krathong with you anymore.

438
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:57,109
Oh?

439
00:24:58,278 --> 00:24:59,004
Uh…

440
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,807
The new branch will open ahead of schedule

441
00:25:02,954 --> 00:25:04,905
so I have to hurry and get everything ready sooner.

442
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:09,339
Plus, I have to go there and oversee the work before Loy Krathong.

443
00:25:11,352 --> 00:25:12,300
Oh.

444
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:15,379
Is that so?

445
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:22,709
I know you must be so disappointed and hurt.

446
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,817
It’s totally fine.

447
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,405
I understand.

448
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,802
Huh?

449
00:25:28,364 --> 00:25:29,802
Are you sure it’s totally fine?

450
00:25:30,226 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah.

451
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,497
I know this big project is very important to you.

452
00:25:36,711 --> 00:25:37,502
Why?

453
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:40,460
Don’t you believe what I said?

454
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:43,407
It’s not that.

455
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:45,259
Of course, I believe it.

456
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,801
(I’d be crazy to believe that.)

457
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,208
(There’s no way you don’t feel anything.)

458
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:15,002
What are you doing, Karan?

459
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:17,502
Deleting some photos.

460
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:21,822
(You’re clearly disappointed.)

461
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,608
Are you sure you’re okay about Loy Krathong?

462
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,005
If you have something on your mind, you can be honest with me.

463
00:26:30,776 --> 00:26:32,622
I told you I’m okay.

464
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:35,506
Asking me that question

465
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,103
sounds like you don’t trust me.

466
00:26:38,254 --> 00:26:39,602
Of course, I trust you.

467
00:26:40,437 --> 00:26:41,506
(Not.)

468
00:26:56,654 --> 00:26:57,805
What are you doing?

469
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,019
Uh…

470
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:02,213
Don’t you believe what I said?

471
00:27:02,471 --> 00:27:03,706
It’s not that I don’t believe it

472
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,660
but I just want to know how you really feel.

473
00:27:10,773 --> 00:27:12,308
Everything you’re saying...

474
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,705
means you don't trust me.

475
00:27:17,644 --> 00:27:18,509
Well,

476
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:25,309
I’m really not sure what you mean by being okay.

477
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,549
I feel like you just said that to make me feel better

478
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:32,303
rather than telling the truth.

479
00:27:32,503 --> 00:27:33,807
But I told you

480
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,805
if I had a problem with anything, I’d tell you honestly.

481
00:27:38,044 --> 00:27:40,899
To make it feel like you’re reading my mind.

482
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:44,802
Oh.

483
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,905
It’s so hard without the magical power.

484
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:51,702
You know when we were apart,

485
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,539
I thought you wouldn’t be able to stand being alone and would come to me

486
00:27:58,555 --> 00:28:00,007
but it turned out it was me

487
00:28:02,357 --> 00:28:05,020
who kept wondering what you’re doing all the time.

488
00:28:08,908 --> 00:28:09,699
Achi…

489
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:10,696
I’m sorry.

490
00:28:11,736 --> 00:28:14,705
I probably mixed things up.

491
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,899
I’m not making sense anymore.

492
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,300
Please excuse me.

493
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:40,602
[I’m sorry I said bad things today.]

494
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:56,008
I have to go to the South in a few days

495
00:28:57,786 --> 00:28:59,404
but now we’re in a fight.

496
00:29:13,306 --> 00:29:14,065
Karan.

497
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,250
[Mr. Tanaka]

498
00:29:20,674 --> 00:29:21,408
(Hello.)

499
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:22,349
Hello, Boss.

500
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:24,454
(I’ve finalized your travel date.)

501
00:29:24,648 --> 00:29:26,005
(It’s quite urgent.)

502
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:28,902
(Would this Saturday be okay for you?)

503
00:29:28,912 --> 00:29:29,800
This Saturday?

504
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,208
That means I’m leaving in two days.

505
00:29:54,514 --> 00:29:55,447
Hey, Achi.

506
00:29:56,102 --> 00:29:57,146
Who are you looking for?

507
00:30:00,737 --> 00:30:02,248
Karan won’t come to the office today.

508
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:04,217
He said he’d be in a meeting until early this evening.

509
00:30:04,531 --> 00:30:05,420
Do you need anything?

510
00:30:07,345 --> 00:30:08,242
No.

511
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:10,348
Please excuse me then.

512
00:30:16,254 --> 00:30:17,019
Achi.

513
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:20,853
This contains all the materials to promote the new branch in Nakhon Si Thammarat.

514
00:30:21,217 --> 00:30:24,588
As for all the print ads, I’ve already contacted the printing house over there.

515
00:30:24,598 --> 00:30:26,245
They’ll deliver them to the branch.

516
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:27,351
Thank you.

517
00:30:29,925 --> 00:30:35,537
I guess you’re not going Loy Krathong with Karan anymore.

518
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:38,241
Eh?

519
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,743
You know about our Loy Krathong?

520
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:42,942
Yes.

521
00:30:44,463 --> 00:30:46,143
Karan asked for my advice.

522
00:30:47,728 --> 00:30:48,343
Wait.

523
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:52,777
But will Achi get to go Loy Krathong with you?

524
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:54,647
Why not?

525
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:59,348
I heard that they want to move up the new branch opening

526
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:02,291
and Achi will have to go to the South sooner

527
00:31:02,306 --> 00:31:05,059
but I don’t know when exactly he has to go.

528
00:31:07,342 --> 00:31:08,500
It’s okay.

529
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:10,900
We can go Loy Krathong together next year instead.

530
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,047
Aren’t you sad at all?

531
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:20,557
I know how important the new branch opening is to Achi

532
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:25,845
and I’d feel very bad if I caused a problem with his work.

533
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,059
I’d rather support him in everything.

534
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:34,546
I want to see him succeed in life like he intended.

535
00:31:38,457 --> 00:31:39,737
Please excuse me.

536
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:47,648
(So Karan really meant what he said.)

537
00:31:48,681 --> 00:31:52,244
(But I never believed in his words.)

538
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,530
[Jinta: I’ve arrived.]

539
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:20,545
Are you a fan of Min too?

540
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:21,804
Yes, he’s my bias.

541
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:23,472
Do you like him too, Uncle?

542
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,045
(Uncle?)

543
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,715
(Even though I’m an uncle, I’m your bias’ boyfriend.)

544
00:32:29,737 --> 00:32:30,948
Is something wrong?

545
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,241
Oh, nothing.

546
00:32:33,714 --> 00:32:34,539
Okay.

547
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,490
[Min: I’m nervous.]

548
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,810
[Jinta: You’re definitely going to win. Do your best.]

549
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,930
[Jinta: Don’t forget you promised to treat me to shabu-shabu after you win.]

550
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,890
[Min: I won’t. Get ready to stuff your belly.]

551
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,130
[Pay attention to what’s on the stage. There’ll be a surprise.]

552
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,542
Hello, everyone.

553
00:32:57,863 --> 00:33:01,644
Welcome to the final audition of

554
00:33:01,754 --> 00:33:03,078
I DO IDOL.

555
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:05,749
Who will be the next idols?

556
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,844
Let’s find out together.

557
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:13,743
Now the first team is ready.

558
00:33:13,832 --> 00:33:17,253
Please give them a big hand.

559
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:21,647
Go, Min!

560
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:23,647
Go, Min!

561
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:25,146
Go, Min!

562
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:29,001
Those shoes.

563
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:30,940
Take it.

564
00:33:30,954 --> 00:33:32,136
I bought this as a thank you gift for you.

565
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:37,582
3, 2, 1.

566
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:05,521
Well done, Min!

567
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,774
Well done!

568
00:34:24,611 --> 00:34:29,136
Now that all three teams have given their performance,

569
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:33,444
it’s time to announce the winning team

570
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,551
that’s going to debut as the next idol band.

571
00:34:37,026 --> 00:34:40,845
And the winning team is…

572
00:34:41,257 --> 00:34:42,448
The first team! The first team!

573
00:34:42,472 --> 00:34:44,044
The winning team is…

574
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,942
The winning team is…

575
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:47,124
Which team?

576
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,254
The first team!

577
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:48,841
The first team!

578
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:52,444
The winner is the second team!

579
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,845
I’m afraid you won’t get to eat your shabu-shabu.

580
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,945
I’m sorry.

581
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,542
I guess I have to give up.

582
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,445
I have no hope of becoming an idol anymore.

583
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:48,645
You know what?

584
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:55,380
Today, you made me understand the true meaning of being an idol.

585
00:35:57,348 --> 00:36:00,444
An idol is not the best dancer

586
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:02,850
or the best singer

587
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:10,380
but someone who can inspire everyone.

588
00:36:12,863 --> 00:36:13,842
Do you know

589
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:18,448
you inspire so many people, including me?

590
00:36:21,189 --> 00:36:25,263
So whether you get to debut or not today,

591
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:30,848
you’re already an idol to me.

592
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:39,245
Thank you.

593
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:42,257
Hey.

594
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:45,140
I have a surprise for you.

595
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,749
Turn around.

596
00:36:51,955 --> 00:36:53,333
Keep going, Min.

597
00:36:53,357 --> 00:36:54,348
Don’t give up.

598
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,051
We’ll keep cheering you on.

599
00:36:56,065 --> 00:36:57,509
We’re rooting for you.

600
00:36:57,528 --> 00:36:59,047
Keep going.

601
00:37:19,782 --> 00:37:20,742
Keep going.

602
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,148
(Karan.)

603
00:37:51,013 --> 00:37:52,842
(I’m sorry about the other day.)

604
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,742
(Actually, I want to apologize to you in person)

605
00:37:57,334 --> 00:37:59,275
but I have to go to the South tomorrow.

606
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:01,343
I probably won’t have time to see you

607
00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:06,051
but I want you to know that I’m really sorry.

608
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,543
I’m really sorry.

609
00:38:26,748 --> 00:38:27,743
Hi.

610
00:38:28,357 --> 00:38:30,245
You’re leaving for the South tomorrow, right?

611
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,834
I brought you some dried food

612
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,952
in case you don’t like the food there.

613
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:36,497
Thank you so much, Auntie.

614
00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:38,840
Take good care of yourself there.

615
00:38:38,851 --> 00:38:40,145
I’m worried about you.

616
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:40,920
Alright.

617
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,758
I’ll buy you Khanom La when I’m back.

618
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,210
Thanks.

619
00:38:45,912 --> 00:38:48,911
By the way, isn’t Karan coming?

620
00:38:48,921 --> 00:38:50,342
I haven’t seen him today.

621
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:53,291
He’s not coming.

622
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:55,442
Of course, he’s coming.

623
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:59,642
I see him park his car on the street next to our houses every night.

624
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:01,751
He’s so handsome that I can’t mistake anyone else for him.

625
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:04,241
Every night?

626
00:39:04,274 --> 00:39:04,946
Yes.

627
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:09,648
Every night around 7-8 p.m.

628
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:10,746
Wait.

629
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:13,539
Didn’t he come to see you?

630
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,648
7 p.m.?

631
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,435
I’ll see you, friend.

632
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:21,245
Bye-bye.

633
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:24,942
Karan.

634
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:25,663
Achi.

635
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:26,746
Why are you in the car?

636
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:29,148
I came down to get some stuff.

637
00:39:29,986 --> 00:39:32,448
Why can I hear the sound from your side too?

638
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,056
Did Karan come to see me every night?

639
00:39:37,194 --> 00:39:39,056
Try opening your window.

640
00:39:41,684 --> 00:39:42,848
Thank you so much, Auntie.

641
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,000
Alright.

642
00:39:45,657 --> 00:39:47,000
You’re welcome.

643
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,493
I won’t keep you any longer.

644
00:39:49,505 --> 00:39:49,834
Okay.

645
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:50,940
I should get going.

646
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:51,782
I won’t keep you.

647
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,542
(Hello, Achi.)

648
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,939
Hello, Pai.

649
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,016
Are you free?

650
00:40:05,057 --> 00:40:05,848
(Yes.)

651
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:07,539
I need your help.

652
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:11,842
Thank you so much for today.

653
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:14,549
I’ll send you next month’s catalog as soon as I can.

654
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:16,475
Rock.

655
00:40:16,496 --> 00:40:17,071
Duj.

656
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:18,060
What are you guys doing here?

657
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:18,888
We’re here to see you.

658
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,801
Are we done here?

659
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:20,814
Uh, yes.

660
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:21,622
Thank you.

661
00:40:21,648 --> 00:40:22,782
- Where are we going?
- Bye.

662
00:40:22,826 --> 00:40:23,390
Rock.

663
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:24,320
It’s nothing. We’re close.

664
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:24,816
Very close.

665
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,777
Where are we going?

666
00:40:25,795 --> 00:40:26,611
Bye.

667
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:27,475
Rock.

668
00:40:27,522 --> 00:40:28,143
Hey.

669
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:36,182
What’s going on, Rock?

670
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,647
Why did you bring me here?

671
00:40:38,256 --> 00:40:38,918
I won’t tell you

672
00:40:38,927 --> 00:40:39,980
because I don’t know either.

673
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:41,841
Don’t worry.

674
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,543
Our job is done.

675
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,782
You’ll find out soon.

676
00:40:45,774 --> 00:40:46,502
Let’s go.

677
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,251
Liar!

678
00:40:58,822 --> 00:40:59,540
Achi.

679
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,317
I thought you said no matter how much you missed me,

680
00:41:03,324 --> 00:41:05,013
you wouldn’t come to see me.

681
00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:10,177
But you secretly came to my house every day, didn’t you?

682
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,628
You knew.

683
00:41:17,638 --> 00:41:19,777
How can I trust you now?

684
00:41:32,297 --> 00:41:33,642
I understand you though.

685
00:41:36,715 --> 00:41:39,819
I missed you so much that I couldn’t bear it either

686
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:45,248
so I asked Duj and Rock to bring you here.

687
00:41:53,321 --> 00:41:56,186
I’m sorry I didn’t trust you before.

688
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,952
Sometimes your love is so great

689
00:42:02,825 --> 00:42:06,137
that it’s hard to believe that someone could love me this much.

690
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:11,536
But I trust you now.

691
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:15,940
I trust you wholeheartedly.

692
00:42:20,053 --> 00:42:21,703
You don’t need to apologize.

693
00:42:23,445 --> 00:42:24,740
I’ve never been angry with you.

694
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:33,254
In that case, can I ask you something?

695
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,943
Are you sad that our first Loy Krathong plan failed?

696
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:44,445
Apart from not wanting to make you feel uncomfortable,

697
00:42:45,872 --> 00:42:46,857
I’m sad

698
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:50,780
but what can I do?

699
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:53,180
It can’t be helped.

700
00:42:56,522 --> 00:42:58,019
Who says it can’t be helped?

701
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:11,459

711
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:36,241
Let me do something for you for a change.

712
00:43:37,674 --> 00:43:43,140
At least I want to make our first Loy Krathong happen.

713
00:43:46,848 --> 00:43:48,245
What’s really going on?

714
00:43:48,482 --> 00:43:50,121
Did they come here to fight it out?

715
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:51,654
You idiot.

716
00:43:52,472 --> 00:43:54,173
Look how romantic it is.

717
00:43:54,185 --> 00:43:55,669
Who would come here to fight?

718
00:43:55,685 --> 00:43:57,859
The couple came here to reconcile.

719
00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:00,154
Oh.

720
00:44:01,337 --> 00:44:02,154
No wonder.

721
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:03,945
What?

722
00:44:04,734 --> 00:44:05,628
They’re a couple?

723
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:09,447
Yes.

724
00:44:11,688 --> 00:44:12,499
Yes.

725
00:44:13,773 --> 00:44:14,882
You’ve been around them all this time.

726
00:44:14,896 --> 00:44:16,348
Haven’t you suspected anything?

727
00:44:17,007 --> 00:44:18,748
What could have been suspicious?

728
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:20,779
They were just on a date at the mall.

729
00:44:21,382 --> 00:44:22,779
They slept over in each other’s homes.

730
00:44:23,842 --> 00:44:24,850
Exactly.

731
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,379
What the f*ck?

732
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:28,574
Keep it down.

733
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,037
Keep it down.

734
00:44:30,047 --> 00:44:30,737
Shh!

735
00:44:42,118 --> 00:44:43,345
(What do you wish for?)

736
00:44:44,637 --> 00:44:47,248
(I wish we get to Loy Krathong together every year.)

737
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:49,548
(What about you, Achi?)

738
00:44:50,598 --> 00:44:55,152
(I wish for our love to be strong.)

739
00:44:55,669 --> 00:44:57,182
(I wish nothing could destroy it.)

740
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:03,841
You don’t have to make a wish for that.

741
00:45:04,425 --> 00:45:05,841
It’s up to us

742
00:45:07,776 --> 00:45:09,642
but I believe we can do it.

743
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:12,340
No matter how far

744
00:45:12,866 --> 00:45:14,142
or for how long we are apart,

745
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:17,059
I believe we’ll get through it.

746
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:22,047
(Hello.)

747
00:45:22,146 --> 00:45:23,007
(We’re ready.)

748
00:45:23,029 --> 00:45:23,817
(Do it.)

749
00:46:14,391 --> 00:46:15,342
Really?

750
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:17,149
Did you park here every night?

751
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,240
Yeah.

752
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:22,155
Because I missed you.

753
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:30,448
But when I’m in Nakhon,

754
00:46:30,828 --> 00:46:33,139
you can’t just come to visit me as you please.

755
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:36,240
From now on, we’ll really have to be apart.

756
00:46:38,472 --> 00:46:39,442
I’m not afraid.

757
00:46:40,402 --> 00:46:41,745
Whether you’re going to Nakhon,

758
00:46:42,268 --> 00:46:44,139
America,

759
00:46:44,472 --> 00:46:46,740
or Mars,

760
00:46:47,441 --> 00:46:49,642
my feelings for you will be the same.

761
00:46:50,383 --> 00:46:51,447
Nothing will change.

762
00:46:53,537 --> 00:46:56,742
So please focus on your work

763
00:46:56,934 --> 00:46:57,743
and don’t worry.

764
00:46:58,342 --> 00:46:59,644
I promise I’ll wait.

765
00:47:16,085 --> 00:47:17,351
(I love you, Achi.)

766
00:47:27,994 --> 00:47:29,253
I love you too, Karan.

767
00:47:53,128 --> 00:47:55,817
(Let this kiss take care of you for me.)

768
00:48:47,245 --> 00:48:48,330
Thank you so much.

769
00:48:48,351 --> 00:48:49,540
You’re the magical power

770
00:48:50,114 --> 00:48:51,582
that always reignites my passion.

771
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:54,445
I want to ask

772
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,650
if you’re open to seeing me.

773
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,158
This is the new boss.

774
00:48:59,314 --> 00:49:00,266
Boss!

775
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:03,047
I know everything seems hard on your first day.

776
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,231
I think I have a lot to adjust to.

777
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,546
You can do it for sure.

778
00:49:07,774 --> 00:49:09,146
A nice guy like you

779
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:11,448
can make everyone around you fall in love with you.

780
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:21,770
[I wish for our love to be strong and nothing could destroy it.]
