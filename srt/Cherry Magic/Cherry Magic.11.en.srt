5
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:15,739
Live apart?

6
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:18,608
I think we should practice our long distance relationship.

7
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:20,063
You can’t just visit him as you please.

8
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:20,908
Liar!

9
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:22,754
I thought you said no matter how much you missed me,

10
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,142
you wouldn’t come to see me.

11
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:26,527
But you secretly came to my house every day, didn’t you?

12
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:27,583
I understand you though.

13
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:30,543
I missed you so much that I couldn’t bear it either.

14
00:00:31,588 --> 00:00:33,197
When I’m in Nakhon,

15
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:35,082
you can’t just come to visit me as you please.

16
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:37,343
From now on, we’ll really have to be apart.

17
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:41,854
(Let this kiss take care of you for me.)

18
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:50,008
Seeing Achi and Karan in love makes me so happy.

19
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:53,102
I want them to love each other like this every day.

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,706
I wish I had good love like that.

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,805
Good job.

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,001
Which one do we get?

23
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:04,312
That’s so cute.

24
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:08,805
Will you be my girlfriend?

25
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:14,905
Because I want to have a special moment like this too.

26
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:16,808
Yes.

27
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:18,665
You’re so cute.

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,706
Thank you.

29
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:31,694
Move.

30
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:40,908
Whoa.

31
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,804
Next time you want this, you can tell me.

32
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:49,605
Not like this.

33
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,311
What?

34
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:52,103
Why are you whining?

35
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:55,311
Just you wait.

36
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,004
I’ll do better.

37
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,460
I’ll make it very special.

38
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,608
Wait for me.

39
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,936
One day, you’ll have your own special moment

40
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:05,296
and I’ll make sure you don’t have to be jealous of anyone again.

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,604
I’ll wait and see.

42
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:44,505
(When I send you this, can you feel and read my mind that I’m missing you?)

43
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:58,308
(I’m missing you too.)

44
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,558
We can’t go further.

45
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:14,502
The car is stuck in the mud.

46
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,100
You got mud stains on you.

47
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:20,804
I’m afraid this is the closest I can drop you off.

48
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:22,800
You can walk a little further.

49
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:23,711
It’s not far.

50
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,065
When you reach the main road, you’ll see your office.

51
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,730
Okay.

52
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,691
Come on!

53
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:36,902
Hurry up!

54
00:04:37,198 --> 00:04:39,202
I heard the new boss is arriving today.

55
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:41,020
From Bangkok?

56
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:41,631
Yes.

57
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:43,137

58
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:43,730
and sit in the air-conditioned room.

59
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,103
The van will park here.

60
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,671
Once you’re done, come stand and wait for the boss here.

61
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:47,937
Excuse me. Hello.

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,463
Are you selling insurance?

63
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:51,642
I don’t want it.

64
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:52,454
I have my lucky charms.

65
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:52,860
Leave.

66
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:55,099
No.

67
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:57,906
I’m not here to sell insurance.

68
00:04:58,225 --> 00:04:59,312
I’m here to work.

69
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:02,180
I have an appointment with Pong.

70
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:03,702
You’re here already.

71
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:06,302
Hello.

72
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,105
Hello.

73
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:09,617
Everyone, come here.

74
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:13,222
This is the new boss.

75
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:15,180
Boss!

76
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:23,008
Hi, everyone.

77
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:24,939
I’m Achi.

78
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,805
I’m a representative from the head office.

79
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:29,739
I’ll be overseeing this branch opening.

80
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:31,407
I’m here as your coworker,

81
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,105
not anyone’s boss.

82
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,607
You all can relax.

83
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:40,337
I’ve been assigned to

84
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:43,306
set up a long-term system

85
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:44,918
to make work easy.

86
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,343
We’ll have documents to fill in everything.

87
00:05:49,377 --> 00:05:50,802
Boss,

88
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:53,085
we’ve always winged it.

89
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,980
We don’t know how to work with documents.

90
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:56,706
That’s right.

91
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:58,077
It’s a waste of time.

92
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,903
Agreed.

93
00:05:59,974 --> 00:06:01,514
But this will help you, Mr…

94
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,205

95
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:03,139
I’m Luang Wee.

96
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:06,817
This will help your work become easier later, Mr. Luang Wee.

97
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,303
Let’s not worry about later, Boss.

98
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:10,106
If we don’t do it today, we make it easy today.

99
00:06:10,263 --> 00:06:11,896
We have loads of work over there.

100
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,312
Let’s get back to work, guys.

101
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:14,208
Come on.

102
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:16,010
That way.

103
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:37,407
(It is now five o’clock, zero minutes, and zero seconds.)

104
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:39,100
Guys!

105
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,611
It’s 5 p.m.

106
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:41,659
Let’s go play football.

107
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,678
Let’s go play football. Let’s go.

108
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:45,502
But guys…

109
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:48,457
We have to practice for the important match.

110
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:51,402
The Employee League Cup tournament is coming soon.

111
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:54,460
We’ll continue working in the morning.

112
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,940
Let’s go, guys.

113
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:01,705
I have to go.

114
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:06,605
(It’s okay.)

115
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:08,860

you can still take care of me.

00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,204
Zero minutes and zero seconds.

188
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:24,937
I’m going home, Boss.

189
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:25,960
I’m off, Boss.

190
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,906
Wait for me.

191
00:11:42,955 --> 00:11:44,804
(There’s no definite way)

192
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:48,414
(but you must try to open your mind.)

193
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:04,811
(Maybe you could start by becoming one of them.)

194
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,515
Excuse me, kids.

195
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:37,749
Can you teach me how to play football?

196
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:52,748
Come eat the candies, guys!

197
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:01,136
Hey, I have more.

198
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,709
Are you ready?

199
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,062
Achi and I always come here when we have bad days.

200
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:37,511
Do you know why?

201
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:42,002
Because the food here is very special.

202
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,225
It helps Achi and I get through our bad days.

203
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:48,000
I want you to feel that way too.

204
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:51,819
So,

205
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:54,004
today I have a special dish to present to you.

206
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:57,503
I guarantee it’ll reignite the fire in your life.

207
00:13:58,106 --> 00:13:58,860
What is it?

208
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,136
Stir-Fire Morning Glory.

209
00:14:14,223 --> 00:14:15,414
Are you ready?

210
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:16,365
Yes.

211
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:17,306
Come on.

212
00:14:18,782 --> 00:14:19,900
Do you think I can do it?

213
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:21,294
You’re talented.

214
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:22,202
You got this.

215
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:25,715
One, two, three.

216
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,712
I really did it.

217
00:14:45,143 --> 00:14:46,051
This is fun.

218
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,908
You’ll find many more fun things every day.

219
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:53,100
As someone who has failed many times before,

220
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,002
I want you to know that your opportunities don’t end here.

221
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,204
We can always start over.

222
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:02,303
One day will be your day, Min.

223
00:15:06,776 --> 00:15:07,900
Thank you so much.

224
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,460
You’re the magical power

225
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:13,506
that always reignites my fire.

226
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:35,407
More opportunities will come

227
00:15:36,491 --> 00:15:39,137
but someone like you can’t be found anywhere else.

228
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,342
So this is how good having a boyfriend is.

229
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:02,342
Hey.

230
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:05,106
They asked me to audition again.

231
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:10,708
Hey.

232
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:14,208
Hey.

233
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:22,604
This is my daughter Kaimook.

234
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,204
She’s 11 years old already.

235
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:27,016
Come on.

236
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:28,192
You’re on your phone all day.

237
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,108
Should I cut off your internet?

238
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:29,936
Relax.

239
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:35,405
It’s great to have a meal with you, Boss.

240
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:37,342
We haven’t talked and gotten to know each other.

241
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,506
You must have a big position.

242
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,407
That’s why they sent you to this branch.

243
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:45,306
I’m not big or anything.

244
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:50,219
I’m an administrative officer.

245
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:53,706
My boss saw that this branch had no one in charge

246
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:55,909
so he sent me here.

247
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:57,906
I knew it.

248
00:16:57,962 --> 00:16:59,004
You look young.

249
00:17:07,622 --> 00:17:09,607
(It’s always like this for branches in the provinces.)

250
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,537
(We’re not important. They think they can just put anyone in charge.)

251
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,709
(That’s why they sent this baby face over. Who knows if he’ll last?)

252
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,500
(Oh, no. I knew they wouldn’t trust me.)

253
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,533
Why would you care about his age and his previous position?

254
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:27,297
Boss Achi is so hard-working.

255
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:30,001
The one who sent him said he’s top-tier from the Bangkok branch.

256
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:31,503
I’m not that good.

257
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:33,407
I know I’m still new to this

258
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:35,939
but I’ll try my best.

259
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:39,302
You came very far to work here.

260
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:40,496
Don’t your kids and wife mind, Boss?

261
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:44,702
Oh, I’m not married.

262
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:48,005
You’re not married, but you’re in a relationship, right?

263
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:53,007
Come on. Can I see the Lady Boss’ photos?

264
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:55,408
I want to see how beautiful she is.

265
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:56,610
Come on.

266
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,968
Hey.

267
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:03,700
Whenever I’m not watching,

268
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:05,604
you’re always watching clips of men flirting with each other.

269
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:07,402
Enough already.

270
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:13,219
(They don’t even trust me with work.)

271
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,659
(What would they think of my relationship with Karan?)

272
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:20,906
Show us, Boss.

273
00:18:21,106 --> 00:18:21,899
We want to see the photos.

274
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:25,299
Sorry.

275
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,174
My phone ran out of battery.

276
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:28,560
Come on.

277
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,706
Why did it have to run out now?

278
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:32,056
I’ll show you later.

279
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:39,259
(Actually, I won’t be here forever.)

280
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,708
(About anything that would make them question me,)

281
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:46,207
(I’m just not going to tell them.)

282
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,008
(That way, we should be more comfortable working with each other.)

283
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,422
The night is still young, Boss.

284
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,622
Come on, Boss. Don’t leave just yet.

285
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:52,561
Come on. Cheers.

286
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:02,010
Amazing.

287
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:19,309
(Hey, Achi.)

288
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:26,103
Sorry I’m late.

289
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,604
(My phone ran out of battery this evening)

290
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:29,302
(and I had to run to dinner with the team.)

291
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:30,614
No worries at all.

292
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,405
You’re busy with work.

293
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:35,605
Shall we change to 8 p.m. instead

294
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,260
so we’re free at the same time?

295
00:19:42,622 --> 00:19:43,401
Okay.

296
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:46,405
You must be sleepy.

297
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:49,262
You should go to sleep.

298
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,899
Good night.

299
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:53,302
Good night.

300
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:06,977
Min.

301
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,605
Just now, I made Madam Noi predict if you’d pass the audition or not.

302
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,010
She chose to eat from the pass bowl.

303
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:16,260
Everything will turn out well.

304
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:17,459
You can be sure of it.

305
00:20:23,696 --> 00:20:24,306
Oh.

306
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:27,005
What happened?

307
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,906
Why aren’t you going to the audition?

308
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,106
[The guy named Min made a lot of mistakes.]

309
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:52,060
[He deserved to fail the first round of audition.]

310
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,139
Look, I don’t want to be disappointed again.

311
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,303
No.

312
00:21:10,017 --> 00:21:11,607
You already got the magical power from me.

313
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:15,499
What if I make a mistake while dancing again?

314
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,208
At least, you’ll have tried.

315
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:20,108
You have to go to the limit.

316
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:23,857
Besides, you already know what mistakes you made

317
00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:26,263
and you have tried to improve in those areas.

318
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:28,807
This is your dream, Min.

319
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,411
You can’t let it go easily

320
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,906
just because you’re worried about something that hasn’t happened.

321
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,309
Do you remember what I told you?

322
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:39,702
One day will be your day.

323
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:43,702
I think it’s today.

324
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:54,019
But will I make it in time?

325
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:55,706
You will.

326
00:21:59,675 --> 00:22:00,311
Come on!

327
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:02,709
Hey.

328
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:04,607
We won’t make it in time.

329
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:05,940
We will.

330
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,105
Your opportunity happens when you grab it.

331
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:22,700
You got this.

332
00:22:32,622 --> 00:22:33,414
I love you.

333
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,902
This got me dying already.

334
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,072
Let’s not think about how to get rid of my power yet.

335
00:22:51,345 --> 00:22:53,506
I will be shocked to death before that happens.

336
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:13,607
Is everything alright?

337
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,820
Why do you all seem worried?

338
00:23:16,072 --> 00:23:19,900
Oh, today is the final match of the Employee League Cup

339
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:21,702
that we have to compete in, Boss.

340
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:22,579
But we can wait.

341
00:23:22,674 --> 00:23:23,890
We know we have to work first.

342
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,804
Yes.

343
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:31,675
Once it’s 5 p.m., you guys have to run

344
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:33,754
or you’ll be too late for the game registration.

345
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,591
Okay.

346
00:23:34,737 --> 00:23:38,472
I guess it’s okay to get off work early today.

347
00:23:39,474 --> 00:23:40,708
Are you serious, Boss?

348
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,906
Let’s go!

349
00:23:51,142 --> 00:23:54,057
(Number 21 is passing the ball to number 11.)

350
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,620
(Number 2 from Toyokawa tried to block him but failed.)

351
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,300
Your dad seems to take this match very seriously, Kaimook.

352
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:01,746
Of course.

353
00:24:01,771 --> 00:24:03,506
He has failed to win for years.

354
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,912
All the employees who went to work at other places have won.

355
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,460
Only my dad hasn’t.

356
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,407
I want him to finally win so he can be happy.

357
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,770
[Toyokawa VS Chor Mon Karn Chang]

358
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,305
(Luang Wee from Toyokawa is following number 15 closely.)

359
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:25,600
(Will he manage to steal the ball?)

360
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,600
(He pushed him down.)

361
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:28,644
(He almost got the ball.)

362
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:29,752
Ugh!

363
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:31,373
We were about to win.

364
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:34,102
(Toyokawa’s opposition gets a penalty kick.)

365
00:24:34,277 --> 00:24:38,400
(Toyokawa is leading Chor Mon Karn Chang 1-0.)

366
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:40,020
(If Chor Mon Karn Chang can score a goal, it’ll be 1-1)

367
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,176
Referee!
(If Chor Mon Karn Chang can score a goal, it’ll be 1-1)

368
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:42,680
(If Chor Mon Karn Chang can score a goal, it’ll be 1-1)

369
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:44,357
(and we’ll need to add extra time.)

370
00:24:44,371 --> 00:24:45,380
Oh my god.

371
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,207
Why does he need to poop now?

372
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,405
It’s a penalty kick.

373
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,419
Who will substitute him?

374
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:01,979
(I’m fully one of them now.)

375
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,607
(Karan, please root for me.)

376
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,217
Boss, put your hands up high.

377
00:25:07,654 --> 00:25:08,586
Just receive the ball, Boss.

378
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:09,502
Just receive the ball.

379
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,946
Yay!

380
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,647
Boss! How did you do it?

381
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:33,508
Of course, I did it.

382
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,407
I wanted to be on your team.

383
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:37,645
Boss Achi, you’re the best!

384
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:52,109
Guys, don’t hold back.

385
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:53,522
Tonight’s on me.

386
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:55,401
Hold on.

387
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:57,342
Can I say something?

388
00:25:57,494 --> 00:25:59,739
From now on, we’re all on the same team.

389
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:01,706
Let’s help each other

390
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,017
and fight for our branch!

391
00:26:05,358 --> 00:26:07,180
Hold on!

392
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:08,219
Boss!

393
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:10,379
Can you drink?

394
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:12,703
Yes, I can.

395
00:26:13,422 --> 00:26:16,379
The Bangkok office also parties very often.

396
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:17,813
Okay.

397
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:18,825
Cheers.

398
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:19,604
Wait!

399
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,804
Is your partner okay with this, Boss?

400
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:27,903
(There’s no definite way)

401
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:29,602
(but you must try to open your mind.)

402
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:33,985
It’s no problem.

403
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:38,020
My partner would be happy that I had a great day with you all.

404
00:26:39,351 --> 00:26:40,005
Here we go.

405
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,506
Kanpai!

406
00:26:42,576 --> 00:26:43,420
Go where?

407
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:47,475
Alright. Let’s go!

408
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:04,906
Boss!

409
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:08,607
If I got this drunk,

410
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,848
my wife would tell me off so much when I got home.

411
00:27:14,047 --> 00:27:15,208
She wouldn’t tell you off.

412
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,808
It’s more likely that she’d be worried.

413
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,663
So has anyone seen photos of Boss’ girlfriend?

414
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:23,400
What does she look like?

415
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,111
No.

416
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,810
Who’s this handsome guy?

417
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:41,885
My name is Karan.

418
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:42,856
I’m…

419
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:48,982
I’m a sales rep from Toyokawa.

420
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,085
I just came to report the sales to Mr. Achi.

421
00:27:57,485 --> 00:27:59,281
I can take him home.

422
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,585
I brought a car.

423
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,042
[I’m so busy today.]

424
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,536
[I might reply late.]

425
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:20,383
(Achi will be surprised to see me today.)

426
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,582
Are you feeling better?

427
00:28:34,628 --> 00:28:35,588
I’m okay now.

428
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:39,583
I shouldn’t have drunk that much.

429
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,183
Is this how you’ve been trying to win everyone’s hearts?

430
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:47,976
Yeah.

431
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,888
Everyone seems to be happy with me now.

432
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:55,377
From now on, I won’t have to worry about this anymore.

433
00:28:58,093 --> 00:29:00,177
I suggested you become one of them

434
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:04,887
but forgot to tell you not to get yourself in trouble.

435
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,687
I’ll be careful next time

436
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:14,388
so you don’t have to worry about me again.

437
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:25,785
While I’m working hard for something else,

438
00:29:26,697 --> 00:29:28,419
I’m failing us.

439
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:33,589
I haven’t been video-calling you on time.

440
00:29:35,949 --> 00:29:37,189
Why is it so hard?

441
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:42,485
Don’t worry, Achi.

442
00:29:45,545 --> 00:29:49,194
Are you the real Karan?

443
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:52,617
Or did the video call get clearer?

444
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:11,487
Is this real enough?

445
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,186
(Achi, I have to go to Songkhla for work.)

446
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:05,484
(After that, I’ll probably fly back to Bangkok.)

447
00:32:05,777 --> 00:32:07,897
(It’s a pity I could only find this much time.)

448
00:32:08,288 --> 00:32:11,983
(Even though it was short, I was so happy to see your face.)

449
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,388
(When we see each other again,)

450
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:18,185
(I’ll hug you to make up for all the lost days.)

451
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:27,285
(By the way, to not make you too tired,)

452
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,891
(we can cancel our promise to call each other at 8 p.m.)

453
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:32,988
(Let’s talk when you’re free.)

454
00:32:34,072 --> 00:32:36,386
(I know you have to spend time on many things.)

455
00:32:37,114 --> 00:32:39,482
(There’s so much more in life to put your effort in.)

456
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:46,881
(I know you’re worried about me, Karan.)

457
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:51,986
(But after moving here, I found many special things.)

458
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,497
Hit the brake!

459
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,885
(It’s a journey out of my comfort zone)

460
00:33:15,106 --> 00:33:19,588
(to learn that there are many other safe places I can find.)

461
00:33:20,188 --> 00:33:22,385
(Staying apart makes me realize)

462
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,885
(that I’m gradually growing because of your care.)

463
00:33:26,611 --> 00:33:31,819
(It also makes me realize how much I love you.)

464
00:33:32,355 --> 00:33:35,488
(Even though we’re watching the sunset alone from different places,)

465
00:33:37,094 --> 00:33:41,789
(it’s good to know someone else is watching it with us.)

466
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:44,019
(I miss you.)

467
00:34:00,785 --> 00:34:02,220
Excuse me.

468
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,487
Is Mr. Achi here?

469
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:07,650
Oh, Boss Achi is…

470
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,454
Achi.

471
00:34:24,853 --> 00:34:25,657
How are you feeling?

472
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:30,555
I’m sorry.

473
00:34:32,086 --> 00:34:35,057
I tried to balance everything like you suggested

474
00:34:36,386 --> 00:34:39,161
but I guess I’m really weak.

475
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:41,850
You don’t have to apologize, Achi.

476
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,860
I know you want to do your best in everything.

477
00:34:47,423 --> 00:34:50,459
I’m just sad that we have to stay apart

478
00:34:51,229 --> 00:34:54,152
because I won’t know what happens to you.

479
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:12,585
It’s okay.

480
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:14,551
It won’t be long now.

481
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,936
Hey, Mr. Sales Rep.

482
00:35:17,102 --> 00:35:18,354
What brings you here?

483
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:31,650
(If you’re not ready to talk about anything, don’t do it.)

484
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:36,158
(I don’t care about anything except your peace of mind.)

485
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,250
My peace of mind?

486
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:57,740
Guys,

487
00:36:02,557 --> 00:36:06,453
not only is Karan a sales supervisor at my office,

488
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,742
but he’s also my lover.

489
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:23,749
This is my partner whom I want to introduce to you all.

490
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:31,053
Oh.

491
00:36:46,191 --> 00:36:47,228
Really?

492
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:49,556
Why didn’t you tell us from the beginning?

493
00:36:49,948 --> 00:36:52,955
I asked about your partner

494
00:36:52,956 --> 00:36:55,047
so I could call him if anything happened.

495
00:36:56,971 --> 00:36:58,146
We were worried.

496
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,557
What a relief.

497
00:37:01,797 --> 00:37:03,151
I thought you were the boss.

498
00:37:03,266 --> 00:37:05,450
If I had known this,

499
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,386
I would have invited you to drink with us the other day.

500
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:11,114
You must be feeling better, Boss.

501
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:12,646
Your boyfriend is here now.

502
00:37:12,756 --> 00:37:14,549
Or are you going to keep asking him for tender loving care?

503
00:37:14,757 --> 00:37:17,446
It looks like he’s going to keep doing that.

504
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:18,505
Don’t tease him.

505
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:23,051
I was so worried,

506
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,254
you know?

507
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,456
Hmm?

508
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:28,103
I was worried.

509
00:37:30,434 --> 00:37:31,259
Thank you so much.

510
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,542
No worries.

511
00:37:33,146 --> 00:37:34,653
You can continue being lovey-dovey with each other.

512
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:35,752
We’re leaving.

513
00:37:48,486 --> 00:37:53,647
[Can you please come to the rooftop, Pai?]

514
00:37:54,102 --> 00:37:57,263
[Please also pick up the stuff we’re going to test from the 22nd floor.]

515
00:37:57,644 --> 00:37:59,755
(I left it near the fire stairs.)

516
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:22,357
(I’ve known you for almost a year.)

517
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:29,555
(The first time I noticed how cool you were was at the outing.)

518
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:31,251
Okay?

519
00:38:31,297 --> 00:38:35,468
(At that time, I didn’t see you as just a boss anymore.)

520
00:38:43,794 --> 00:38:46,545
My happiness is bacon.

521
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:47,368
Bacon!

522
00:38:47,557 --> 00:38:48,251
Bacon!

523
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:49,265
Bacon!

524
00:39:06,797 --> 00:39:08,752
(That day when you comforted me,)

525
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:12,648
(I knew right away I wanted to be)

526
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:14,906
(the one you love.)

527
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:19,148
I believe you’ll be successful one day

528
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,933
because I’ll always support you.

529
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,955
Oh, Rock.

530
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:28,253
You’re just…

531
00:39:28,912 --> 00:39:30,854
No wonder you’ve been acting weird lately.

532
00:39:50,966 --> 00:39:52,816
[I have something to ask you.]

533
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:08,054
What are you going to ask me?

534
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:18,309
I want to ask

535
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:22,503
if you’re open to seeing someone like me.

536
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,851
Someone who may seem like a loser

537
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:32,022
but is trying to do everything to improve himself

538
00:40:33,672 --> 00:40:35,247
and become someone you can love.

539
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,666
Did you buy this?

540
00:40:42,844 --> 00:40:44,703
I kept throwing darts at the balloons until I won it.

541
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:51,066
Thank you so much

542
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:52,848
for doing this for me.

543
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:58,358
Never in my life has anyone done anything good like this for me.

544
00:41:01,023 --> 00:41:06,354
I know doing this might make you shocked

545
00:41:08,148 --> 00:41:09,053
and hesitate

546
00:41:12,998 --> 00:41:13,897
but I get it

547
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,942
because we both have been disappointed by love before.

548
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:21,254
Starting over with someone new

549
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:24,351
is probably not as easy for us as for the others

550
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,152
but I can wait for you.

551
00:41:30,231 --> 00:41:32,051
I’ll give you time to think about it

552
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:34,746
before you tell me

553
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:42,651
if you’re willing to open up and give me a chance to date you.

554
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,653
I’ll wait.

555
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:03,051
They’re gone.

556
00:42:03,475 --> 00:42:04,451
What a pity.

557
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:05,654
Don’t be sorry.

558
00:42:06,813 --> 00:42:07,551
Here.

559
00:42:08,728 --> 00:42:09,948
You have both the bear and me.

560
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:12,348
Can I have the bear only?

561
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:13,946
You must help me carry it.

562
00:42:15,706 --> 00:42:16,650
You’re overreacting.

563
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
It’s heavy.

564
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:20,946
This ship!

565
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:23,752
Not as heavy.

566
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,754
Oh.

567
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:35,266
So you’ve been working hard to save up your vacation days.

568
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:38,551
I’d rather get tired once

569
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,751
but get to see something like this with you.

570
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:44,306
We’d never been to the beach together.

571
00:42:57,481 --> 00:42:59,106
Next week, you’re going back already.

572
00:42:59,779 --> 00:43:01,454
I’ve planned a welcome back for you.

573
00:43:03,363 --> 00:43:04,647
Just don’t get tired of me yet.

574
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:06,648
I won’t.

575
00:43:07,182 --> 00:43:09,460
Dating you is exciting all the time.

576
00:43:10,444 --> 00:43:12,244
I have to hold my breath for when you’ll faint.

577
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:13,742
Wow.

578
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,549
I won’t be weak anymore.

579
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:19,548
I’ll go back as the new Achi.

580
00:43:20,123 --> 00:43:21,554
I can do many things by myself now.

581
00:43:21,776 --> 00:43:25,266
I’ll take care of you for a change.

582
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,446
Really?

583
00:43:28,423 --> 00:43:29,456
Do we have to wait until you get back?

584
00:43:30,647 --> 00:43:31,706
Can you do it now?

585
00:43:36,806 --> 00:43:37,951
Here.

586
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:39,551
We’re watching the sunset together.

587
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:43,352
I don’t want to see the sunset anymore.

588
00:43:45,148 --> 00:43:46,533
I’d rather see your face.

589
00:43:56,715 --> 00:43:58,650
This is the first time since we’ve known each other

590
00:43:59,465 --> 00:44:01,151
that we’re on a trip with just the two of us

591
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:08,022
Being in a nice atmosphere without having to worry about anything.

592
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,155
There’s nothing to worry about.

593
00:44:12,552 --> 00:44:13,349
There’s only us.

594
00:44:17,982 --> 00:44:20,029
Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for this opportunity?

595
00:44:29,404 --> 00:44:31,346
I used to only be able to watch you from afar

596
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:40,751
but now everything for me is like a dream

597
00:44:43,856 --> 00:44:46,583
when I have you right in front of me.

598
00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:52,160
Karan.

599
00:46:53,629 --> 00:46:54,351
Hold on.

600
00:46:57,844 --> 00:47:00,623
The voice inside your head is so loud.

601
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:04,355
Don’t worry.

602
00:47:06,254 --> 00:47:08,157
Soon you won’t be able to read my mind anymore.

603
00:48:07,053 --> 00:48:08,054
I love you, Achi.

604
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:44,158
What?

605
00:48:49,534 --> 00:48:50,746
Do you regret losing your power?

606
00:48:53,591 --> 00:48:55,555
I’d regret not loving you.

607
00:49:17,551 --> 00:49:19,853
(I probably don’t need to read Karan’s mind anymore)

608
00:49:21,497 --> 00:49:25,346
(because he has done everything to show it to me.)

609
00:49:26,853 --> 00:49:29,253
(Goodbye my magical power.)

610
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:43,869
Karan, do you want to go to Lamphun with me for New Year’s?

611
00:49:43,928 --> 00:49:46,451
Achi has never brought anyone home.

612
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,552
Dad. Mom.

613
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:49,460
Achi is my lover.

614
00:49:49,494 --> 00:49:51,253
Karan and I are dating.

615
00:49:51,736 --> 00:49:54,518
It’s time both of you let go of something

616
00:49:54,531 --> 00:49:55,909
for my brother’s happiness.

617
00:49:57,174 --> 00:49:57,951
Cute.

618
00:49:58,733 --> 00:49:59,450
Achi,

619
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:01,357
can I ask you something?

620
00:50:05,206 --> 00:50:14,576
[Thank you, Karan, for being both my smile and energy.]
