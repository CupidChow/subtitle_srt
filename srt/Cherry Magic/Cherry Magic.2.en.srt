Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:20,023
(There’s a belief that if you’re still a virgin at 30, you’ll gain a magical power.)

5
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:22,297
(I'm still a virgin at 30.)

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,073
(I’m going to pray this evening. I must find a man this year.)

7
00:00:24,073 --> 00:00:25,624
(I hate Mondays.)

8
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:27,028
What the hell is going on?

9
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:27,956
Is something wrong?

10
00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:29,118
You look stressed when it’s only morning.

11
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:32,220
(Achi looks even cuter up close.)

12
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:33,727
(This is going to be a good day.)

13
00:00:33,727 --> 00:00:35,527
(I get to be near my crush so early in the morning.)

14
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:39,035
I have a magical power to read people’s minds by touching them.

15
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:41,798
I heard that the most perfect guy in my office happens to have a crush on me.

16
00:00:41,798 --> 00:00:42,595
You have a magical power?

17
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:43,777
That sounds delusional.

18
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:46,875
(Achi must be so tired and will have trouble getting home.)

19
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,282
If you don’t want problems,

20
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,725
don’t lead him on.

21
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:52,083
Do you want to stay at my condo tonight?

22
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:54,317
(I tried not to lead him on.)

23
00:00:54,317 --> 00:00:56,891
(But now I’m staying over at Karan’s condo?)

24
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,361
(What should I do?)

25
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:02,050
(Shit. How did we get here?)

26
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:06,131
(Am I really going to stay over at Karan’s place?)

27
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,489
(Did I make the right decision?)

28
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:12,060
(I’m getting scared now.)

29
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,040
Achi, please come in.

30
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:22,184
(Wait! What about Karan’s imagination?)

31
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,161
(Could it be that…)

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,600
(Karan is really thinking of doing something to me?)

33
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:30,762
Achi?

34
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:36,630
(Come on. I’ve come all the way here.)

35
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:39,012
(I have my mind reading power.)

36
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,296
(It should come in handy.)

37
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:54,029
Sorry.

38
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:55,244
My room is a little messy.

39
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,622
You call this messy?

40
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:01,868
Please have a seat, Achi.

41
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:05,401
Get comfortable. Make yourself at home.

42
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:06,757
Okay.

43
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,587
(Wow. This place is nothing less than I would expect from Karan.)

44
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:17,596
(The decorations are all so stylish.)

45
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:20,880
(A good-looking home just like its owner.)

46
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:22,422
(Eh?)

47
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:25,533
Sorry. I forgot to put that away.

48
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:31,432
(Oh, no. I shouldn’t have let Achi see)

49
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:33,054
(that I’m secretly reading a manga.)

50
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,760
You read The Devil's Sword too?

51
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:45,000
I actually love the story so much.

52
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,055
The new villain is cool.

53
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:48,777
Yes.

54
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,620
Especially in his introduction scene

55
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,897
when he bombs the male lead’s soldier camp

56
00:03:52,897 --> 00:03:54,011
and turns to say,

57
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,560
“The only one who can beat me…”

58
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:56,858
“...is me.”

59
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:01,760
How strange.

60
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:02,388
Hmm?

61
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:05,254
Nothing.

62
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:12,000
How strange that a perfect guy like Karan likes some similar things as me.

63
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:13,230
It’s late.

64
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,963
You can go take a shower first.

65
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,361
Here’s your pajamas.

66
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:23,346
Thank you.

67
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,681
(Finally, this day has come.)

68
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:28,181
Hmm?

69
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:31,520
(I’ll see Achi wear the pajamas I specifically bought for him.)

70
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,423
(I bought and kept them because I think they’d really suit him.)

71
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:37,759
(Wait.)

72
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:40,880
(This is getting bad.)

73
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,261
Don’t forget to wear them.

74
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:45,301
Mm.

75
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:49,646
(No.)

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,288
(I don’t want to wear them.)

77
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:55,855
(But I can’t wear my work outfit to sleep.)

78
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,022
(They fit perfectly.)

79
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:12,055
You look good in those pajamas.

80
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:21,243
Here’s an eye mask.

81
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:22,746
My curtains don’t block light.

82
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:24,760
This will help you sleep more comfortably.

83
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:26,967
Thank you.

84
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:32,080
(Not just look good. He looks super cute.)

85
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:35,560
(Achi looks great in anything.)

86
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,228
(Anyway, would he be able to tell that the embroidered doodle on his shirt)

87
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,112
(represents the mole behind his neck?)

88
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:46,925
Really?

89
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:48,298
What?

90
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,382
Nothing.

91
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,390
You should go take a shower.

92
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,959
It’s late.

93
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:55,902
Okay.

94
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:05,664
(What the heck? I thought my mind-reading power would help.)

95
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:08,294
(But the more I read his mind, the more stressed I become.)

96
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:11,128
(In a desperate situation like this,)

97
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:14,755
(I think I need to use my deadly move.)

98
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:18,320
(Pretending to be asleep is my deadly move.)

99
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:21,603
(Now I don’t have to feel uncomfortable interacting with him.)

100
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:41,884
(Achi’s face looks so cute while sleeping.)

101
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:44,523
(I want to stare at it for the rest of my life.)

102
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:47,296
(Hold on. Are you serious right now?)

103
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:49,176
(Should I do something?)

104
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,557
(What are you going to do now?)

105
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:52,079
(No, I shouldn’t.)

106
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:55,119
(If Achi caught me, would he hate me?)

107
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,311
(What are you thinking about doing? It must be something bad.)

108
00:06:57,702 --> 00:07:01,042
(But if I don’t do it now, I won’t have another chance.)

109
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:04,309
(When would he ever sleep near me again?)

110
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:07,800
(Come on. He won’t know.)

111
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:17,897
(Hey. Are you going to kiss me?)

112
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:28,083
Do not touch.

113
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:30,996
Allow me to break the rule.

114
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:41,776
(Don’t do it. If you kiss me, I’ll seriously punch you.)

115
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:45,408
(What should I do?)

116
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:48,830
Good night, Achi.

117
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:20,466
He just said good night?

118
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:22,367
What a relief.

119
00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:29,091
But why is my heart beating fast?

120
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:42,632
And is this really supposed to represent my ear?

121
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:47,676
What is Karan thinking?

122
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:26,419
Good morning, Achi.

123
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:27,762
Are you hungry?

124
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,726
Is that congee?

125
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:31,572
So smart.

126
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:32,974
Even when your eyes are closed.

127
00:09:33,713 --> 00:09:35,798
My eyes were closed, but not my nose.

128
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:40,200
Why don’t you go wash your face and join me for breakfast?

129
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,596
(He’s handsome. He has a sweet smile. He can cook.)

130
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,338
(What a totally perfect man he is.)

131
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:50,822
(This world is really not fair.)

132
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,419
This is so good.

133
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:56,378
Really?

134
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:00,775
The texture is so smooth like congee from famous shops.

135
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:02,253
You’re exaggerating.

136
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:05,693
You can have a soft-boiled egg too.

137
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:11,821
Oh, that’s an onsen egg.

138
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:13,613
I like this type of egg best.

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,662
Really?

140
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,252
How lucky.

141
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:25,438
(Achi really likes this type of egg.)

142
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,852
(All that time I spent practicing making it is worth it.)

143
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:30,671
(What? You practiced making it for me?)

144
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:49,851
You got something on your mouth.

145
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:04,462
(This is the first time in my life someone has done so much for me.)

146
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:09,091
(So being loved actually feels this good.)

147
00:11:10,645 --> 00:11:13,389
(Karan having feelings for me is not a bad thing at all.)

148
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:16,560
(Should I let this continue?)

149
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:33,132
Achi.

150
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:33,801
Hmm?

151
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:35,308
Do you want to change your tie?

152
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,427
I brought a spare one for you.

153
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:40,293
This way others won’t notice you’re wearing the same one from yesterday.

154
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:42,369
Thank you.

155
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:47,400
Come on. Let me help you.

156
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:52,948
Excuse me.

157
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:05,555
(Will others notice that I’m wearing the same tie as Achi’s?)

158
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:10,174
(They probably won’t.)

159
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:13,325
(I just want to have a matching couple outfits moment.)

160
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:15,655
(Wait. You planned this?)

161
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:19,947
Done.

162
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:25,512
Oh my god.

163
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:26,830
Hi.

164
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,120
Wait.

165
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:31,947
You guys are wearing the same tie.

166
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:33,191
Did you plan it?

167
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,109
If I didn’t know, I’d think you’re together.

168
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:35,846
No.

169
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:37,044
We’re not.

170
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:38,111
Nothing is going on.

171
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:39,513
Right, Karan?

172
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:41,383
He’s right.

173
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:42,666
We’re not.

174
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:46,097
I was only joking

175
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:50,488
but seeing how much you try to deny it got me curious now.

176
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:52,425
Why are you panicking so much?

177
00:12:53,177 --> 00:12:53,747
Huh?

178
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:55,830
Oh, hey, Rock.

179
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:56,650
There you are.

180
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,308
Come here.

181
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:57,808
Hi.

182
00:12:57,808 --> 00:13:01,343
Do you think wearing matching ties makes them look like lovers?

183
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,040
Lovers?

184
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,572
Yeah.

185
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:06,072
Lovers?

186
00:13:06,072 --> 00:13:06,572
Hey.

187
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,227
Lovers!

188
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:08,266
Lovers!

189
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:09,395
Rock!

190
00:13:11,518 --> 00:13:14,231
I think something is definitely going on in this office.

191
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:23,687
I’m helping you right now.

192
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:27,097
I understand urgent things can come up.

193
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:28,990
That’s why I’m asking you

194
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,320
what was so urgent that you had to leave Achi work alone last night.

195
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:43,244
If you don’t answer, I can’t help you.

196
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:46,099
And I must report this to Mr. Tanaka.

197
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:50,816
You know that will affect your probation, don’t you?

198
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:51,690
Pai.

199
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:53,646
Achi.

200
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:55,414
Please don’t scold Rock.

201
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:57,835
He didn’t throw his work at me.

202
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:05,703
I was already staying late last night, so I offered to help him.

203
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:10,612
Achi, don’t take the blame for Rock.

204
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:14,522
The owner must take responsibility for his work.

205
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,413
If he can’t take responsibility for something as small as this,

206
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:18,077
he probably can’t take responsibility for other things either.

207
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:18,938
But…

208
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:19,880
It’s alright, Achi.

209
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:23,561
It’s really my fault.

210
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:30,036
(I really shouldn’t have gone last night.)

211
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,474
(If I hadn’t, everything wouldn’t be ruined like this.)

212
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:38,446
If nothing else,

213
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:41,715
please excuse me.

214
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:07,558
Drink this to feel better.

215
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,188
Thank you.

216
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:20,734
You stayed to cover for me last night

217
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,828
and also defended me.

218
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:27,072
Don’t worry too much.

219
00:15:28,206 --> 00:15:30,640
Something has been bothering you lately, hasn’t it?

220
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:40,250
I might not know many things, but I can see you’re not okay.

221
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:45,894
If you have something on your mind, you can tell me.

222
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:50,754
I might not be able to give you much advice,

223
00:15:52,046 --> 00:15:54,253
but I know someone who has great advice.

224
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:00,642
Senior.

225
00:16:04,193 --> 00:16:05,271
Here we go.

226
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:14,120
I met up with my partner last night.

227
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:18,063
(Oh no. I’m not good at giving anyone advice.)

228
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:21,910
(Especially on love. I have 0 skills.)

229
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,510
But she came to break up with me.

230
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,078
She said she never loved me.

231
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:34,172
She just liked being loved.

232
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:37,300
She just liked being treated well by someone.

233
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:43,020
Liked being treated well by someone?

234
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,550
I feel so bad.

235
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,360
She could’ve told me she didn’t love me.

236
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,240
Instead, she used me.

237
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,281
She must think I’m stupid, right?

238
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:01,810
Yes.

239
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:04,033
You also think I’m stupid?

240
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:05,437
Hey.

241
00:17:05,437 --> 00:17:06,542
Do I look that stupid?

242
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:07,247
No, Rock.

243
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:08,317
Do I look so easy to fool?

244
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:09,057
No.

245
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:10,294
I’ve been so stupid, right?

246
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:11,508
No. I mean…

247
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:12,503
I’m so stupid, right?

248
00:17:12,503 --> 00:17:13,269
No, Rock.

249
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:14,260
I was thinking of other things.

250
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:30,280
I offered to lend Rock an ear, but now I have my own worry.

251
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:41,622
(He was used just like I was in my university days.)

252
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:45,425
(And I’m doing the same thing to Karan, aren’t I?)

253
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:51,761
Achi.

254
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:54,104
Are you busy?

255
00:17:57,886 --> 00:17:58,849
Is everything alright?

256
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:01,521
I brought you mosquito repellent spray.

257
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:04,198
I thought you might need it on the outing trip this Saturday.

258
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,255
No, I don’t want to trouble you.

259
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,213
You’re not troubling me at all.

260
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,658
The client gave me an extra bottle.

261
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:12,873
I have many already.

262
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:16,105
Alright then. Thank you.

263
00:18:21,705 --> 00:18:24,983
(I lied again. Actually, I didn’t get this from the client.)

264
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,868
(I intended to buy it for Achi.)

265
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,366
(It’s something he will need.)

266
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:32,552
Oh?

267
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:35,173
You don’t want it?

268
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:37,541
Well…

269
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:44,552
(Well, it feels like I’m taking advantage of Karan’s feelings.)

270
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:46,364
(I don’t like myself like this at all.)

271
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:47,040
Achi.

272
00:18:50,114 --> 00:18:51,051
May I have a word with you?

273
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:52,726
Yes, Boss.

274
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,200
Please excuse me.

275
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,874
I heard that you stayed and covered for Rock last night.

276
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:09,459
That’s so kind of you to help him.

277
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:12,007
Well,

278
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:15,837
I didn’t do it alone.

279
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:18,035
Karan also stayed and helped.

280
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:19,570
Is that so?

281
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,943
I was going to reward you.

282
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:25,032
I have this restaurant voucher.

283
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,461
Excuse me, Boss.

284
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,319
Here’s our sales for this month.

285
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:34,098
There you are.

286
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:37,080
Achi was telling me you stayed and helped him work last night.

287
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:43,000
I’ll let Achi take you out for a meal as a thank you.

288
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:46,204
Are you sure?

289
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:47,234
It’s no big deal.

290
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,449
Go and enjoy it.

291
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:50,191
It’s my thank-you gift to you.

292
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:55,560
Take Karan out for a meal.

293
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,671
(Ugh!)

294
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:05,019
(How did things turn out this way?)

295
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:11,414
(I tried hard to keep my distance, but now I ended up with this new problem.)

296
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:15,647
How is it going?

297
00:20:16,512 --> 00:20:17,975
Have you decided when you want to go for the meal?

298
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:22,011
Not yet.

299
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:25,439
I can go any day.

300
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,085
Please choose the day that works for you.

301
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:30,266
I just looked it up.

302
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:32,871
There’s a dessert shop near the restaurant we’re going to.

303
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:35,608
Do you want to get ice cream after the meal?

304
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:39,447
It has great reviews. Look.

305
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,505
(I can’t believe I’m going on a meal date with Achi.)

306
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:48,731
(I hope it brings us closer.)

307
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:52,053
(I want our relationship to progress already.)

308
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,264
Karan.

309
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,269
Hmm?

310
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:04,419
You can have this voucher.

311
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:05,961
Go with anyone you’d like.

312
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:07,721
Why?

313
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:09,289
I don’t think I can make it.

314
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:10,361
Please excuse me.

315
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:16,721
[Success]

316
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:22,314
I’m blank!

317
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,137
Why is writing a romance novel when I’ve never been in love so hard?

318
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:29,282
Right, Madam Noi?

319
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,130
Have you ever been in love?

320
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,371
Can you tell your papa?

321
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:36,379
Have you ever been in love?

322
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,492
Help your papa write his novel, please.

323
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,398
I have a delivery for you.

324
00:21:46,322 --> 00:21:48,937
(Many teenagers are working as delivery guys these days.)

325
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:53,810
(Good. This way, they won’t become troublemakers.)

326
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,327
Wait.

327
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:58,211
This is not for my room.

328
00:21:58,658 --> 00:22:00,658
This is for 131/16.

329
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:03,096
My room is 131/61.

330
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,297
Sorry.

331
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:07,992
They look similar.

332
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:09,674
You must be new.

333
00:22:10,214 --> 00:22:11,817
Be careful next time.

334
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:13,203
Sorry.

335
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,762
Wait.

336
00:22:17,574 --> 00:22:19,142
Another warning.

337
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:22,161
Don’t forget to take off your helmet when delivering stuff inside the building.

338
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:24,833
Coming into someone else’s place like this looks suspicious

339
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,135
and quite rude.

340
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:31,961
But I get that kids these days don’t know about these things.

341
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,818
I must apologize

342
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,351
but I’m not a kid.

343
00:22:45,993 --> 00:22:47,323
I’m of age.

344
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:50,105
I was in a hurry to deliver things to the next place.

345
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:53,781
I didn’t even have time to take a break and eat or take off my helmet.

346
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:58,101
But I get that adults these days don’t understand these things.

347
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:12,883
Did I just get insulted?

348
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,399
[Achi]

349
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:19,740
Hello.

350
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,517
What’s up, Achi?

351
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:22,352
Excuse me.

352
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:22,852
Yeah?

353
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:25,512
Can I order this water mimosa and shrimp dish but with morning glory instead?

354
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:27,786
Sure.

355
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:28,764
Cool.

356
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:33,696
Why don’t you try to eat what’s on the menu?

357
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,656
That’d be so boring.

358
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,271
Anyway, why did you want to see me?

359
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:41,763
Same problem.

360
00:23:42,648 --> 00:23:45,841
Remember I told you that someone has a crush on me?

361
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,408
I don’t know how to act.

362
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:49,241
I actually feel good

363
00:23:49,392 --> 00:23:51,841
but the better he treats me, the more guilty I feel.

364
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,307
It’s like I’m exploiting his feelings for me.

365
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:58,001
When I read his mind, I hate myself so much that I don’t want to see his face.

366
00:23:58,293 --> 00:24:00,660
Sometimes, I wonder if I should quit my job.

367
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:02,269
Quitting is a good idea.

368
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,241
I think you’ve been working too hard.

369
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:08,302
So you still think you can read minds?

370
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,685
You might want to see a doctor.

371
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:13,335
I’m not delusional.

372
00:24:13,443 --> 00:24:14,816
Someone really has a crush on me.

373
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,129
I don’t know how to act anymore.

374
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,626
So, someone has a secret crush on you, right?

375
00:24:23,986 --> 00:24:25,801
Do you like him too?

376
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:27,363
Are you crazy?

377
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,007
How can I like him?

378
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:31,796
I’ve never been in love in my life.

379
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:33,566
I don’t even know what love is.

380
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:34,531
Then it’s easy.

381
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:35,763
Act the same.

382
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,441
Keep your distance.

383
00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:39,556
I have.

384
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:43,142
But I feel like I’m being mean

385
00:24:43,142 --> 00:24:44,400
when he’s good to me.

386
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:48,193
Keep an appropriate distance.

387
00:24:48,193 --> 00:24:50,331
Make it clear he’s just your colleague.

388
00:24:50,378 --> 00:24:52,551
Not too much. Not too little.

389
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:54,113
No personal matters.

390
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:57,001
So he won’t think you’re leading him on.

391
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:59,809
Also, please go see a doctor when you have free time.

392
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:00,895
Your friend here is worried about you.

393
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:04,088
Here you go.

394
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,105
Fried water mimosa and morning glory.

395
00:25:09,526 --> 00:25:10,726
Wait.

396
00:25:11,828 --> 00:25:12,598
Enjoy.

397
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:17,401
I told you to order what’s on the menu.

398
00:25:18,924 --> 00:25:20,011
You can pack it home.

399
00:25:22,173 --> 00:25:22,956
Bye now.

400
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:23,630
See you next time.

401
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,197
Bye.

402
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:26,296
See you, buddy.

403
00:25:26,555 --> 00:25:27,127
I’m off now.

404
00:25:27,257 --> 00:25:28,070
Wait.

405
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,789
Hmm?

406
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:31,983
What’s this?

407
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:35,311
You’ll see when you open it.

408
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:54,391
[Happy birthday to the soon-to-be world's number one writer.]

409
00:25:54,717 --> 00:25:58,881
[Wishing you a very happy birthday this year. - Achi]

410
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:03,184
I thought you didn’t remember.

411
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,540
I have a delivery for you.

412
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:35,770
(This kid again.)

413
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:42,485
Please sign to receive it.

414
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:47,280
(Ugh. I’m so unlucky)

415
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:49,523
(I have to make a delivery for this 61 uncle.)

416
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:50,694
Who are you calling uncle?

417
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:53,635
I didn’t say anything.

418
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:04,665
(He seems weird.)

419
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,326
(Probably from being alone too much.)

420
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:07,712
What did you say?

421
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:10,539
I didn’t say anything.

422
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:15,045
(I’m screwed. Why do I have to deliver stuff to this crazy man’s home?)

423
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:26,311
(What? Is he a psycho?)

424
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:29,141
Please excuse me.

425
00:27:38,697 --> 00:27:39,341
This can’t be true.

426
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:44,221
I have a magical power to read people’s minds by touching them.

427
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,297
No way.

428
00:27:58,774 --> 00:28:00,641
(Leave me alone, hooman. Go away!)

429
00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:05,361
So I really can read minds?

430
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:09,521
No!

431
00:28:16,715 --> 00:28:18,715
Oh, hey, Karan.

432
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:20,951
Have you got your seat?

433
00:28:21,427 --> 00:28:22,227
Do you want to join us?

434
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:24,224
Thank you.

435
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:27,264
Can I have one of those?

436
00:28:27,893 --> 00:28:29,655
Eat your own food.

437
00:28:29,655 --> 00:28:30,488
You’re both old and stingy.

438
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:31,021
Hey!

439
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:31,731
Just kidding.

440
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:32,953
Sorry.

441
00:28:33,607 --> 00:28:34,461
Can I have one?

442
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:42,709
(Act like a colleague.)

443
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:43,781
You like Pad See Ew?

444
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,041
Uh, yes.

445
00:28:49,173 --> 00:28:51,584
But you know what I like more than Pad See Ew?

446
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:53,659
It’s…

447
00:28:56,717 --> 00:28:58,912
It’s the marketing plan for the latest quarter.

448
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:00,642
I think it’s so cool.

449
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:02,678
Especially the target analysis.

450
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:04,114
It’s very detailed.

451
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,985
What’s wrong with you?

452
00:29:06,263 --> 00:29:08,004
Why are you suddenly talking about work?

453
00:29:08,643 --> 00:29:10,924
What? Do you want to win Employee of the Year?

454
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,121
Let’s change the topic.

455
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:16,105
What about you, Karan?

456
00:29:16,962 --> 00:29:17,735
What’s your preference?

457
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:20,021
Not the food.

458
00:29:20,283 --> 00:29:21,961
I mean your type.

459
00:29:23,957 --> 00:29:24,660
What’s wrong with you, Rock?

460
00:29:27,943 --> 00:29:28,819
My type?

461
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:32,084
I think the type of product spec that just came in is too high.

462
00:29:32,222 --> 00:29:35,800
If we downgrade it a little, we should be able to reduce a lot of costs.

463
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,529
What’s wrong with Achi?

464
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,970
Is he going to take the CEO qualification exam?

465
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:46,132
No idea.

466
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:47,206
He’s acting weird.

467
00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:53,514
Achi.

468
00:29:53,838 --> 00:29:54,640
- Yes?
- I’m leaving now.

469
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:55,973
Bye.

470
00:30:02,393 --> 00:30:03,648
(Is Karan leaving already?)

471
00:30:05,165 --> 00:30:07,705
(Good. I won’t have to feel uncomfortable now.)

472
00:30:14,082 --> 00:30:18,027
(If he’s still here, he’d be helping me pick these documents up.)

473
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:24,764
(Honestly, he helps me with work, he’s kind, and he can give me advice.)

474
00:30:25,187 --> 00:30:28,614
(Why would I panic about having a good colleague like him?)

475
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:38,920
(It’s bad of me to act like that.)

476
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:45,341
(Even though I know he has a crush on me, he doesn’t make it obvious.)

477
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:46,418
Achi.

478
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:50,533
You look stressed today.

479
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:52,312
I’ve noticed since the afternoon.

480
00:30:54,624 --> 00:30:56,624
A little.

481
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:01,045
Do you have to hurry home?

482
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:03,975
Can I ask you for more advice about work?

483
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:09,527
(There. I’m so glad Karan sees me as a colleague.)

484
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:12,632
About work?

485
00:31:13,194 --> 00:31:13,841
Sure.

486
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:15,384
I’m glad you’re free.

487
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,815
Let’s go eat Yakiniku.

488
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:19,428
I just called and booked us a table.

489
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:20,143
(What?)

490
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,237
(I thought this was about work.)

491
00:31:21,961 --> 00:31:22,780
To discuss work.

492
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:29,619
(Gosh, I make mistakes so easily.)

493
00:31:43,474 --> 00:31:45,814
(So lucky I decided to book a table.)

494
00:31:45,814 --> 00:31:49,690
(I’m now eating alone with Achi. I’m not dreaming, am I?)

495
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:53,450
(Ouch! I’m really not dreaming!)

496
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:55,770
(Are you really that serious?)

497
00:31:58,061 --> 00:31:58,860
Karan.

498
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:01,810
What is it about work that you want to talk about?

499
00:32:05,535 --> 00:32:06,945
I noticed that you look tired

500
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:12,650
and Mr. Tanaka once said taking a break from work is a part of work too.

501
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,916
(Unbelievable.)

502
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,539
(Karan is so good at convincing.)

503
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:21,394
Well,

504
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,690
I suppose you’d feel bad about not using Mr. Tanaka’s voucher, right?

505
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,720
If we didn’t use it, it’d probably look bad.

506
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:32,849
That’s part of it.

507
00:32:33,643 --> 00:32:36,037
Actually, I just want you to try this restaurant

508
00:32:36,804 --> 00:32:37,993
because, for me,

509
00:32:40,352 --> 00:32:41,690
Yakiniku will heal everything.

510
00:32:44,684 --> 00:32:45,435
(Oh.)

511
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:49,862
(Will Achi think I made up an excuse about work to ask him out for a meal?)

512
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,981
(What can I do? The voucher expires today.)

513
00:32:53,268 --> 00:32:54,882
(I was afraid I wouldn’t have any more excuses.)

514
00:32:54,882 --> 00:32:55,560
(What?)

515
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:00,275
It’s okay, Karan.

516
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:01,180
I’ll pick it up.

517
00:33:01,578 --> 00:33:02,614
You better watch the meat and keep it from burning.

518
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,515
(I actually wanted to ask Achi out for a nice meal directly,)

519
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:15,611
(but I was afraid I’d make him feel uncomfortable.)

520
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,422
(Just seeing his face every day and making him smile a little is enough.)

521
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:23,413
(Just being by his side is enough.)

522
00:33:23,742 --> 00:33:27,103
(Just being his colleague is okay.)

523
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,099
This is ready.

524
00:33:35,206 --> 00:33:37,038
I already asked the staff to bring you a new pair of chopsticks.

525
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:42,995
(Why do I feel so bad?)

526
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:47,996
(I’m so selfish for only caring about my feelings)

527
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,568
(when Karan has always put my feelings first.)

528
00:33:53,589 --> 00:33:54,364
Karan.

529
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,007
Hmm?

530
00:33:57,937 --> 00:33:58,645
I’m sorry.

531
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:03,384
For what?

532
00:34:06,815 --> 00:34:12,058
(Karan is the only one who treats me well, but I’ve never done anything for him.)

533
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:16,384
(I can’t even be a good colleague to him.)

534
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:20,638
Would you like anything else? Feel free to order.

535
00:34:21,236 --> 00:34:24,801
I’m sorry about the noise upstairs.

536
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:27,123
It’s a company celebration.

537
00:34:28,176 --> 00:34:28,967
Don’t worry about it.

538
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:32,103
My company makes a loud noise when we celebrate too.

539
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,134
Don’t leave yet, Rock.

540
00:34:34,134 --> 00:34:34,777
Duj!

541
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:37,624
Duj, you’re drunk. Go home to sleep.

542
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:41,690
The boss is still here. You can’t leave.

543
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:44,451
That’s Achi and Karan.

544
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,304
Achi! Karan!

545
00:34:48,304 --> 00:34:49,941
Come up here quickly!

546
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:51,422
Let’s go back to singing.

547
00:34:51,937 --> 00:34:57,248
♪ I don’t want to go home ♪

548
00:34:57,248 --> 00:35:03,108
♪ No one is waiting for me there ♪

549
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:08,353
♪ How sad it is to not have someone watch over you ♪

550
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:10,894
♪ I don’t want to go home ♪

551
00:35:11,237 --> 00:35:13,668
You can be anything, but not a singer.

552
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:16,473
But I want to be just that.

553
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,650
After work, she’s no longer like a discipline teacher.

554
00:35:25,531 --> 00:35:27,531
(Why does it have to be like this?)

555
00:35:27,896 --> 00:35:30,440
(I got a chance to have a meal with Achi alone)

556
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:32,447
(but unfortunately ran into people from the office.)

557
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:34,608
(This world is not fair.)

558
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,065
(I hate this world.)

559
00:35:36,065 --> 00:35:37,394
(I hate it!)

560
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:41,690
(I didn’t know Karan had his hotheaded side.)

561
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,704
By the way

562
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:46,294
why are you two here together?

563
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:48,250
Are you guys on a date?

564
00:35:48,873 --> 00:35:50,390
No. We aren’t.

565
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:51,616
Uh…

566
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:56,554
We knew everyone was coming here

567
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:57,927
so we followed.

568
00:35:58,063 --> 00:36:00,050
Oh.

569
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,219
(I had to lie.)

570
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:05,909
(Achi would probably feel uncomfortable)

571
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:08,620
(if the others found out he was here to eat with just the two of us.)

572
00:36:11,032 --> 00:36:12,624
Rock, you’re heartbroken, right?

573
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:13,819
Let’s have fun.

574
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:17,114
I have a fun game for everyone to play.

575
00:36:17,114 --> 00:36:18,739
It’s called Ōsama Game

576
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,829
or the King’s Game.

577
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:21,650
First, I’ll have you all pick your number papers

578
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,055
and take turns being King.

579
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:27,446
The King can order any number to do anything.

580
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,530
The first King is Pai.

581
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:35,375
I’m ordering number 3 to bottoms up.

582
00:36:35,642 --> 00:36:36,369
I’m number 3.

583
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:40,095
Yes.

584
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:42,194
More.

585
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:49,250
The next King is

586
00:36:49,363 --> 00:36:50,299
Ms. Duj.

587
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:59,380
I’m ordering number 6 to slap number 9’s head.

588
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,125
Who are they?

589
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:03,832
It’s me.

590
00:37:04,694 --> 00:37:05,660
Rock.

591
00:37:07,468 --> 00:37:08,497
Who’s number 9?

592
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:13,777
I’m number 9.

593
00:37:15,564 --> 00:37:16,417
It’s okay.

594
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:19,090
Please go ahead.

595
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:21,221
I don’t think that’s a good idea, Boss.

596
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:22,085
Don’t underestimate me.

597
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,775
I’m a man of my word.

598
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,547
Don’t be afraid.

599
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:27,016
Do it.

600
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:30,622
Alright then.

601
00:37:31,856 --> 00:37:32,932
It’s a game, Boss.

602
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:42,663
I’m sorry.

603
00:37:43,298 --> 00:37:43,970
Very good.

604
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:49,199
My turn next.

605
00:37:49,611 --> 00:37:56,530
I’m ordering number 2 and number 4 to kiss.

606
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:01,708
I’m number 4.

607
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:06,988
I’m number 2.

608
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:08,684
Oh.

609
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:10,190
Hold on.

610
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:12,796
Don’t you think this order is too extreme?

611
00:38:12,796 --> 00:38:13,562
Come on.

612
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:14,602
It’s just a kiss.

613
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:15,299
What are you afraid of?

614
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:20,669
Kiss.

615
00:38:20,669 --> 00:38:21,883
Let’s think that this is just a game.

616
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:31,095
Kiss.

617
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:53,673
(Please excuse me.)

618
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:02,417
Hey!

619
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:02,991
You’re cheating.

620
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:04,386
That’s cheating.

621
00:39:04,908 --> 00:39:05,692
Right, Boss?

622
00:39:06,055 --> 00:39:07,104
Boss?

623
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:08,458
He’s down.

624
00:39:19,843 --> 00:39:21,264
Excuse me, I need to go to the restroom.

625
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,319
Please excuse me.

626
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,204
What are you doing here?

627
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,837
Just getting some air.

628
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:09,341
It’s hot inside.

629
00:40:13,922 --> 00:40:15,966
They shouldn’t have made us play that game.

630
00:40:17,455 --> 00:40:20,544
No guy would be okay with kissing a guy.

631
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:30,502
(No matter how much I want to kiss Achi, I don’t agree with being forced to.)

632
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:34,235
(Seeing him afraid like that)

633
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:36,690
(made me feel so bad.)

634
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:40,111
(He must feel so uncomfortable.)

635
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:45,289
(But actually, the one who makes him feel most uncomfortable is me.)

636
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:50,201
(If I didn’t have feelings for Achi, he wouldn’t be this uncomfortable.)

637
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:52,908
(I’m sorry, Achi.)

638
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:55,954
(I’m sorry for falling for you.)

639
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,090
Come on. Let’s get inside.

640
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:21,134
It’s not that I’m uncomfortable with kissing you, Karan.

641
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:35,037
I’ve just never kissed anyone

642
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:37,498
so I didn’t know what to do.

643
00:41:40,673 --> 00:41:41,490
Really?

644
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:42,857
Actually,

645
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:45,921
it’s not that I don’t like kissing you.

646
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:57,593
You realize what that means, right?

647
00:41:59,407 --> 00:42:00,142
What?

648
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:09,592
Are you sure about what you said?

649
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,570
Hey, watch out!

650
00:42:51,832 --> 00:42:53,356
(Should I leave him alone?)

651
00:42:53,356 --> 00:42:54,645
Can I come in and see your cat?

652
00:42:55,483 --> 00:42:57,279
(This uncle is actually kinda cute.)

653
00:42:58,232 --> 00:43:00,010
We’re about to start our activity.

654
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,050
Pair up.

655
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:01,734
Do you want to pair with me?

656
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,555
You have such a great body.

657
00:43:04,736 --> 00:43:07,678
(What made Karan fall for me?)

658
00:43:08,228 --> 00:43:11,050
(Ever since that night, I haven’t got a chance to be near him again.)

659
00:43:11,943 --> 00:43:13,512
(I need to hurry up and make a move.)

660
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:23,321
[So being loved actually feels this good.]
