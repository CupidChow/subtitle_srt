Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,590
(I never thought working on a holiday would make me so happy.)

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,520
(No matter what,)

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,500
(I want to see Karan succeed in life.)

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,160
(Even if he likes someone else other than me.)

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,690
What’s that sound?

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,010
It sounds like a fire alarm.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:28,680
She’s so lovey-dovey.

12
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,680
She must be his girlfriend.

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,640
I want to take over his condo for a while.

14
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,060
Even though you’re my big sister, I won’t let you mess with everything.

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,050
(What? This is his older sister?)

16
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,800
It’s a good idea for Karan to stay here.

17
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,870
You’re sick.

18
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,010
You should have someone to take care of you.

19
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,700
Bye.

20
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,090
(Does this mean Karan is moving into my house?)

21
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,300
Achi.

22
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,200
I’m sorry for my sister causing you trouble.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,200
Don’t worry about it.

24
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,500
Make yourself at home.

25
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,700
Get comfortable.

26
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,410
Actually, I can stay at a hotel.

27
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,000
I don’t want to trouble you.

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,490
You let me stay at your place before.

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,490
And it’s getting dark now.

30
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,410
At least stay here tonight.

31
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,700
Let’s talk about this again tomorrow.

32
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,860
I’ll make the bed for you.

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,730
Achi.

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:34,980
Achi.

35
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,110
Achi.

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,600
Are you alright?

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,450
Your temperature is still very high.

38
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,200
You might want to hurry upstairs and rest.

39
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,490
Let’s go.

40
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,600
Get well soon.

41
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,200
Please don’t disappear.

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,900
I won’t go anywhere.

43
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,780
You sat here all night?

44
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,770
You’re awake.

45
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,300
Let me see.

46
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,410
Thank god.

47
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,200
It seems like your fever has gone down.

48
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,800
But from now on, you must take care of your body

49
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,600
so you don’t get sick easily again.

50
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,860
I’ll go down and make you something to eat.

51
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,100
Then you can take your medicine.

52
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,300
Are you sure you feel okay to work?

53
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,300
Yeah.

54
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,610
I feel better now.

55
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,960
Don’t worry.

56
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,610
I can go to work.

57
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,000
Hey, Achi.

58
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,220
Are you going to work?

59
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,500
Come here.

60
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,100
Bring Khao Tom Mud to eat.

61
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,600
Thank you.

62
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,400
Eh?

63
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,590
Who’s this young man?

64
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,710
I’ve never seen him before.

65
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,800
Is he your friend?

66
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,800
This is Karan.

67
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,850
He’s my coworker.

68
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,800
Hello.

69
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,900
Oh my.

70
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,900
He looks handsome and great.

71
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,830
I’m relieved you have a friend who seems reliable, Achi.

72
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,820
I thought you’re only friends with clumsy people like you.

73
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,010
Honestly, I’m so worried.

74
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,890
You’re already 30 but still clumsy.

75
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,770
At this rate, when will you get promoted?

76
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,300
Please don’t worry, Auntie.

77
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,900
Achi is not irresponsible.

78
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,300
He’s always helping others at the office.

79
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,700
He works harder than anyone.

80
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,490
The company’s latest big project came from his idea.

81
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,200
He’s more talented than you think.

82
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,500
Really?

83
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,400
Achi, why haven’t you ever told me that?

84
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,700
Achi is a humble guy

85
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,980
and doesn’t like to take the credit.

86
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,200
Actually, I think he’s the good person he is because of you.

87
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,120
Thank you for taking good care of him.

88
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,500
Oh, you’re too kind.

89
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,650
He does well on his own.

90
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,800
Achi,

91
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,410
you have such a good friend.

92
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,410
You must take good care of each other, alright?

93
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,780
Okay.

94
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
We should go to work now.

95
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,720
Please excuse us.

96
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,600
Alright.

97
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,100
Safe trip.

98
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,100
Two people, please.

99
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,150
♪ Just a soft I love you and I’d give in all the way ♪

100
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,300

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,660

(Even when singing in his head, he’s singing off key.)

103
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,230
♪ With only a whisper from your heart ♪

104
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,300
This is the first time I’m on a boat like this.

105
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,250
I wish I could ride it often like you do.

106
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,000
It’d feel like I was on vacation every day.

107
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,400
If you ride it every day, you won’t think that way.

108
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,850
This morning, it’s crowded and a little uncomfortable.

109
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,810
Hang in there.

110
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,400
(Being on a boat feels so romantic.)

111
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,290
(Since this is my first boat ride with Achi,)

112
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,000
(I want to have something as a keepsake.)

113
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,230
(What should it be?)

114
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,100
(Would asking him for a selfie be too suspicious?)

115
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,900
Karan, this is for you.

116
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,300
It’s a souvenir for your first boat ride.

117
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,600
Thank you.

118
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,600
I’ll keep it carefully.

119
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,450
Moo Ping, anyone?

120
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,500
Thank you so much.

121
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,800
Try it.

122
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,940
It’s really tasty.

123
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,910
It’s good, right?

124
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,090
It’s my secret go-to place.

125
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,920
I usually don’t tell anyone about it.

126
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,810
I’m afraid the Moo Ping will sell out and I won’t get to eat any.

127
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,400
(Wow. Am I the only one who knows about this place from him?)

128
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,890
(So nice. I feel like I’m special to Achi.)

129
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,500
By the way, Achi.

130
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,190
Don’t forget to take your medicine.

131
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,610
Oh, right.

132
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,250
You forgot it at home

133
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,410
so I brought it for you.

134
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,500
Thank you.

135
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,800
Drink this water too.

136
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,890
How was last night?

137
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,300
Did you get any sleep?

138
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,810
I did.

139
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,100
I slept comfortably.

140
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,100
Then you can stay longer.

141
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,800
Can I really?

142
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,780
Of course you can.

143
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,100
Your sister is going through a tough time, isn’t she?

144
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,500
I’m happy to help.

145
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,730
I’ll take you up on it then.

146
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,300
Okay.

147
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,300
(Strangely, I’m not scared of being around Karan like I used to be.)

148
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,170
(I actually even feel comfortable.)

149
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,200
(I feel safe somehow.)

150
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,190
(I don’t know yet what this feeling is,)

151
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,300
(but it feels so good.)

152
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,020
(So this is what a person feels when they’re about to start a married life.)

153
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,000
(What?)

154
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,600
(I’m about to live like a couple with Achi?)

155
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,700
(I can’t wait.)

156
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,020
(A married life?)

157
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,200
(How could Karan’s imagination go so wild?)

158
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:40,404
He’s so cute, Madam Noi.

159
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:43,324
Even in the video, his aura shines through.

160
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:47,484
If I get to watch Min dance live, how much cuter is he going to be?

161
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:48,364
Look.

162
00:11:48,364 --> 00:11:49,044
Let’s dance along.

163
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,204
Are you listening to music?

164
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:03,804
I could hear it from in front of the room.

165
00:12:04,564 --> 00:12:07,604
(Oh, no. If Min finds out I’m secretly watching his practice videos,)

166
00:12:07,804 --> 00:12:10,604
(he might think I’m a suspicious psycho fan.)

167
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:15,124
What music?

168
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:17,404
The ad video just randomly came up.

169
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:19,804
I can’t watch any videos.

170
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:21,604
I’ve been so busy lately.

171
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:24,204
I don’t have time for that nonsense.

172
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,724
You must have been busy.

173
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:31,724
Yes.

174
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:35,404
Here’s your package.

175
00:12:40,964 --> 00:12:42,804
(I want to invite him to watch me practice)

176
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,724
(but I better not.)

177
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,564
(I don’t want to take away his work time.)

178
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:47,364
What?

179
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:49,924
Oh, here you go.

180
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:55,324
Keep going with your work.

181
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:56,804
I should get going.

182
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:00,804
Wait.

183
00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:05,324
Damn it, Jinta!

184
00:13:05,844 --> 00:13:07,724
I shouldn’t have talked too much.

185
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:14,324
Please don’t patch my tires yet.

186
00:13:15,524 --> 00:13:17,404
I’d rather wait for the imported tires.

187
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:19,204
Yes.

188
00:13:20,244 --> 00:13:21,764
I can wait even if it takes a long time.

189
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:25,204
I don’t need to use the car anytime soon.

190
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:26,804
Alright. Thank you so much.

191
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:34,324
Achi.

192
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:38,764
Do you want to go home together after work?

193
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,804
(Ever since Karan started thinking about married life,)

194
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:45,804
(I don’t know how to act when I’m alone with him,)

195
00:13:46,204 --> 00:13:48,404
(even though I feel good when we’re together.)

196
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:51,804
Sure.

197
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:54,004
But we might have to wait for a while.

198
00:13:54,044 --> 00:13:55,324
Boss hasn’t left yet.

199
00:13:59,364 --> 00:14:02,004
(Luckily, there’s a rule forbidding us from leaving before our boss.)

200
00:14:02,484 --> 00:14:04,964
(I should have some time to find an excuse.)

201
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:12,204
I’m leaving, everyone.

202
00:14:12,444 --> 00:14:13,404
See you tomorrow.

203
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,444
Huh?

204
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:23,524
Guys, Boss left early today.

205
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:24,324
Let’s go.

206
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:33,724
How lucky.

207
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:36,524
Shall we leave now?

208
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:43,804
♪ For me to stop loving you, just stop being lovely first ♪

209
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:47,124
♪ You’re too cute to handle, not loving you is impossible ♪

210
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:49,324
♪ I’m already yours ♪

211
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,324
Are you guys leaving already?

212
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:54,204
I’ve never seen you leave together.

213
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:58,764
I have to stay at Achi's house for now.

214
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:01,764
What? Why didn’t you invite me?

215
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:04,124
I want to stay over too.

216
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,644
Then come and stay with us.

217
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:07,804
Can I?

218
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:09,324
Are you sure?

219
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:12,324
You don’t want too many people troubling you.

220
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:16,524
You won’t be troubling me.

221
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:17,964
My house has a lot of space.

222
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:22,124
But I don’t think you have enough beds.

223
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,724
I have a picnic mattress.

224
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:27,924
What about the bathrooms?

225
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:29,444
Hey.

226
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:31,924
Is this yours or Achi’s house?

227
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:34,924
You can come and stay over, Rock.

228
00:15:35,044 --> 00:15:35,924
Don’t worry.

229
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:37,124
No take backs.

230
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:40,004
Yes!

231
00:15:40,484 --> 00:15:41,644
Since all three of us are staying together tonight,

232
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:43,924
shall we hold a Mala Shabu party?

233
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:47,564
Do you have all the ingredients?

234
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:49,004
Shall we go shopping first?

235
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:53,724
(Just like that, I don’t have to worry about being alone with Karan anymore.)

236
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:26,404
(Gosh. His aura is shining even brighter than in that video clip.)

237
00:16:27,324 --> 00:16:30,164
(I want to watch closer, but I don’t want Min to notice.)

238
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,124
Jinta.

239
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:37,004
What are you doing, sneaking around here?

240
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:38,804
Didn’t you say you were busy with work?

241
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,204
Yes, I’m busy.

242
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:45,404
I’m writing a novel about idols

243
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,524
so I’m here to do some research.

244
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:47,604
Damn.

245
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:48,924
A writer.

246
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:50,004
So cool.

247
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:51,244
Shall we let him join us for dancing?

248
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:52,164
Since he’s already here.

249
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:53,724
He’ll understand idols' lives better.

250
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:55,124
Not a good idea.

251
00:16:55,204 --> 00:16:56,404
He never danced before.

252
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:58,044
Look at him.

253
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,684
He doesn’t look like he can pull it off.

254
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:08,124
Listen, kids.

255
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:10,324
I’m not that old.

256
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:12,684
I sometimes work out at home.

257
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:15,364
Dancing will be just a piece of cake.

258
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:16,764
He has the guts.

259
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:18,204
Alright, dude.

260
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:19,724
Turn on the music.

261
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:21,404
Bring it on.

262
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:33,964
Easy peasy.

263
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:51,604
Come on, man.

264
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:06,204
Just wait and see.

265
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:07,604
Easy peasy.

266
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:12,484
(I need to use this opportunity to impress Min.)

267
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:16,644
Watch me.

268
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:27,524
Jinta.

269
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:36,244
Whoa.

270
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:39,844
And this is Rock Rock Pork.

271
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:42,644
This Mala pork with cheese is my special recipe.

272
00:18:42,684 --> 00:18:43,644
It’s so delicious.

273
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:44,484
Try it.

274
00:18:44,484 --> 00:18:45,764
It’s hot. Let me blow on it first.

275
00:18:58,124 --> 00:18:59,164
It’s really delicious.

276
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:00,084
I know, right?

277
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:01,564
I’m glad you like it.

278
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:02,684
I’ll make you another one.

279
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:03,764
It’s okay, Rock.

280
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:04,764
I’ll do it.

281
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:23,524
And this is my Mala specialty.

282
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:27,564
Ran Ran Mala.

283
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:30,084
Do you want to try it, Achi?

284
00:19:30,164 --> 00:19:31,484
I’ll get some for you.

285
00:19:39,884 --> 00:19:41,004
Try it.

286
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:43,124
Help yourself to it, Rock.

287
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:46,084
Okay.

288
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:54,524
It’s so delicious.

289
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:58,764
It’s so satisfyingly spicy.

290
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,044
It’s amazing.

291
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:01,724
Do you want more soup, Achi?

292
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:02,964
Let me give you some more.

293
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,524
(I won’t let him compliment only Rock.)

294
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:10,324
(That ‘so delicious’ compliment should be given to me.)

295
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:12,924
(Is he jealous?)

296
00:20:13,484 --> 00:20:15,724
(I didn’t think he had this side of him.)

297
00:20:16,204 --> 00:20:17,804

00:20:20,164 --> 00:20:21,564

Of course.

310
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:40,324
I’m still young.

311
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:43,604
I had a band when I was in university.

312
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:44,724
I’ll show you.

313
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:49,604
You guys seriously formed a band?

314
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:51,004
That’s so cool.

315
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:54,524
We didn’t get far.

316
00:20:54,764 --> 00:20:56,004
We quit before we could.

317
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,324
Why did you quit?

318
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:01,404
We were just bored.

319
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:02,164
It’s nothing.

320
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:03,124
Forget it.

321
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:04,924
Do you want anything? I’ll get it for you.

322
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:13,924
(Actually, we didn’t want to quit, but we saw no future.)

323
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:18,724
(We had a band for many years, but didn’t get to debut.)

324
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:21,324
(It would’ve only been a waste of time to keep fighting.)

325
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:55,444
Is Rock asleep already?

326
00:21:56,324 --> 00:21:57,204
Yeah.

327
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:00,644
I feel bad for Rock.

328
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:08,884
Even though he said “forget it”, I think he still hasn’t gotten over it.

329
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:17,724
(Why am I feeling so upset?)

330
00:22:17,924 --> 00:22:20,444
(Achi is rightly worrying about another person)

331
00:22:22,044 --> 00:22:23,564
(but I can’t help feeling unhappy)

332
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:25,884
(when I hear him talk about someone else.)

333
00:22:27,124 --> 00:22:28,204
(I’m so bad.)

334
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:32,204
Karan.

335
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:37,604
Sorry.

336
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:39,604
I probably drank too much.

337
00:22:40,684 --> 00:22:41,604
Please excuse me.

338
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,695
Your mattress was so comfy to sleep on.

339
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,123
Can I come again next time?

340
00:22:55,139 --> 00:22:56,295
Sure.

341
00:22:56,516 --> 00:22:57,905
You can come anytime.

342
00:22:58,283 --> 00:22:58,979
Please get on the boat.

343
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:00,499
Get on.

344
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:01,461
Get on, guys.

345
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:03,689
Excuse me.

346
00:23:03,888 --> 00:23:05,138
The boat is full.

347
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:06,603
Please wait for the next one.

348
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:08,068
It leaves in about 15 minutes.

349
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:09,948
But we came together.

350
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,351
Let’s wait for the next boat.

351
00:23:11,365 --> 00:23:11,911
Come on.

352
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:16,305
I have to meet Pai for a product promotional video shoot at 8 a.m.

353
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:18,390
I don’t want to be late.

354
00:23:19,088 --> 00:23:20,591
Don’t you have to help too?

355
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:23,597
You’re right.

356
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:27,190
You guys can go first.

357
00:23:27,713 --> 00:23:30,496
I think I’ll visit a client before going to the office.

358
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:31,264
You may leave now.

359
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,187
Okay.

360
00:23:32,856 --> 00:23:33,599
Off you go.

361
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:34,692
I’m sorry.

362
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:35,896
See you at the office.

363
00:23:54,763 --> 00:23:55,591
Pai,

364
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,886
is everything alright?

365
00:23:57,525 --> 00:23:58,551
Achi.

366
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:04,415
The writer we asked to promote the pen just canceled out of the blue.

367
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:07,101
I don’t know where to find his replacement in time.

368
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:09,800
Can it be someone with a different job?

369
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:11,756
Writers these days don’t use pens anymore.

370
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:12,988
They write on their computers.

371
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:15,627
If you think like that, then don’t sell pens.

372
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:17,828
If you want a writer,

373
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:19,793
I might be able to find you one

374
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,627
but he’s not very famous.

375
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,833
That’s totally fine.

376
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:34,796
As long as he’s a real writer.

377
00:24:35,293 --> 00:24:36,991
Can you help me, Achi?

378
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:38,018
Sure.

379
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:39,742
I’ll keep you updated.

380
00:24:40,317 --> 00:24:41,170
Okay.

381
00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:43,492
I’ll go check on everything.

382
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:44,230
Alright.

383
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,089
Thank you.

384
00:24:51,815 --> 00:24:52,825
Karan’s here.

385
00:24:54,997 --> 00:24:55,689
Karan.

386
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,587
Karan.

387
00:24:59,095 --> 00:24:59,948
How was the trip?

388
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:01,202
Was it inconvenient?

389
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,693
Don’t worry about me.

390
00:25:03,406 --> 00:25:04,600
Did you guys make it here in time?

391
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:05,950
We almost didn’t.

392
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:09,510
This morning, we went to queue up at Achi’s secret Moo Ping place.

393
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:10,754
It’s so good.

394
00:25:10,768 --> 00:25:12,185
I want to eat it again.

395
00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:13,550
Let’s go there again some other time.

396
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,690
Sure.

397
00:25:18,562 --> 00:25:20,588
Is something wrong, Karan?

398
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:23,399
Nothing.

399
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:24,968
Excuse me.

400
00:25:35,372 --> 00:25:38,861
(I thought I was the only one Achi told about that place.)

401
00:25:39,012 --> 00:25:40,791
(I flattered myself.)

402
00:25:44,283 --> 00:25:45,107
Excuse me.

403
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,997
Excuse me!

404
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:00,489
Excuse me!

405
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:03,594
What the hell?

406
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:05,344
Jinta.

407
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,289
Oh, hey, Min.

408
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,350
Where are you going?

409
00:26:08,307 --> 00:26:10,594
I’m going to film an ad for my friend.

410
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,194
Wow.

411
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:13,831
That’s cool.

412
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:15,394
You’re a model now.

413
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:17,639
I’m no model.

414
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,793
It’s just a small promotional video.

415
00:26:21,197 --> 00:26:25,098
Are you going to model with that thing on your face?

416
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:28,813
Come here.

417
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:30,052
Let me help you.

418
00:26:57,132 --> 00:26:59,498
Where’s your friend’s office?

419
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:01,222
I can give you a ride if you want.

420
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:02,867
I don’t have work today.

421
00:27:05,627 --> 00:27:06,793
Are you sure?

422
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:09,901
Why not?

423
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:14,991
Are you embarrassed to ride with a motorbike delivery rider like me?

424
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:16,991
No, I’m not embarrassed.

425
00:27:17,024 --> 00:27:19,292
I just don’t want to trouble you.

426
00:27:20,615 --> 00:27:21,796
You’re not troubling me.

427
00:27:21,978 --> 00:27:24,385
I’ll be your rider today

428
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:28,394
to make up for being the cause of your injury.

429
00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:32,594
Here.

430
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:33,493
Get on.

431
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:56,690
Achi.

432
00:27:57,062 --> 00:27:57,751
Hmm?

433
00:27:58,962 --> 00:28:00,190
Can I talk to you?

434
00:28:01,242 --> 00:28:02,190
What’s up?

435
00:28:02,443 --> 00:28:03,625
Achi!

436
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:04,591
Here I am!

437
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:08,130
You’re here!

438
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:10,273
Thank you so much for coming.

439
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:11,538
No need to thank me.

440
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,831
I’ll do anything for you.

441
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,062
Oh.

442
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:17,495
Hello, Mr. Karan.

443
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:18,935
You know me?

444
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,455
Of course, I do.

445
00:28:20,462 --> 00:28:21,095
You…

446
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:23,110
It’s almost time.

447
00:28:23,114 --> 00:28:24,667
We should get ready or we’ll be late.

448
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:25,468
Let’s go.

449
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:26,916
What were you going to say?

450
00:28:27,628 --> 00:28:29,018
Nothing.

451
00:28:29,031 --> 00:28:29,910
Let’s go.

452
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:35,366
Writing is serious business.

453
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:37,104
It must make your heart race.

454
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:41,296
All good.

455
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:43,499
Feel free to change your clothes, Jinta.

456
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:52,298
Hey.

457
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:01,993
Do you remember the young rider I told you about?

458
00:29:04,148 --> 00:29:08,144
He’s going to pick me up this evening.

459
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:10,588
The guy named Min?

460
00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:11,482
Yes.

461
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:13,092
That’s cool.

462
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:15,092
Has your relationship developed already?

463
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,092
Not really

464
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,907
but I think I’m falling for real.

465
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:23,982
I knew it.

466
00:29:24,074 --> 00:29:25,575
I feel the same way.

467
00:29:30,224 --> 00:29:32,388
Then this evening…

468
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:41,905
(When you ride on his motorbike, why don’t you hold him like this?)

469
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:46,381
(Like this?)

470
00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:47,551
(No.)

471
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,929
(Won’t he think you’re being handsy if you do that?)

472
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:54,385
(What if I hold onto his shoulders?)

473
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,233
(Will that look bad?)

474
00:29:56,464 --> 00:30:00,730
(Won’t he think you’re being handsy?)

475
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:01,938
(I’ll do this then.)

476
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:07,544
What are you doing?

477
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:13,271
What am I doing?

478
00:30:13,286 --> 00:30:14,794
I’m not doing anything.

479
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,295
We’re just talking.

480
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,409
Nothing is going on.

481
00:30:19,725 --> 00:30:20,384
He’s right.

482
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:22,273
We’re really just talking.

483
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,799
We’re not doing anything.

484
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:27,711
I’m sorry.

485
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,295
I misunderstood.

486
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,495
I’m really sorry.

487
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:38,796
What’s wrong with him?

488
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:43,188
I almost got punched.

489
00:30:50,968 --> 00:30:51,728
Excuse me.

490
00:30:52,448 --> 00:30:53,728
Are you Min?

491
00:30:54,408 --> 00:30:56,208
You know me?

492
00:30:57,128 --> 00:30:59,128
Jinta told me you’d pick him up.

493
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:00,288
My name is Achi.

494
00:31:00,288 --> 00:31:01,288
I’m Jinta’s friend.

495
00:31:01,688 --> 00:31:03,928
He’s still filming the last scene.

496
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:04,888
You can wait upstairs.

497
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,528
Come.

498
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,128
Okay.

499
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:12,328
Take a seat and wait here.

500
00:31:12,528 --> 00:31:14,048
I think Jinta is almost done.

501
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:15,128
Duj,

502
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:17,728
please let Min wait for Jinta here.

503
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:19,928
Oh.

504
00:31:20,808 --> 00:31:21,928
Your name is Min?

505
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,048
You’re good-looking.

506
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,528
- Hello.
- Hi.

507
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,528
Are you tired from sitting here?

508
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:29,328
If so, you can sit in my heart instead.

509
00:31:30,608 --> 00:31:34,008
Achi, can you help upload the footage we shot earlier?

510
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:34,568
Sure.

511
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:35,288
Let me handle it.

512
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:36,128
Thank you.

513
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:45,728
Min.

514
00:31:46,128 --> 00:31:46,808
Oh?

515
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:48,808
You two know each other?

516
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:54,848
We’re friends from university.

517
00:31:54,848 --> 00:31:56,088
I see.

518
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:59,488
Then you must have seen Rock’s dance band.

519
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,528
What was he like during that time?

520
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:01,968
Was he handsome?

521
00:32:01,968 --> 00:32:02,968
Probably not.

522
00:32:12,728 --> 00:32:15,008
I think I should wait outside.

523
00:32:15,248 --> 00:32:16,488
Oh?

524
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:17,928
Please excuse me.

525
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:19,328
Min.

526
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:20,408
Min.

527
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,688
Hold on, Min.

528
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:22,808
Min.

529
00:32:26,088 --> 00:32:28,968
Rock, what’s the problem between you and Min?

530
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:35,608
Hey.

531
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,528
Are you alright?

532
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:54,928
I’m fine.

533
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:57,928
I’m just thinking about the past.

534
00:33:08,808 --> 00:33:11,808
That employee is your friend, right?

535
00:33:15,488 --> 00:33:16,528
He was

536
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:21,608
but not anymore.

537
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:31,128
Min and I were in the same band.

538
00:33:33,448 --> 00:33:36,528
We graduated without getting to debut.

539
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:42,008
At that time, I thought there’s no future in becoming idols

540
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:44,528
so I thought of quitting.

541
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:54,208
I thought it’d be better to have a stable job

542
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,208
so I applied for different companies

543
00:33:58,448 --> 00:34:00,208
and ended up working here.

544
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:03,608
But I didn’t know what to tell my friends.

545
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:06,648
I was afraid of being accused of abandoning the band.

546
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:09,808
So I decided to cut contact with everyone.

547
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:15,168
I’ve never been mad at Rock.

548
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:18,208
I’m actually happy that he has a good job.

549
00:34:20,328 --> 00:34:24,528
But now he’s in a different league from me.

550
00:34:27,088 --> 00:34:28,928
He probably doesn’t want to be friends with me anymore.

551
00:34:30,408 --> 00:34:32,088
These past several years,

552
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:34,408
I’ve always wondered

553
00:34:34,648 --> 00:34:37,608
if I gave up too easily.

554
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:39,328
Was I selfish?

555
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:41,728
Did I disappoint my friends?

556
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,688
Rock made the right decision.

557
00:34:45,808 --> 00:34:47,528
I’m still stuck in the same place.

558
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:53,528
Sometimes I think that if I hadn’t chosen this path,

559
00:34:55,368 --> 00:34:57,008
my life might be better.

560
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:00,368
That’s not true.

561
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:05,208
No matter how many more times you chose,

562
00:35:06,128 --> 00:35:08,008
you’d still choose this path.

563
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:18,328
You know, every time I watch your practice clips,

564
00:35:19,768 --> 00:35:22,808
I only see your effort and determination.

565
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:29,328
If you didn’t really love it, you wouldn’t be working so hard for it.

566
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:34,128
You didn’t choose the wrong path.

567
00:35:36,328 --> 00:35:38,528
You just chose to follow your dream.

568
00:35:43,088 --> 00:35:47,568
So, even if you could turn back time and change things,

569
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:52,368
I believe that in the end, you’d still choose this path.

570
00:36:10,848 --> 00:36:12,608
I’m such a bad person.

571
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:20,288
It’s good that Min stopped being friends with me.

572
00:36:22,368 --> 00:36:24,088
We feel bad for Rock, don’t we?

573
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:28,008
No way in hell.

574
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:30,288
You idiot.

575
00:36:30,328 --> 00:36:31,528
What’s wrong with you?

576
00:36:31,768 --> 00:36:33,688
I’m in a sad mood. Why did you slap me?

577
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:35,328
To help you pull yourself together.

578
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:36,528
Are you out of your mind?

579
00:36:36,648 --> 00:36:38,768
You feel guilty and want to apologize to him

580
00:36:38,808 --> 00:36:40,168
but instead you’re sitting here going on about it.

581
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:41,688
How would he know how you feel?

582
00:36:41,688 --> 00:36:42,408
Huh?

583
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,368
Come with me.

584
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:45,768
Come on. Get up!

585
00:36:45,928 --> 00:36:46,728
Pai.

586
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:52,848
Duj.

587
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:56,208
I think ever since Pai went off on her ex,

588
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:59,208
she has seemed a lot scarier.

589
00:36:59,248 --> 00:37:00,008
Agreed.

590
00:37:00,448 --> 00:37:01,728
She’s sweet like a sugar glider on the outside

591
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:03,688
but aggressive like a bengal tiger on the inside.

592
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,408
She’s crazy.

593
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:05,928
Let’s quickly follow them

594
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:07,128
or Rock will be dead.

595
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:09,168
I forgot my phone.

596
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,928
Go talk to your friend.

597
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:27,408
Go.

598
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:32,208
Come here. Come on.

599
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:33,808
Let’s stand here.

600
00:37:47,288 --> 00:37:48,008
I’m sorry.

601
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,968
It’s my fault.

602
00:37:50,528 --> 00:37:51,168
I’m despicable.

603
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,208
I’m selfish.

604
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:53,848
I’m the reason our band broke up.

605
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:55,928
I abandoned you all.

606
00:37:57,248 --> 00:37:58,488
You can kick and punch me all you like.

607
00:37:58,528 --> 00:37:59,928
You can do anything to me.

608
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:03,528
I only ask for one thing.

609
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,608
Can I be your friend again?

610
00:38:11,848 --> 00:38:12,688
Yes.

611
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:15,128
I was angry.

612
00:38:19,288 --> 00:38:21,728
I was angry you didn’t tell me you were going to apply for jobs.

613
00:38:23,248 --> 00:38:24,648
I would’ve supported you more.

614
00:38:28,288 --> 00:38:29,208
Min.

615
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,208
But I was never angry that you left the band.

616
00:38:37,128 --> 00:38:38,688
Stop feeling guilty already.

617
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:41,528
No matter what your dream is,

618
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:44,968
I’ll always support you.

619
00:39:03,288 --> 00:39:04,408
I’m sorry.

620
00:39:19,968 --> 00:39:23,568
Actually, there’s something I regret.

621
00:39:25,648 --> 00:39:26,608
What is it?

622
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:30,968
I regret I didn’t get to dance with you one last time.

623
00:39:31,968 --> 00:39:34,128
If you see me dance, you’ll be horrified.

624
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:52,728
Guys.

625
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:56,528
Would it be possible for you to help film a little something more?

626
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:02,328
Are you sure you still remember the moves?

627
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:04,128
We’ll see.

628
00:40:07,048 --> 00:40:08,008
Achi.

629
00:40:08,688 --> 00:40:09,528
Let’s go.

630
00:40:19,608 --> 00:40:21,968
Yes!

631
00:40:53,808 --> 00:40:56,568
(All’s well that ends well.)

632
00:40:56,928 --> 00:40:59,448
(Rock and Min are friends again.)

633
00:41:00,008 --> 00:41:02,128
(Even though they’ve chosen different paths,)

634
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:07,928
(I believe both will keep supporting each other.)

635
00:41:10,608 --> 00:41:12,328
Come on.

636
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:21,288
Well done.

637
00:41:48,328 --> 00:41:49,608
Thank you, Pai.

638
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:53,448
If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have made up with Min

639
00:41:53,448 --> 00:41:55,528
and I’d still feel guilty.

640
00:41:56,568 --> 00:41:57,928
No need to thank me.

641
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:02,128
But don’t think that being an office worker is easier than being an idol.

642
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:05,408
Alright.

643
00:42:08,648 --> 00:42:10,208
It’s okay though.

644
00:42:11,728 --> 00:42:13,048
I know you can do it.

645
00:42:13,608 --> 00:42:14,248
Hmm?

646
00:42:15,688 --> 00:42:22,328
No matter how hard it is, I believe you’ll be successful one day

647
00:42:23,448 --> 00:42:25,208
because I’ll always support you.

648
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:31,008
Got it?

649
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:36,928
Got it, Senior.

650
00:42:38,168 --> 00:42:39,488
Very good, Junior.

651
00:42:41,288 --> 00:42:42,128
Let’s go.

652
00:43:05,088 --> 00:43:06,408
You can hold onto my waist

653
00:43:06,688 --> 00:43:07,608
so you don’t fall off.

654
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,648
(I’m surprised this uncle knew how to say cool things.)

655
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:18,728
(Wait. Did Min say I was cool?)

656
00:43:19,528 --> 00:43:20,368
(Yes!)

657
00:43:20,928 --> 00:43:22,408
By the way,

658
00:43:23,528 --> 00:43:25,728
since when did you watch my dance practice clips?

659
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:29,848
Don’t tell me you’re my secret fan.

660
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:34,328
I just came across them.

661
00:43:36,808 --> 00:43:37,608
Really?

662
00:43:38,288 --> 00:43:40,808
Are you sure you’re not my fan?

663
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,008
Hold on tight.

664
00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:02,608
Today was so hectic

665
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,208
but it was buzzing in a good way.

666
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:07,208
Filming the dance was so much fun.

667
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,848
Too bad Rock isn’t coming home with us tonight.

668
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:17,248
If he was, we’d probably get to eat shabu again like the other day.

669
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:18,528
That was fun, wasn’t it?

670
00:44:44,688 --> 00:44:45,408
Karan?

671
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:47,848
Is something wrong?

672
00:44:55,808 --> 00:44:57,008
I like you, Achi.

673
00:44:57,288 --> 00:45:00,928
♪ Message from my heart, want you to hear ♪

674
00:45:08,968 --> 00:45:14,048
♪ My heart shouts out loud, I love you ♪

675
00:45:16,568 --> 00:45:17,368
What a waste.

676
00:45:17,368 --> 00:45:18,488
I put him in this team

677
00:45:18,608 --> 00:45:20,008
because he’s good-looking

678
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,168
so he’d attract the client.

679
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:23,128
You’re drunk. Will you get home okay?

680
00:45:23,328 --> 00:45:25,328
I feel so useless.

681
00:45:25,448 --> 00:45:26,168
No.

682
00:45:26,368 --> 00:45:29,088
At least you helped me.

683
00:45:29,568 --> 00:45:32,128
The office is so lonely without Karan.

684
00:45:32,368 --> 00:45:33,088
Pai.

685
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,648
I have something very important to talk about with Karan.

686
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,488
Achi, follow me.

687
00:45:35,488 --> 00:45:36,808
I wouldn’t be able to make it in time.

688
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:51,168
[You didn’t choose the wrong path.
You just chose your dream.
Even if you could turn back time,
I believe that you’d still choose this path.]
