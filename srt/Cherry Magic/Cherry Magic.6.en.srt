Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:15,822
Achi.

6
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:17,871
Do you want to go home together after work?

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,376
(Ever since Karan started thinking about married life,)

8
00:00:22,659 --> 00:00:25,309
(I don’t know how to act when I’m alone with him,)

9
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:26,714
You can come and stay over, Rock.

10
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:27,588
Yes!

11
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:30,020
(Just like that, I don’t have to worry about being alone with Karan anymore.)

12
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:33,579
This morning, we went to queue up at Achi’s secret Moo Ping and sticky rice place.

13
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:34,780
It’s so good.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,053
(I thought I was the only one Achi told about that place.)

15
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:39,582
(I flattered myself.)

16
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:41,521
(Why am I feeling so upset?)

17
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:43,905
(Achi is rightly worrying about another person.)

18
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:44,813
Karan?

19
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:45,808
Is something wrong?

20
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:53,017
I like you, Achi.

21
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:58,942
I like you

22
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:01,607
not as a friend

23
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,509
or a coworker.

24
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:08,998
I thought just seeing your face or saying hi would be enough to make me happy

25
00:01:09,782 --> 00:01:14,410
but every time we’re near, I imagine things.

26
00:01:17,574 --> 00:01:19,305
Even though you trust me

27
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:22,805
and treat me well because you see me as a friend.

28
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:34,940
I’m sorry.

29
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:39,217
Sorry?

30
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,263
I feel guilty for betraying your trust and thinking of you more than just a friend.

31
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:48,297
when you seem happier

32
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:55,109
when you’re with other people.

33
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:04,937
So I think telling you this honestly should be better for you.

34
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:08,976
Well…

35
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:12,330
Karan…

36
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:16,903
I’ll sleep at my place tonight.

37
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:20,456
Have a safe trip home.

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,808
(Even though I’ve always known how Karan feels,)

39
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:36,207
(hearing that made me speechless.)

40
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,506
(Today has finally come.)

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,010
FIRST YEAR OF WORKING

42
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:47,182
Achi.

43
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:49,182
- Yes?
- Are the wine and the card ready?

44
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,583
Did you write it yourself the way Ms. Kem likes?

45
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,607
She doesn’t like ready-made cards.

46
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,582
They’re ready.

47
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,565
I’ve also added her mall’s sticker.

48
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:57,508
Good.

49
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,420
Karan, come and sit here.

50
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:00,103
Come on.

51
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:01,001
Okay.

52
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:01,943
Move here.

53
00:05:03,223 --> 00:05:04,705
Here you are.

54
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:09,805
You’ve prepared for this, right?

55
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:12,380
You’ll take care of Ms. Kem today.

56
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:13,314
Yes.

57
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,543
I’ve looked up the product information.

58
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:15,355
Come on.

59
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:16,607
Why did you?

60
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,805
You’re born good-looking.

61
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,054
Just use this.

62
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:23,903
Do your best today.

63
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:25,340
You’re our team’s hope.

64
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,709
Take a seat, Achi.

65
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:38,825
Hey.

66
00:05:38,857 --> 00:05:39,330
Yes?

67
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,294
Do you have chewing gum?

68
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,410
It’s really delicious, Ms. Kem.

69
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:52,235
- Agreed.
- Amazing.

70
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:55,737
I really admire your brand, Ms. Kem.

71
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:56,601
Especially the quality.

72
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:58,111
Come on.

73
00:05:58,177 --> 00:06:00,294
What an eager new joiner you are.

74
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,724
No more talking about stressful things.

75
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:03,682
Relax.

76
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:04,694
This is after hours.

77
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:06,214
Don’t talk about work.

78
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:08,376
I’m sorry.

79
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,103
He’s really new, Ms. Kem.

80
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:11,583
He’s only been with us for a few months.

81
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,736
He hasn’t really picked up on things yet.

82
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,124
I see.

83
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:19,219
Oh, look at that sheepish face.

84
00:06:19,234 --> 00:06:20,407
Poor thing.

85
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:22,914
No one is scolding you.

86
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,419
Let me treat you to a drink to make you feel better.

87
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,497
Excuse me.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,007
Open the wine.

89
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,657
No, thank you. I don’t drink.

90
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:32,500
Oh?

91
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,459
Actually, I also don’t…

92
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,733
Don’t feel bad.

93
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:37,733
Ms. Kem is happy to treat you.

94
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:39,201
Right, Ms. Kem?

95
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:40,115
That’s right.

96
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:41,628
Don’t feel bad at all.

97
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:44,201
I can pay for as many bottles as you like

98
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:46,823
so we can spend more time together.

99
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:52,656
That’s really amazing.

100
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:53,576
Cheers.

101
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:02,408
Well done.

102
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:05,226
Wait, you’ve only had two glasses and you’re drunk already?

103
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,980
No, not yet.

104
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:09,865
He probably doesn’t drink often.

105
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:13,702
He’s a good kid, huh?

106
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:17,736
What about you?

107
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:19,180
Aren’t you going to drink that?

108
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:20,336
I am.

109
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:28,379
Achi.

110
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,300
It’s my favorite wine.

111
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,296
If you don’t mind, can I have that?

112
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,459
Whoa.

113
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,112
You finished the glass.

114
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,912
Awesome.

115
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,499
You’re drunk. Will you get home okay?

116
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:57,112
Yes.

117
00:08:02,844 --> 00:08:04,099
Actually,

118
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:08,005
the rooms at this hotel are nice.

119
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,802
Shall we go and relax in one?

120
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:22,419
Hey.

121
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,214
What are you doing?

122
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,007
I haven’t done anything.

123
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:29,480
Did you imagine it?

124
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:30,048
But you just…

125
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,182
Karan!

126
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:33,008
How could you do this?

127
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:34,405
Show Ms. Kem some respect.

128
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,417
I’m not feeling well.

129
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,804
Please excuse me.

130
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,305
Are you alright, Ms. Kem?

131
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:50,005
I must apologize on his behalf.

132
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,862
He’s clueless.

133
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:53,056
It’s okay.

134
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:02,108
Karan.

135
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:08,705
I’m sorry.

136
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:10,207
How are things going inside?

137
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:12,136
They’re about to leave.

138
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:14,537
Really?

139
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,459
Karan.

140
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,940
He ran off just like that?

141
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:41,177
What’s wrong with him?

142
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:43,063
I told him to use his looks to our advantage.

143
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:44,108
I know.

144
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,389
What’s wrong with letting a client get a little handsy?

145
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,259
He’s a man. It’s no big deal, right?

146
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:51,554
What a waste.

147
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:53,007
I put him in this team

148
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,477
because he’s good-looking

149
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,699
so he’d attract the client.

150
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:56,920
He’s useless.

151
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:02,939
He probably thinks he’s talented

152
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,905
being in the same team with only seniors.

153
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:07,742
It’s true what they say. All he has is looks.

154
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:13,500
Let’s go inside, Boss.

155
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:40,011
Karan.

156
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:42,297
You forgot your notebook.

157
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,007
When it dropped, the Post-it fell off, so I put it back.

158
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:07,896
Your notes are very easy to understand and complete.

159
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,219
I noted down roughly only a few lines on my phone.

160
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:16,900
I can’t even remember what some of them mean.

161
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:24,717
Yours are so organized that I knew where to put the Post-it back.

162
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:27,905
Let me guess.

163
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,808
When you’re in university, you must be...

164
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:35,312
the owner of the exam prep notes

165
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:38,585
that the whole faculty passes around and doesn’t know where they came from.

166
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,080
Even though I wrote my name on them,

167
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,780
people didn’t believe they were mine.

168
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,617
They thought my fans summarized them for me.

169
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,170
That’s so sad.

170
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:55,186
Forget it.

171
00:11:57,714 --> 00:12:00,097
You can keep the notebook.

172
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:01,291
I probably won’t need it anymore.

173
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:03,407
No.

174
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:05,496
You should keep it.

175
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,989
You might not have gotten to use it today,

176
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:09,697
but you might need it later.

177
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,600
I can see

178
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,619
how hard you worked on your research.

179
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,008
Seeing this makes me feel like an even bigger loser.

180
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:23,699
I used to be jealous that you were born very handsome

181
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:26,020
and thought you probably wouldn’t have any difficulties.

182
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:31,460
But now I realize you don’t work less hard than anyone else.

183
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:35,260
Maybe you work even harder.

184
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,201
But I ruined everything today.

185
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:42,139
I might get fired tomorrow.

186
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,305
But you didn’t do anything wrong.

187
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:49,007
I’m glad you were brave enough to reject the client.

188
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,407
No one should have to deal with that.

189
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:55,808
I feel so useless today.

190
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,605
No.

191
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:02,702
At least you helped me

192
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:07,217
when you drank that wine for me.

193
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,266
Thank you.

194
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:16,730
And even though the boss said that,

195
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:19,411
he wouldn’t fire you.

196
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:24,608
The team would struggle without a talented guy like you.

197
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:39,509
(This is the first time I feel like someone’s really interested in my hard work.)

198
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:44,020
(This is the first time someone confirms)

199
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:47,302
(that I didn’t get everything just because of my looks.)

200
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:50,823
(The first time in my life.)

201
00:13:57,373 --> 00:13:58,805
Cry it all out.

202
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:01,007
I have a memory-erasing pen.

203
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:03,900
I won’t remember anything.

204
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:07,019
I want you to have it.

205
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:19,706
(Even though I know what he said is nonsense,)

206
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,103
(it really makes me feel better.)

207
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,579
(Ever since that day,)

208
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:50,016
(I’ve always unknowingly looked for Achi.)

209
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:54,648
Achi.

210
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,422
Hmm?

211
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:04,444
(Suddenly, everything he does looks cute to me.)

212
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:08,684
Done.

213
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,545
Yeah?

214
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,749
My sibling’s kid will surely love it.

215
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:15,848
You can leave early since it’s your sibling’s kid’s birthday.

216
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:17,202
I can put these away myself.

217
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,348
- Thanks.
- No problem.

218
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:19,853
- Bye.
- Bye.

219
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:25,140
(More importantly, he really is kind to everyone.)

220
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,346
(The more I observe, the more I learn...)

221
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:35,376
(he’s making everything in the company run smoothly)

222
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:38,982
(without anyone realizing it at all.)

223
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,502
(Seeing Achi spend all day taking care of the whole office)

224
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:59,737
(makes me wonder)

225
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:02,536
(who takes care of him.)

226
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:15,656
(Can I be the one)

227
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,546
(who always takes care of Achi?)

228
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:51,937

Can I help you with anything?

236
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:32,847
Uh…

237
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,647
Well…

238
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:40,047
Well…

239
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,816
Can I get a pen?

240
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:51,558
What color do you want this time?

241
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:52,457
Black, please.

242
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:00,945
Thank you.

Hold on, Karan.

244
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:07,740
I need to talk to you.

245
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:17,244
This week, you’ve requested three pens already.

246
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:19,053
Please use them sparingly.

247
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,053
You lost them, didn’t you?

248
00:18:30,214 --> 00:18:32,254
Take this pen holder.

249
00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:35,623
Once you finish using your pens, put them in here,

250
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,645
so you won’t lose them again.

251
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,946
Thank you so much, Achi.

252
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,543
(Can I consider this a Valentine’s gift from Achi?)

253
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,542
(What I’ve been doing since then...)

254
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,500
(I guess I really have to stop.)

255
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,210
[I’m not feeling well today.]

256
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:48,170
[I’ll take a sick leave and go to a doctor.]

257
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:04,862
We’ll see each other anyway.

258
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:08,457
It doesn’t matter if I’m ready or not.

They’re inside.

00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,848
Look. The documents are here.

262
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:49,099
Carry this for me, Rock.

263
00:20:49,244 --> 00:20:50,105
Okay.

264
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:55,180
The office is so lonely without Karan, isn’t it?

265
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,143
There’s no one to cheer us up.

266
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:02,743
Go.

267
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:06,447
Is Karan absent?

268
00:21:07,202 --> 00:21:12,448
Oh, he volunteered to go on a work trip in Chiang Mai for Mr. Tanaka.

269
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:13,847
I’m so jealous.

270
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,638
I want to travel to Chiang Mai for free too.

271
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,143
Start by getting to work.

272
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:18,348
Go.

277
00:22:05,614 --> 00:22:07,933
Why are there so many books like this?

278
00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:10,928
Does the author even have a partner?

279
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:12,100
How can I check?

280
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,225
I can’t believe I have to rely on a how-to book.

281
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:26,905
I’m even hallucinating now.

Jinta, your eyes are problematic.

Hey, Jinta.

285
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:49,930
He’s really here?

00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:57,057
You read these things too?

Well…

288
00:23:02,736 --> 00:23:06,337
A writer must read everything related to work.

289
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,543
I see.

290
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,468
Is your next book a romance novel?

291
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:16,534
How do you know that?

292
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:18,902
Well, you’re in front of a dating how-to shelf.

(Don’t tell me he’s asking me on a date.)

296

Wear a nice outfit.

297
00:23:34,251 --> 00:23:36,127

It sounds like a good date

309
00:24:06,716 --> 00:24:10,248
but it might be hard for someone who’s not talkative to start a conversation.

310

Is your character good at making conversations?

311

No.

He’s bad at it.

313
00:24:15,474 --> 00:24:17,586
His social skills suck.

314
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:19,463
His romantic level is zero.

315
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:22,287
What does the character like to do then?

316
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,185

How can they read it together?

319
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:30,007
You have to consider reading speed

320
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:31,444
and book genres.

321
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,957

00:28:46,004 --> 00:28:47,531
I usually don’t get the sun.

370
00:28:51,808 --> 00:28:53,271
(4:40 p.m.)

371
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:17,429
(Karan would normally come up and roll down the blinds)

372
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:23,140
(even though the sun doesn’t even reach his desk.)

373
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:34,246
(How many years has he been getting hot water at 1:30 p.m. every day)

374
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:37,234
(even though he doesn’t drink coffee?)

375
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:16,034
(8:50 a.m.)

376
00:30:30,106 --> 00:30:33,134
(Getting hit by the elevator doors today was not a coincidence. )

377
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:38,145
(I’m used to being taken care of by Karan.)

378
00:30:47,672 --> 00:30:49,034
(Magic pen.)

379
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:58,016
[Achirawit]

380
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:00,429
(This is…)

381
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,733
You can erase my memory, Karan.

382
00:31:10,422 --> 00:31:11,733
I won’t remember a thing.

383
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,029
What happened today will definitely be a secret.

384
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:28,331
Mr. Achi, please look at this pen.

385
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:41,143
(He’s kept it since then.)

386
00:31:46,766 --> 00:31:47,606
[Calling Karan]

387
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:55,782
(Sorry, the number you’ve dialed is not available at this time.)

388
00:31:56,506 --> 00:32:01,232
(At the very least, Karan deserves to know that I’ve never hated him.)

389
00:32:03,995 --> 00:32:05,106
I like you, Achi.

390
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:08,696
(I had no idea it’s been so hard for Karan.)

391
00:32:11,444 --> 00:32:14,705
(I had no idea Karan was this serious.)

392
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:25,543
(I had no idea)

393
00:32:26,354 --> 00:32:28,983
(Karan had been hiding his feelings for so many years.)

394
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:37,382
(I don’t want him to hurt because of me anymore, not even another minute.)

395
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,026
Pai.

396
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:47,869
Do you know Karan’s return flight?

397
00:32:47,876 --> 00:32:49,937
I have something very important to talk about with him.

398
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:03,505
Is it okay that we left work early?

399
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,231
It would be okay if it’s just me and Achi.

400
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,323
Why did you have to come with us?

401
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,792
That hurts, you know.

402
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:14,343
I got a taxi for you.

403
00:33:14,897 --> 00:33:16,857
I asked you to get it, not invite you to come.

404
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:18,654
I saw you two got super excited.

405
00:33:18,672 --> 00:33:21,109
Can’t I have something exciting in my life too?

406
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:22,737
Let’s go.

407
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:23,607
Go straight.

408
00:33:44,093 --> 00:33:45,011
Achi,

409
00:33:45,195 --> 00:33:47,182
we have 40 minutes before the plane lands.

410
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:49,111
Shall we take a seat while waiting?

411
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,502
Do you want to eat?

412
00:33:56,146 --> 00:33:57,206
Hello, Duj.

413
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,259
(Where did you guys run off to?)

414
00:33:59,277 --> 00:34:02,337
(I struggled to come up with an excuse to distract the boss.)

415
00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:04,063
We’re at Don Mueang Airport.

416
00:34:04,074 --> 00:34:06,406
We have something important to talk about with Karan.

417
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:07,711
(You need to talk to Karan?)

418
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:09,217
(Then why didn’t you go to Suvarnabhumi Airport?)

419
00:34:09,232 --> 00:34:10,163
What?

420
00:34:12,048 --> 00:34:13,905
Suvarnabhumi Airport?

421
00:34:15,646 --> 00:34:16,342
Okay.

422
00:34:19,472 --> 00:34:20,915
I wouldn’t be able to make it in time.

423
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:22,097
Of course not.

424
00:34:22,256 --> 00:34:24,013
Let’s talk to him tomorrow.

425
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,382
Or we can call him.

426
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:26,589
We should be able to talk to him after he lands.

427
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,011
Stop talking.

428
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:30,440
You can’t say that after bringing us to the wrong airport.

429
00:34:30,557 --> 00:34:31,816
It’s okay.

430
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,317
Rock is right.

431
00:34:33,617 --> 00:34:34,517
I can talk to him some other day.

432
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:35,666
No.

433
00:34:35,817 --> 00:34:39,481
The fact that you left work early means it can’t wait.

434
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,546
We’ll get there in time.

435
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:41,629
I won’t give up.

436
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:45,177
Follow me.

437
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:47,308
Wait for me.

438
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:48,755
Excuse me.

439
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,651
Excuse me.

440
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,937
We need to get to Suvarnabhumi Airport ASAP.

441
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:51,770
Three people can’t ride together.

442
00:34:51,782 --> 00:34:52,906
The police will arrest us.

443
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,906
You go alone, Achi.

444
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:57,265
But it’s very far

445
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,029
and I’m not familiar with the route.

446
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,752
A round-trip would be like a hundred kilometers.

447
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:01,423
It’s far.

448
00:35:01,438 --> 00:35:02,425
It’s hot.

449
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:03,897
The sun will be in my eyes.

450
00:35:03,912 --> 00:35:05,653
It doesn’t help that I have to ride to the west.

451
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:07,297
And it’s almost time people get off work.

452
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:09,105
Okay, listen.

453
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:10,914
Please wait here.

454
00:35:11,084 --> 00:35:13,917
Keep my ID and phone number.

455
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:17,422
Here’s the rent for your motorbike.

456
00:35:18,705 --> 00:35:19,515
Achi.

457
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:22,025
Hey.

458
00:35:22,844 --> 00:35:23,828
Let’s go, Achi.

459
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:26,588
Pai, what about me?

460
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:27,463
Just follow us quickly

461
00:35:27,474 --> 00:35:29,127
and bring him too.

462
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,924
What?

463
00:35:31,915 --> 00:35:32,739
Hey!

464
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,471
How could they take my motorbike like that?

465
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:35,868
What now?

466
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:47,303
Pai, you can go slowly.

467
00:35:47,554 --> 00:35:48,407
I can’t.

468
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,423
We’re going out of our way to do this.

469
00:35:49,437 --> 00:35:50,608
We’ll get there in time.

470
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:53,166
Hold on tight, Achi.

471
00:36:02,163 --> 00:36:02,813
Hey.

472
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:03,758
Hey.

473
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:05,246
What’s wrong with this motorbike?

474
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,411
What’s going on?

475
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:10,126
It ran out of gas.

476
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:13,686
You go ahead, Achi.

477
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:15,019
The airport is just over there.

478
00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:16,514
Rock will probably catch up with me soon.

479
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,927
Thank you so much, Pai.

480
00:36:17,946 --> 00:36:18,814
No worries.

481
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:20,986
Keep going, Achi.

482
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,314
Pai.

483
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:56,207
Here.

484
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:03,813
So you’re late because you stopped to buy this.

485
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:05,806
I was worried about you.

486
00:37:05,878 --> 00:37:08,186
It was a long ride and the sun was hot.

487
00:37:08,386 --> 00:37:09,477
Thanks.

488
00:37:15,286 --> 00:37:16,411
Refreshing, isn’t it?

489
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:20,114
Where’s Achi?

490
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:23,508
I let him continue on his own.

491
00:37:23,814 --> 00:37:25,711
Our job is done.

492
00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:27,426
What is this really about?

493
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,117
Are you really not going to tell me?

494
00:37:29,198 --> 00:37:31,106
You asked me to follow you.

495
00:37:31,337 --> 00:37:32,619
Honestly,

496
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:36,617
I don’t know what’s going on.

497
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:43,109
I just know that it’s important to someone I have good feelings for.

498
00:37:44,494 --> 00:37:46,385
You like Achi?

499
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:48,786
Not like that.

500
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,610
I have good feelings for him because

501
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:53,610
he’s always been good to me.

502
00:37:53,825 --> 00:37:56,666
If there’s anything I can help him with, I want to do it.

503
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:59,623
Going out of my way to help someone

504
00:38:00,123 --> 00:38:02,708
actually makes me feel good.

505
00:38:03,727 --> 00:38:06,820
Right now, I’m so relieved.

506
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:11,817
How nice.

507
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:14,622
Yeah, it’s very nice.

508
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,211
Senior.

509
00:38:18,388 --> 00:38:19,186
Hmm?

510
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:21,023
I have something to tell you.

511
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:22,324
What is it?

512
00:38:25,194 --> 00:38:26,942
You’re very special.

513
00:38:28,244 --> 00:38:31,123
Everything you do is so cool.

514
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:34,441
I’d say someone like you is one in a hundred.

515
00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:36,343
No, you’re one in a million.

516
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:41,828
For sure.

517
00:38:46,398 --> 00:38:47,914
So lucky I met you.

518
00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:55,349
Since you already returned your motorbike,

519
00:38:56,274 --> 00:38:57,428
I’ll give you a ride

520
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:58,715
then I’ll return mine too.

521
00:39:00,691 --> 00:39:01,428
Okay.

522
00:39:02,564 --> 00:39:03,807
Sounds like a plan, Junior.

523
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,288
You must call me Senior now

524
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:06,166
because I’m giving you a ride.

525
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:07,416
Is that so?

526
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:09,416
Let’s go before it’s dark.

527
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:11,044
I’ll ride safely.

528
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,985
Don’t worry.

529
00:39:12,826 --> 00:39:14,388
I’m starting to worry after you said that.

530
00:39:14,404 --> 00:39:15,211
Hey.

531
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:16,416
Be careful.

532
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,620
(Am I too late?)

533
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:11,810
Achi.

534
00:40:42,694 --> 00:40:44,013
What are you doing here?

535
00:40:44,632 --> 00:40:46,465
I want to talk to you about the other night.

536
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:51,708
I made you feel uncomfortable, didn’t I?

537
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:54,677
Don’t worry.

538
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:59,422
Can you try to forget it?

539
00:40:59,432 --> 00:41:00,527
I can’t.

540
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:04,625
It’s time you hear my feelings out.

541
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,955
All this time, I admit I’ve been confused.

542
00:41:12,487 --> 00:41:14,420
I don’t know why you like me

543
00:41:17,235 --> 00:41:20,773
when we’re so different.

544
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:31,914
I don’t know what love is.

545
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:38,286
I don’t know what feeling comfortable with you around means,

546
00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:45,068
what feeling good when you see the good in me means,

547
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:49,111
or what my heart beating fast when you take care of me means.

548
00:41:51,863 --> 00:41:52,706
Achi.

549
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:04,309
Before this, I didn’t know what to answer you.

550
00:42:08,463 --> 00:42:14,628
But reflecting on my feelings has made me realize

551
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:19,426
that all these things I’ve been feeling

552
00:42:20,734 --> 00:42:22,588
is not just acknowledging your feelings.

553
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,411
It means...

554
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:29,010
I have feelings for you too.

555
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:34,515
I really like you, Karan.

556
00:42:55,008 --> 00:42:56,706
I’m not dreaming, am I?

557
00:42:59,062 --> 00:42:59,914
No.

558
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:02,117
You’re not dreaming.

559
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:12,109
(This is the first time)

560
00:43:13,595 --> 00:43:15,829
(I’m not hearing any voices in Karan’s head.)

561
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:23,207
(But I can still feel how he feels anyway.)

562
00:43:28,368 --> 00:43:32,920
(Maybe I gained this magic)

563
00:43:36,136 --> 00:43:38,619
(because the angels empathize with Karan.)

564
00:43:41,503 --> 00:43:44,711
(Karan is really God’s favorite son.)

565
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:00,614
Do you like watching the sunset?

566
00:44:01,189 --> 00:44:02,757
Do you want to watch it together this Saturday?

567
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,887
What do you mean?

568
00:44:03,905 --> 00:44:04,740
Our first date.

569
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:06,500
(Just you wait.)

570
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:07,640
(I’ll surprise you all day.)

571
00:44:07,669 --> 00:44:09,311
(I’m going on a date. I must look handsome.)

572
00:44:09,323 --> 00:44:10,422
When you’re not wearing glasses,

573
00:44:10,438 --> 00:44:11,047
you also look cute.

574
00:44:12,251 --> 00:44:14,028
Why are you so good to me?

575
00:44:14,094 --> 00:44:15,543
Why don’t you try to look at me in a new way?

576
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:17,371
When a man buys you a shirt,

577
00:44:17,385 --> 00:44:19,761
it means he wants to be the one to take it off.

578
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,761
I want to take you somewhere quiet

579
00:44:21,857 --> 00:44:22,745
so we can be alone.

580
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:23,486
(Huh?)

581
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:33,576
[At the very least, Karan deserves to know that I’ve never hated him.]
