Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,600
Pai.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,020
I have something very important to talk about with Karan.

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,810
Keep going, Achi.

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,120
(At the very least,)

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,880
(Karan deserves to know)

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,350
(that I’ve never hated him.)

11
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,500
It’s time you hear my feelings out.

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,240
Achi.

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,130
Reflecting on my feelings

14
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,300
has made me realize

15
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,420
I have feelings for you too.

16
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,800
I’m not dreaming, am I?

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,810
No.

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,400
You’re not dreaming.

19
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,090
Ugh!

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,980
I can’t think of anything.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,980
Can you give me an example?

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,360
Try adding some emotions

23
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,100
so the client can relate to our product more easily.

24
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,700
How?

25
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,700
Okay.

26
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,220
We have a pen, a notebook,

27
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,500
and a camera.

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,710
How do you think they’re related?

29
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,250
They’re used to record things?

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,400
Yes.

31
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,600
You’re getting cleverer.

32
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,110
Every moment in our life

33
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,910
happens in just a split second.

34
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,820
It comes and then it’s gone forever.

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,220
Both what we think and what we see.

36
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,800
That’s why we need to record it.

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,800
Today’s sunset is the same way.

38
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,100
It only happens once.

39
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,820
Is that Achi and Karan?

40
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:55,830
Achi!

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,600
Hey.

42
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,000
(Every moment in our life happens in just a split second.)

43
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,500
They might be talking about work.

44
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,500
Getting off work early is nice, isn’t it?

45
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,800
Because we get to see something like this.

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,200
The sky is beautiful today.

47
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,400
Do you like watching the sunset?

48
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,090
Look.

49
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,510
This is so cute.

50
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,200
Mine is more beautiful.

51
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,400
I think a good day is when we get to see the sunrise

52
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,000
and the sunset with our own eyes.

53
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,400
The orange light

54
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,900
seems to have some kind of good energy.

55
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,730
Seeing it makes me happy.

56
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,410
Do you want to watch it together this Saturday?

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,710
What do you mean?

58
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,810
Our first date.

59
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,900
I want us to spend time together.

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,400
(And I want to make you like me more.)

61
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,530
[Going on a date.]

62
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,010
[10 Ways to Impress on Your First Date]
[Read if You Don’t Want to Fail]

63
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,090
[“Smiling is the way to win their heart.”]

64

65
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,290
(Eating.)
[“Eating, watching a movie, walking hand in hand,
and getting to know each other are the basics of a date.”]

66
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:08,500
(Eating.)

67
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,690
(Watching a movie. Walking hand in hand.)

68
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,700
(I think that’s about it.)

69
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,950
(Relax. Nothing will be difficult.)

70
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,730
[But who knows? If the weather or the vibe is right,]
[your date might turn out to be]
[the hottest night you’ll never forget.]

71
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,630
[But who knows? If the weather or the vibe is right,]

72
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,650
[your date might turn out to be]

73
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,310
[the hottest night you’ll never forget.]

74
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,490
[Calling Jinta]

75
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,490
Pick up the phone, Jinta!

76
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,130
(Never mind. It’s okay.)

77
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,100
(At least I have mind reading power.)

78
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,100
(I’ll just deal with it when the time comes.)

79
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,490
But what’s that four-eyes doing?

80
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,370
[Achi]

81
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,120
Are you sure I can come and play with Madam Noi here?

82
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,970
Of course.

83
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,450
Don’t think you’re troubling me.

84
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,270
You don’t need a reason to come over.

85
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,200
You’re welcome to hang out here anytime.

86
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,600
We’re not strangers.

87
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,150
Then I’ll cuddle you all over.

88
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,610
(This is so you.)

89
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,930
Can I kiss you like this?

90
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,730
(Great.)

91
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,610
(I’ve never wanted to be Madam Noi so much as I do now.)

92
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,900
By the way, don’t you have to go anywhere today?

93
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,130
I have to submit my manuscript today

94
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,900
so I think I’ll go over it one more time.

95
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,050
You already finished it?

96
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,020
Good job.

97
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,300
I want to read it.

98
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,100
Is this the novel you said you researched on me for?

99
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,100
Yes.

100
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,010
You want to read it?

101
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,700
Come here.

102
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,200
Did I startle you?

103
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,810
No.

104
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,010
Go ahead and read it.

105
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,900
A dream is only beautiful

106
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,370
when accomplished.

107
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,410
Because if not, it’ll turn to the pain you feel when you think of it.

108
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,070
Just like the light far away,

109
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,220
you might not be able to reach it anytime soon,

110
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,250
but it’s wonderful

111
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,400
and lives up to its reputation.

112
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,800
Is it that bad?

113
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,800
Who says?

114
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,400
If I came across this book

115
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,360
and this sentence on a bad day,

116
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,980
I’d definitely get the energy to do everything.

117
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,660
How did you come up with it?

118
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,450
From what you told me about how much you want to be an idol.

119
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,610
Those dance moves you have to keep practicing.

120
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,210
Your shoes that got broken after getting jumped and stepped on over and over.

121
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,500
You know what?

122
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,820
I call all of that dedication.

123
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,300
Thank you.

124
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,820
For what?

125
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,260
For understanding

126
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,860
that my dream is not a joke.

127
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,850
Thank you so much, too,

128
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,280
for inspiring me to write with a different kind of feeling

129
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,370
that I’ve never experienced before.

130
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,400
It’s good.

131
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,140
It’s really good.

132
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,450
[Annoying!]

133
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,400
See what you think about this part.

134
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,700
I’ll pick you up at your house in the morning.

135
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,900
5 a.m.?

136
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,050
So early.

137
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,380
(Karan is so well-dressed.)

138
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,900
(Even on a weekend when he wears a simple outfit, he still looks good.)

139
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,600
(Look at me.)

140
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,700
(We look like we’re going to different places.)

141
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,170
(Are we even suitable to walk together?)

142
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,340
I wanted to come early so we could do many things together.

143
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,530
Okay.

144
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,300
Shall we start

145
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,890
with this?

146
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,300
(Huh? Flowers?)

147
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,530
Don’t tell me…

148
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:29,611
(I hope Achi will have fun and enjoy everything I prepared.)

149
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,010
(How many things did he prepare?)

150
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:33,674
(I hope nothing goes wrong.)

151
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:35,014
(Please let all go to plan.)

152
00:11:35,023 --> 00:11:36,280
(Plan?)

153
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,554
(This seems even more serious than his sales presentation.)

154
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,634
(I hope today ends with a good feeling)

155
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:43,604
(like I intended.)

156
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:44,802
(Amen.)

157
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:46,020
Are you done, young man?

158
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,020
The line is all the way to the end of the lane now.

159
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,850
I’m sorry.

160
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,380
I rarely get to give food offerings.

161
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,600
Let’s go, Achi.

162
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,600
Where are we going next?

163
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:15,770
Let’s go.

164
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,280
(Just you wait.)

165
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,640
(I’ll surprise you all day.)

166
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,940
Because a first date only happens once,

167
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,610
I’ll do everything to impress you, Achi.

168
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,910
I’m a regular here.

169
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,710
There’s one shirt that makes me think of you every time I see it.

170
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,600
Do you want to have a look?

171
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,390
Here you go.

172
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,140
Thank you so much.

173
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,000
You’re welcome.

174
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,470
This one.

175
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,740
- Would you like to try it on now?
- Oh.

176
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,860
I’ll help.

177
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:36,216
(So cute.)

178
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:38,568
(I’ve wanted to dress Achi up for a long time.)

179
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:39,540
(What?)

180
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,340
This really suits you.

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,600
You have a great fashion sense.

182
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,580
I’ll have to ask for your advice sometime.

183
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,200
How about this shirt?

184
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,700
Do you like it?

185
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,050
I like that it doesn’t look too serious.

186
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,090
Yeah.

187
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,290
I like it.

188
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,800
(What? It’s over 6,000 baht?)

189
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,100
But…

190
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,130
Please let me buy it for you.

191
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,590
What? No.

192
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,570
Why would you buy it for me?

193
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,200
As a gift for our first date.

194
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,110
Please.

195
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,810
(Oh, no.)

196
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,300
Please don’t worry, Achi.

197
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,060
I really want to buy this for you.

198
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,130
(I’ll get him something in return then.)

199
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,120
Please cut the tag off.

200
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:26,700
He’ll wear it now.

201
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,780
Of course.

202
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,200
Excuse me for a second.

203
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,850
Excuse me.

204
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,020
May I say something?

205
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,300
(Shit. Does he think I trick him into buying me things?)

206
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:49,770
Well, they say that when a man buys you a shirt,

207
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,210
it means he wants to be the one to take it off.

208
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,700
There’s a theory like that?

209
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,300
(So this means)

210
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,230
[your date might turn out to be the hottest night.]

211
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,500
(Thank god we’re not somewhere with only the two of us.)

212
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,390
We’re all set.

213
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,490
Let’s go.

214
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,800
I’ll take you somewhere quiet.

215
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,610
A secret place where we can be alone.

216
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,840
(What?)

217
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,100
(A secret place where we can be alone?)

218
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,890
(Does this mean…?)

219
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,500
Achi.

220
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,674
I felt bad for Achi and Karan

221
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:50,246
but now I’m the one who has to work on a holiday.

222
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:53,986
I’m sorry I’m making you work overtime.

223
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:56,601
I’ll request for your weekend allowance.

224
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:59,786
RIP to my work-life balance.

225
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:02,574
I hate a full-time job.

226
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,395
Hey!

227
00:16:03,803 --> 00:16:05,226
Do you think I like it so much?

228
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,466
I try to act mature to calm you down

229
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:09,694
because I still can’t fix this problem.

230
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:12,352
Why do you have to give me more stress?

231
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:12,878
I’m sorry.

232
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:13,909
Please relax.

233
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,071
I complained just for the sake of content.

234
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:16,161
I wasn’t serious.

235
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:17,503
I can do everything.

236
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:18,665
Let’s help each other

237
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:19,844
so we can finish this quickly.

238
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,186
Fine.

239
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,991
I’m sorry, too.

240
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:28,948
I’m so upset.

241
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:33,625
Besides, I’m in a period of mood swings for women.

242
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:36,087
You understand, right?

243
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:40,730
I do.

244
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:41,992
It’s okay.

245
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:49,592
By the way, you’ve been working here for four years, right?

246
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:52,480
Yeah.

247
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,647
How has it been?

248
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:55,589
Is this a job you really like?

249
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:57,151
I don’t know.

250
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:00,388
I majored in Japanese, so I wanted to work in a Japanese company.

251
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:02,583
I’d say this is my dream job.

252
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:07,287
But I’ve never really questioned if this is what I like or just what I can do.

253
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:11,493
I get it.

254
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:16,100
I envy you though.

255
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:19,493
You used to have a dream about dancing with your friends.

256
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:22,091
I’ve never had anything like that.

257
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:25,357
Right now, I only hope I can make money from work to support myself

258
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:26,795
and not be a burden to my family.

259
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,105
That’s the best I can hope for.

260
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:34,302
But what do you really want to do?

261
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:39,905
I don’t know.

262
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:43,090
Actually, this may not sound like something big,

263
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:48,794
but eating delicious food,

264
00:17:49,523 --> 00:17:51,691
and watching my favorite series

265
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:55,026
are enough to make me happy.

266
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:11,152
Go now.

267
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,894
Go.

268
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:14,896
[Editor]

269
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:17,497
Hello?

270
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,291
(Mr. Jinta, do you want to hear the good or the bad news first?)

271
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:22,942
The good news, please.

272
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:26,494
(Well, the publisher has agreed to publish your novel.)

273
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:27,690
Really?

274
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:29,232
(Yes.)

275
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,401
(Everyone who has read it loves it so much.)

276
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:32,694
Really?

277
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,389
I’m so happy.

278
00:18:35,607 --> 00:18:37,900
But what’s the bad news?

279
00:18:38,072 --> 00:18:39,093
(Uh…)

280
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,192
(Well…)

281
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:41,834
(Well…)

282
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:43,791
Just say it.

283
00:18:43,887 --> 00:18:46,137
I’m mature enough to listen to bad news.

284
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:47,600
No matter how bad, I can deal with it.

285
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:49,213
Just say it. I’m ready to hear it.

286
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:50,385
Come on. Say it.

287
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:54,300
(I’ll need you to finish the manuscript by the end of this month.)

288
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:55,502
(It’s quite urgent.)

289
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:57,094
(Do you think you can make the deadline?)

290
00:18:58,317 --> 00:18:59,823
Yes, I can.

291
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,395
This bad news makes me very happy.

292
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,351
Thank you.

293
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:04,171
Thank you so much.

294
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:06,297
(I want to compliment you.)

295
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:08,694
(Your work is a lot more mature this time.)

296
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:11,194
(Your character has more people in his life.)

297
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:15,592
(He’s not a lonely guy who’s tired of life anymore.)

298
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:20,186
(No matter who you got inspiration from, go thank him.)

299
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,699
I will.

300
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,597
(By the way, is this guy based on a real person)

301
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:28,093
(or did you make him up?)

302
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,743
He’s definitely a real person.

303
00:19:29,831 --> 00:19:31,786
If I came across this book

304
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,446
and this sentence on a bad day,

305
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:35,001
I’d definitely get the energy to do everything.

306
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,693
[There’s something I really need to thank you for.]

307
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:40,471
[Can I treat you to a meal?]

308
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,496
[Of course.]

309
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:08,986
Hello?

310
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,887
Yeah, come in.

311
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:14,038
I actually wanted to close the shop today

312
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:17,090
but you said you’d bring someone important

313
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:18,792
so I had to open for you.

314
00:20:20,982 --> 00:20:21,696
Okay.

315
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:26,093
Kin.

316
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,789
You finally made it to your friend’s shop.

317
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:45,294
We studied together before I left for America.

318
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:48,299
When I got back, he got so far in life.

319
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:52,093
Only I’m still into this kind of thing.

320
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:56,700
This place seems very serious.

321
00:20:57,294 --> 00:20:59,705
I can tell you really love coffee.

322
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,589
Of course.

323
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,497
Our group of friends is serious about what we do.

324
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:08,789
If we like something, we’re serious about it.

325
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:20,290
The coffee beans are from Doi Chang Pa Pae village in Lamphun.

326
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:23,183
The body is heavy and the taste is rich.

327
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,441
It’s a bit sweet at the tip of the tongue.

328
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:26,995
Try it. I think you’ll like it.

329
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:40,493
It’s really tasty.

330
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:43,632
I haven’t had a good craft coffee like this in a long time.

331
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,262
Drinking it reminds me of home.

332
00:21:49,037 --> 00:21:50,491
Karan briefed me on it.

333
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,294
Can I try it?

334
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:03,989
What?

335
00:22:07,123 --> 00:22:09,291
Normally, my friend doesn’t drink coffee.

336
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:12,546
Today must be really special.

337
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:14,097
Isn’t that right?

338
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:30,001
Enjoy your trip.

339
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:36,860
I’m leaving now.

340
00:22:37,093 --> 00:22:38,343
Hold on.

341
00:22:38,438 --> 00:22:39,706
What are you to each other?

342
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,890
Nothing yet.

343
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:43,890
Okay.

344
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:46,588
I’ll wait for the day you can tell me

345
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:48,588
what you are to each other.

346
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,096
[Answers To Your Eyesight Problems]

347
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,488
(I’m going on a date. I must look handsome.)

348
00:22:58,564 --> 00:23:00,391
(No one would want to walk next to an uncle.)

349
00:23:00,404 --> 00:23:02,071
(My glasses era is over.)

350
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:05,988
(From now on, there’s only the cool Jinta.)

351
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:10,909
No, I’m scared.

352
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,191
Listen.

353
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,887
There’s always a first time for everyone.

354
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:16,386
Do you want to try again or let me help?

355
00:23:16,936 --> 00:23:18,791
Hey, can you keep him still?

356
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:19,355
No.

357
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,843
Let me help you.

358
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:22,040
I’m really scared.

359
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:24,348
I won’t wear them anymore.

360
00:23:25,056 --> 00:23:26,297
Who would even wear them?

361
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:27,694
They’re scary as hell.

362
00:23:46,034 --> 00:23:46,888
What?

363
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:48,188
Can you see?

364
00:23:49,368 --> 00:23:50,186
Yes.

365
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,586
Of course, I can see.

366
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:57,591
When you’re not wearing glasses, you actually look good.

367
00:23:58,451 --> 00:23:59,591
You look a different kind of cute.

368
00:24:01,003 --> 00:24:03,610
(A different kind of cute? Really?)

369
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:06,705
I wear contact lenses now.

370
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:09,102
Let’s wait for the green light and then go.

371
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:10,486
Okay.

372
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:18,693
(To stay a different kind of cute like Min said, blurry vision is not a problem.)

373
00:24:24,668 --> 00:24:25,629
Hey.

374
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:27,434
Are you okay?

375
00:24:27,446 --> 00:24:28,693
Yes, I’m fine.

376
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:40,084
Karan.

377
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:43,088
After scanning, why is my screen showing

378
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,491
18.29?

379
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:46,908
What is it?

380
00:24:48,425 --> 00:24:49,466
You’ll find out.

381
00:24:55,238 --> 00:24:57,748
We’re going to watch the sunset up close.

382
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,342
(What? We’re riding a helicopter?)

383
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:06,438
It’s done!

384
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:09,872
Let’s celebrate.

385
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,857
Celebrate such a small thing as this?

386
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:18,766
You told me that we should find joy in little things.

387
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:19,715
This is it.

388
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:21,569
We got our work done, so we’re going to watch a series

389
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:23,737
and eat delicious things we want.

390
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:26,377
We can create our own happiness just like that.

391
00:26:26,388 --> 00:26:28,377
We don’t have to win Employee of the Year.

392
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:41,136
Why are you so good to me?

393
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,111
You’re tired enough.

394
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:49,646
You’re a leader and you work harder than me.

395
00:26:52,706 --> 00:26:54,665
Actually, I want to apologize too.

396
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:56,742
For what?

397
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,640
I apologize for sometimes being lazy

398
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:03,952
and careless that I’ve become your burden.

399
00:27:05,271 --> 00:27:06,743
But now I understand

400
00:27:07,992 --> 00:27:13,557
that if we do our best in what we have to do,

401
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,146
that’s enough for us to be proud of ourselves.

402
00:27:18,743 --> 00:27:19,751
Okay.

403
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:24,114
Then let’s keep helping each other work.

404
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:32,514
I want to see you happy.

405
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:39,631
Oh.

406
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,915
That’ll stop your cramps.

407
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:45,714
You keep surprising me.

408
00:27:52,456 --> 00:27:54,343
Why don’t you try to look at me in a new way?

409
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:57,552
Maybe you’ll see a different side of me.

410
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:03,844
Okay.

411
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:06,037
Let’s watch a series.

412
00:28:11,182 --> 00:28:12,718
Can we watch this one?

413
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:14,240
Sure.

414
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:16,240
Whatever you want.

415
00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:18,446
This one then.

416
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:34,545
I’m so shy!

417
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:36,714
I ship them.

418
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:52,733
What are you doing?

419
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,567
Taking a photo of the sun.

420
00:28:54,588 --> 00:28:56,038
And accidentally capturing me?

421
00:28:56,183 --> 00:28:57,139
No.

422
00:28:57,327 --> 00:28:58,437
There’s only the sun.

423
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,041
- You’re nowhere in this photo.
- Yeah, right.

424
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:02,935
I look ugly. Throw that away.

425
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,846
(If I can’t see anything,)

426
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:08,164
(I’ll just have to read his mind.)

427
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:12,170
(I’m screwed.)

428
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,032
What’s the occasion for this treat?

429
00:29:15,157 --> 00:29:16,044
Oh.

430
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:18,337
My novel is getting published.

431
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:19,446
Wow.

432
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:20,736
That’s amazing.

433
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,140
You’re so talented.

434
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:23,939
I’m not.

435
00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:26,644
What you said that day gave me confidence.

436
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:28,373
So I think

437
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,597
you’ve played a part in the success of my work.

438
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,241
You’re an inspiration.

439
00:29:34,228 --> 00:29:35,714
I’m your inspiration?

440
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:40,370
I mean, the character in my novel

441
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,352
is partly based on you.

442
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:43,872
Oh.

443
00:29:44,037 --> 00:29:48,675
And you gave me confidence that day.

444
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,278
You’re talented yourself.

445
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:55,872
But I want to eat here anyway.

446
00:30:08,315 --> 00:30:10,837
Then feel free to order anything you’d like.

447
00:30:11,272 --> 00:30:12,837
I don’t want to be presumptuous.

448
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:14,335
Can you order for me?

449
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:16,646
Alright.

450
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:29,295
(Oh, no, Jinta. You’re in trouble.)

451
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:32,354
Well, would you like black ink spaghetti?

452
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,840
I don’t eat squid.

453
00:30:35,121 --> 00:30:36,046
Oh.

454
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:39,343
Sorry.

455
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:41,343
Why apologize?

456
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:43,243
It’s just choosing dishes.

457
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:44,746
We can choose them together.

458
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:46,497
It’s our first time eating together.

459
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:48,847
It’s normal to not know what the other person doesn’t like.

460
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:51,106
We’ll slowly get to know each other.

461
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:55,631
You’re right.

462
00:30:56,253 --> 00:31:00,844
Can you please tell me what you like and don't like?

463
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:02,835
So we can get to know each other better.

464
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,841
Here’s the thing.

465
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,299
I really love Thai food

466
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:12,752
such as Tom Yum Goong and Kaprao.

467
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:15,246
I also love Khai Jiao.

468
00:31:15,246 --> 00:31:15,942
(Just listening)
I also love Khai Jiao.

469
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:16,577
(Just listening)

470
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:17,558
(and looking at him)

471
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,954
(seems to make my feelings clearer.)

472
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:23,201
(I’ll slowly get to know him then.)

473
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:24,786
(It’s better than reading his mind.)

474
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:32,140
We’re so high up we could touch the clouds.

475
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,238
Really?

476
00:31:40,606 --> 00:31:41,949
I love today so much

477
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:44,140
because we get to do this together.

478
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:49,440
Without you, I wouldn’t have had a chance to do anything like this.

479
00:31:51,137 --> 00:31:53,674
Let’s hang out often then.

480
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:56,537
Like this?

481
00:31:57,197 --> 00:31:58,050
Yeah.

482
00:31:58,939 --> 00:31:59,742
Okay.

483
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:00,817
Sure.

484
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:08,431
(In a few seconds, it’ll be 6:29 p.m.)

485
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:13,044
(What? So it's the time?)

486
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:21,237
I want today to be as perfect as it can be.

487
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:24,940
There’s only one more thing I want to do.

488
00:32:25,816 --> 00:32:26,678
What is it?

489
00:32:29,303 --> 00:32:29,998
(Nine.)

490
00:32:31,447 --> 00:32:32,352
(Eight.)

491
00:32:33,444 --> 00:32:34,257
(Seven.)

492
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:37,847
(Oh, it’s today’s sunset time.)

493
00:32:37,865 --> 00:32:40,755
I think a good day is when we get to see the sunrise

494
00:32:40,766 --> 00:32:43,343
and the sunset with our own eyes.

495
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:46,038
(That’s why he came to see me so early in the morning)

496
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:50,875
(and brought me to watch the sunset on the same day)

497
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:52,235
(so up close like this.)

498
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:53,475
(Four.)

499
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:54,552
(Three.)

500
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:55,646
(Two.)

501
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,383
(I’m sorry, Karan.)

502
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:57,924
(One.)

503
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:59,924
(I’m afraid of heights.)

504
00:33:02,652 --> 00:33:03,540
Achi.

505
00:33:04,603 --> 00:33:05,546
Achi.

506
00:33:06,105 --> 00:33:06,905
Achi.

507
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,342
Are you alright, Achi?

508
00:33:10,265 --> 00:33:11,035
Achi.

509
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,515
I’m so weak.

510
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:29,143
When I’m sick, I never can take care of myself.

511
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,471
You take care of me every time.

512
00:33:32,326 --> 00:33:33,598
It’s no problem at all.

513
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,598
You probably didn’t have enough sleep.

514
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:37,737
Also, it was a hot day.

515
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,477
This shirt must be the cause of it.

516
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:44,924
Please take a lot of rest.

517
00:33:45,615 --> 00:33:46,437
Okay.

518
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:49,878
Thank you for today.

519
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:52,943
Thank you too.

520
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:56,139
I’m leaving now.

521
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:57,074
Okay.

522
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:20,546
It’s so great, dude.

523
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,777
I never thought going with the flow would make everything go so smoothly.

524
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:26,777
Min and I can talk about so many things.

525
00:34:27,176 --> 00:34:28,872
And I’m not tense anymore.

526
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,637
Hey.

527
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:37,497
I’ve told you so many times that if you’re not going to eat the garlic,

528
00:34:37,506 --> 00:34:38,843
you shouldn’t order this dish.

529
00:34:38,855 --> 00:34:40,736
I want to eat fried pork bones with garlic

530
00:34:40,749 --> 00:34:42,268
but I don’t eat garlic.

531
00:34:42,721 --> 00:34:44,675
I’m scared to order it without garlic.

532
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:45,748
I don’t want to be scolded.

533
00:34:46,146 --> 00:34:50,437
Because you don’t speak up, you end up being miserable alone like this.

534
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:52,102
It’s not just about the garlic.

535
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:54,831
I bet you didn’t tell Karan you were afraid of heights.

536
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:57,746
It seemed hard to book

537
00:34:57,877 --> 00:34:59,249
and it was expensive.

538
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,831
He’d probably already paid for it.

539
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:05,582
If I’d chickened out in front of him, don’t you think it’d have hurt him?

540
00:35:05,595 --> 00:35:08,992
But do you think he was happy to see you faint up there?

541
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:13,841
What should I do?

542
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:16,441
Just be honest with him.

543
00:35:17,435 --> 00:35:19,940
Even though I know he’ll feel uncomfortable?

544
00:35:19,955 --> 00:35:21,838
It’s called learning

545
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,540
and getting to know each other.

546
00:35:23,758 --> 00:35:24,594
Got it?

547
00:35:27,853 --> 00:35:29,398
What’s up with you today?

548
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:31,992
Why do you suddenly seem like an expert?

549
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,342
Call me Master.

550
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:39,069
Master Jinta.

551
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,994
Anyway, go talk to him honestly.

552
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:46,272
Don’t keep your feelings to yourself like this.

553
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:47,936
It could become a problem later.

554
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:52,546
Today, I didn’t use my magical power at all.

555
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,743
When I couldn’t see things clearly,

556
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,841
I tried so much harder to look.

557
00:36:03,586 --> 00:36:06,422
As a result, I saw what I’d never seen before

558
00:36:07,718 --> 00:36:11,040
and heard what I’d never paid attention to before.

559
00:36:12,748 --> 00:36:16,524
I think that’s the start of a good relationship.

560
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:22,877
What?

561
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:23,791
What’s wrong with you?

562
00:36:26,493 --> 00:36:27,909
I’m practicing being serious.

563
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:35,137
It’s kind of stressful.

564
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:38,136
It’s okay, dude.

565
00:36:38,815 --> 00:36:40,406
I’ll help you with the garlic today.

566
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:41,743
I’ll pick them out for you

567
00:36:42,228 --> 00:36:43,446
so you can eat easily.

568
00:36:44,103 --> 00:36:45,995
It’ll get better. Just keep trying.

569
00:36:54,855 --> 00:36:56,237
Is everything alright?

570
00:36:56,803 --> 00:36:58,237
Why did you want to see me here?

571
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:00,437
Well...

572
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:06,543
I’ve not been feeling very comfortable.

573
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:08,838
I want to talk about yesterday.

574
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:10,791
You didn’t enjoy the date, did you?

575
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,849
Don’t get me wrong.

576
00:37:17,127 --> 00:37:18,712
Actually, it was good.

577
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,629
It was really good.

578
00:37:21,515 --> 00:37:24,149
I was happy and excited

579
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:25,914
about what you prepared for me.

580
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:30,712
Every minute we were together was special.

581
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:32,463
But…

582
00:37:32,475 --> 00:37:34,312
But I wasn’t very comfortable

583
00:37:36,597 --> 00:37:38,634
with you buying me a shirt.

584
00:37:39,575 --> 00:37:41,053
I really didn’t want to trouble you.

585
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:44,837
When we were drinking coffee with your friend,

586
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:47,939
I also didn’t know what to do.

587
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,349
I don’t know how he felt about me going with you like that.

588
00:37:56,923 --> 00:37:58,660
And about the helicopter trip,

589
00:38:00,135 --> 00:38:05,043
I was wrong for not telling you how afraid of heights I was.

590
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:09,840
I completely ruined it.

591
00:38:12,152 --> 00:38:16,841
You gave your all into preparing everything

592
00:38:18,323 --> 00:38:20,535
but I was such a bad date.

593
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:34,114
I was so worried too.

594
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,536
I was afraid that anything too ordinary wouldn’t impress you.

595
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:45,025
I just wanted our first date to turn out the best

596
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:50,155
but I didn’t even ask if you liked it.

597
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:59,647
Karan, I actually don’t want anything special.

598
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:06,143
Just being together and talking with each other like this

599
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:09,441
is special enough.

600
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,512
Yesterday before I fainted,

601
00:39:18,832 --> 00:39:20,139
what were you going to say?

602
00:39:27,078 --> 00:39:30,040
I used to think that if I had feelings for someone

603
00:39:31,671 --> 00:39:36,336
just being by their side would be enough to make me happy

604
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:41,392
but yesterday, a question came up in my mind.

605
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:43,789
I’ll wait for the day you can tell me

606
00:39:44,129 --> 00:39:45,844
what you are to each other.

607
00:39:48,717 --> 00:39:51,139
At least I want to confidently tell my friend

608
00:39:52,895 --> 00:39:54,345
what you are in my life

609
00:39:56,392 --> 00:39:59,345
and I want you to be sure about us.

610
00:40:01,926 --> 00:40:06,142
♪ Might seem like I overstate ♪

611
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:11,940
♪ An honest opinion, nevertheless ♪

612
00:40:17,638 --> 00:40:19,136
I prepared this necklace

613
00:40:20,031 --> 00:40:22,229
and planned to give it to you yesterday while watching the sunset together.

614
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,850
(But I also want you to remember the shirt, the coffee beans,

615
00:40:44,012 --> 00:40:48,109
and the helicopter ride as good memories from our first date.)

616
00:41:04,622 --> 00:41:07,835
I’ve been setting the alarm for sunrise and sunset every day

617
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:11,339
since you said getting to watch them would be very special.

618
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,145
(Three.)

619
00:41:23,305 --> 00:41:24,115
(Two.)

620
00:41:27,712 --> 00:41:28,529
(One.)

621
00:41:31,132 --> 00:41:31,957
Achi.

622
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:38,351
Will you be my boyfriend?

00:41:45,345 --> 00:41:50,444

624
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:53,539

00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:56,155

00:41:56,176 --> 00:41:58,438

♪ If my heart says ‘love’ often loudly ♪

628
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:04,158
It’s not just because of the special things Karan prepared.

629
00:42:04,549 --> 00:42:07,443
It’s also Karan himself who made it special.

630

Keep it down.

635
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,973
They all heard my story now.

636
00:42:34,991 --> 00:42:36,017
Sorry.

637
00:42:36,717 --> 00:42:39,631
I’m just so excited that my friend is finally off the market.

638
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:46,022
But does this mean

639
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:50,299
you already did it with Mr. Karan?

640
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:52,295
Not yet.

641
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:52,983
You're crazy.

642
00:42:52,997 --> 00:42:53,918
You pervert.

643
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,315
Pervert?

644
00:42:55,751 --> 00:43:00,320
I’m just asking if you’ve talked with him about your magical power.

645
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,121
Not yet.

646
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,320
And I’m scared to tell him.

647
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,398
If he finds out I’ve secretly been reading his mind all along,

648
00:43:11,274 --> 00:43:12,792
I don’t know what’ll happen.

649
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,918
He might hate me.

650
00:43:17,114 --> 00:43:18,336
Then don’t tell him.

651
00:43:18,775 --> 00:43:19,523
Huh?

652
00:43:19,951 --> 00:43:21,194
I mean if you

653
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:25,524
lose your virginity to him,

654
00:43:27,035 --> 00:43:28,712
you’ll lose your magical power, right?

655
00:43:29,437 --> 00:43:30,705
Are you crazy?

656
00:43:30,977 --> 00:43:32,705
No. I haven’t thought about that.

657
00:43:33,604 --> 00:43:34,649
Fine.

658
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,306
I only suggested a solution.

659
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:49,315
Achi.

660
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:50,817
Hmm?

661
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:55,072
This is where we’re going on a date this Saturday.

662
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:56,155
Do you like it?

663
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:57,817
Whoa.

664
00:43:58,043 --> 00:43:59,508
You researched places to go?

665
00:43:59,855 --> 00:44:01,912
I want to make it up for our previous date.

666
00:44:02,385 --> 00:44:04,124
This time, I want to do something you really like.

667
00:44:04,317 --> 00:44:04,958
What do you think?

668
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:05,911
Do you like it?

669
00:44:08,102 --> 00:44:08,924
I like it.

670
00:44:09,543 --> 00:44:10,312
Thank you.

671
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,646
I’ll make a reservation then.

672
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:13,437
Okay.

673
00:44:17,548 --> 00:44:19,121
(What time should I make the reservation?)

674
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,820
(7 p.m. should be good.)

675
00:44:22,735 --> 00:44:24,231
(But will Achi be hungry?)

676
00:44:24,963 --> 00:44:25,969
7 p.m. sounds good.

677
00:44:25,977 --> 00:44:27,115
I’m okay with that.

678
00:44:29,397 --> 00:44:31,675
How did you know I was thinking about that?

679
00:44:36,315 --> 00:44:37,315
Well,

680
00:44:41,419 --> 00:44:43,677
I guessed from your facial expression.

681
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,417
My facial expression?

682
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:48,477
You’re a good guesser.

683
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:50,477
I thought you could read minds.

684
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:55,672
But who would be able to do that?

685
00:44:58,019 --> 00:44:59,016
I know.

686
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,521
Hi, Duj.

687
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,921
(Achi, are you coming back upstairs soon?)

688
00:45:07,954 --> 00:45:10,537
(I’d like your help to decorate the office.)

689
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,124
Sure.

690
00:45:17,964 --> 00:45:19,149
Thank you so much, Achi,

691
00:45:19,158 --> 00:45:20,503
for helping me decorate.

692
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:21,354
No worries.

693
00:45:21,754 --> 00:45:24,228
Our boss really loves to celebrate important days, huh?

694
00:45:24,423 --> 00:45:29,635
I remember one World Sea Turtle Day, he made us dress as a turtle to work.

695
00:45:29,649 --> 00:45:30,626
Yes.

696
00:45:30,749 --> 00:45:33,355
That year, I dressed as a green turtle.

697
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,586
Pai dressed as a softshell turtle.

698
00:45:35,597 --> 00:45:37,820
Our shells bumped into each other while walking.

699
00:45:37,923 --> 00:45:41,132
Anyway, there’s one festival our office doesn’t care about.

700
00:45:43,786 --> 00:45:44,715
Is there?

701
00:45:44,749 --> 00:45:45,629
Yes.

702
00:45:46,062 --> 00:45:47,629
Valentine’s Day.

703
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:53,420
You’re right.

704
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,228
I never noticed.

705
00:45:56,152 --> 00:45:56,972
Why is that the case?

706
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:00,623
Because of the company rule prohibiting employees from dating.

707
00:46:01,004 --> 00:46:03,715
Our boss doesn’t want any romance to happen.

708
00:46:04,657 --> 00:46:08,155
Haven’t you noticed that none of the employees are dating each other?

709
00:46:09,597 --> 00:46:12,404
Remember Kitti who left last year?

710
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:14,229
He didn’t leave willingly.

711
00:46:14,243 --> 00:46:15,354
Boss made him leave

712
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:19,395
because he was caught secretly dating Ann from accounting.

713
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:23,816
Why does our office have to keep employees from dating?

714
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:26,232
Mainly to prevent fraud.

715
00:46:26,508 --> 00:46:28,075
Especially the sales team

716
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:32,874
who deal with commissions and client meal expenses.

717
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:35,529
Boss is extra careful with them.

718
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,954
Luckily, no one is dating anyone right now.

719
00:46:43,456 --> 00:46:44,329
Right.

720
00:46:52,598 --> 00:46:53,715
(I’m in trouble.)

721
00:46:58,007 --> 00:46:59,420
You’re not comfortable, right?

722
00:46:59,455 --> 00:47:01,146
With letting other people know we’re on a date.

723
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,825
Our office has a rule prohibiting employees from dating.

724
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:06,250
But we’re not in the office now.

725
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:07,619
Can I hold your hand?

726
00:47:08,253 --> 00:47:09,803
Building blocks are like love.

727
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:10,874
There’s no fixed formula.

728
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:13,015
We have to slowly build something together.

729
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:14,895
I cannot

730
00:47:14,914 --> 00:47:16,875
let you two be in a relationship.

731
00:47:18,394 --> 00:47:19,515
Can I prove this to you?

732
00:47:22,935 --> 00:47:32,385
[When we couldn’t see something clearly,
