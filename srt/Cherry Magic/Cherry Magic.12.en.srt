You got this.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:24,940
I love you.

8
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,005
Hi, everyone.

9
00:00:27,014 --> 00:00:27,817
I’m Achi.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,961
I’m a representative from the head office.

11
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:31,814
I’ll be overseeing this branch opening.

12
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:32,900
Thank you so much.

13
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:34,613
Even when we’re this far apart,

14
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:36,222
you can still take care of me.

15
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:38,908
(I probably don’t need to read Karan’s mind anymore)

16
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:41,911
(because he has done everything to show it to me.)

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,779
(Goodbye my magical power.)

18
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:52,364
(Huh?)

19
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:54,247
(Is this real?)

20
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:55,000
Karan.

21
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:57,881
The voice inside your head is so loud.

22
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:04,207
(Did I say goodbye to my magical power?)

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,703
Let me test it.

24
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:15,925
Karan,

25
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:16,951
can you think of something?

26
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,103
Are you thinking?

27
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,140
I am.

28
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:28,610
I’m thinking I want you to wake me up like this every morning.

29
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:32,906
(I really can’t hear anything.)

30
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:37,050
(Achirawit’s magical power is gone.)

31
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:38,401
Why?

32
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,305
Do you want me to think more than that?

33
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,509
It’s not like that, but…

34
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,454
How can you hear anything?

35
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:53,004
Last night we…

36
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,500
I love you, Achi.

37
00:02:06,764 --> 00:02:07,937
Can you hear it now?

38
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,720
[5 days later.]

39
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,308
Don’t put it away yet.
[5 days later.]

40
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:38,402
[5 days later.]

41
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:39,586
You’ll still make it to your flight in time, Boss.
[5 days later.]

42
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,709
It’s only 7 p.m.
[5 days later.]

43
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:40,810
[5 days later.]

44
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,309
(Living without magical power again)

45
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:52,420
(is actually not that different from before.)

46
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:53,500
Boss.

47
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,654
Our store is ready to open tomorrow.

48
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,702
Open it.

49
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:24,508
Yay!

50
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:33,724
Everyone, let’s take a group photo.

51
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:34,628
When we take a photo,

52
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:36,934
let’s say Achi together.

53
00:04:36,948 --> 00:04:38,220
One, two.

54
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:40,771
Achi!

55
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:44,125
Achi!

56
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,402
I hope the process I set up will work.

57
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:48,420
It definitely will.

58
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:49,506
When you have free time,

59
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,979
feel free to stop by or send us messages sometimes.

60
00:04:52,097 --> 00:04:52,697
I will.

61
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:54,214
You guys take care.

62
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:54,903
We will.

63
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,601
Take care.

64
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,700
Good luck.

65
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:14,002
Hello.

66
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:17,857
(Achi, are you coming home for New Year’s?)

67
00:05:19,314 --> 00:05:20,011
Yes.

68
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:27,903
I also have something important to tell you and Dad.

69
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:35,918
Karan.

70
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:43,505
Do you want to go to Lamphun with me for New Year’s?

71
00:06:00,174 --> 00:06:01,798
Hey, Achi!

72
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:03,305
Hi, Duj.

73
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,127
You’re back.

74
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:05,576
That’s Achi.

75
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:07,608
We’ve missed you so much.

76
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:09,242
Achi.

77
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:10,210
Achi, hi.

78
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:11,105
Hi.

79
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:13,140
I’ve missed you all too.

80
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,177
Hey.

81
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:15,802
The whole gang's here.

82
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:18,125
That means it’s time to celebrate.

83
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:19,490
Yes!

84
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,807
Let’s go.

85
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:22,257
What should we eat?

86
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:23,010
- Here.
- Have you eaten?

87
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:23,911
Yes.

88
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:24,960
Right here.

89
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:27,306
Would you like some, Duj?

90
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:28,922
What’s Rock doing?

91
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:32,708
Hi, everyone.

92
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:36,097
As the youngest employee here,

93
00:06:36,202 --> 00:06:38,502
I’ve prepared something to show you guys.

94
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:56,924
Did you doze off?

95
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:02,509
That’s cute.

96
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:09,945
Alright, everyone.

97
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,318
Let’s give Rock a big hand.

98
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,308
Thank you.

99
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:16,269
Well done, Rock.

100
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:17,114
You’re the best.

101
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:17,928
Thank you.

102
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:20,554
Alright, everyone.

103
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,225
It’s almost the new year.

104
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,702
Let’s leave the bad things behind this year.

105
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:29,896
Next year, I wish you all only good things in your lives.

106
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,017
Amen.

107
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,568
Stop it.

108
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:34,179
You didn’t have to make me look so old.

109
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:36,505
You guys are crazy.

110
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,878
Cheers!

111
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:40,136
Cheers!

112
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,100
This coming new year,

113
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:59,583
I wish you all good luck and happiness.

114
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,714
Make the most of your time off

115
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,534
because this year’s bonus will be paid in time for the long holidays.

116
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:15,905
I also have one more special gift for you all.

117
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,906
This past year, I’ve seen

118
00:08:19,973 --> 00:08:23,299
that good love can motivate us to work

119
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:27,105
and make us become better people.

120
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,657
So from now on,

121
00:08:30,955 --> 00:08:34,699
there’ll no longer be any rule to prohibit you from dating in the office.

122
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:49,739
My ship is going to have their moments all year.

123
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:52,805
Fine.

124
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:54,703
You can be happy about that.

125
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:57,109
But once you’re done,

126
00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:59,010
don’t forget to think about your own relationship.

127
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:03,407
Come on, everyone.

128
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:04,502
Cheers!

129
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,777
Cheers!

130
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:12,905
Cheers.

131
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:22,497
Where are you going to celebrate New Year?

132
00:09:23,114 --> 00:09:24,500
I’m probably going to chill in bed at home.

133
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:25,739
What?

134
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,816
You? Chilling in bed at home?

135
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:30,608
Of all the people in the office,

136
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,702
you seem the least likely to stay home.

137
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:37,908
I used to go out with my friends

138
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:42,408
but they’re all probably going to be on stage this year.

139
00:09:44,997 --> 00:09:46,813
Watching them from below alone

140
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:49,909
would make me feel like a loser somehow.

141
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:57,305
Rock,

142
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:12,908
does working an office job make you feel that bad?

143
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:17,608
It’s quite fun

144
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:20,709
and suits my life

145
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,807
but when I think of the dream I haven’t pursued,

146
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,379
I don’t know.

147
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:30,444
Even though you’re working now,

148
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:32,305
you don’t have to give it up.

149
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,139
If you like dancing, keep dancing.

150
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:38,693
Dancing alone is no fun.

151
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:41,708
Dancing without an audience

152
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:44,945
is like practicing all my life but never getting to go on stage.

153
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:47,202
I don’t know what to practice for.

154
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,204
Okay.

155
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:55,308
Then dance now.

156
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:56,700
I’ll watch.

157
00:10:58,468 --> 00:10:59,222
What?

158
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:00,517
I’m serious.

159
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:01,413
Go ahead and dance.

160
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:02,404
Dance.

161
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:03,305
Come on.

162
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:04,602
Go.

163
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:10,752
Rock, I don’t want you to think that

164
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,925
because you don’t get to do what you love for a living,

165
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,453
you have to give it up.

166
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:16,780
If you love it, do it.

167
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,588
But…

168
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,502
People have different life limitations.

169
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,860
You have yours.

170
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:27,262
Other people have theirs.

171
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:28,500
That’s it.

172
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,010
There’s no win or lose.

173
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:36,703
Come on.

174
00:11:37,262 --> 00:11:38,014
Why are you not moving?

175
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:39,059
Dance.

176
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:39,918
Go ahead and dance.

177
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:41,505
I’m waiting.

178
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,808
Show the world an office boy can do what he loves.

179
00:11:46,274 --> 00:11:46,829
Come on.

180
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,979
I’ll take a video of you.

181
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:48,798
Come on.

182
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,346
Pai.

183
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,303
Oh, but before you start dancing,

184
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:56,905
I have a New Year gift for you.

185
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,432
Here.

186
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:09,343
Isn’t it cute?

187
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:11,800
Isn’t it cute?

188
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:12,949
Did you make it for me?

189
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:13,614
Yes.

190
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:16,934
Here. You have a fan and an LED sign.

191
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:19,010
Are you ready to dance, Mr. Artist?

192
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:21,376
Go, Rock!

193
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:22,685
Go, Rock!

194
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,087
This is your stage.

195
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:24,909
Go up there.

196
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:30,608
Wow.

197
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:31,539
You’re so handsome.

198
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:32,911
You’re so cool, Rock.

199
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:52,702
Achi.

200
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:53,600
Hmm?

201
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:56,300
Are you nervous?

202
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,708
Yeah.

203
00:13:00,383 --> 00:13:02,700
I don’t really talk to my family about these things

204
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,702
so I don’t know how this will turn out.

205
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,272
Let me help, Mom.

206
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,007
No, it’s okay.

207
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:36,508
How can I trouble my guest?

208
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,780
Just sit and wait to eat.

209
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:40,700
I hope you’ll like the food.

210
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,801
These look so good.

211
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,297
Why did you cook so much food?

212
00:13:44,512 --> 00:13:46,974
I told you we’d only have one guest.

213
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:49,518
That’s exactly why I had to prepare a lot

214
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,100
so he can try all my dishes.

215
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:57,103
If you can’t finish it, you can pack it up and bring it to Bangkok.

216
00:13:58,174 --> 00:13:59,808
These are not easy to find, you know.

217
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:02,601
My home-cooked Northern dishes.

218
00:14:04,905 --> 00:14:05,902
Dig in.

219
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:08,106
I’ll go and get your dad.

220
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,604
Get the rice, Achi.

221
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:18,908
You’re so cute when you speak the Northern dialect.

222
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:21,208
Can you speak it every day?

223
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:25,205
Dad!

224
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:26,853
Calm down.

225
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:28,805
I told you to buy good quality balloons.

226
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,768
The ones you bought are thin.

227
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,309
They burst after a little pumping.

228
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,466
Come on.

229
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:36,220
You have to blow only a little air into the balloons.

230
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:39,463
Take a break and come eat.

231
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,303
Our son brought a friend to visit.

232
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:42,906
Don’t let him wait for too long.

233
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:43,811
Hurry.

234
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,610
Hello.

235
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:01,777
Karan, you’re Achi’s colleague, right?

236
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:05,204
Yes.

237
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:08,303
I work at the same company as him.

238
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,854
So what brings you here together?

239
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:13,697
Achi has never brought anyone home.

240
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:18,912
Don’t tell me…

241
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:30,302
You’re from the North, right?

242
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:32,400
You gave Achi a ride, didn’t you?

243
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,096
I’ll help you with the gas bill.

244
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:36,376
Achi, you can’t do this.

245
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,779
You can’t ride with him for free.

246
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:42,905
I wanted to come and introduce myself to you two.

247
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:50,413
Dad. Mom.

248
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:54,613
I told you I have something important to tell you.

249
00:15:56,143 --> 00:15:56,905
Well,

250
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,204
actually,

251
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:03,800
Karan and I,

252
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:10,700
we’re dating.

253
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,407
Achi and I love each other sincerely

254
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:39,309
and we’re sure we want to be in a serious relationship

255
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:43,711
so I wanted to come here and let you two know in person.

256
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:51,405
May I have your permission to take care of Achi?

257
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:04,004
I understand your love, Achi and Karan,

258
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,134
but

259
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:17,804
I just don’t understand what made you choose my son.

260
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:21,093
Achi is clumsy.

261
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:22,607
He doesn’t know how to do many things

262
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,002
and doesn’t really make sense when he talks.

263
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:25,404
Are you sure about this, Karan?

264
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:26,377
Mom!

265
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,611
I am sure, Mom.

266
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:32,207
Achi has a very good heart.

267
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,808
He might not be very good with words

268
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:36,142
but he’s a very thoughtful person.

269
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,456
Once he puts his mind to something, he does it well every time.

270
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:43,108
Your son is much more talented than you think.

271
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,810
I think I’m the lucky one.

272
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:52,811
It’s a relief to hear that.

273
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:55,506
Let’s eat.

274
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,497
After we finish eating,

275
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,601
please help me make a snack, Karan.

276
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,306
Of course, Mom.

277
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:12,411
Have you had Khao Pook Nga before?

278
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:14,411
Never.

279
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:17,207
Then you have to try making it.

280
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,736
We wouldn't get to eat this snack if you boys weren’t here.

281
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:34,402
Let me see.

282
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:36,440
Ouch!

283
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:39,004
Are you alright, Achi?

284
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:40,402
Is it very hot?

285
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:41,682
Not really.

286
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:46,860
It’s red.

287
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:50,708
Why are you smiling, Mom?

288
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,508
You must be happy you got to prank me.

289
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:55,111
Who would prank you?

290
00:18:56,743 --> 00:18:59,865
Seeing you happy makes me happy.

291
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:03,600
This is what love is.

292
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,299
You have to keep supporting each other.

293
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:09,807
When one person has a hard time, the other person comes in and helps.

294
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:11,663
That’s how you make it last.

295
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:15,269
You sure you’re alright, Achi?

296
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:16,411
Come on.

297
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:31,608
When you have free time, come home and visit me often.

298
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:34,155
You too, Karan.

299
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,056
Feel free to invite your family too.

300
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:41,309
Next time, I’ll prepare a full course of food and desserts.

301
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:44,503
Okay.

302
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:49,407
What Mom prepared today could feed the whole village already.

303
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:51,205
Hmm?

304
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:53,105
What did you say?

305
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:56,105
I didn’t say anything.

306
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,657
I heard you.

307
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:09,154
If I get a red gummy,

308
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:12,807
it means I already won over your parents.

309
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:31,459
It’s green.

310
00:20:32,594 --> 00:20:35,314
I think you never really needed to win them over.

311
00:20:35,496 --> 00:20:38,305
They’re probably happy that I finally found love.

312
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:44,100
Here you go, Achi.

313
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:01,099
Karan.

314
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:02,508
- Hmm?
- Are you okay?

315
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:05,257
Can I ask you for something?

316
00:21:05,757 --> 00:21:08,737
Of course, if it’s not too hard to do.

317
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,309
Can you say “I love Karan the most in the world.

318
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,102
I love Karan only. I love Karan forever”

319
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:23,638
in the Northern dialect?

320
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:27,312
No.

321
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:28,051
Please.

322
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:29,764
Pretty, please.

323
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,509
Alright.

324
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:31,407
Fine.

325
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:34,202
Can I take a video?

326
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:35,703
Excuse me.

327
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:39,902
You can take a video.

328
00:21:40,422 --> 00:21:41,463
Come to think of it,

329
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,339
it’s better than having to say it often.

330
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,001
Okay.

331
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,207
One.

332
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,305
Two.

333
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,382
Three.

334
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:56,097
I love Karan the most in the world.

335
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,303
I love Karan only.

336
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,897
And I will love him forever.

337
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:03,808
Ah.

338
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,263
That’s cute.

339
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:09,300
Let me see if I got the video.

340
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:17,208
Turn it off.

341
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:20,807
Karan!

342
00:22:22,562 --> 00:22:23,306
Turn it off.

343
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:25,007
Turn it off.

344
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:28,250
What about the 2nd?

345
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:30,284
(Your dad and I aren’t available on the 2nd either.)

346
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:32,082
(Can we talk about this later?)

347
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:32,768
(I’m outside.)

348
00:22:32,776 --> 00:22:33,389
Mom.

349
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:34,785
(Alright, talk later.)

350
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,682
Mom.

351
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,588
Karan, let’s go to sleep.

352
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:50,979
I’ve prepared the bed for you.

353
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:01,896
Alright, everyone.

354
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:03,500
I asked you guys to come in today

355
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:05,586
because I have good news to share.

356
00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:09,290
The four of you passed the audition

357
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:12,388
and you’re going to debut with our label.

358
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:13,379
Congratulations.

359
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:15,487
Really?

360
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,248
Yes.

361
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:18,385
Yay!

362
00:23:20,494 --> 00:23:22,890
From now on, you have to practice harder

363
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:24,103
and work harder

364
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:26,336
so you can debut by the scheduled promotion period.

365
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:27,487
Do your best.

366
00:23:27,712 --> 00:23:28,429
You can do it, right?

367
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:29,482
Yes.

368
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:37,651
Before you go back,

369
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,782
don’t forget to try the Khao Pook Nga you made together.

370
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:42,291
I packed it in this box.

371
00:23:42,315 --> 00:23:43,066
Thank you so much.

372
00:23:43,878 --> 00:23:44,782
Take this too.

373
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,977
Thank you.

374
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,989
Safe travels.

375
00:23:49,414 --> 00:23:51,383
Come give your dad and mom a hug.

376
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:06,794
Karan, you can hug me too.

377
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:08,377
You’re also my son.

378
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:10,410
Thank you, Mom.

379
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:13,986
Good luck, son.

380
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:16,882
Bye, Dad.

381
00:24:17,885 --> 00:24:18,820
Safe travels.

382
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:19,315
Thank you.

383
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,582
Off you go.

384
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:21,456
We’re leaving now.

385
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:22,080
Okay.

386
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,377
Let’s go.

387
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,989
Okay.

388
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:52,711
Hi.

389
00:24:53,065 --> 00:24:53,847
Excuse me, Min.

390
00:24:53,863 --> 00:24:55,136
Can I get a photo with you?

391
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:55,989
Absolutely.

392
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,580
Sure.

393
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,394
Thank you.

394
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:05,970
I have to go.

395
00:25:06,014 --> 00:25:07,016
See you next time, everyone.

396
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:09,232
Bye.

397
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:13,183
Bye.

398
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,482
Hey.

399
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:25,672
What are you doing?

400
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:27,980
It’s me.

401
00:25:28,102 --> 00:25:29,023
I know.

402
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:31,285
I have good news to share.

403
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:32,185
Hmm?

404
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,380
I got to sign my contract today.

405
00:25:34,457 --> 00:25:35,583
I’m going to debut.

406
00:25:36,631 --> 00:25:39,074
See? I told you your day would come

407
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,585
because you’re so talented.

408
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:42,586
Can I scream once?

409
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:43,948
You’re so talented!

410
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:44,693
Stop!

411
00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:46,765
Let him go!

412
00:25:46,773 --> 00:25:47,979
What are you doing?

413
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:49,183
- Nothing.
- What are you doing?

414
00:25:49,198 --> 00:25:50,500
Nothing.

415
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,500
Hold on, everyone.

416
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,494
This guy is…

417
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,656
From now on, please be careful with anything you do,

418
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:05,288
Even in your personal life,

419
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:06,871
please behave appropriately.

420
00:26:12,518 --> 00:26:13,340
He’s…

421
00:26:17,668 --> 00:26:18,494
my boyfriend.

422
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:19,305
Huh?

423
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:20,182
Huh?

424
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:25,222
I’m sorry for shocking you.

425
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:30,499
I understand if any of you are not okay that I’m in a relationship.

426
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:33,186
I won’t ask you to accept it

427
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,819
but whatever you all decide,

428
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:38,697
I respect your feelings.

429
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:40,245
It’s not like that, Min.

430
00:26:40,635 --> 00:26:43,733
We’re all just worried about you.

431
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,008
About your boyfriend, that’s your personal life.

432
00:26:48,388 --> 00:26:51,629
Whenever you’re ready, you can tell us.

433
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,017
Thank you so much.

434
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:02,900
Excuse me.

435
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:04,102
Yes?

436
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:07,691
Are you Jinta, the author of this novel?

437
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:11,259
Uh, yes.

438
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:13,100
Can I get your autograph?

439
00:27:13,404 --> 00:27:14,691
I’m a big fan of your work.

440
00:27:14,724 --> 00:27:16,177
I’ve been following you since your first novel.

441
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:16,888
Please?

442
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:17,837
Of course.

443
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:18,777
You have his book too?

444
00:27:19,315 --> 00:27:20,383
Of course.

445
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:21,445
Thank you.

446
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:22,457
I really appreciate it.

447
00:27:22,477 --> 00:27:23,442
I’ll sign it for you.

448
00:27:23,714 --> 00:27:24,586
Thank you so much.

449
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:26,056
Thank you for reading it.

450
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:26,682
You’re welcome.

451
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:28,588
Thank you for following my work.

452
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:30,490
You’re not going to hit me anymore, right?

453
00:27:31,724 --> 00:27:33,361
Alright. Thank you so much.

454
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:51,880
Is something wrong, Karan?

455
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,681
No.

456
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,983
Oh.

457
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:01,697
By the way, we talked about visiting your family home.

458
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:05,982
Oh, about that.

459
00:28:16,484 --> 00:28:17,696
I called my mom

460
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:21,982
but it seemed like she wanted to hold it off.

461
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:28,183
We can go there some other time.

462
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:29,882
She may not be ready yet.

463
00:28:31,315 --> 00:28:34,134
I don’t know if my family will ever be ready for this.

464
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:37,955
Last night, I brought up

465
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,840
that there’s a guy I want to introduce to her

466
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:45,087
but it seemed she was trying to avoid the conversation.

467
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:52,497
So what would you like to do?

468
00:28:55,115 --> 00:28:58,539
Would you like to go with the way that makes your family comfortable?

469
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:10,371
No way.

470
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:11,740
I choose you no matter what.

471
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:17,684
No matter what’s going to happen,

472
00:29:18,647 --> 00:29:20,139
can you please stay by my side, Achi?

473
00:29:24,614 --> 00:29:25,693
Don’t worry.

474
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,284
I’ll always stay by your side.

475
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:44,198
I changed my mind.

476
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:47,838
Let’s go to my house now.

477
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:49,819
No one is going to be ready anyway.

478
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:43,508
So what’s your name?

479
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:46,610
My name is Achi.

480
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:47,497
Achi?

481
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:48,967
That’s a cute name.

482
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:50,259
It suits your face.

483
00:30:51,235 --> 00:30:53,607
You can call me Mom.

484
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:54,906
Thank you.

485
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:09,408
Dad. Mom.

486
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,282
Achi is my lover.

487
00:31:18,317 --> 00:31:19,377
How long have you been dating?

488
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,312
Uh…

489
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:24,957
For a while now.

490
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,807
Actually, your relationship is between you two.

491
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,411
As your parents, our duty is to support you.

492
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:56,604
Please bear with my little brother’s singing skills.

493
00:32:05,562 --> 00:32:07,204
Would you like some desserts, Mom?

494
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:15,111
We worried a lot for nothing.

495
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:18,616
Actually, your parents are very kind.

496
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:22,607
Yeah, I overthought it.

497
00:32:25,502 --> 00:32:26,512
I spent so much time worrying.

498
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:29,312
You did great, Karan.

499
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:34,605
Don’t you have a reward for someone who did great?

500
00:32:38,371 --> 00:32:39,601
Others might see us.

501
00:32:40,715 --> 00:32:42,244
No one is going to say anything.

502
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:44,208
Please.

503
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,557
Can I get a reward?

504
00:32:45,635 --> 00:32:47,148
No, Karan.

505
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:54,760
Karan!

506
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,800
I’ll be away so I brought you a New Year's gift in advance.

507
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,400
Oh, thank you.

508
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,219
- I hope you like it.
- Hello, Auntie Da.

509
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,108
Oh, hi.

510
00:33:10,331 --> 00:33:11,605
Aren’t you traveling anywhere this year?

511
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:12,915
I’m leaving tomorrow.

512
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,060
Luckily, I got to see you and Karin first.

513
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:17,939
Oh.

514
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:19,748
This is Achi.

515
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:20,139
He’s…

516
00:33:20,146 --> 00:33:21,525
Achi is Karan’s friend.

517
00:33:21,545 --> 00:33:23,364
He stopped by to visit us lonely old people.

518
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:23,986
A friend?

519
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:26,208
I thought he was Karin’s boyfriend.

520
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,604
Speaking of, are you dating anyone, Karan?

521
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,980
When will you get married?

522
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:32,768
Your parents said they’re lonely.

523
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,205
They can’t wait to have grandchildren.

524
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,730
Well…

525
00:33:36,742 --> 00:33:37,755
Oh, he’s not dating.

526
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:39,244
He works so hard.

527
00:33:39,986 --> 00:33:42,045
We gave up hope already.

528
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:43,808
Don’t give up just yet.

529
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:46,109
I know the daughters of many families.

530
00:33:46,214 --> 00:33:48,986
If you want me to bring them here so you can get to know them,

531
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,179
just let me know.

532
00:33:50,317 --> 00:33:52,097
I have my eyes on many girls for Karan.

533
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:54,712
Looks like we have to pin our hopes on Auntie Da.

534
00:33:55,014 --> 00:33:56,512
No problem.

535
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:59,450
The daughter of that family is a dentist.

536
00:34:02,031 --> 00:34:02,878
Hey.

537
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:07,712
Auntie Da still pays so much attention to other people’s affairs.

538
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,309
Look at Karan.

539
00:34:12,703 --> 00:34:17,672
He’s never dared to be this relaxed even around his own family.

540
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,957
Just seeing this makes me understand why it has to be this guy.

541
00:34:23,173 --> 00:34:25,151
I don’t see anything different.

542
00:34:29,204 --> 00:34:33,665
You know Karan really loves his family, right?

543
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:38,702
That’s why I think it’s very important for him

544
00:34:38,822 --> 00:34:41,607
to get accepted by his family for who he really is.

545
00:34:43,571 --> 00:34:44,703
I accept him.

546
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:46,158
I didn’t say anything.

547
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,217
I didn’t try to stop him.

548
00:34:47,693 --> 00:34:49,608
What about when you talked to Auntie Da earlier?

549
00:34:50,096 --> 00:34:51,103
What was that?

550
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:53,906
I was just trying to protect them.

551
00:34:54,247 --> 00:34:56,404
I didn’t want her to spread gossip about them.

552
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,401
It wouldn’t look good.

553
00:34:57,754 --> 00:35:01,007
If anyone thinks badly of them, it’s their problem.

554
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:06,059
You know Karan and Achi didn’t do anything wrong, don’t you?

555
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:09,614
I’m really curious

556
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:14,537
if it was me who introduced a guy to my family today,

557
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:16,502
would you just ask his name and end the conversation?

558
00:35:23,097 --> 00:35:23,708
Mom,

559
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:30,842
I think by giving him freedom and not stopping him

560
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,804
but not supporting or caring what he does,

561
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:38,703
you’re just waiting for him to get bored and get back in line

562
00:35:38,798 --> 00:35:40,902
like you’ve been doing to him all his life.

563
00:35:41,783 --> 00:35:44,936
To me, that’s not acceptance.

564
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:54,020
Every time he’s interested in what you don’t agree with,

565
00:35:54,288 --> 00:35:55,819
it’s true that you never stop him,

566
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:59,835
but you ignore it until he finally stops doing it himself.

567
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:03,019
When he does anything that pleases you and Dad,

568
00:36:03,143 --> 00:36:04,909
you praise him so openly

569
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:07,506
that he learns what he should and shouldn't do.

570
00:36:10,813 --> 00:36:14,016
I saw that you have tried

571
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:20,019
but all this time, Karan has given up so many things he liked

572
00:36:20,364 --> 00:36:22,103
for you and Dad’s happiness.

573
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:28,117
It’s time both of you let go of something

574
00:36:28,128 --> 00:36:29,805
for my brother’s happiness for a change.

575
00:36:31,765 --> 00:36:32,402
Alright.

576
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:33,940
That’s all I’d say.

577
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:36,752
Now make your own decision.

578
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:49,500
Can you move a bit? I want to sit with you.

579
00:37:17,297 --> 00:37:19,402
Let’s have a cool drink.

580
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,077
Thank you, Mom.

581
00:37:20,088 --> 00:37:21,280
Are you guys in a hurry to leave?

582
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,650
I haven’t really talked to Achi.

583
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:24,579
We’re not in a hurry.

584
00:37:25,638 --> 00:37:28,460
How long have you two been dating?

585
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,530
Less than a year but…

586
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,108
Hey.

587
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:33,905
Won’t you let me talk to Achi at all?

588
00:37:34,134 --> 00:37:36,506
Give me a chance to talk to him personally.

589
00:37:37,905 --> 00:37:38,494
Come here.

590
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:39,703
Help me clean up the other room.

591
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:40,785
Come with me.

592
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,108
Come take a seat, Achi.

593
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:51,397
Hey.

594
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:53,343
Just let them be.

595
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:57,902
Mom just wants to get to know the person you want to be with for the rest of your life.

596
00:37:59,595 --> 00:38:00,930
Come help me with this.

597
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:03,254
Careful.

598
00:38:03,345 --> 00:38:06,099
I can trust you with Karan then?

599
00:38:08,216 --> 00:38:09,008
Yes.

600
00:38:11,814 --> 00:38:17,208
Even though Karan has been taking care of me most of the time,

601
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:23,708
I’ve been trying to learn how to do things for him in return

602
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:29,863
even if it’s just letting him do what makes him happy

603
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:33,352
like cooking every day,

604
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,102
buying things to use together,

605
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:39,109
hearing him sing,

606
00:38:44,244 --> 00:38:47,611
or being by his side on the days he doesn’t feel confident.

607
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:51,457
I may not be an all-rounder like Karan

608
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,936
but I definitely won’t let him be the only one who makes an effort for anything.

609
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:00,007
Thank you, Achi,

610
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,068
and thank you for telling us more about Karan.

611
00:39:03,948 --> 00:39:06,041
Now that we know many sides of him,

612
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,200
we love him for everything he is.

613
00:39:10,554 --> 00:39:15,460
Also, thank you for letting my son be himself.

614
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:17,859
You’re welcome.

615
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,608
I knew you’d cry.

616
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,825
You’re still that crybaby.

617
00:39:35,882 --> 00:39:36,811
Come take a seat.

618
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:38,161
Come on.

619
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:39,260
Why are you crying?

620
00:39:39,687 --> 00:39:41,007
It’s okay. Cry it out.

621
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:46,589
My amazing son.

622
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:52,407
I didn’t disappoint you, did I?

623
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:54,629
Not at all.

624
00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:56,441
How can I be disappointed in you

625
00:39:56,454 --> 00:39:58,405
when you’re such a great person?

626
00:39:59,074 --> 00:40:00,854
I’m proud of you, son.

627
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,502
Today, I’m even prouder of you.

628
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:05,306
Don’t cry.

629
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:06,608
My amazing son.

630
00:40:09,605 --> 00:40:10,705
Well done.

631
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:33,220
(The best New Year’s gift is to see my son in a good relationship.)

632
00:40:46,017 --> 00:40:47,142
I’m so relieved.

633
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:51,939
I feel like there’s nothing to worry about anymore.

634
00:40:54,857 --> 00:40:56,417
You make me so much braver, Achi.

635
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:02,005
Shouldn’t I be the one to say that?

636
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,608
You’re more important to my life than you think, Achi.

637
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:13,703
I wouldn’t have had the courage to do

638
00:41:14,025 --> 00:41:15,405
or overcome many things

639
00:41:16,379 --> 00:41:17,506
if I didn’t have you.

640
00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:44,807
Achi.

641
00:41:45,122 --> 00:41:45,705
Hmm?

642
00:41:47,197 --> 00:41:48,306
Will you marry me?

643
00:41:55,628 --> 00:41:56,659
You can say no.

644
00:41:57,354 --> 00:41:58,503
I just thought I’d ask.

645
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:05,007
I thought you’d surprise me with a music band.

646
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:16,660
I just don’t want you to feel like I expect you to say yes.

647
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,856
No matter what your answer is, I won’t regret it.

648
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:21,902
I’ll still love you the same

649
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:24,708
and still be just as happy with what we have today.

650
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:30,202
I just felt like today was a very good day.

651
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:31,708
That’s why I asked.

652
00:42:36,976 --> 00:42:38,201
When it comes to this,

653
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:46,007
no matter how you asked, I’d say yes.

654
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:52,894
Do you mean it?

655
00:42:53,675 --> 00:42:54,777
You can’t change your mind.

656
00:42:56,164 --> 00:42:56,802
Yeah.

657
00:42:59,173 --> 00:43:00,204
I love you, Achi.

658
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:03,106
Thank you so much.

659
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:17,413
Actually, I’ve prepared something to propose to you too.

660
00:44:21,945 --> 00:44:23,829
Let me put it on you then.

661
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,702
Karan,...

662
00:44:40,426 --> 00:44:41,605
will you marry me?

663
00:44:44,425 --> 00:44:45,779

I feel very honored.

681
00:45:48,822 --> 00:45:50,816
We have a question for the author too.

682
00:45:50,903 --> 00:45:54,109
Mr. Jinta, you said you got inspiration from someone in real life.

683
00:45:54,136 --> 00:45:55,666
Could you please give us a hint

684
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:58,410
as to who was your inspiration?

685
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:03,206
Actually, I can give you a little hint.

686
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,056
(Okay.)

687
00:46:43,548 --> 00:46:44,811
Amazing.

688
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:46,608
Hey.

689
00:46:47,946 --> 00:46:48,623
Oh, hey.

690
00:46:49,234 --> 00:46:49,691
Hi.

691
00:46:49,703 --> 00:46:50,308
Hi.

692
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,911
Look at my T-shirt.

693
00:46:52,232 --> 00:46:52,731
Isn’t it cool?

694
00:46:52,745 --> 00:46:53,823
That’s cool.

695
00:46:54,118 --> 00:46:58,814
Now it’s time to watch their showcase.

696
00:46:59,068 --> 00:47:01,860
May I ask all the press to take your seats?

697
00:47:02,016 --> 00:47:06,617
Get ready to have fun with Cherry Mania.

698
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:12,711
Go, Min!

699
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:51,025
That’s my friends!

700
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,075
That’s my friends!

701
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:53,441
Woohoo!

702
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,011
Excuse me, are you Office Rockstar?

703
00:48:08,247 --> 00:48:08,964
Yes.

704
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:10,813
I’ve been following you.

705
00:48:11,006 --> 00:48:12,813
You do dance covers in your office, right?

706
00:48:15,217 --> 00:48:16,274
Thank you so much.

707
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:18,106
Can I get a photo with you?

708
00:48:18,219 --> 00:48:20,512
You inspire me so much to go back to practicing dance covers.

709
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:21,752
Absolutely.

710
00:48:21,883 --> 00:48:22,416
Okay.

711
00:48:22,668 --> 00:48:23,314
Let’s take a photo.

712
00:48:23,352 --> 00:48:24,214
One, two.

713
00:48:25,251 --> 00:48:25,866
One more.

714
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:26,783
One, two.

715
00:48:27,189 --> 00:48:28,016
Thank you.

716
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,317
You can still do what you love while working an office job.

717
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:34,217
Yes.

718
00:48:34,232 --> 00:48:35,148
Thank you so much.

719
00:48:35,302 --> 00:48:36,345
I’ll always be your fan.

720
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:37,223
Thank you.

721
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:42,807
Hey, Pai.

722
00:48:45,786 --> 00:48:46,515
Why are you smiling?

723
00:48:46,629 --> 00:48:48,210
Are you shipping him and me?

724
00:48:48,545 --> 00:48:51,711
Well, the chemistry is there.

725
00:48:51,819 --> 00:48:54,114
A young man with big glasses and a guy with bangs.

726
00:48:55,617 --> 00:48:57,051
That hurts, you know.

727
00:48:57,586 --> 00:48:59,343
Would you really give me to someone else so easily?

728
00:48:59,357 --> 00:49:00,641
Just kidding.

729
00:49:01,831 --> 00:49:05,708
I’m just happy you can still inspire others.

730
00:49:06,733 --> 00:49:11,823
Even though you’re not an artist, you can be an idol for office men.

731
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:13,613
You started it.

732
00:49:14,106 --> 00:49:16,213
Because you posted my clip and it went viral,

733
00:49:16,502 --> 00:49:18,305
I had to start my own channel.

734
00:49:18,614 --> 00:49:21,518
Yes, I started it.

735
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:23,785
But it’s turned out well, hasn’t it?

736
00:49:26,816 --> 00:49:27,917
What are you doing here by the way?

737
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:31,588
Don’t tell me you also came to support Cherry Mania.

738
00:49:31,745 --> 00:49:32,611
Don’t be silly.

739
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,588
I came to see you.

740
00:49:34,992 --> 00:49:36,508
I have something important to give you.

741
00:49:39,206 --> 00:49:39,865
What is it?

742
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,742
Are you inviting me to donate money to a temple?

743
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:44,456
Just open it.

744
00:49:44,623 --> 00:49:45,705
You’ll see.

745
00:49:59,003 --> 00:49:59,616
Karan.

746
00:49:59,927 --> 00:50:00,515
Achi.

747
00:50:01,056 --> 00:50:02,410
I’m really happy for you guys.

748
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,354
Thank you so much.

749
00:50:06,395 --> 00:50:07,312
Thank you.

750
00:50:19,171 --> 00:50:20,020
Thank you.

751
00:50:21,715 --> 00:50:24,214
I wish you two a long and happy life together.

752
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:27,120
Be forgiving to each other.

753
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:27,856
Thank you, Mom.

754
00:50:27,874 --> 00:50:29,571
Take good care of him.

755
00:50:31,848 --> 00:50:34,023
Even though we could only have a wedding ceremony today,

756
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:36,213
but looking back to your parents’ days,

757
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:38,363
we’ve come very far.

758
00:50:39,768 --> 00:50:42,610
I believe you two will get to register your marriage

759
00:50:42,696 --> 00:50:44,912
and do everything like everyone else.

760
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:47,262
I’ll wait for that day with you.

761
00:50:48,022 --> 00:50:48,856
Thank you, Mom.

762
00:50:50,419 --> 00:50:52,463
Since we’re family now,

763
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:54,983
let’s take group photos hugging one another, shall we?

764
00:50:55,071 --> 00:50:55,868
Let’s do it.

765
00:51:06,607 --> 00:51:07,777
Congratulations.

766
00:51:15,003 --> 00:51:19,417
(My magical power may have been the start of all the happiness today.)

767
00:51:49,746 --> 00:51:50,646
Do it.

768
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:54,108
One, two, three!

769
00:52:11,736 --> 00:52:13,613
(But after all this time,)

770
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:19,417

(is the power of loving someone wholeheartedly.)

794
00:55:17,774 --> 00:55:19,700
Achi and Karan are amazing.

795
00:55:19,891 --> 00:55:21,314
They had a beautiful wedding

796
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,811
and even booked rooms for their guests.

797
00:55:25,776 --> 00:55:26,617
Yeah.

798
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:32,340
You’re drunk.

799
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:34,422
Do you want to go and sleep inside the room?

800
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:37,411
No.

801
00:55:38,037 --> 00:55:38,723
I’m lazy.

802
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:39,712
I’ll stay here.

803
00:55:49,271 --> 00:55:50,480
(Hmm.)

804
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,514
(I never thought about having a wedding before)

805
00:55:54,806 --> 00:55:58,718
(but attending this one makes me wish I could have mine one day.)

806
00:55:58,952 --> 00:56:00,506
(I’ll probably be so happy.)

807
00:56:01,715 --> 00:56:05,311
(But is he that serious about me?)

808
00:56:06,297 --> 00:56:06,937
Min.

809
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:08,346
Huh?

810
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:12,611
If you want to marry me, just let me know whenever you’re ready.

811
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:14,524
I can wait no matter how many years.

812
00:56:15,348 --> 00:56:18,416
I haven’t proposed to you because I don’t want to interfere with your dream.

813
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:23,020
When you’re ready, come and propose to me.

814
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:25,406
Okay.

815
00:56:25,795 --> 00:56:27,112
But you’re so drunk.

816
00:56:27,779 --> 00:56:29,712
Will you remember what you said when you wake up?

817
00:56:30,377 --> 00:56:31,411
I will.

818
00:56:32,206 --> 00:56:33,625
I’ve been thinking about this for a long time.

819
00:56:36,068 --> 00:56:37,114
Okay then.

820
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,312
When I’m ready, I’ll propose to you.

821
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:45,614
So this means we’re engaged, right?

822
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,908
Not engaged.

823
00:56:47,306 --> 00:56:48,411
There’s no ring.

824
00:56:54,946 --> 00:56:57,213
Don’t tell me you…

825
00:57:00,755 --> 00:57:01,715
Give me your hand.

826
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:03,013
Come on.

827
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:22,337
Done.

828
00:57:28,973 --> 00:57:30,583
The diamond should be bigger.

829
00:57:30,777 --> 00:57:31,807
It’s an engagement ring.

830
00:57:32,785 --> 00:57:33,985
That will do.

831
00:57:35,217 --> 00:57:36,010
Give me your hand.

832
00:57:47,886 --> 00:57:48,545
What do you think?

833
00:58:09,241 --> 00:58:10,217
I love you.

00:59:41,608 --> 00:59:45,561
You know I wasn’t even this happy on my graduation day.

857
00:59:46,468 --> 00:59:47,091
Yes.

858
00:59:47,103 --> 00:59:47,908
I believe you.

859
00:59:50,248 --> 00:59:57,810
Honestly, don’t you think I’m crazy or weird?

860
00:59:57,997 --> 00:59:58,611
I do.

861
00:59:59,768 --> 01:00:01,017
You’re crazy and weird.

862
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:02,420
And scary too.

863
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:09,668
If that’s what you think, then why do you still like me?

864
01:00:12,201 --> 01:00:13,186
Why?

865
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:19,803
Because you’re very serious about what you love

866
01:00:21,087 --> 01:00:23,114
and mean well to everyone around you.

867
01:00:23,576 --> 01:00:27,117

868

including me.

869
01:00:30,223 --> 01:00:33,617
When I find someone this cool, I’d be crazy not to fall for her.

870
01:00:34,743 --> 01:00:36,019
I don’t care if I’ll get my heart broken.

871
01:00:44,023 --> 01:00:45,414
After you said that,

872
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:49,946
I’d be crazy to let you get your heart broken.

873
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:56,114
Don’t tell me you’ve given in to me already.

874
01:00:57,216 --> 01:00:58,610
You agree to date me now, right?

875
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,020
Yeah.

876
01:01:03,912 --> 01:01:04,743
I’ll date you.

877
01:01:05,077 --> 01:01:05,986
I guess I have to give in.

878
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:07,711
You agree to date me now, right?

879
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:08,438
Yeah.

880
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:09,336

886
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:16,065
Yes.

887
01:01:16,328 --> 01:01:18,065
I have a girlfriend now!

888
01:01:18,726 --> 01:01:19,517
Shh!

889
01:01:21,016 --> 01:01:22,014
Other people might find out about us.

890
01:01:25,354 --> 01:01:26,114
Achi.

891
01:01:43,977 --> 01:01:45,007
Would you like anything else to eat?

892
01:01:45,481 --> 01:01:46,745
I can order room service for you.

893
01:01:48,198 --> 01:01:49,145
It’s okay.

894
01:01:49,942 --> 01:01:51,008
I’m full already.

895
01:01:58,811 --> 01:02:00,013
Aren’t you tired at all?

896
01:02:00,943 --> 01:02:01,614
No.

897
01:02:02,955 --> 01:02:05,213
I can marry you ten more times.

898
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,506
Achi, can I ask you something?

899
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,951
Do you ever regret losing your magical power?

900
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:37,517
I think that mind reading power is so cool.

901
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:52,742
Actually, that magical power made me feel more special.

902
01:02:53,954 --> 01:02:56,420
It made me a better person.

903
01:02:57,397 --> 01:03:01,512
But all the good things the magical power gave me,

904
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,505
you could give them to me too, Karan.

905
01:03:08,189 --> 01:03:12,905
I’ve never felt like I lost anything.

906
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:17,806
My magical power...

907
01:03:20,674 --> 01:03:21,616
is right here.

908
01:03:33,091 --> 01:03:34,619
Thank you so much too, Achi.

909
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,017
No matter how cool I think that magical power is,

910
01:03:40,065 --> 01:03:41,312
if I could choose,

911
01:03:43,577 --> 01:03:45,315
I would choose you without hesitation.

912
01:03:51,521 --> 01:03:54,023
Thank you for being the most special thing in my life.

913
01:05:56,886 --> 01:06:06,336

I love Karan only.
And I will love Karan forever.”]
