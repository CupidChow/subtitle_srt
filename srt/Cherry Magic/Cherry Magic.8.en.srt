Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:16,257
Do you like watching the sunset?

6
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:17,685
Do you want to watch it together this Saturday?

7
00:00:17,753 --> 00:00:18,459
Let’s go.

8
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:19,309
(Just you wait.)

9
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:20,372
(I’ll surprise you all day.)

10
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:22,954
We’re going to watch the sunset up close.

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,711
(What? We’re riding a helicopter?)

12
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:25,516
Achi.

13
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:26,620
Will you be my boyfriend?

14
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:29,088
Have you talked with him about your magical power?

15
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:29,662
Not yet.

16
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:31,179
(What time should I make the reservation?)

17
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,700
(7 p.m. should be good.)

18
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,700
7 p.m. sounds good.

19
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:34,518
I’m okay with that.

20
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,377
If he finds out I’ve secretly been reading his mind all along,

21
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:37,240
I don’t know what’ll happen.

22
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,883
There’s one festival our office doesn’t care about.

23
00:00:39,904 --> 00:00:40,596
Is there?

24
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:41,634
Valentine’s Day.

25
00:00:41,657 --> 00:00:44,375
Because of the company rule prohibiting employees from dating.

26
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:45,946
(I’m in trouble.)

27
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,020
Well done.

28
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:55,446
Thank you

29
00:00:55,462 --> 00:00:57,513
for working on the weekend.

30
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,426
No worries, Boss.

31
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:02,203
I have a little something to reward you guys.

32
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:05,577
Take this restaurant voucher

33
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:07,702
as a thank you from me.

34
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,700
Thank you for your hard work.

35
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,641
Thank you.

36
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:30,419
Our boss only gives away restaurant vouchers.

37
00:01:30,452 --> 00:01:32,304
He must have stocked up on them.

38
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,419
For sure.

39
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,485
Let’s not go.

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,080
What?

41
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,205
Why not, Senior?

42
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:43,010
If only the two of us go, we’ll get teased.

43
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,062
It’s just people’s teasing.

44
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:47,412
Why do you care?

45
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:51,606
Or are you afraid?

46
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,702
Afraid of what?

47
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:56,219
Afraid that if people keep teasing us, you’ll fall for me.

48
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:57,403
Are you crazy?

49
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,822
Who would fall for you?

50
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:01,610
Well, if you’re not into me, then we can go together.

51
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,714
Besides, the German pork knuckle and the fried chicken there are really good.

52
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:06,940
Think about it.

53
00:02:07,248 --> 00:02:09,057
Crispy pork skin.

54
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,540
Spicy dipping sauce.

55
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:12,300
With a side of fries.

56
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:13,742
Enough.

57
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:14,810
Fine.

58
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:15,907
I’ll go.

59
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:17,311
But don’t let anyone know.

60
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:18,707
I don’t want to be teased.

61
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:22,902
Yes!

62
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:25,906
I’m finally getting to eat one on one with Pai.

63
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:31,920
Min.

64
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,116
We’ve known each other for a while.

65
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,008
I think it’s time

66
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:41,412
to take our relationship to the next level.

67
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,700
Will you be my boyfriend?

68
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:50,495
Madam Noi!

69
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:52,384
Will you please focus on the practice?

70
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:54,780
How am I going to confess to him?

71
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,780
Even Achi has a boyfriend now.

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,867
I don’t want to lose to my friend.

73
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:00,005
Lose in what matter?

74
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:01,205
Well…

75
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:03,205
Oh.

76
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,544
I saw the door was ajar so I let myself in.

77
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,806
I’ve missed you so much I couldn’t bear it anymore.

78
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,900
I’ve missed you so much, Madam Noi.

79
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:27,050
Oh, he’s missed the cat.

80
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:38,015
(Okay. This is the moment to confess my feelings to Min.)

81
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:39,440
Min.

82
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,577
I have something for you.

83
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:47,109
Here.

84
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,509
I didn’t order this.

85
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:55,215
You didn’t.

86
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:57,415
I wanted to give it to you.

87
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,306
Thank you.

88
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:05,601
Whoa.

89
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:07,815
But this is very expensive.

90
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:12,213
It’s my gift to celebrate your novel getting published.

91
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,302
Finish building it soon.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,302
I’ll stop by to see it.

93
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:28,539
He even bought me a gift.

94
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,337
Does he actually have a crush on me too?

95
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,403
I’ll build this as soon as I can.

96
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,111
Do you want some photos?

97
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,104
I’ll take them for you.

98
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,015
One, two, three.

99
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,380
These look good.

100
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:02,453
Do you want me to take new ones?

101
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:16,932
Achi.

102
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:19,533
I have two bottles for you to choose from.

103
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:21,208
Which one would you like?

104
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,309
This one.

105
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:31,660
I can never guess your mind correctly.

106
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,753
I thought you’d pick this one.

107
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:36,942
How are they different?

108
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:41,125
This one, I already opened for you

109
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,015
so you wouldn’t have to tire yourself opening it.

110
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,339
You can let me get tired sometimes.

111
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:52,808
But you guessed one thing right.

112
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,608
I was craving a refreshing drink.

113
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:37,626
(Finally, I’m having a special romantic meal with Pai.)

114
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:40,013
(I’m so prepared for this.)

115
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:43,109
(I bought a new outfit and started styling my hair at 3 p.m.)

116
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,020
(I wanted to impress her big time.)

117
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:47,600
(But…)

118
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:50,805
(How is the boss here?)

119
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:55,113
I didn’t think you’d come with us, Boss.

120
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,493
I’m sorry I didn’t explain it clearly.

121
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:02,806
Actually, this is a special work meal

122
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:05,422
so I, as a boss, can get to know my team better.

123
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:09,801
Besides, I wouldn’t let you two have a meal one on one.

124
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:11,608
That wouldn’t look good.

125
00:08:13,713 --> 00:08:16,516
I actually think this is a good idea.

126
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:20,274
I was worried that if it was just the two of us,

127
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,259
we might get teased by other people.

128
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,187
Having you join us

129
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:25,806
makes me feel relieved.

130
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,055
Is that so?

131
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,106
Please eat.

132
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:35,511
Excuse me.

133
00:08:35,926 --> 00:08:37,907
I need to go to the restroom.

134
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,413
We have half an hour before the reservation time.

135
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,013
Shall we take photos for fun while waiting?

136
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:05,537
Hey, Achi, Karan.

137
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:07,403
Hey, Rock.

138
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,139
What are you doing here?

139
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,812
I’m having a meal with Pai.

140
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:13,812
But why are you two here together?

141
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,709
Don’t tell me you’re on a date.

142
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:19,413
No.

143
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,184
We just ran into each other.

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,229
We didn’t come together.

145
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:25,813
I’m just kidding.

146
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:27,813
How can the two of you date?

147
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:30,005
You’re right.

148
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:31,264
How would that be possible?

149
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:34,106
Are you guys leaving soon?

150
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,516
Do you want to join us?

151
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:38,116
No, thank you.

152
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:40,100
I’m about to leave.

153
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:43,309
See you at the office then.

154
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:44,511
I’m going to the restroom.

155
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,201
See you.

156
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:01,937
Achi.

157
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:04,897
Can I ask you something?

158
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:06,704
What is it?

159
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:13,580
You’re not comfortable with letting other people know we’re on a date, right?

160
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:19,613
I understand why you feel that way.

161
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,913
Telling people you’re dating a guy is not easy.

162
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:33,104
I don’t mind telling people I’m dating you

163
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:37,904
but our office has a rule prohibiting employees from dating.

164
00:10:38,406 --> 00:10:39,704
If we get caught,

165
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,518
we could get fired.

166
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:44,502
But I don’t think our boss would be that heartless.

167
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:47,909
If he’s serious, what would you do?

168
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:52,702
I don’t want you to have problems at work

169
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:54,916
so I don’t want anyone in the office to know yet.

170
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:04,419
If I really had to choose, I’d choose you, Achi.

171
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:07,608
I’d be sad to resign

172
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,220
but I think I can find a job elsewhere.

173
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:16,182
I can’t find you anywhere else.

174
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:26,215
For your peace of mind,

175
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,003
we don’t have to tell anyone at the office about this now.

176
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:32,805
Let’s wait for everything to be ready and you can tell them then.

177
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,210
Okay.

178
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:42,933
But we’re not in the office now.

179
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:45,711
Can I ask for something?

180
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:47,733
What is it?

181
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:51,900
Can I…

182
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:57,495
Can I hold your hand?

183
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:00,840
It’s okay if I can’t.

184
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:01,706
You can.

185
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:25,617
What’s wrong?

186
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:32,542
No need.

187
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:33,737
It’s too late.

188
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:49,022
Is this correct?

189
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:56,104
Oh, no!

190
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:03,900
It should be around here.

191
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:10,206
There are so many mosquitoes.

192
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:13,212
It’ll be so bad if I can’t find it.

193
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:15,906
Min went to the trouble of buying it for me.

194
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,180
What’s this?

195
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:28,935
It’s dog’s poop!

196
00:13:29,627 --> 00:13:30,624
Ew!

197
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,805
Where is it?

198
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:41,535
I have a delivery for you.

199
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:56,603
Hold on.

200
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:58,897
What’s the hurry?

201
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,206
How’s it going with the building blocks?

202
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,606
Have you finished assembling them?

203
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:05,620
Building blocks.

204
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:06,806
Well…

205
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,000
You’ve assembled a lot already.

206
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,137
Let me see.

207
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:10,973
Wait.

208
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:11,857
Hold on.

209
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:13,608
Hold on.

210
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,201
This is so pretty.

211
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:21,601
But this stem is missing its flower.

212
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:23,608
I’m sorry, Min.

213
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,311
It’s my fault.

214
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,650
I accidentally dropped it out the window.

215
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:30,095
I looked everywhere around the building but I really couldn’t find it.

216
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:32,299
I also asked the security and the cleaning lady.

217
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,806
No one could find it.

218
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:35,617
I’m really sorry.

219
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:38,911
You intentionally bought it for me but I couldn’t keep it.

220
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:40,845
I’m bad.

221
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,306
I’m really bad.

222
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:44,106
I beg you.

223
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:45,497
Please don’t be mad at me.

224
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:52,055
You don’t have to feel that guilty.

225
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,208
Are you sure you’re not mad at me?

226
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:02,500
But that building block set is so expensive.

227
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:05,290
It was damaged in transit.

228
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:06,620
The customer didn’t want it.

229
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:10,406
And I already opened it, so I had to take responsibility.

230
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:12,010
I didn’t want to throw it away

231
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:14,659
so I gave it to you.

232
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:16,624
What?

233
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:18,504
Yes.

234
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,217
You don’t have to feel guilty.

235
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:22,506
I didn’t even buy it on purpose.

236
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:24,257
I have to go.

237
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:39,413
He didn’t intentionally buy it for me.

238
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:43,617
That means he doesn’t have feelings for me.

239
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,419
It’s all in your head again, Jinta.

240
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:00,540
Achi. Karan.

241
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,907
Boss wants to see you guys.

242
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,706
It’s okay.

243
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:15,775
Whatever will be, will be.

244
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:41,267
What are you doing?

245
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:43,539
Why are you snooping in front of Boss’ room?

246
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:44,902
Keep it down.

247
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:48,012
Achi and Karan got called in by Boss.

248
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:49,193
It seems serious.

249
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:50,528
I don’t know what’s going on.

250
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,347
Help me listen in on them.

251
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,403
No way.

252
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,313
I’m HR.

253
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,408
I have to be a good role model.

254
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:00,300
I won’t stick my nose in my boss’s business.

255
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:01,765
Fine.

256
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:02,645
I’ll listen by myself.

257
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,916
But as HR, I have to know everything.

258
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,860
I’m not going to beat around the bush.

259
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:14,806
You two are dating, aren’t you?

260
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:22,008
Well, the two of us…

261
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:23,660
Yes.

262
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:26,370
Achi and I are dating.

263
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,180
Achi and Karan are together.

264
00:17:37,716 --> 00:17:38,704
You’re so still.

265
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:40,309
You must be shocked.

266
00:17:47,097 --> 00:17:48,457
My ship is together for real.

267
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:50,777
Nothing could make me happier than this.

268
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,676
This is the ultimate dream come true for a BL fangirl.

269
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,085
If I were to die right now, I wouldn’t regret my life.

270
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:08,212
I understand that two guys being in a relationship

271
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:10,328
is something…

272
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,579
I don’t have problems with anything like that, Karan.

273
00:18:13,436 --> 00:18:14,699
I’m a little surprised

274
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:17,979
but I’m generous enough to accept all my employees for who they are.

275
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,455
The reason why I don’t let you guys date each other

276
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:26,217
is because it can affect your work performance.

277
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:33,200
I promise it won’t affect our work.

278
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:38,930
Actually, Karan has always been supporting me

279
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,603
and that makes me want to develop myself further.

280
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:45,337
What if one day you guys break up?

281
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:55,017
Have you ever thought about what you’d do if you broke up?

282
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:57,723
If that day came,

283
00:18:57,742 --> 00:19:01,775
would you two really be able to work together?

284
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:11,693
I know that prohibiting employees from dating

285
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:14,099
seems like a silly rule

286
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,516
but love is very powerful.

287
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:21,535
It will affect every aspect of your lives.

288
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:26,824
You must’ve heard a story about me forcing employees to resign.

289
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:33,539
The truth is I didn’t do anything.

290
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,107
Those two people broke up and couldn’t work together after that.

291
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,935
They left of their own will.

292
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:43,542
I have no intention of firing you two

293
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,940
but I can’t let you continue your relationship.

294
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:51,309
This is a contract

295
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:55,933
that you two will not date each other while working here.

296
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:13,916
Hey, Karan.

297
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:15,224
I’ve been looking for you.

298
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:17,022
The client called and asked for the new product brief.

299
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,575
Can you please send it to me ASAP?

300
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:19,074
Sure.

301
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:19,945
I’ll send it to you shortly.

302
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:20,911
Okay. Thank you.

303
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:24,211
Can we talk later?

304
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:25,706
Yeah.

305
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,290
[No Entry Without Permission]

306
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:45,700
You guys know about Karan and me?

307
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:48,229
Yes.

308
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:49,905
You know what, Achi?

309
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:54,225
This is the best thing that’s ever happened in my life.

310
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:56,860
All my sailing is worth it.

311
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:59,226
You should quickly get your ship back to shore.

312
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,008
Tsunami is coming and you don’t even know it.

313
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,696
What did Boss say?

314
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:12,105
I…

315
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:17,699
I’m afraid I can’t sign this contract.

316
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:20,404
I’m sorry, Boss.

317
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:27,900
Even if Achi and I fulfill the contract by not dating each other,

318
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:33,602
my feelings for him aren’t going anywhere.

319
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,899
I’d do wrong by the company

320
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:40,899
and my own feelings.

321
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,204
What are you going to do then?

322
00:21:49,232 --> 00:21:50,339
Can I prove this to you?

323
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,774
I’ll show you

324
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:58,623
we can really separate work from our personal relationship.

325
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,100
I want to prove it too.

326
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:04,819
It’s okay, Achi.

327
00:22:05,197 --> 00:22:06,909
Let me take responsibility for this myself.

328
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,702
But…

329
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,709
Please.

330
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,500
Please, Boss.

331
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:19,700
What if you fail?

332
00:22:27,536 --> 00:22:28,914
Then I’ll resign.

333
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:30,419
Resign?

334
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:33,340
That’s not fair.

335
00:22:34,342 --> 00:22:37,502
If Karan resigns, I will too.

336
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:39,334
Stop it.

337
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:40,608
He hasn’t resigned.

338
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,416
How is Boss making Karan prove this?

339
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:46,706
By this month’s sales.

340
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:51,103
He asked him to make...

341
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:53,402
three million baht.

342
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:54,805
Three million?

343
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,318
That’s insane.

344
00:22:57,491 --> 00:22:59,465
We only have two weeks left before the end of the month.

345
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:01,906
Even though Karan is the best sales executive,

346
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:03,401
it’s too hard.

347
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,420
Agreed.

348
00:23:04,777 --> 00:23:07,524
This is basically forcing him to resign.

349
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:08,420
Yeah.

350
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,460
Turns out he didn’t intentionally buy it for me.

351
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,860
Why would I keep this to remind myself of that, Madam Noi?

352
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,770
I’ll throw it away now.

353
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,470
I can’t let go of it.

354
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,760
It’s still a gift from Min.

355
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,070
How can I help you?

356
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,540
Can’t I come without a reason?

357
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,260
Just kidding.

358
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,370
I’ve missed Madam Noi so I decided to drop by.

359
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,860
Hey.

360
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,460
(Even the cat seems worth thinking of more than me.)

361
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,850
(You’re so stupid, Jinta)

362
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,860
(for thinking he has feelings for you.)

363
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,260
I have something for you.

364
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,160
How did you find it?

365
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,460
The other day, I came to deliver stuff and found it by chance.

366
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,180
Take it.

367
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,960
(I was risking my life to get it)

368
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,470
(but it’s worth it.)

369
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,060
(These building blocks really suit Jinta.)

370
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,120
(No matter how dangerous it was,)

371
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,370
(I wanted to see them completely assembled.)

372
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,170
Put them together.

373
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,760
Give me a second.

374
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,760
Since this is the last piece,

375
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,260
let’s build it together.

376
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,970
Okay.

377
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,660
Actually, building blocks are like love.

378
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,780
There’s no fixed formula.

379
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,770
We have to slowly build something together.

380
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,860
How’s that?

381
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,270
Is that deep?

382
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,930
I think that’s so cheesy.

383
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,120
But cute.

384
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,740
Oh.

385
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,170
The building blocks.

386
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,060
Thank you.

387
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,470
If you’re interested in this model,

388
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,060
we’ve already prepared the quotation.

389
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,180
Mr. Karan.

390
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,170
Please come in.

391
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,050
I’ll send you two new options tomorrow.

392
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,760
Actually, we’re also launching our new products tomorrow.

393
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,170
I’ll send them over for your consideration.

394
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,220
Take some rest.

395
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,170
I see you haven’t eaten since early this evening.

396
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,970
Why are you still here?

397
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,060
You don’t want to be late for the last boat.

398
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,560
You’re still working.

399
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,210
How can I go home?

400
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,960
Hey.

401
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,690
I’ve put together a list of client names from other sales reps.

402
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,860
Our company hasn't been in contact with these clients for a long time.

403
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,650
This should help you a bit.

404
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,160
Thank you so much, Achi.

405
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,260
I’m sorry this is all I could do to help you.

406
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,260
I know it’s the responsibility of both of us.

407
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,850
No.

408
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,660
You’re helping me a lot.

409
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,560
You know, I’m so proud of this project

410
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,760
because all this time I’ve been working in sales,

411
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,250
I’ve always exceeded the target.

412
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,860
This time, it’s different.

413
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,650
You’re making me even prouder

414
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,660
because I’m doing this for you.

415
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,160
Do you remember when Boss asked...

416
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,660
what would happen if we broke up?

417
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,360
At the time, just the thought of that

418
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,160
hurt me so much.

419
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,570
The only thing on my mind now is

420
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,530
I have to give this my all no matter what.

421
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,560
Please don’t worry, Achi.

422
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,860
I promise I’ll do everything to keep our relationship.

423
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,580
Just please stay by my side.

424
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,570
I will.

425
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,760
I promise.

426
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,890
For now,

427
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,060
you have to rest.

[Total Sales: 1,240,260.00]

430
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,170
Is this the latest Karan sent over?

431
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,250
There’s less than a week left.

432
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,360
There’s no way we can reach three million.

433
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,770
I know.

434
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,600
Should we help Karan do the selling?

435
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,360
Get it together.

436
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,830
You’re not a salesperson.

437
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,020
What are you even going to sell?

438
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,940
Well, I don’t know what to do.

439
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,170
[Karan]

440
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,380
It’s Karan.

441
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:17,960
Hello, Karan.

442
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,360
(Hello, Achi.)

443
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,250
(I’m calling to tell you that)

444
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,760
(I’ve made a deal with a big client.)

445
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,260
(I think we’ll meet the sales target.)

446
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,560
Really?

447
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,170
Karan said he was able to make a deal with a big client.

448
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,350
He thinks we’ll meet the sales target.

449
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,070
Way to go!

450
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,470
Who’s this big client?

451
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,700
Sorry, I have to go.

452
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,160
The client is here.

453
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,760
Talk later.

454
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,760
Hello, Ms. Kem.

455
00:30:58,939 --> 00:30:59,526
Oh.

456
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:00,309
Achi.

457
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:03,908
Achi.	I didn’t know you’re still here, Boss.

458
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,714
I forgot something.

459
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,915
Is something wrong?

460
00:31:12,683 --> 00:31:13,588
No.

461
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:14,788
If I remember correctly,

462
00:31:14,884 --> 00:31:17,471
Karan is discussing the contract with Ms. Kem tonight, right?

463
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,982
This is the catalog for our new products from Japan.

464
00:31:20,994 --> 00:31:22,211
They’ll be available next month.

465
00:31:22,345 --> 00:31:25,811
I’ve selected only the highlighted products that suit your department stores.

466
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,511
I heard you had to meet the sales target,

467
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:32,629
otherwise you’d get fired.

468
00:31:34,817 --> 00:31:35,389
Yes.

469
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,672
I see.

470
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,709
No wonder you came back to me.

471
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:49,816
Actually, I can spend your proposed amount so easily.

472
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:51,791
There’s just one thing.

473
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:58,149
I’m still not happy about what you did to me last time.

474
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:03,945
What are you doing?

475
00:32:06,696 --> 00:32:08,071
You must be uncomfortable

476
00:32:08,496 --> 00:32:11,631
with Karan meeting a client who’s particularly interested in him.

477
00:32:15,774 --> 00:32:17,214
But I’m a kind person.

478
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:21,309
I’ll give you a chance to redeem yourself.

479
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:29,317
If this time, you agree to do everything I want,

480
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:33,709
I’ll sign the contract with you.

481
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:36,712
What do you say?

482
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,016
I warned you guys, didn’t I?

483
00:32:43,622 --> 00:32:45,909
Separating work from your romantic relationship

484
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:47,512
is not easy.

485
00:32:53,155 --> 00:32:54,117
You’re totally wrong.

486
00:32:55,693 --> 00:32:57,908
I can separate work from my romantic relationship

487
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:01,948
but I’m worried about Karan.

488
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:07,616
All this time,

489
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:13,517
I know how much he hates being thought of as just a handsome face.

490
00:33:14,454 --> 00:33:18,917
Knowing he has to be treated that way again tonight

491
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:21,705
hurts me.

492
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:24,551
And this time,

493
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:27,146
I can’t do anything to help him.

494
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:30,789
Please excuse me.

496
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:46,911
Hello, Karan.

00:33:47,284 --> 00:33:48,217
How’s it going?

498
00:33:49,253 --> 00:33:50,197
(I’m sorry.)

499
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,213
(I was with Ms. Kem so I couldn’t reply to you.)

500
00:33:52,785 --> 00:33:54,714
(I have good news for you.)

501
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:55,811
What is it?

502
00:33:56,222 --> 00:33:58,011
(I closed the deal with Ms. Kem.)

503
00:33:58,339 --> 00:33:59,911
(Tomorrow, she’s going to sign the contract.)

504
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:01,108
Really?

505
00:34:01,323 --> 00:34:02,106
(Yes.)

506
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:03,911
(We did it, Achi.)

507
00:34:04,115 --> 00:34:05,826
(We’ve proven ourselves to Boss.)

508
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:09,426
(By the way, are you free tomorrow?)

509
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:11,112
(I want you to come with me.)

510
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,917
Sure.

511
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:14,511
I’ll come with you.

512
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,114
This is Achi.

513
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,520
He’s my assistant today.

514
00:34:25,044 --> 00:34:25,918
Hello.

515
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,512
This is the quotation and the contract.

516
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,666
Please review them first.

517
00:34:40,749 --> 00:34:41,814
All good.

518
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:54,512
Then let’s sign the contract.

519
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,326
Hold on.

520
00:34:55,946 --> 00:34:58,708
I’m waiting for someone.

521
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:05,317
There he is.

522
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,519
Hello, Ms. Kem.

523
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,518
Boss.

524
00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:30,228
I asked Mr. Tanaka to witness our contract signing today

525
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:35,991
because what you did really embarrassed me, Mr. Karan.

526
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,628
Even though you tried to take good care of me,

527
00:35:39,881 --> 00:35:41,269
it’s not enough for me.

528
00:35:44,234 --> 00:35:48,918
I think you should make a formal apology to me

529
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:51,031
in front of Mr. Tanaka.

530
00:35:51,798 --> 00:35:53,911
That should make me feel better.

531
00:35:57,943 --> 00:36:00,431
How would you like me to apologize?

532
00:36:09,054 --> 00:36:11,309
Could you kneel down and apologize?

533
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,010
Don’t do it, Karan.

534
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:16,718
You didn’t do anything wrong.

535
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,629
If you don’t do it, you’re fired.

536
00:36:32,266 --> 00:36:36,631
(If it will save my relationship with Achi, I can do anything.)

537
00:37:07,468 --> 00:37:08,271
Stand up,

538
00:37:08,582 --> 00:37:09,512
Karan.

539
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:13,349
Ms. Kem, I’m sorry.

540
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:15,705
I really can’t let my employee

541
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,311
be insulted this much.

542
00:37:18,797 --> 00:37:19,911
How could you even think that?

543
00:37:20,413 --> 00:37:22,717
Do you know how much you’ll lose if I don’t sign this contract?

544
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:23,918
It’s okay.

545
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:29,314
I planned to tear up this contract anyway.

546
00:37:37,573 --> 00:37:38,411
You idiots.

547
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,022
Don’t even think you’ll get to do business with me again.

548
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:43,211
Let’s go.

549
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:46,712
Come on.

550
00:38:04,748 --> 00:38:06,706
Thank you for helping Karan.

551
00:38:07,006 --> 00:38:08,114
No need to thank me.

552
00:38:09,075 --> 00:38:12,148
Did you really think I wanted that kind of client?

553
00:38:13,942 --> 00:38:17,912
Actually, there’s another contract I should tear up.

554
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,054
This is a contract

555
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:33,909
that you two will not date each other while working here.

556
00:38:44,062 --> 00:38:45,109
Don’t get me wrong.

557
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:47,118
I’m not in support of your relationship

558
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:49,814
but I have to admit

559
00:38:51,094 --> 00:38:53,228
that you two have really proven to me

560
00:38:53,752 --> 00:38:56,914
how much love means to you.

561
00:39:07,726 --> 00:39:10,217
Let’s just say that though I don’t support this,

562
00:39:11,964 --> 00:39:13,426
I won’t stop it.

563
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:20,189
I hope you two continue to grow with your love.

564
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:22,586
I have to go.

565
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:39,414
I’m so relieved everything turned out well.

566
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:42,115
If I really had to resign,

567
00:39:43,056 --> 00:39:44,115
what would you do?

568
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:50,509
I already thought about it.

569
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,711
I would resign too.

570
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:53,909
Hmm?

571
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,912
I mean it.

572
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:03,109
I’ve always thought it’s not fair that you had to take the responsibility alone

573
00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:05,828
and I felt so uncomfortable

574
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:07,909
that I couldn’t do anything to help you.

575
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,109
Why are you smiling?

576
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:21,317
I’m glad.

577
00:40:25,663 --> 00:40:28,609
I feel like our relationship has grown another step.

578

No obstacles could come between our love.

579
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:38,915

Uh…

586
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,389
Well…

587
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,411
You accidentally hummed it out loud.

588
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:34,315
Really?

589
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:36,917
I didn’t realize it at all.

590

I’ll be right back.

I’m just asking if you’ve talked with him about your magical power.

592

Achi.

593
00:42:09,311 --> 00:42:10,714
I have these in green and orange.

594
00:42:11,117 --> 00:42:12,146
Which color would you like?

595
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:16,226
I want purple.

596
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:22,788
Here’s the purple one.

597
00:42:24,729 --> 00:42:26,388
I changed my mind.

598
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:27,714
I want the red one instead.

599
00:42:28,453 --> 00:42:29,217
Here’s the red one.

600
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,517
Whoa, how many colors do you have?

601
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:33,915
I’m not good at reading your mind

602
00:42:34,323 --> 00:42:35,911
so I have to try harder.

603
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:39,613
I chose these candies that come in different colors.

604
00:42:56,068 --> 00:42:58,946
I think how sensitive and observant you are

605
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,011
is probably what makes you able to guess others’ minds all the time.

606
00:43:04,145 --> 00:43:05,420
I won’t give up though.

607
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:08,788
I’ll try to get to know you better

608
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:11,712
like how you know me so well.

609
00:43:15,148 --> 00:43:16,121
(That’s not true.)

Hmm?

I have mind reading power.

617
00:44:10,986 --> 00:44:11,571
Take it.

618
00:44:11,638 --> 00:44:13,246
I bought you these shoes

619
00:44:13,257 --> 00:44:15,272
because I have a hidden agenda.
