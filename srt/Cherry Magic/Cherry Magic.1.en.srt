5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,850
Good day, Luang Por.

6
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,070
I’m off to work.

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,554
Achi, don’t forget to wake up for your birthday merit-making tomorrow.

8
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:39,179
Your mom already called and asked me to prepare the stuff.

9
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,247
See you at the temple dock tomorrow.

10
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:41,914
Okay.

11
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:45,000
You should make merit to boost your life.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,188
You’re already turning 30 this year.

13
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,338
(30?)

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,856
(That’s right.)

15
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:53,158
(I’m turning 30 tomorrow.)

16
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:58,911
(Many say turning 30 is a time of major milestones in life)

17
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:00,734
(such as getting your own house,)

18
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,789
(owning a car,)

19
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:06,613
(or getting promoted to a high position and having a secure job.)

20
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:09,401
(But for me, things would still be the same as every day.)

21
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:13,482
(I’m probably not a 30-year-old who has everything the others expect me to.)

22
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:15,780
(Especially in this regard.)

23
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,879
(Out of all the expectations,)

24
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,509
(finding love is probably the hardest to meet.)

25
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:28,979
(To have someone fall for me or make me feel brave enough to fall for someone,)

26
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,962
(it’d probably take some kind of magical power for that to happen.)

27
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:05,664
Hurry up!

28
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:06,537
We don’t want to be late.

29
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:07,432
Hurry up!

30
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:08,737
Gentlemen.

31
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:09,640
Thanks.

32
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,530
Straighten your necktie.

33
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,265
Straighten it.

34
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,201
It’s almost time.

35
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:13,348
Look cheerful.

36
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:15,066
Smile.

37
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:21,833
Achi.

38
00:03:23,764 --> 00:03:25,399
You don’t have to go and prepare the stuff anymore.

39
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,753
Can you stay and help me here?

40
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:28,766
Come here.

41
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:31,433
This is Banpot, our new employee.

42
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,430
He just joined today

43
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,535
but I haven’t given him an orientation yet.

44
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:35,464
Can you take care of him?

45
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,431
You may ask him to fill out some documents first.

46
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:38,986
Okay?

47
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,003
- Sure.
- Please help me.

48
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:47,063
Thank you, Achi.

49
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,000
You can call me Rock.

50
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:52,366
I’m so excited.

51
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,154
I’ve never worked a full-time job before.

52
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,334
Considering your age, you seem to have been here for a long time.

53
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:57,882
You’re in a senior position, right?

54
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:00,960
Feel free to give me any advice.

55
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,158
I’d really appreciate your help.

56
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,342
No need to Wai me.

57
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:04,817
I’m not that senior.

58
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,504
I’m an admin.

59
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:10,360
Just an ordinary administrative officer.

60
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,227
I don’t have a high position at all.

61
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:15,120
I’ve just been here for a long time.

62
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:16,529
Got it.

63
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:20,200
Anyway, you’re my senior now.

64
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:21,982
(You guys should get up there already.)

65
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:23,366
(Line up.)

66
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,491
(Get up there and form a line.)

67
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:26,471
Is it hectic here like this every day?

68
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:29,793
We have our annual awards ceremony today.

69
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:32,021
It’s a big event because this year

70
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,666
a representative from Japan will present the awards himself.

71
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,149
We got through it because of the collaboration between both branches,

72
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,462
Thailand and Japan,

73
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:39,298
and especially thanks to this gentleman

74
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:41,843
whom I’ve come to present the award to myself.

75
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:47,679
Please give it up for our star employee for 7 consecutive years.

76
00:04:48,463 --> 00:04:49,628
Toyokawa’s pride.

77
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:51,065
Mr. Karan.

78
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:14,871
Thank you for the award.

79
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,260
And thank you, Mr. Ikeda, for traveling here for this.

80
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:22,505
It means a lot to me.

81
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,555
This achievement isn’t mine alone.

82
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,715
I couldn’t have done it without the collaboration from all of you here.

83
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:34,533
Thank you so much.

84
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:43,166
(He’s always showing respect to others like that.)

85
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,609
Why is that guy so handsome, cool, and talented?

86
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:50,744
That’s Karan.

87
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:54,193
If you want to pick someone in the office as your role model,

88
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:55,531
it should be him.

89
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:07,134
(Even though we joined at the same time, I’m so far behind him now.)

90
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:09,455
7 YEARS AGO

91
00:06:09,455 --> 00:06:10,557
Ms. Nattakan, please come in.

92
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,775
(We’re around the same age but work in different positions.)

93
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:18,262
6 YEARS AGO

94
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:22,374
(And he does his job so well.)

95
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:27,711
5 YEARS AGO

96
00:06:28,214 --> 00:06:28,983
Congratulations.

97
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:30,104
Thank you so much.

98
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:32,760
(Everyone accepts him.)

99
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:38,446
4 YEARS AGO

100
00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:53,293
3 YEARS AGO

101
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,092
(And he has come to represent the perfect 30-year-olds.)

102
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,040
You’re amazing.

103
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,571
You’re not even 30 yet
[2 YEARS AGO]

104
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,171
but you get a big desk already.

105
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:08,313
I got mine when I was nearly 40.

106
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:17,924
(The distance between Karan and I seems to keep increasing.)

107
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:26,856
(He’s the person I look at and compare myself to.)

108
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:34,819
(I used to wish that one day I would become a tiny fraction as smart as Karan.)

109
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:36,837
(Just a little would be enough.)

110
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,696
Achi,

111
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,131
there’s a photo of you on this board.

112
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,183
It’s just a birthday shout-out, Pai.

113
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,658
Not like I have any achievements.

114
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:11,862
Mr. Ikeda wished you a happy birthday.

115
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,473
Thank you so much.

116
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,292
Mr. Ikeda asked how old you are.

117
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:27,323
I’m turning 30 tomorrow.

118
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:41,873
Mr. Ikeda said

119
00:08:41,873 --> 00:08:43,548
turning 30 is a time of growth.

120
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:46,800
Good things will definitely happen to you.

121
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:49,476
He wishes you all the best.

122
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:55,157
(I guess I have to be a full adult now.)

123
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,520
(Do you think someone like me knows how to do that?)

124
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:02,963
[How to be a perfect 30-year-old.]

125
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:07,249
[3 Things to Know When You Reach 30]

126
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:09,654
First, savings are very important.

127
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,484
(Right now, I just want to have enough to spend each month.)

128
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:16,009
Second, you’ll start to get back pain.

129
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,870
(I got that even before reaching my 30.)

130
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,829
Third, keep those around you.

131
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,633
They will become important people in your life.

132
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:28,818
(There are not many, but I’ll do my best.)

133
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:35,224
(But don’t worry, you might experience something fun and unexpected.)

134
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:40,990
(There’s a belief that if you’re still a virgin at 30, you’ll gain a magical power.)

135
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,037
(I hope reading that makes you smile.)

136
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:47,393
Hey, Achi.

137
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:48,897
Why did you close it?

138
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:50,200
I haven’t finished reading.

139
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:53,383
I have 7 years to go, huh?

140
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:55,760
Will I start getting back pain already when I turn 30?

141
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:58,020
That’s so old.

142
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,132
(What kind of belief is that? Gaining a magical power from being a virgin at 30?)

143
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:05,807
(It’s probably just a fun story to comfort people who’ve never been with anyone.)

144
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:10,000
Honestly, are you serious with that guy?

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,603
Come on. You’re too serious about this.

146
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:14,463
I’m only seeing Achi as a helper.

147
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:17,195
He’s so boring.

148
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:19,560
He does everything I ask.

149
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,808
I knew a guy like him wouldn’t be able to handle you.

150
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:23,100
You know me so well.

151
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,166
(I wasn’t mad at her at all.)

152
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,650
(But things were ruined even before I started my first relationship.)

153
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:39,395
(That might seem like a small matter, but it started my fear of thinking about love.)

154
00:10:58,171 --> 00:10:59,514
(It’s unbelievable, isn’t it?)

155
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:03,460
(But I'm still a virgin at 30.)

156
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:22,739
Happy Birthday, Achi.

157
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:26,405
I wish you a healthy 30, son.

158
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:27,560
Thank you, Mom.

159
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:29,691
The monk is here.

160
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:31,360
Talk later.

161
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,813
Could you please come this way?

162
00:12:06,754 --> 00:12:09,354
(If you want something, work for it for a change.)

163
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,096
(Don’t just pray to the monks for it.)

164
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,143
What?

165
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:17,616
What’s the matter?

166
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:22,205
Nothing.

167
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:24,241
I’m probably just hearing things.

168
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:28,771
May you be blessed with a long life, glowing skin, happiness, and good health.

169
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,028
Achi.

170
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:35,223
Yes?

171
00:12:35,481 --> 00:12:38,238
I wish you career growth,

172
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:40,422
wealth, and a high position.

173
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,544
Most importantly, I hope you finally find someone.

174
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:45,607
Thank you, Auntie.

175
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:49,309
Let me help you pack up.

176
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:50,894
Oh.

177
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,140
(You’re a grown man but still won’t stop being clumsy, Achi.)

178
00:12:57,987 --> 00:13:02,120
(It’s cute to be like this when you were a kid, but you’re 30 now.)

179
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:03,972
What did you say?

180
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:06,120
I didn’t say anything.

181
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,850
(Will he be alright? No wonder his mother is so worried about him.)

182
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:27,709
(Ugh, the ticket booking service has no more availability. When will I finally get my concert ticket?)

183
00:13:28,194 --> 00:13:30,324
(Damn. What’s going on?)

184
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:33,134
(Why do I feel like I heard her voice when she hasn’t said anything?)

185
00:13:33,223 --> 00:13:34,805
(Was it the sound of her thoughts?)

186
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:36,976
(Was it the sound of her thoughts?)

187
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,000
(I’m going to pray this evening. I must find a man this year.)

188
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,458
(I hate Mondays. No, I don’t hate Mondays. I hate every day that I have to go to work.)

189
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,580
(If my neighbor doesn’t stop being an idiot, I’ll call the police today.)

190
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,762
What the hell is going on?

191
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:47,493
(This weather makes people crazy.)

192
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,536
(If you forgot something, go back to get it, not make a scene on the sky train.)

193
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:50,584
(What’s wrong with him?)

194
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,053
(What’s going on?)

195
00:13:56,053 --> 00:13:59,215
(Why does it seem like I can hear people’s thoughts when I touch them?)

196
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:07,012
(Or being a virgin at 30 makes me able to read minds?)

197
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:12,288
(Is this about the belief in magical power on that website?)

198
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:17,228
(I don’t know what happened.)

199
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:20,733
(But please make me stop hearing other people’s thoughts.)

200
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,453
(Amen.)

201
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:39,767
Please go ahead.

202
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:20,674
(Thank god it’ll just be me and Karan in the elevator.)

203
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:23,795
(I won’t have to squeeze into anyone or hear anything again.)

204
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:24,698
Is something wrong?

205
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,495
You look stressed when it’s only morning.

206
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:28,896
No.

207
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:32,291
I just don’t want to get in a crowded elevator.

208
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:37,315
Do you want to take the stairs with me then?

209
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:38,698
There’ll only be a few people around.

210
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,027
No, thanks.

211
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:43,183
I don’t want to exhaust myself before I start working.

212
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:51,840
(How can Karan be so handsome, smart, and friendly?)

213
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:54,051
(And look at how neatly he dressed.)

214
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:56,742
(No wonder everyone admires him.)

215
00:15:58,709 --> 00:15:59,287
Achi,

216
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:01,349
the elevator is here.

217
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:15,979
(I can’t escape this, can I?)

218
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:24,923
(You must have run to work.)

219
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:27,600
(That’s why your hair is sticking out like this.)

220
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:29,195
(It looks like a duck tail.)

221
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:33,053
(But it’s cute though.)

222
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:34,366
(Eh?)

223
00:16:35,514 --> 00:16:36,682
(Cute?)

224
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:38,457
(Who did Karan compliment?)

225
00:16:38,953 --> 00:16:42,188
(Does he have a crush on someone in the office?)

226
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:46,006
(I never thought I’d get to be near you today.)

227
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:46,965
(Hmm.)

228
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:49,034
(That person must be in here.)

229
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:51,973
(Who is that woman?)

230
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:55,647
(What kind of person does Karan like?)

231
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:04,640
(Achi looks even cuter up close.)

232
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:07,674
(This is going to be a good day.)

233
00:17:07,674 --> 00:17:09,574
(I get to be near my crush so early in the morning.)

234
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,305
(Thank you so much, Achi, for being cute today.)

235

(See? It’s not true.)

241
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:42,476
(It’s only true in fiction and mysteries.)

242
00:17:42,882 --> 00:17:46,018
(Achi, you’re just stressed and paranoid.)

243
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:47,856
(Forget it. Relax.)

244
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:50,634
(You’re just hearing things.)

245
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:51,904
Morning, Achi.

246
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:55,969
Hi, Rock.

247
00:17:58,842 --> 00:17:59,573
Are you...

248
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,335
Are you uncomfortable with me?

249
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:04,136
No.

250
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:06,379
What’s up?

251
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:15,460
Are you lonely?

252
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:18,030
Since I just joined, I don’t know anyone yet.

253
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:21,500
This office is full of women and seniors.

254
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:23,776
Can I talk to you first?

255
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:24,864
Please?

256
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:26,484
Of course.

257
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:31,882
Is this about the office rules you asked me about?

258
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:32,515
Yes.

259
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,829
Ms. Dujdao made me note them down.

260
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:36,468
There are just so many.

261
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:37,487
I can’t make sense of them.

262
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:38,791
Are they really that serious?

263
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:39,593
Look.

264
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:41,370
Wear a suit at work at all times.

265
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,240
Never leave before your boss.

266
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:45,481
Socialize for harmony.

267
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:47,520
Do everything on time and not too far in advance.

268
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,363
But don’t be late.

269
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:49,520
Don’t eat in the office.

270
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,103
Small snacks are an exception.

271
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:51,889
Don’t make a mess at the table.

272
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:53,640
There are like a hundred of them.

273
00:18:53,824 --> 00:18:55,059
Do we really have to stick to these rules?

274
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:58,387
I thought it’d get more chilled after graduating college.

275
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:04,624
Rock, everywhere in this world has rules and restrictions.

276
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:07,032
We don’t get to do what we want that much.

277
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,922
Try opening your mind.

278
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,248
I think you can learn many things here.

279
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:16,265
Thank you.

280
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:17,369
I appreciate your advice.

281
00:19:20,831 --> 00:19:21,420

282
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:23,114

284

285
00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:39,539
See?

286
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,342
This place is a SOTUS system.

287
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,923
It’s consumed by dark power.

t’s not that bad.

Actually,

292
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:51,710
the scary thing about this place is

293
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:57,846
having very talented people and people with no talent at all together.

It’s okay.

356
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:34,687
I can do it myself.

00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:52,495
(Ouch! It’s real. Somebody help me!)

361
00:23:52,495 --> 00:23:54,623
(Mom! Oh, my mom is far away. She can’t help me in time.)

362
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:57,555
(The monk. Honor to the Blessed One.)

363
00:23:57,555 --> 00:24:00,652
(No! How can it be this bad?)

364
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:02,514
(How can I hallucinate so badly?)

365
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,520
(Karan, are you sure you should be thinking those things?)

366
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,833
(What mole? I don’t have any!)

367
00:24:10,456 --> 00:24:10,956
(A mole!)

368
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,955
(I have one. So that means…)

369
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:15,661
(Everything is real.)

370
00:24:15,862 --> 00:24:17,029
(It’s happening for real.)

371
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,204
(I really can read people’s minds.)

372
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,508
This office really is weird.

373
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:34,185
Here you go.

374
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,960
Chow down your extra feet.

375
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:39,158
Enjoy, guys.

376
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,646
You ordered extra?

377
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:48,361
I need to talk to you about something important

378
00:24:50,164 --> 00:24:52,921
but you must keep it a secret.

379
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:54,846
Of course.

380
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,145
The commitment between us is always important.

381
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:01,570
Come on.

382
00:25:01,712 --> 00:25:03,187
Cheers.

383
00:25:09,997 --> 00:25:10,798
Hey.

384
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:11,595
Mm?

385
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:13,445
Well…

386
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,689
Well…

387
00:25:19,597 --> 00:25:23,845
I have a magical power to read people’s minds by touching them.

388
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:25,667
More importantly,

389
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:33,769
I heard that the most perfect guy in my office happens to have a crush on me.

390
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:37,300
Sorry.

391
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:38,325
I choked on the foot.

392
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:40,650
Never mind.

393
00:25:41,336 --> 00:25:42,584
I thought you didn’t believe what I said.

394
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,180
Of course, I didn’t.

395
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,504
Are you crazy?

396
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,317
You’re saying you have a magical power and a secret admirer?

397
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,264
That sounds delusional.

398
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:53,534
Honestly, has something been stressing you out?

399
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:54,754
I knew it.

400
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:56,395
If you don’t believe me, you don’t get to eat.

401
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,288
You don’t get to eat either.

402
00:25:58,288 --> 00:25:59,190
You don’t get to eat.

403
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:00,490
Give it back to me.

404
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,396
You don’t get to eat.

405
00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:02,600
No!

406
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,282
Don’t do that!

407
00:26:03,282 --> 00:26:04,013
Stop!

408
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:04,832
No!

409
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:05,406
Hey.

410
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:06,413
What’s wrong with you guys?

411
00:26:07,052 --> 00:26:09,483
Do you want to order another set of feet and eggs so you don’t have to fight over them?

412
00:26:09,483 --> 00:26:10,671
You’re fighting like children.

413
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,736
Behave when you eat.

414
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,496
Well,

415
00:26:16,774 --> 00:26:18,788
I get that it’s hard to believe.

416
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,763
So let’s just focus on the important things.

417
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:24,222
Like what?

418
00:26:26,257 --> 00:26:28,161
Like the fact that I have a secret admirer.

419
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:33,392
I’m asking you for advice because you’re a legendary romance novelist.

420
00:26:35,015 --> 00:26:38,316
You must have a lot of relationship experience

421
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:40,732
and really understand the world.

422
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,476
That’s why I want your opinion on what I should do.

423
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:48,735
Are you sure he likes you and it’s not all in your head?

424
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:50,959
I’m completely sure.

425
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:54,616
I just don’t know why he likes me.

426
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:02,046
You know, it’s actually hard to describe the theory of love

427
00:27:02,303 --> 00:27:03,995
and why a person likes you.

428
00:27:04,161 --> 00:27:07,107
It may start from the little moments that make you feel good.

429
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:10,210
Before you know it, you’ve fallen in love with someone.

430
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:11,918
Wow.

431
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:16,150
That sounds so soft and deep.

432
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,983
When you found out he liked you, what’s the first thing you felt?

433
00:27:24,237 --> 00:27:25,273
I guess I was surprised.

434
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:26,941
Okay.

435
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:29,058
If you don’t want problems,

436
00:27:29,224 --> 00:27:31,720
don’t lead him on. Got it?

437
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:36,306
Got it.

438
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:39,095
Thanks a lot, buddy.

439
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:43,304
Without you, I’d be struggling to deal with this.

440
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:46,451
It’s okay.

441
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:51,955
(Thank god I still look good in my friend’s eyes.)

442
00:27:51,955 --> 00:27:55,630
(If one day he finds out that I’ve never dated anyone either,)

443
00:27:55,928 --> 00:27:57,928
(will he still believe in anything I say?)

444
00:27:58,165 --> 00:27:58,737
Hey.

445
00:28:00,072 --> 00:28:00,584
What?

446
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,158
Nothing.

447
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:05,600
Eat the feet. They’ve gone cold already.

448
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:06,522
Okay.

449
00:28:07,783 --> 00:28:09,783
I’m going to eat this then.

450
00:28:11,974 --> 00:28:13,278
Thank you.

451
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:14,329
I’m going to eat this now.

452
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,856
You should eat too. Come on.

453
00:28:19,612 --> 00:28:25,600
(Oh, Jinta. You act like a pro, but only know the theory.)

454
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,937
(You’ve never put it into practice, have you?)

455
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:29,905
(No wonder we’re friends.)

456
00:28:30,297 --> 00:28:33,717
(And no wonder we’re both still sitting here single.)

457
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:36,900
This is good. Aren’t you going to eat it?

458
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,534
Thank you so much.

459
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:40,412
Come again, kiddos.

460
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:41,369
Bye now.

461
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:42,033
Bye.

462
00:28:47,383 --> 00:28:48,095
See you, buddy.

463
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:51,442
Don’t worry too much and don’t forget to follow my advice.

464
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:52,565
Understand?

465
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,312
Okay.

466
00:28:56,186 --> 00:28:56,953
Get home safe.

467
00:28:57,781 --> 00:28:58,281
See you.

468
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,444
What are you doing here?

469
00:29:15,444 --> 00:29:16,167
Come out.

470
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,602
Okay.

471
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:20,054
Can you breathe?

472
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:25,085
I’ll come to visit you again, okay?

473
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:27,483
I’ll buy you some food next time.

474
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:28,748
Okay?

475
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:31,490
Okay. Be good.

476
00:29:31,891 --> 00:29:32,401
I’m off now.

477
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:33,217
See you.

478
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:34,105
Bye.

479
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:42,612
Hey.

480
00:29:44,223 --> 00:29:46,057
I said I’d come visit you again.

481
00:29:46,366 --> 00:29:47,964
Don’t follow me, okay?

482
00:29:47,964 --> 00:29:48,905
I’m leaving now.

483
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:56,764
I said I’d come visit you again.

484
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,320
Come on. Go home.

485
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:01,609
Why do I have to keep repeating myself?

486
00:30:04,926 --> 00:30:07,160
Hey. I know you’re following me.

487
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,543
If you’re stubborn like this, I won't come to see you again.

488
00:30:14,822 --> 00:30:15,852
What should I do?

489
00:30:32,922 --> 00:30:33,734
Kitty cat.

490
00:30:34,444 --> 00:30:35,206
Your food has arrived.

491
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:42,848
Where have you gone today?

492
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:47,811
Meow.

493
00:30:49,168 --> 00:30:50,003
Meow.

494
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:54,455
Meow.

495
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:02,716
You’ve never gone anywhere.

496
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:24,247
If someone has taken you in, I hope they’re good people.

497
00:31:26,347 --> 00:31:27,945
If I’m lucky, I hope to see you again.

498
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:35,673
Thank you, Achi.

499
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:39,767
Thank you.

500
00:31:45,785 --> 00:31:47,170
Ahem, everyone.

501
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,461
This is Rock.

502
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,401
He just joined the promotion team.

503
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:53,029
He’s going to help me design campaigns to promote our products.

504
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:54,318
Hi.

505
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,254
Congrats, Pai.

506
00:31:56,254 --> 00:31:57,361
Now you won’t have to do it alone.

507
00:31:57,361 --> 00:31:58,072
I know.

508
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,600
That department has a heavy workload.

509
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,939
I’m serious. I’m not trying to scare you.

510
00:32:02,098 --> 00:32:03,696
Well, that’s true.

511
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,013
Today is also going to be a long day.

512
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:08,560
Really?

513
00:32:13,411 --> 00:32:14,842
But I can do it for sure.

514
00:32:15,621 --> 00:32:16,391
You’ll see.

515
00:32:16,996 --> 00:32:19,138
Hey, are you seeing anyone?

516
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:21,519
Why?

517
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:25,426
Single people who work here stay single forever

518
00:32:25,426 --> 00:32:27,793
and everyone in a relationship breaks up

519
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,120
because the work is so tough.

520
00:32:29,853 --> 00:32:30,784
Is that right, Achi?

521
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:32,208
It’s possible.

522
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:33,547
I can confirm it.

523
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:36,036
This is the most legendary cursed office.

524
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:41,826
See?

525
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:45,410
You’ve only just joined but your face looks pale already

526
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:46,844
from stressing all day.

527
00:32:47,223 --> 00:32:49,800
Was he stressed because he had to join us for this meal?

528
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:51,580
Seriously?

529
00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:54,821
Just eat. Don’t stress.

530
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:12,521
(What should I do? I have an important date with my partner this evening.)

531
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:15,455
(If I get off late and can’t make it, I’ll be screwed.)

532
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,635
(So that’s what he’s stressed about.)

533
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,893
The damn rain has already stopped

534
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:26,774
but now it looks like it’s going to pour again.

535
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:29,108
It always rains when it’s almost time to go home.

536
00:33:29,581 --> 00:33:30,238
Ugh.

537
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:34,127
And the boss is still here.

538
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:37,302
Why does he have to be so hardworking?

539
00:34:06,154 --> 00:34:06,680
Let’s go.

540
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:36,237
Achi.

541
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:36,872
Yes?

542
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:37,944
I’m leaving now.

543
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:39,581
Get home safe.

544
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:50,996
(Have the notebook samples arrived?)

545
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:52,583
Not yet, Rock.

546
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,056
The guy said he’s stuck in the rain. It’ll probably take another while.

547
00:34:55,736 --> 00:34:59,179
(I feel so bad. I shouldn’t have asked you to help with my work.)

548
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:00,142
(Now you have to wait until late.)

549
00:35:00,142 --> 00:35:01,169
(It’s totally fine, Rock.)

550
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:03,682
(I have to stay late to finish my work anyway.)

551
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:05,825
(Don’t worry about it.)

552
00:35:10,813 --> 00:35:11,583
Thank you.

553
00:35:18,153 --> 00:35:21,620
Wait, why do the colors of the logo look weird?

554
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:32,167
Hello?

555
00:35:32,356 --> 00:35:34,020
(Have you finished checking them, Mr. Achi?)

556
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:36,130
(We have to confirm and make a print order tonight.)

557
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,122
(Otherwise, we’ll miss the deadline.)

558
00:35:38,151 --> 00:35:39,441
How much time do we have left?

559
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,838
(No more than half an hour.)

560
00:35:43,638 --> 00:35:44,876
Alright. I’ll submit it as soon as I can.

561
00:35:44,994 --> 00:35:46,111
(I’ll be waiting.)

562
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:46,646
Thank you.

563
00:36:08,057 --> 00:36:11,311
I went to get food downstairs and these were Buy 1, Get 1 Free

564
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:15,200
so I got one for you since you’re also staying late to work.

565
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,170
Oh.

566
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:18,617
Thank you.

567
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:21,881
(The truth is I intended to buy it for you.)

568
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:24,411
(You must be so hungry working late.)

569
00:36:33,546 --> 00:36:35,144
The new colors of the client’s logo look good.

570
00:36:37,477 --> 00:36:38,420
The new colors?

571
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:40,600
Yeah.

572
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:43,085
Did Rock not tell you?

573
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:49,261
He just joined.

574
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:51,720
He probably didn’t know he had to tell me about it.

575
00:36:53,832 --> 00:36:55,832
Well, if Rock wants to leave his work with other people,

576
00:36:56,095 --> 00:36:57,740
he should be more careful next time.

577
00:36:58,446 --> 00:36:58,946
Come on.

578
00:36:59,561 --> 00:37:00,360
Let me help you.

579
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,220
This is correct.

580
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,151
M100, Y100.

581
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:44,947
You can go ahead and print them.

582
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:48,231
Thank you so much, Karan.

583
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:50,918
If it wasn’t for you, I’d be in trouble.

584
00:37:51,717 --> 00:37:52,292
No worries.

585
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:55,600
Okay.

586
00:37:56,979 --> 00:37:59,523
(I’m so happy I got to stay and help Achi today.)

587
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:06,179
(Most importantly, being alone in the office with him is so romantic.)

588
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:09,062
(Oh, I made a mistake.)

589
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,393
(I was so stressed about work and totally forgot about this.)

590
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:16,120
(I tried not to lead him on but things led me here.)

591
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:20,547
(How should I deal with this?)

592
00:38:30,898 --> 00:38:32,249
Your shirt has a stain from the milk you drank earlier.

593
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:34,273
If you leave it for too long, it’ll be hard to wash out.

594
00:38:34,991 --> 00:38:35,621
Oh,

595
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:37,453
you’re right.

596
00:38:38,064 --> 00:38:38,626
Thank you.

597
00:38:41,964 --> 00:38:42,644
Shall we go now?

598
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:46,269
We can take the elevator. It won’t be crowded at this time.

599
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:49,536
Let’s go.

600
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:14,973
The sky train has already stopped running.

601
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,317
How are you going to get home?

602
00:39:17,745 --> 00:39:18,813
I think I’ll get a taxi.

603
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:21,909
There it is.

604
00:39:21,909 --> 00:39:22,409
I should go.

605
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,609
I tried the ride-hailing app.

606
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:56,507
No one accepted the booking.

607
00:39:57,016 --> 00:39:58,446
It’s probably hard to get a ride when it’s raining.

608
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:06,083
(Achi must be so tired and will have trouble getting home.)

609
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:09,051
(Because of his kindness,)

610
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:11,172
(he’s always helping others and ending up getting himself in trouble.)

611
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:14,165
(But this is why I like him.)

612
00:40:18,928 --> 00:40:20,146
(That sounds so special.)

613
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:24,089
(Karan is probably the first to see me as a kind person.)

614
00:40:25,051 --> 00:40:27,755
(I’m sorry I’ve been acting weird all day.)

615
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:29,987
(I wasted my time worrying about nonsense.)

616
00:40:32,727 --> 00:40:35,700
How about I give you a ride first?

617
00:40:36,261 --> 00:40:38,395
Once we get out of this area, it should be easier to get you a taxi.

618
00:40:45,295 --> 00:40:45,953
Let’s go.

619
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:04,521
(It’ll probably take an hour for Achi to get home.)

620
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:08,045
(Then he has to take a shower. What time will he get to sleep?)

621
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,968
(It’ll only be a little while before he has to wake up, shower, and go to work again.)

622
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:12,558
(He’ll be so tired.)

623
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:21,210
Achi.

624
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:27,668
You’re all wet.

625
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:28,245
Why don’t you wipe yourself?

626
00:41:29,162 --> 00:41:29,787
Thank you.

627
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,251
I have an offer.

628
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:42,489
Yes?

629
00:41:43,344 --> 00:41:45,738
Do you want to stay at my condo tonight?

630
00:41:46,694 --> 00:41:47,359
It’s just nearby.

631
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,628
You can make yourself at home there.

632
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,090
Let’s go.

633
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:43,179
(I tried not to lead him on.)

634
00:42:43,748 --> 00:42:46,117
(I tried to act like nothing happened.)

635
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:49,567
(But now I’m staying over at Karan’s condo?)

636
00:42:49,904 --> 00:42:50,415
After you.

637
00:42:52,176 --> 00:42:53,665
(What should I do?)

638
00:43:06,163 --> 00:43:09,991
(Why does someone who has never experienced love once in his life

639
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:11,748
has to go through something like this?)

640
00:43:11,748 --> 00:43:12,321
Achi.

641
00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:39,249
(How did we get here?)

642
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:40,146
Here’s your pajamas.

643
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:44,036
(Finally, I’ll see Achi wear the pajamas I specifically bought for him.)

644
00:43:44,036 --> 00:43:47,167
(Wait. I thought my mind-reading power would help.)

645
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,505
(But the more I read minds, the more stressed I become.)

646
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:53,023
Why are you two here together?

647
00:43:53,023 --> 00:43:54,652
Are you guys on a date?

648
00:43:55,793 --> 00:43:57,480
It’s not that I’m uncomfortable with kissing you.

649
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:10,918
[Love can start from the little moments that impress you.]
[Before you know it, you’ve already caught feelings.]
