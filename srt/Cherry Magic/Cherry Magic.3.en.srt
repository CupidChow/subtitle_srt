00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:05,460
Characters, actions, places, occupations, and events in this series

2
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:08,128
are fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.

3
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:12,331
They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,702
Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:16,703
So you still think you can read minds?

6
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:17,979
I’m not delusional.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,312
Someone really has a crush on me.

8
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:20,115
Then it’s easy.

9
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:21,308
Keep your distance.

10
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:22,779
No personal matters.

11
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:23,333
Achi.

12
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:24,287
Do you want to get ice cream after the meal?

13
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:25,460
Let’s go eat Yakiniku.

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,720
(I make mistakes so easily.)

15
00:00:29,337 --> 00:00:30,334
(Is he a psycho?)

16
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:32,062
So I really can read minds?

17
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:33,582
No!

18
00:00:33,594 --> 00:00:36,108
I’m ordering number 2 and number 4 to kiss.

19
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:37,179
Let’s think that this is just a game.

20
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,303
(Please excuse me.)

21
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:41,580
Actually, it’s not that I don’t like kissing you.

22
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:43,182
You realize what that means, right?

23
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:48,656
Are you sure about what you said?

24
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,257
Yeah.

25
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:02,905
(Will Achi really let me do it?)

26
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:04,497
(Am I dreaming?)

27
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,908
(What?)

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,223
Everyone, follow me.

29
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,508
That’s Achi and Karan.

30
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:32,700
Are you getting some air too?

31
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:33,536
Yes.

32
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:34,762
We’re just about to go down.

33
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:36,805
Don’t go yet.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,914
Stay with us.

35
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:38,389
Right?

36
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:38,908
Yes.

37
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:40,715
Yeah. Don’t go back so fast.

38
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,928
It’s very hot inside.

39
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,641
- The view is great up here.
- Yes.

40
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:46,760
Let’s take a selfie.

41
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,143
Let’s take a selfie.

42
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:51,586
Take a selfie.

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,623
Whose phone are we using?

44
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:57,792
Whose phone has a good camera?

45
00:01:57,807 --> 00:01:58,820
Mine.

46
00:01:58,927 --> 00:01:59,848
Yeah?

47
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:01,795
Alright.

48
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,856
Come.

49
00:02:05,848 --> 00:02:09,721
(If everyone hadn’t come up, what would’ve happened between Achi and I?)

50
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:14,906
(Is Achi already giving me a chance?)

51
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:16,937
(I need to hurry up and make a move.)

52
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:18,880
(Eh?)

53
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,490
[Jinta]

54
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:43,705
What’s up, buddy?

55
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:45,705
Achi, I’m in trouble.

56
00:03:45,722 --> 00:03:47,650
Right now, it seems like….

57
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:48,699
Ugh!

58
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:49,998
Hold on.

59
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,906
Calm down.

60
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,807
Speak slowly.

61
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,105
What’s going on?

62
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:57,245
It seems like I now have the same magical power you mentioned.

63
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:58,109
What?

64
00:03:58,124 --> 00:03:58,899
You too?

65
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:00,665
What I want to know is

66
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,013
how do I live my life from now on?

67
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:06,302
If the readers or the editors think that my works suck,

68
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,911
I’ll be too scared to write for the rest of my life.

69
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:10,309
My future will be doomed

70
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:11,600
and I will starve to death.

71
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:12,751
Do you hear me, Achi?

72
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:14,208
Calm down.

73
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,508
No one is starving to death right now.

74
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:18,300
The thing is…

75
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,900
It’s really hard.

76
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,263
Can you come over and stay with me tomorrow?

77
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:27,906
I’ll lose my mind if you don’t.

78
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:32,106
I can’t.

79
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:35,777
I’ll be out of town on a company outing tomorrow.

80
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,537
No!

81
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:41,712
How about you keep to your room for now?

82
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:44,109
Try to avoid seeing people as much as you can.

83
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:47,309
Wait till I get back, okay?

84
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,020
If I don’t touch anyone, I’ll still be fine, right?

85
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:51,700
Yes.

86
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,407
Don’t touch anyone yet.

87
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,297
Wait till I’m back.

88
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:57,696
Okay.

89
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:16,217
Hey, Pai.

90
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:18,210
Thank you.

91
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,294
Oh, I’m sorry.

92
00:05:26,503 --> 00:05:27,493
I’m sorry.

93
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:31,352
(If we run into each other, I’ll be screwed.)

94
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:35,662
(There are plenty of resorts. Why do we have to go to the same place?)

95
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:38,115
Sorry.

96
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:40,339
I’ll carry this on the bus.

97
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:42,508
Okay.

98
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:57,703
(Problem solved.)

99
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,099
(Now I don’t have to go anywhere or see anyone.)

100
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:13,268
Karan.

101
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:15,463
Do you want to sit with me?

102
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,706
This seat is available.

103
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:19,517
I think I better sit in the front

104
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:22,105
so I can help give out snacks.

105
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:24,296
What a good guy you are.

106
00:06:24,306 --> 00:06:25,404
That’s lovely.

107
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,788
Achi, can I sit with you?

108
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:40,912
Sure.

109
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:42,103
Thank you.

110
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:45,807
When did you arrive?

111
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:47,373
A while ago.

112
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,102
I’ve never been on a company outing.

113
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:50,946
What’s it like?

114
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,205
Have you ever been to where we’re going?

115
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:52,734
Yes.

116
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:54,506
We go there every year.

117
00:06:54,677 --> 00:06:56,084
There’s an onsen there, right?

118
00:06:56,103 --> 00:06:57,062
Have you ever tried it?

119
00:06:57,303 --> 00:06:59,817
It’s not really my thing.

120
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:01,940
We have to be naked, right?

121
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,311
Rock.

122
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:14,598
Here.

123
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:16,400
Thank you.

124
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:21,579
Thank you.

125
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:29,419
Achi.

126
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,008
Thank you.

127
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,103
Karan.

128
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:45,220
Why is Achi’s drink different from the others?

129
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:48,096
I just picked randomly.

130
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:53,580
By the way, Rock,

131
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:56,201
Pai wants to discuss some work with you.

132
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:57,865
Shall we swap seats?

133
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,562
But my stuff…

134
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:00,057
It’s okay.

135
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:01,137
I’ll help you move it.

136
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,291
(Luckily, I bought it for Achi in advance.)

137
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:24,420
(It will keep him refreshed the whole journey.)

138
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:26,131
(And finally, I got to sit next to him.)

139
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:27,370
(This trip is worth it already.)

140
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:32,300
(I hope it rains, there’s a traffic jam, a fallen tree blocking the road, or whatever.)

141
00:08:32,315 --> 00:08:34,207
(Just let me sit here for a long time.)

142
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:49,057
Where are we now?

143
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,105
(Achi dressed so cute.)

144
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,417
(Ever since that night, I haven’t got a chance to be near him again.)

145
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:58,908
(Did he get cuter?)

146
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:02,422
(Of course, he got cuter.)

147
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:08,422
(You really can’t tell what another person is thinking by just what you see.)

148
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:12,312
(Will I get a heart attack before arriving at the resort?)

149
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:20,222
(How can someone’s imagination go so wild while acting so calm?)

150
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,257
Isn’t that pretty?

151
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,306
As soon as we got off the bus, it felt like we’re in Japan.

152
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,601
This is to make Mr. Tanaka happy.

153
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:41,740
Hopefully, it helps him miss home a little less.

154
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:44,866
Everyone, please listen here.

155
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:47,099
Two people will share a room.

156
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:50,798
Please send a representative to get the key

157
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:52,819
then you can put your stuff in your room.

158
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:56,856
See you in the convention room in half an hour, okay?

159
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,142
Okay.

160
00:09:58,152 --> 00:09:59,339
Pair up.

161
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:19,114
Rock, do you want to be my roommate?

162
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:19,983
Sure.

163
00:10:20,635 --> 00:10:22,662
But I snore.

164
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,299
That’s totally fine.

165
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:26,202
Then let’s share a room.

166
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:27,339
Okay.

167
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:30,404
Karan, do you want to share a room with me?

168
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:32,804
Uh…

169
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:34,709
Yes.

170
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:44,460
Look.

171
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,659
Mr. Karan looks so neat even in his casual outfit.

172
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,816
I’m so jealous of his future partner.

173
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,183
I think the reason he’s still single

174
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:57,019
is because he still hasn’t found someone good enough.

175
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:00,979
(If I couldn’t read minds, I’d think so too.)

176
00:11:01,817 --> 00:11:05,660
(What made a guy like Karan fall for me?)

177
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:08,404
Everyone!

178
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:10,404
We’re about to start our activities.

179
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:14,783
Today, please forget all about your roles and responsibilities

180
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:17,011
and let’s have the best time together.

181
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:18,299
Is that okay?

182
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,650
Make some noise if you’re ready.

183
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,462
Let’s go!

184
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:38,700
Is everyone ready?

185
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,930
Yes!

186
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,604
One.

187
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:41,610
Two.

188
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,318
Three!

189
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,831
Everyone, let’s do this together in one, two.

190
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:49,857
One, two!

191
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:50,862
One, two!

192
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,189
The blue team won.

193
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:12,740
You’re amazing, Karan.

194
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:26,345
(Wow. He won every game. Isn’t he too talented?)

195
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:29,004
We’ve come to the last game of the day.

196
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,706
Everyone will pair up

197
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:33,792
but you can only pair with someone from a different department

198
00:12:33,807 --> 00:12:35,158
so you can get to know each other better.

199
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,401
Sounds good?

200
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:38,991
Here are the rules.

201
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:43,060
You’ll take turns telling your partner your story

202
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,314
and come up here to present it.

203
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,808
We’ll see who’s the best at presenting their partner.

204
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:54,111
I’m telling you, the winner will get a huge prize.

205
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:57,454
Are you ready?

206
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:58,120
Ready?

207
00:12:58,165 --> 00:12:59,343
Yes.

208
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,714
If you’re ready,

209
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:02,259
pair up!

210
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:05,407
Find someone from a different department.

211
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:10,900
(Everyone would want to pair with someone cool in this game.)

212
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:13,106
(It’d probably make it easier to win.)

213
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:22,777
(Who would want to pair with someone like me?)

214
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,813
(Here you are.)

215
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:30,540
Do you want to pair with me?

216
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:38,783
You can go first, Achi.

217
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:43,580
I graduated in management.

218
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,208
Then I applied for a job here.

219
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:48,904
I’ve been working in the same position since.

220
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:53,804
And I’m 30 years old now.

221
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,110
That’s all.

222
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:04,609
What do you like most while working here?

223
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:06,609
Well…

224
00:14:08,387 --> 00:14:10,712
I like when I fix up things

225
00:14:11,913 --> 00:14:15,710
and replace broken stuff before people come to work

226
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,704
such as the low battery that causes a mouse to stop working.

227
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,984
Seeing everyone arrive and be able to start working right away

228
00:14:22,258 --> 00:14:24,384
without having to waste their time with odds and ends

229
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:28,310
makes me feel glad I can be of help.

230
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:33,485
Your turn now.

231
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,713
That’s all from me.

232
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:37,580
Well…

233
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:43,414
Actually, I’m not interested in anything specific or particularly good at anything.

234
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,983
I just do whatever I can.

235
00:14:46,044 --> 00:14:49,580
When I was a kid, I learned to play Go to kill my boredom

236
00:14:49,952 --> 00:14:51,981
but I was invited to join a national competition.

237
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:53,620
When I took up a sport instead,

238
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:56,504
I was asked to compete and become a professional athlete,

239
00:14:56,906 --> 00:15:00,386
but I wasn’t that into it, so I didn’t pursue it.

240
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:03,006
I ended up reading mangas

241
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:07,812
and posting my analyses on social media.

242
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:09,983
Then they were later published in magazines.

243
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:15,983
I don’t know why everything I do for fun always becomes serious.

244
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,998
(Even though he says he’s not good at anything,)

245
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:24,938
(he can probably do them better than I can do what I’m best at.)

246
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:30,017
And that’s Mr. Tanaka’s story.

247
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:35,218
This is Rock.

248
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:41,507
The next person will be the last.

249
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:43,411
He’s the one you all have been waiting for.

250
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:45,669
Please give it up for Karan.

251
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:01,146
Hi, everyone.

252
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,704
I’m Karan.

253
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:07,501
Today, I’m going to tell you about Achi.

254
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:33,020
(What I told Karan is nothing special,)

255
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:41,889
(but somehow, he can make someone like me who has nothing special look that good.)

256
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:45,512
Please give Achi a round of applause

257
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:48,344
as a thank you from all of our hearts.

258
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,904
Thank you, Achi.

259
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:02,221
I had no idea your responsibilities were that important.

260
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:05,510
Thank you.

261
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:13,346
(Karan looks more like someone with magical power compared to me.)

262
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:18,106
Amazing.

263
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:20,009
You’re really amazing, Achi.

264
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,214
Thank you so much.

265
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:24,384
Let’s take an onsen bath to relax.

266
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:31,518
Wow.

267
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:34,461
Where do you find the time to take care of yourself?

268
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:35,778
You have such a great body.

269
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:40,106
(My body looks like tofu.)

270
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:42,506
(I hope no one comments on it.)

271
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:52,546
(I better hide.)

272
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,011
(I’m lifting my feet.)

273
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:06,718
(I’m walking forward.)

274
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,503
(I’m stepping my feet down.)

275
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:11,614
(I can’t look.)

276
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,408
(I have to close my eyes.)

277
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:15,208
(I can do it.)

278
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:32,205
Should we ask Achi to help?

279
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:34,066
Oh, there he is.

280
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:36,107
Me?

281
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,758
Don’t bother him.

282
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:38,589
It’s okay.

283
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:39,906
What’s going on?

284
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:42,404
Well,

285
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:46,186
Pai’s ex is staying here too.

286
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:48,584
He probably saw Pai’s Instagram stories

287
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,086
so he tagged and asked her to have a meal with him.

288
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,310
That’s why she’s upset.

289
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:56,507
His new girlfriend is so pretty

290
00:18:57,051 --> 00:19:00,510
and I think the ring on her finger is her engagement ring.

291
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:04,301
Meanwhile, I’m not even in a talking stage with anyone.

292
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,864
If he asks how I am, I won’t know how to answer without embarrassing myself.

293
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:13,596
That’s exactly why we need Achi to pretend to be your boyfriend.

294
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:14,312
What do you say?

295
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:20,411
Would having me as a boyfriend make people jealous?

296
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,743
Of course, it would,

297
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:28,820
but I actually don’t want to trouble anyone.

298
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:33,707
I already said yes and I don’t want to go back on my word,

299
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:40,343
so I’ll try to brave up and go alone.

300
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:42,063
It won’t be so bad.

301
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:02,115
Did I run out of gas?

302
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:07,809
When did this thing break?

303
00:20:10,658 --> 00:20:13,411
Madam Noi, when did you bite the power cord?

304
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:14,386
Huh?

305
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:18,112
Why won’t you help me?

306
00:20:18,604 --> 00:20:19,774
(So what?)

307
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:20,534
(Huh?)

308
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:24,913
Whoa, you’re talking back in your head?

309
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:26,703
Don’t think I can’t hear you.

310
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,912
I guess I have no choice but to order food.

311
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:47,011
Please leave it outside.

312
00:20:47,356 --> 00:20:49,107
You chose to pay cash on delivery.

313
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:54,913
Damn it!

314
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:11,409
Hey, watch out!

315
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:14,423
Are you okay?

316
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:19,303
(Is something wrong with him? Should I leave him alone?)

317
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:23,664
(He’ll have a hard time taking care of himself while he’s sick.)

318
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:27,005
(But how can I talk to him without sounding weird?)

319
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,313
Here.

320
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,980
Keep the change.

321
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:50,901
Excuse me.

322
00:21:55,832 --> 00:21:57,500
Can I come in and see your cat?

323
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:00,925
My cat?

324
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:05,461
Okay.

325
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:12,863
What’s your name?

326
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,703
Jinta.

327
00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:16,507
Hello, Jinta.

328
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,024
Oh, he meant the cat’s name?

329
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:22,286
The cat is called Madam Noi.

330
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:24,817
Madam Noi?

331
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:27,509
I picked her up from a crate with the name Madam Noi on it.

332
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:29,221
So I call her that.

333
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:32,109
The crate with Madam Noi’s name?

334
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:36,140
It’s in the alley next to the market, right?

335
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:37,205
Yes.

336
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:38,774
How do you know that?

337
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:41,398
It’s really you.

338
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:46,110
I gave her the crate.

339
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:50,109
I’ve been feeding and playing with her since she was a kitten.

340
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:53,309
One day, she disappeared.

341
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:56,109
I thought I’d never see you again.

342
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,221
He’s taking care of you pretty well, huh?

343
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:11,820
You’re so lucky, you know?

344
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,109
I must get back to work.

345
00:23:24,629 --> 00:23:25,583
You’re okay now, right?

346
00:23:26,897 --> 00:23:27,709
I’m okay.

347
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:29,651
I was a bit hungry

348
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:30,944
so when I got up too fast, I felt dizzy.

349
00:23:41,518 --> 00:23:45,609
(He seemed weird at first, but he’s actually kinder than I thought.)

350
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,312
(He takes care of the cat very well.)

351
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,409
(His room is also clean.)

352
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,310
(He’s a pretty okay guy.)

353
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:55,004
(Pretty okay? What does that mean?)

354
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:56,343
(What does he mean?)

355
00:23:58,421 --> 00:23:59,409
I have to go.

356
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:19,943
Damn it, Achi!

357
00:24:20,304 --> 00:24:21,943
Hurry back already!

358
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:30,347
Cheers.

359
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:38,833
Achi, drink it a little.

360
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:40,141
Please drink it.

361
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:42,117
Please. I’ll take care of you.

362
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:42,794
Come on.

363
00:24:42,821 --> 00:24:44,096
Drink a bit. Please.

364
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,034
Rock.

365
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:47,083
Can you please fill me a cup?

366
00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:49,745
I’d be very honored.

367
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:56,125
Drink with Karan, Achi.

368
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:56,825
Drink it a little.

369
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,542
Rock.

370
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:00,631
Give it to Mr. Tanaka too.

371
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:27,262
Where are you going, Pai?

372
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:30,439
I need to buy some personal items.

373
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,862
I just realized I forgot to bring them.

374
00:25:33,013 --> 00:25:34,065
But it’s late now.

375
00:25:34,556 --> 00:25:35,545
It’s dangerous.

376
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,225
Someone should go with you.

377
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:41,947
Achi, can you go with Pai?

378
00:25:41,963 --> 00:25:43,566
You’re the least drunk here.

379
00:25:44,116 --> 00:25:44,653
Sure.

380
00:25:44,664 --> 00:25:45,941
Go.

381
00:25:54,326 --> 00:25:55,246
Come on, Boss.

382
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:06,785
Are you feeling better about what you were stressed about earlier?

383
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:08,422
Sorry?

384
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,645
Oh, you mean about my ex?

385
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:16,932
I already said no to him.

386
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,046
I don’t know why I have to go and make myself feel bad.

387
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:25,984
Even if I had you pretend to be my boyfriend,

388
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:29,130
I’d still know in my heart that I haven’t found someone new.

389
00:26:30,445 --> 00:26:31,464
I’d still lose.

390
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:35,027
But you seem to have been happy.

391
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,664
What?

392
00:26:37,914 --> 00:26:39,529
I’m sorry.

393
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:42,834
I didn’t mean to judge quickly.

394
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:45,584
No, Achi.

395
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:47,526
You’re right.

396
00:26:48,944 --> 00:26:52,467
I actually have been happy.

397
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:56,024
I didn’t think anyone would notice.

398
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,642
Of course, I did.

399
00:26:58,954 --> 00:27:00,507
I see that you can be happy by yourself

400
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:03,634
without having to wait for anyone to make you happy.

401
00:27:03,711 --> 00:27:05,582
That’s exactly right.

402
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:10,181
Then that’s not losing, is it?

403
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:13,430
Thank you.

404
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:15,025
I feel so much better.

405
00:27:17,562 --> 00:27:20,030
What are you looking at, beautiful?

406
00:27:20,268 --> 00:27:21,427
She really is beautiful.

407
00:27:21,828 --> 00:27:23,624
What a shame she’s with her man.

408
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:27,765
She’s so beautiful. I don’t mind if she already has a man.

409
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:28,584
Disgusting.

410
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,729
Hey, wait!

411
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,261
Who are you calling disgusting?

412
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,468
Watch your mouth.

413
00:27:37,394 --> 00:27:38,861
Please calm down.

414
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:40,833
We’re just passing by.

415
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:42,498
We don’t want to fight.

416
00:27:42,514 --> 00:27:44,885
Are you saying we want to fight?

417
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:46,788
She insulted us first.

418
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:47,979
Stop right now.

419
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:50,024
If you don’t, I’ll call the cops on you.

420
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,430
On what charge?

421
00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:52,645
We haven’t done anything.

422
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:54,302
They could charge you for a false report.

423
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:55,499
I have an idea.

424
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,732
Why don’t you create some evidence for her to report to the police?

425
00:27:59,332 --> 00:28:00,530
Good idea.

426
00:28:01,735 --> 00:28:02,530
Don’t.

427
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:03,476
Stay out of my business!

428
00:28:04,402 --> 00:28:05,326
Achi!

429
00:28:06,555 --> 00:28:07,218
Come here.

430
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,258
You want a piece of me?

431
00:28:12,283 --> 00:28:13,830
(Don’t touch Achi.)

432
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:21,253
I think we should talk it out nicely.

433
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,471
Let’s not use violence and hurt ourselves.

434
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:28,618
You want to stick your nose in, huh?

435
00:28:28,628 --> 00:28:29,538
You got it.

436
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:36,545
Don’t.

437
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:37,744
Let’s go.

438
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,224
Are you alright, Achi?

439
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:46,042
I’m fine.

440
00:28:48,116 --> 00:28:51,024
(If anything happened to Achi, I would never forgive myself.)

441
00:28:51,673 --> 00:28:54,231
(Is he hurt anywhere? Is he still shocked?)

442
00:28:55,615 --> 00:28:56,382
Are you okay?

443
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:58,634
I’m okay.

444
00:28:59,713 --> 00:29:00,665
What about you, Pai?

445
00:29:01,482 --> 00:29:03,037
I’m okay. I’m not hurt.

446
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:04,533
Are you okay, Achi?

447
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,144
What about you, Karan?

448
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:09,013
How are you feeling?

449
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:09,833
I’m fine.

450
00:29:11,742 --> 00:29:15,828
(I should be feeling grateful, but I’m feeling jealous)

451
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:20,027
(that it’s so easy for Karan to do everything I can never do.)

452
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:26,585
(The more I’m around Karan, I find his heart is full of good feelings.)

453
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:33,034
(But every time we’re near each other, I keep feeling smaller.)

454
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:35,210
Ouch!

455
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:37,727
Are you alright, Achi?

456
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:39,864
I’m fine.

457
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:41,067
Let me see.

458
00:29:42,139 --> 00:29:42,833
Hey.

459
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:44,127
You’re not fine.

460
00:29:45,065 --> 00:29:46,431
Let’s go dress your wound.

461
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:51,732
Let’s clean your wound a bit.

462
00:30:01,578 --> 00:30:03,532
(I accidentally inserted myself in Achi’s business again,)

463
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:07,984
(even though I intended to like him from afar in my own place.)

464
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:11,862
(I don’t want Achi to feel uncomfortable, but I can’t help myself.)

465
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:18,532
(Luckily, the fight didn’t escalate earlier.)

466
00:30:19,012 --> 00:30:20,582
(I wouldn’t know how to beat them.)

467
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:25,227
(My hands are still shaking. Will Achi notice?)

468
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:29,945
(I’m not cool at all.)

469
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,239
Okay.

470
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:39,222
Last step.

471
00:30:44,402 --> 00:30:47,188
(Om. May his wound heal quickly.)

472
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:55,631
It should be okay now.

473
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:05,984
Thank you so much.

474
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:11,065
Without you, I’d be in trouble.

475
00:31:11,547 --> 00:31:15,867
Thank you for that presentation too.

476
00:31:17,274 --> 00:31:19,670
You’re so good with words and made me look so good.

477
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,527
I just talked about who you really are.

478
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:25,326
I didn’t do anything.

479
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:29,148
Still, I want to thank you.

480
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,933
Karan.

481
00:31:56,747 --> 00:31:57,689
Come and sing.

482
00:31:57,695 --> 00:31:59,030
The girls want to hear your voice.

483
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:00,126
Okay.

484
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:09,203
Show us your singing.

485
00:32:09,335 --> 00:32:10,668
Give me a second to choose the song.

486
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,530
It’s Bird Thongchai’s song.

487
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:21,184
Prepare your ears to be impressed.

488
00:32:22,184 --> 00:32:26,729
♪ When we meet eyes, it’s like we know ♪

489
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:31,246
♪ You’re in my sight but still seem so far ♪

490
00:32:31,274 --> 00:32:36,105
♪ Say you love me when we’re together ♪

491
00:32:36,117 --> 00:32:40,587
♪ With only a whisper from your heart ♪

492
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:43,842
I’ve never met a better singer than you.

493
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:45,135
You’re too kind.

494
00:32:46,553 --> 00:32:49,831
(I guess even Karan has something he can’t do.)

495
00:32:58,077 --> 00:32:59,639
Ooh, bacon!

496
00:33:04,922 --> 00:33:06,234
It smells so good.

497
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:07,736
Pai.

498
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:09,553
It’s been so long.

499
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,067
She’s my ex.

500
00:33:12,473 --> 00:33:13,451
Oh.

501
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:14,738
Do you want to join us?

502
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:17,551
Our table is just nearby.

503
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:18,744
Come.

504
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:27,036
Did you get fatter, Pai?

505
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,111
Are you neglecting your body again?

506
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,030
I’m telling you, as you get older,

507
00:33:31,246 --> 00:33:33,428
your metabolism won’t be as good as it was before.

508
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,750
Right.

509
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,396
And you still work at the same place?

510
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,516
You need to keep working with different bosses in order to grow.

511
00:33:41,531 --> 00:33:45,182
Also, I don’t think the position you’ve had for a long time will get you anywhere.

512
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:47,750
When we broke up, I was still worried about you.

513
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,040
You must still be single.

514
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:51,830
I haven’t seen you post any couple photos or anything about a boyfriend.

515
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,637
When you turn 30, it’ll be hard to find a man.

516
00:33:55,691 --> 00:33:58,418
Maybe she has a boyfriend but doesn’t want to post any photos with him.

517
00:33:58,428 --> 00:33:59,433
That’s even more dangerous

518
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:02,302
because you don’t know if he’s also dating someone else or already married.

519
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:04,236
I can’t take this anymore.

520
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:06,034
I’m going to walk there and tell him I’m Pai’s boyfriend.

521
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:09,110
And I’m going to say I’m actually the president of the company.

522
00:34:09,243 --> 00:34:11,968
I didn’t tell anyone because I didn’t want them to think I used connections to get in.

523
00:34:18,768 --> 00:34:20,139
I don’t have a boyfriend yet.

524
00:34:21,265 --> 00:34:25,390
When I want to have one, I want to choose carefully.

525
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:29,231
I don’t want someone who loves making others feel uncomfortable

526
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:31,831
or saying things that make others feel bad.

527
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,831
Do you want some bacon?

528
00:34:33,845 --> 00:34:34,836
I can share it with you.

529
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,738
No, thank you.

530
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:43,034
If you eat it, you’ll be scolded, right?

531
00:34:44,695 --> 00:34:45,397
Never mind.

532
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:46,642
I’ll eat it myself.

533
00:34:49,704 --> 00:34:50,833
This is so yummy.

534
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:52,382
By the way,

535
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:54,933
you said I got fatter after I broke up with you, right?

536
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:58,153
That is true.

537
00:34:58,502 --> 00:34:59,311
But you know why?

538
00:35:00,116 --> 00:35:02,750
It’s because I can now eat whatever I want.

539
00:35:02,877 --> 00:35:04,424
I can wear saggy T-shirts.

540
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:05,971
I can lie down and watch boys love series on the weekends.

541
00:35:05,985 --> 00:35:07,867
I can finish jumbo french fries by myself.

542
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:12,037
Most importantly, hugging a chicken bucket makes me happier than hugging you.

543
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:15,867
So don’t you worry about me

544
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,618
even though I’m almost 30,

545
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:18,834
single, and fat

546
00:35:18,845 --> 00:35:21,548
because I’m happier than when I was with you.

547
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:23,270
Okay?

548
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,268
Pai.

549
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,733
You’re amazing.

550
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:31,939
Way to go.

551
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,510
I salute you.

552
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,396
No need.

553
00:35:35,665 --> 00:35:38,138
I’m so proud of you, Pai.

554
00:35:43,412 --> 00:35:45,508
I honestly don’t feel bad about myself.

555
00:35:45,732 --> 00:35:46,931
All this time,

556
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:49,111
I’ve always known what my happiness is.

557
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:52,711
Thank you everyone.

558
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:58,673
Many of you here make me realize there are still people who love me for who I am.

559
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:03,766
It gives me the strength to fight for my happiness.

560
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:07,539
And of course, my happiness is

561
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:08,701
bacon.

562
00:36:08,939 --> 00:36:10,187
All hail bacon!

563
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:11,892
Bacon!

564
00:36:12,058 --> 00:36:12,827
Bacon!

565
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:13,739
Bacon!

566
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:14,619
Bacon!

567
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,203
Bacon! Bacon! Bacon!

568
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:18,569
Let’s eat.

569
00:36:18,581 --> 00:36:19,630
Eat. Eat.

570
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:30,045
(Having someone who loves you for who you are gives you the strength to keep fighting for your happiness?)

571
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:31,310
It’s so good.

572
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,436
There’s still some left.

573
00:36:43,562 --> 00:36:46,431
At least I can be around you, Madam Noi.

574
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:47,344
Are you hot now?

575
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:48,390
Come on.

576
00:36:48,548 --> 00:36:49,110
Here.

577
00:36:49,147 --> 00:36:49,837
Come here.

578
00:36:50,323 --> 00:36:50,968
Madam Noi

579
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:51,643
Come here.

580
00:36:51,651 --> 00:36:52,296
Get in.

581
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,634
Hey.

582
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,191
What are you doing up here?

583
00:37:10,553 --> 00:37:11,188
What?

584
00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:13,339
You’re having lunch at 3 p.m.?

585
00:37:14,655 --> 00:37:15,668
Breakfast.

586
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,034
Why are you only eating now?

587
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,228
I’ve been busy with work all day.

588
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:21,332
Most were food delivery orders.

589
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:24,848
The customers were probably hungry, so I had to deliver their food fast.

590
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:25,910
I didn’t want them to wait long.

591
00:37:26,085 --> 00:37:27,833
You’re so busy delivering food to others.

592
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:30,068
Why don’t you send some to your stomach for a change?

593
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,436
(He cares about others more than himself.)

594
00:37:37,077 --> 00:37:40,043
(He’s kinder than I thought.)

595
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:47,628
What’s up?

596
00:37:58,628 --> 00:37:59,910
Will that make you full?

597
00:38:07,504 --> 00:38:08,147
Here.

598
00:38:08,557 --> 00:38:09,508
Eat this.

599
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:12,091
Whoa, you removed all the seeds?

600
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:13,535
You prepared it so carefully.

601
00:38:13,781 --> 00:38:14,868
You should keep it for yourself.

602
00:38:15,784 --> 00:38:17,305
I didn’t want Madam Noi to choke on it

603
00:38:17,313 --> 00:38:18,868
but she’s full now.

604
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:21,234
The watermelon is for the cat?

605
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,139
Just take it.

606
00:38:23,156 --> 00:38:26,634
There are no separate varieties for humans and cats to eat.

607
00:38:28,135 --> 00:38:29,271
Take it.

608
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:31,339
At least it’s more refreshing than eating only carbs.

609
00:38:39,213 --> 00:38:39,936
Here.

610
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,533
I don’t think that’ll make you full.

611
00:38:42,408 --> 00:38:43,148
Thank you.

612
00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:59,113
(Wow. He’s kinder than I thought.)

613
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:00,842
(This uncle is actually kinda cute.)

614
00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:05,111
Thank you.

615
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:07,308
I have to go, 61 bro.

616
00:39:08,402 --> 00:39:09,135
Okay.

617
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:11,520
Bye, Madam Noi.

618
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:22,738
Madam Noi, did you hear that?

619
00:39:23,451 --> 00:39:26,061
(I’m not full yet, hooman.)

620
00:39:37,162 --> 00:39:37,948
I’ll help.

621
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:41,947
You can get on the bus, Pai.

622
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:03,028
(Karan might be worried about making me uncomfortable.)

623
00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:06,351
(Am I uncomfortable?)

624
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:19,031
(Sometimes I feel like a loser when I look at Karan)

625
00:40:21,135 --> 00:40:23,738
(but he never intends to make me feel bad.)

626
00:40:26,913 --> 00:40:29,593
(Sometimes I even feel relieved)

627
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:32,336
(that in a world where I seem to fade into the background,)

628
00:40:38,778 --> 00:40:39,867
Do you want to pair with me?

629
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:44,988
(Karan always sees me.)

630
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:54,548
Today, I’m going to tell you about Achi.

631
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:03,499
For all the time I’ve been working here,

632
00:41:03,513 --> 00:41:06,710
I believe many of you will agree with me

633
00:41:07,483 --> 00:41:09,648
that the free coffee is good quality.

634
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,908
The free cookies taste so yummy.

635
00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:18,240
You may wonder what brand is the photocopier

636
00:41:18,888 --> 00:41:20,640
because it has never broken down or run out of ink

637
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,508
or wonder if you’re using magic pens because they never run out of inks either.

638
00:41:26,307 --> 00:41:30,744
All of us are so used to these things that we think they just happen.

639
00:41:32,412 --> 00:41:34,845
But all these little conveniences,

640
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:37,240
the magic of the pens,

641
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:38,434
the staples,

642
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:39,731
the printers,

643
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,550
the delicious coffee,

644
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,637
or the snacks you eat every day,

645
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,834
there’s always someone behind all of them

646
00:41:49,387 --> 00:41:53,236
and we’ve never wondered who that is, right?

647
00:41:54,459 --> 00:41:57,511
The one who takes care of us in silence

648
00:41:57,877 --> 00:42:00,625
and makes it possible for us to do our best work every day

649
00:42:00,787 --> 00:42:03,028
without having to worry about odds and ends.

650
00:42:04,436 --> 00:42:08,068
The one who contributes to the smooth operation of every team every day.

651
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,667
Please give Achi a round of applause

652
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,436
as a thank you from all of our hearts.

653
00:42:25,658 --> 00:42:29,046
(Actually, I couldn’t help feeling good at the time)

654
00:42:29,553 --> 00:42:31,313
(because the things that everyone thanked me for)

655
00:42:34,664 --> 00:42:36,338
(were the things I really did.)

656
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:43,633
(So that’s who I am in Karan’s eyes.)

657
00:42:47,136 --> 00:42:48,240
Karan.

658
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:50,514
You can sit here.

659
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:06,339
Achi.

660
00:43:06,728 --> 00:43:07,335
Hmm?

661
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:08,474
How’s your wound?

662
00:43:08,895 --> 00:43:09,670
Oh.

663
00:43:10,052 --> 00:43:10,862
It’s better now.

664
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,036
Good job.

665
00:43:17,154 --> 00:43:18,138
(Good job on what?)

666
00:43:24,796 --> 00:43:25,437
Oh.

667
00:43:26,345 --> 00:43:27,348
That’s…

668
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:29,348
Oh, yes.

669
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:30,947
Thanks for this.

670
00:43:31,123 --> 00:43:32,833
It helps me sleep much more comfortably.

671
00:43:33,885 --> 00:43:34,831
You’re welcome.

672
00:43:42,938 --> 00:43:47,125

What?

680
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:24,114
Huh?

681
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,133
Nothing happened.

682
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:32,348
Oh, I must have had a bad dream.

683
00:44:42,988 --> 00:44:45,445
(I wish I could protect Achi in his dreams too.)

684
00:44:46,923 --> 00:44:47,956
(That’d be good.)

685
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:56,347
(Apart from Karan’s singing, it’s his crazy thoughts that keep him from being annoyingly perfect.)

686
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:58,477

I’ll have Achi help you work.

694
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,052
During a festival like this,

695
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,193
if it’s inconvenient for you, I can pick you up.

696
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:29,658
But it’s far.

697
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:30,385
I don’t want to trouble you.

698
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:31,107
Getting here was so easy.

699
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:32,430
Leave it on

700
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,079
to reduce your fever.

701
00:45:33,102 --> 00:45:37,119
(I never thought working on a holiday would make me so happy.)

702
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:38,378
(So cute.)

703
00:45:38,388 --> 00:45:40,013
(Achi is melting my heart again.)

704
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:40,493
What?

705
00:45:41,282 --> 00:45:41,763
Yes?

706
00:45:41,871 --> 00:45:43,067
(Not only am I lucky in my career,)

707
00:45:43,085 --> 00:45:45,067
(but a cute girl like Pai also has a crush on me.)

708
00:45:45,074 --> 00:45:46,781
(This is clearly my golden age.)

709
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:56,781
[Sometimes I even feel relieved
that in a world where I seem to fade into the background,
he always sees me.]
