Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:18,099
(Don’t touch Achi.)

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,210
(If anything happened to Achi, I would never forgive myself.)

7
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:22,502
Thank you so much.

8
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:29,173
(This uncle is actually kinda cute.)

9
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:30,302
Pai.

10
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:30,890
You’re amazing.

11
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:32,370
All this time,

12
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:34,407
I’ve always known what my happiness is.

13
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:36,605
Karan.

14
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:38,500
You can sit here.

15
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:42,405
(I wish I could protect Achi in his dreams too.)

16
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:53,143
Let me help you, 61 bro.

17
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,539
Who even is called 61?

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,708
I told you my name is Jinta.

19
00:00:57,955 --> 00:00:58,906
I see.

20
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:02,505
Do you want me to call you Jin or Ta?

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,336
My name is Jinta, so call me Jinta, kid.

22
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,103
This hat must be a free item from the store.

23
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:16,242
You can have Madam Noi wear it.

24
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,407
Hold on.

25
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:25,308
(Jinta smells good.)

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,385
(He smells just like the scented water my grandpa uses.)

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,201
(But the scent smells so charming on his body.)

28
00:01:31,706 --> 00:01:32,743
(Charming?)

29
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:35,142
(No one has ever complimented me like that.)

30
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:38,794
(Why is my heart beating so fast?)

31
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,309
(He smells good like my grandpa.)

32
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:41,400
(I love this.)

33
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,140
By the way, my name is not ‘kid’.

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,605
My name is Min.

35
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:52,202
Oh, Min.

36
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:55,908
(He has a cute smile and a cute name.)

37
00:01:56,632 --> 00:01:57,505
I’m gonna go now.

38
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:05,703
Oh, no.

39
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:08,742
What was I feeling just now?

40
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:13,128
Stop smiling already, Jinta.

41
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,708
I said, stop smiling.

42
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:16,708
Stop smiling.

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,810
[Invoice must be submitted before the long holiday from April 13-15.]

44
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:35,909
Poor Achi.

45
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:40,014
Even the photocopier is not kind to you.

46
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:40,829
I know.

47
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,545
Come here.

48
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:42,505
Out.

49
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,906
If it’s not kind to you, you don’t need to be kind to it.

50
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:58,105
Here you go.

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,360
There’s one more paper.

52
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:00,980
One more?

53
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,096
Yes.

54
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,339
Here.

55
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:17,760
Thank you, Duj.

56
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:18,502
You’re welcome.

57
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,651
Where are you going for the long holiday?

58
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:22,911
Are you going back to Lamphun?

59
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:24,617
Not this year.

60
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:27,205
My parents are going on a trip to Chiang Khan.

61
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,106
What about you?

62
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,613
I’m going to the beach.

63
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:34,448
Well, well, well.

64
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:36,217
Who are you going with?

65
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:40,177
I’m going with someone I’m in a talking stage with.

66
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:44,420
You’re in a talking stage on the way there

67
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,632
but what about on the way back?

68
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:47,377
I can’t help it.

69
00:03:47,386 --> 00:03:50,542
My beauty is too hard to resist.

70
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,216
Look at you all.

71
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:57,410
You’re so happy with the long holiday coming up.

72
00:03:58,934 --> 00:03:59,905
Wait, Pai.

73
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:04,377
Here’s your happiness.

74
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:05,905
I bought some for you.

75
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:07,376
Get chubby.

76
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,004
Hold on.

77
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:09,804
What’s this?

78
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:11,780
Why did you buy her that? What does it mean?

79
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:19,579
After coming up back from the outing,

80
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:24,605
I haven’t had a chance to tell you this directly.

81
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:26,703
What is it?

82
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:31,459
I find a woman like you

83
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:38,708
so brave,

84
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:39,337
so lit,

85
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:40,451
and so cool.

86
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:42,608
May I call you Senior?

87
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:49,817
Oh, so you got me these fries as an offering, right?

88
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:55,607
Okay.

89
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:57,102
Your senior approves.

90
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:03,022
Mr. Karan, I wouldn’t have come all the way here if I’d known this.

91
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,160
Duj.

92
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:07,740
I don’t have a good feeling about this.

93
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:08,847
I’m scared of history repeating itself.

94
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:12,909
You mean the former top sales performer who got in trouble with a client and got fired?

95
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,208
You’re thinking the same thing, right?

96
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:16,408
Poor Karan.

97
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:20,463
It’s almost the holiday but he has to deal with this problem.

98
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,105
Who can help Karan?

99
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,022
(Every time I’m in trouble, Karan saves me.)

100
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:39,142
(I wish I could protect Achi in his dreams too.)

101
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:42,103
(What can I do to help him in return?)

102
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:45,877
Achi!

103
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,331
Achi!

104
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:47,742
Where are you going?

105
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:48,939
Achi!

106
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,789
You can’t do this.

107
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:51,536
Calm down.

108
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:52,780
I want to go in and help Karan.

109
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:54,577
Don’t go in there, Achi.

110
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:56,607
Are you sure this is a good idea?

111
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,008
I wonder the same thing.

112
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:00,659
Is this a good idea?

113
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:03,706
(Can someone like me even help Karan?)

114
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:08,807
If not you,

115
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:10,722
then who?

116
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,511
They’re totally screwed.

117
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,711
Achi.

118
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:23,509
Is there anything urgent?

119
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:26,909
I’m sorry for intruding.

120
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:28,007
I…

121
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:29,408
I…

122
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:34,284
(I already came in. I can’t let this be in vain.)

123
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,462
I received a report that there’s a problem with the AC in this room.

124
00:07:42,474 --> 00:07:43,290
It’s dripping water.

125
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:44,616
It’s messing up your shirt sleeve, Mr. Sukij.

126
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:45,158
Let me help.

127
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:46,054
No.

128
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:47,600
I can take care of it myself.

129
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:57,780
(What would make Mr. Sukij happy?)

130
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:01,675
(He looks so calm. I couldn’t tell he’s this worried.)

131
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,200
What a waste of my trip.

132
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:06,505
Let me fix your suit.

133
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:17,819
(What? That’s the reason?)

134
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:24,690
(Every time Mr. Sukij comes to visit from Yasothon,)

135
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:28,219
(he wants me to prepare the 7th heaven dessert aka Khanom Chan.)

136
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:30,922
(The place that makes the best Khanom Chan is opposite the office.)

137
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,860
(They have a long history of creating each of the 7 colored layers so neatly.)

138
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,365
(Thai people regard Khanom Chan as an auspicious dessert.)

139
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:40,517
(Eating it will boost your career.)

140
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:44,225
(This very colorful dessert makes you feel refreshed just by seeing it.)

141
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:46,605
(The more you eat it, the more delicious it is.)

142
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:49,026
How did you let him get so hangry?

143
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:52,176
I was busy choosing bikinis for the trip with my man so I forgot.

144
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:52,921
Again.

145
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:53,657
Hey.

146
00:08:53,945 --> 00:08:54,644
Achi.

147
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:17,506
It’s so delicious.

148
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:19,601
No other place can compare.

149
00:09:21,684 --> 00:09:23,862
I asked Dujdao to pack some in the box for you too.

150
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,709
Thank you so much.

151
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:32,306
I have to get going now.

152
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:33,257
Goodbye.

153
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:48,426
Achi, how did you know what Mr. Sukij wanted?

154
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,622
(How could I say.)

155
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,222
Thank you so much, Achi.

156
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:54,204
You’re welcome.

157
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:58,072
(Crisis averted.)

158
00:09:58,346 --> 00:10:00,311
(So glad I could help Karan with something.)

159
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:05,807
But I think Mr. Sukij is still not pleased with the products we’re offering to Office Buddy.

160
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,878
(Oh? I thought the problem had already been solved.)

161
00:10:08,896 --> 00:10:11,840
Achi, as an office worker yourself,

162
00:10:11,856 --> 00:10:14,911
what items do you think are essential for workers like you?

163
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,376
For me, it’s probably the pens.

164
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:25,595
Pens?

165
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:30,928
(Oh, god. That sounds so ordinary, doesn’t it?)

166
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,062
But most people type their work on mobile phones, tablets, or laptops these days.

167
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:38,023
Do you really think pens are still necessary?

168
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:42,100
They are.

169
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,802
They may seem so close to us that we overlook them,

170
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:52,736
but many people still use them for work on a regular basis.

171
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,896
Writing with our hands

172
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:58,903
can sometimes help us organize ideas better

173
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,802
and remember our thoughts better.

174
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:09,503
Interesting.

175
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:12,306
Small things that are important but often overlooked.

176
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:15,191
Actually, if we look at the data,

177
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:18,205
pens are one of the things whose sales never drop

178
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:19,508
compared to other products.

179
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,011
I have an idea.

180
00:11:25,222 --> 00:11:27,025
I’ll have Achi help you work

181
00:11:27,044 --> 00:11:29,672
as he’s also the target group of Office Buddy.

182
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:32,205
I think he’ll have interesting user data.

183
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:35,321
Sure.

184
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,208
Me? Helping Karan?

185
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:48,007
(Really? I’m going to help the most talented person in the office?)

186
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,411
This project is very urgent so we’ll have to work during the Songkran holiday.

187
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,007
Actually, I don’t want to trouble you.

188
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:59,607
It’s my responsibility.

189
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:01,607
It’s totally fine.

190
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,342
I’m not going anywhere for the holiday.

191
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:05,201
Plus, I want to give it a try.

192
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:09,336
(So I can learn about another role.)

193
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:14,579
Achi, will it be convenient for you to come to work?

194
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:16,979
During the festival,

195
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,768
if it’s inconvenient for you, I can pick you up.

196
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,408
No worries at all.

197
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:22,315
I’ll be fine.

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Excuse me.

199
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:28,811
This is the catalog of the pens we manufacture and distribute.

200
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:32,708
(So cute.)

201
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:34,902
(Achi is melting my heart again.)

202
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:36,703
(All this time I’ve been fangirling is worth it.)

203
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:37,515
What?

204
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,801
Yes?

205
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,300
Oh, nothing.

206
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:46,103
(What’s going on today?)

207
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,103
(Not only am I lucky in my career,)

208
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:52,386
(but a cute girl like Pai also has a crush on me.)

209
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:56,020
(This is clearly my golden age.)

210
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:09,321
Achi.

211
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,361
I bought some snacks for you.

212
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:14,401
Eating delicious things will give you the energy to work.

213
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:16,081
Thank you.

214
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:18,001
(He’s too cute.)

215
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:20,161
(He’s so gentle and adorable.)

216
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:23,561
You can take this as a bribe.

217
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:26,281
I don’t want to make you work too hard

218
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:27,841
so I bought you this in case you’re hungry.

219
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:31,721
(What should I do? I feel like I have to choose.)

220
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,721
(Why is this giving a love triangle vibe?)

221
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,121
(I don’t know how to act.)

222
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:40,121
Thank you so much, guys.

223
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:42,881
Achi.

224
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:04,521
(Achi, please choose some photos to post on the company’s social media.)

225
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:06,201
(The photos we took at the outing.)

226
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:08,561
(I’ve sent you the link to download them.)

227
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:24,641
(Actually, shouldn’t I feel good about myself that a cute girl like Pai has a crush on me?)

228
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:32,241
(Why do I feel nothing and not excited at all?)

229
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:42,841
(But with Karan…)

230
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:51,441
(Wait. Did I get so advanced that I can hear someone’s heart beating now?)

231
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,161
(Damn. Seriously?)

232
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:21,961

233
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:24,441

I’m stuck.

242
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:50,841
Can you help me type, cat?

243
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:52,241
Cat!

244
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:55,841
You won’t help me work at all.

245
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:20,241
Oh.

246
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:21,081
Oh, what?

247
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:22,241
Were you waiting for your partner?

248
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,721
No.

249
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:24,881
I have a delivery for you.

250
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:27,281
Please sign.

251
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:30,761
Whoa. Your perfume is so strong.

252
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:32,561
Doesn’t it make you dizzy?

253
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:34,041
No.

254
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,361
Where did Min go?

255
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,041
He hasn’t been delivering stuff lately.

256
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:53,921
I’m not playing.

257
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:54,841
I’m not playing.

258
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:55,761
I’m not playing.

259
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:01,121
It’s only the 12th and they started playing already?

260
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:33,641
(What? How did I just run into him so easily?)

261
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:47,161
What are you doing here?

262
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:49,601
Oh, I came to get ideas for my work

263
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:52,241
and find something to eat.

264
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:57,601
And what are you doing around here?

265
00:17:58,321 --> 00:17:59,881
I always practice dancing here.

266
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:00,841
For what?

267
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:02,441
To post on TikTok?

268
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:05,841
I’m going to join an idol contest.

269
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:07,641
Idol?

270
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,161
What do you mean?

271
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:12,001
A boyband.

272
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:13,361
I want to be chosen.

273
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:16,801
So you’re serious about this?

274
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:18,161
Of course, I’m serious.

275
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:25,201
Dancing with my friends takes me away from the chaotic world outside.

276
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:32,961
Getting to debut is the only clearest dream I’ve ever had.

277
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:42,561
(There’s so much more about Min than I thought.)

278
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:47,241
(A person who works really hard for something is so charming.)

279
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:50,961
Hey.

280
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:52,401
Hey.

281
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:53,041
Hey!

282
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:54,201
What?

283
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:55,441
Is something wrong?

284
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:57,641
No.

285
00:18:57,681 --> 00:18:58,761
You should get back to your dance practice.

286
00:18:58,761 --> 00:18:59,761
I’ll leave you to it.

287
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:00,961
Okay.

288
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:06,241
So what moves are we going with?

289
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:08,961
Oh?

290
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:11,441
Not that one.

291
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:12,561
What?

292
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:17,681
Achi.

293
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:20,801
Where are you going to join the water fight tonight?

294
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,441
I’m not going. It’s too crowded.

295
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:23,641
I’d rather go home and sleep.

296
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:24,801
I have to help Karan work tomorrow.

297
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:27,041
What? You have to work on the holiday?

298
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,081
That’s so sad.

299
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:30,041
It’s okay.

300
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,041
I’m willing to.

301
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:34,041
Just make sure to find time to rest too.

302
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:35,641
Oh.

303
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:39,161
Karan is talking to someone in the back.

304
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:40,241
Don’t turn around yet.

305
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:41,641
Hey.

306
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,961
I said don’t turn around yet.

307
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:46,841
Shall we slowly sneak in closer?

308
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:48,241
Let’s not be obvious.

309
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:53,001
Please. I can do that, right?

310
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:53,521
Who said you can?

311
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:55,641
Pretty, please! I can do that, right?

312
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,601
- Please let me stay in your room for just one night.
- Others will see us.

313
00:19:58,601 --> 00:19:59,561
Please.

314
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:00,321
She’s so lovey-dovey.

315
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:01,561
She must be his girlfriend.

316
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:03,641
Girlfriend?

317
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:08,601
(It’s normal for Karan to have a girlfriend.)

318
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:09,801
Let’s go.

319
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,441
(I don’t have to feel anything.)

320
00:20:52,201 --> 00:21:00,361
[I’m sorry, Karan. I’m not feeling well today. I really can’t make it.]

321
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:20,601
I’ll just continue resting for a while.

322
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:28,801
Karan.

323
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:31,601
He really came?

324
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:38,241
Wow.

325
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:40,281
How dare you look disappointed?

326
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:42,041
I should be the one disappointed.

327
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,481
You said you’d come to see me as soon as you’re back from the outing.

328
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:45,761
I was waiting.

329
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:46,641
I was lying and waiting in my room.

330
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:48,761
I didn’t know what to do anymore.

331
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,201
I’m telling you,

332
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:54,841
if I had followed your advice, I’d be dried and dead in my room.

333
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,561
Sorry.

334
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:57,601
Here.

335
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:58,961
I bought you some food.

336
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,361
You’re sick, aren’t you?

337
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,361
Luckily, you gave your parting instructions last night.

338
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:03,681
What parting instructions?

339
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:04,721
I’m not dead.

340
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,041
But almost.

341
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:18,641
What’s wrong?

342
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:19,721
You’re acting weird.

343
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:27,321
(Hey. I think you’re violating my thoughts.)

344
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:30,921
(Can’t I worry about you? You won’t talk, so I have to do this.)

345
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:33,681
(Seriously, why are you acting like you’re heartbroken?)

346
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:36,201
It’s not that.

347
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:39,521
I just feel weird but I don’t know how to explain.

348
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:40,801
Tell me.

349
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:50,161
(It seems like the guy I told you has a crush on me has fallen for someone else.)

350
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:51,841
(That’s why I feel weird.)

351
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:55,401
(This fits the theory of heartbreak.)

352
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:59,441
You feel like you’ve lost something, right?

353
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:00,641
Yeah.

354
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:03,681
I used to feel more special than anyone else

355
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:07,881
but now I’ve realized I’m not and I don’t know how to act.

356
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,081
It can’t be helped.

357
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:13,121
People like us are not good at these things.

358
00:23:21,561 --> 00:23:26,321
(It’s funny we’re asking each other for advice on love at 30 years old)

359
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:27,761
(because of this power.)

360
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:31,081
(The power we got from being virgins.)

361
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:36,681
Oh.

362
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:37,641
Karan.

363
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:42,881
(He’s the guy who has a crush on me.)

364
00:23:43,641 --> 00:23:47,001
Oh, I’ll get going then.

365
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:48,001
I’m leaving.

366

00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:13,881
Give me your hand.

No.

We can draw a long line with a good pen.

497

The line won’t break easily like the noodles.

00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,327
I can find them anywhere.

549
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,207
But the love and relationship like this between seniors and juniors?

550
00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:32,927
I found it here.

551
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:37,407
I’m glad to know, meet,

552
00:38:37,727 --> 00:38:40,847
and work with you guys.

553
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,007
Thank you so much too

554
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:45,967
for always helping us with everything.

555
00:38:48,847 --> 00:38:49,647
Look at you.

556
00:38:50,007 --> 00:38:53,247
You gave your juniors so much love that you have none left for any man.

557
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,207
Shut up.

558
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:56,207
Don’t bring it up.

559
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,407
By the way,

560
00:38:58,047 --> 00:39:00,967
why did you two come together?

561
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:04,247
Careful. The ghosts might push you together.

562
00:39:04,287 --> 00:39:06,407
No need to wait for the ghosts.

563
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:07,807
I’ll push him myself.

564
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:08,807
Oh, no.

565
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,367
- Rock!
- I didn’t mean it.

566
00:39:10,887 --> 00:39:11,647
Rock!

567
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:13,167
- How could you do this at the office?
- I didn’t mean it.

568
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:15,127
- This is against the company rules.
- I swear I didn’t mean it.

569
00:39:15,127 --> 00:39:16,407
But today is a holiday.

570
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:20,887
Yeah, it’s a holiday.

571
00:39:22,647 --> 00:39:23,647
Enjoy yourself to the fullest.

572
00:39:25,287 --> 00:39:26,967
What did you say?

573
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:27,727
Enjoy yourself to the fullest.

574
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:28,967
I’m going to enjoy myself to the fullest.

575
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:30,127
No!

576
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:32,287
Not me!

577
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,727
I’m old!

578
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:50,487
(Achi is so cute.)

579
00:39:56,967 --> 00:39:59,447
(I can’t help falling for him.)

580
00:40:17,287 --> 00:40:20,287
(Oh, no. I think Pai has a crush on me too.)

581
00:40:20,727 --> 00:40:23,567
(It must feel bad to see that.)

582
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:25,207
- Pai!
- Achi.

583
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:27,407
Hey, Achi.

584
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:28,687
What’s going on?

585
00:40:29,447 --> 00:40:29,967
Wait.

586
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:31,087
- Rock.
- Let me pat your face with flour.

587
00:40:31,127 --> 00:40:33,087
Rock, this is not the time to play!

588
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:37,407
Pai.

589
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:38,287
Pai.

590
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:41,007
Pai.

591
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:47,087
(My ship was having a moment in front of me.)

592
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:50,607
(When they played with my BL fan girl’s heart like that, how could I live?)

593
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,807
(What?)

594
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:57,407
What’s this?

595
00:40:57,407 --> 00:40:58,807
Why did you scream just now?

596
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:02,207
Well,

597
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:06,967
I was bitten by an ant.

598
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:09,727
And there’s nothing about this photo.

599
00:41:09,727 --> 00:41:11,687
I just thought it was cute

600
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:12,887
and the lighting was good

601
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,407
so I used it as my wallpaper.

602
00:41:14,607 --> 00:41:18,207
Plus, you two look cute together.

603
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:19,287
Really?

604
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:24,727
(I’m sorry, Achi.)

605
00:41:24,767 --> 00:41:27,327
(I’ve been shipping you with Karan for a long time.)

606
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:30,567
(I tried to keep it quiet and not get you in trouble)

607
00:41:30,607 --> 00:41:34,287
(but I couldn’t help it. You guys make me happy.)

608
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:37,807
(You guys make me want to come to work every day.)

609
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:42,007
(I’m so relieved she doesn’t have a crush on me.)

610
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:44,767
(Now I no longer have to worry about hurting her feelings.)

611
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:45,727
That’s a beautiful photo.

612
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:47,687
You’re such a good photographer.

613
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:50,087
Thank you.

614
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,847
What’s going on with you guys?

615
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:53,167
Why did you run?

616
00:41:53,207 --> 00:41:54,247
You scared me.

617
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:55,287
Nothing.

618
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:56,887
It’s just for fun.

619
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:57,847
Don’t worry.

620
00:42:00,487 --> 00:42:01,367
Pai.

621
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:03,167
What’s wrong?

622
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,287
Why did you run?

623
00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:07,087
You scared me.

624
00:42:07,087 --> 00:42:08,567
Are you okay, Pai?

625
00:42:19,687 --> 00:42:21,447
Hi Dujdao.

626
00:42:21,527 --> 00:42:23,687
Hey. Finally, we met in person.

627
00:42:23,687 --> 00:42:24,767
(He must’ve already told everyone about her.)
Hey. Finally, we met in person.

628
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:26,047
(He must’ve already told everyone about her.)

629
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,087
Hi.

630
00:42:32,327 --> 00:42:36,207
(Of course. How could it be me?)

631
00:42:40,447 --> 00:42:41,167
Achi!

632
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:42,487
- Achi!
- Achi!

633
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:43,607
Achi!

634
00:42:50,927 --> 00:42:52,367
(How did I get back here?)

635
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:01,607
You’re awake.

636
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:09,327
I’m sorry for making you work so hard.

637
00:43:12,647 --> 00:43:16,447
(I knew that if I’d stopped him, he’d still have done it.)

638
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:19,727
(There’s no way Achi won’t help other people.)

639
00:43:20,687 --> 00:43:24,087
(This is why I want to take care of him the best I can.)

640
00:43:44,687 --> 00:43:46,247
(I guess I have to talk about it now.)

641
00:43:46,687 --> 00:43:48,647
(I really don’t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable.)

642
00:43:53,607 --> 00:43:54,727
Uh…

643
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:56,487
May I come in?

644
00:44:14,407 --> 00:44:16,887
Actually, Achi’s house is not small.

645
00:44:17,527 --> 00:44:19,407
It’s perfect for Karan to stay for a while.

646
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:22,447
Can he?

647
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:23,287
What?

648
00:44:24,487 --> 00:44:27,487
I want to take over his condo for a while.

649
00:44:27,687 --> 00:44:28,407
Hey.

650
00:44:28,527 --> 00:44:30,607
Even though you’re my big sister, I won’t let you mess with everything.

651
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:33,207
(What? This is his older sister?)

652
00:44:34,287 --> 00:44:36,087
What can I do?

653
00:44:36,127 --> 00:44:38,487
If Mother finds out that I’m breaking up with my boyfriend,

654
00:44:38,607 --> 00:44:40,607
you know I’ll be screwed.

655
00:44:41,247 --> 00:44:42,887
Your room is the only place.

656
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:44,327
Let me stay there and work things out for a bit.

657
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:46,607
If he tries to get me back, I’ll leave right away.

658
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:51,727
Look.

659
00:44:51,727 --> 00:44:54,447
At a quick listen, I might sound selfish

660
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:56,927
but I’m actually worried about you, Achi.

661
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:01,007
It’s a good idea for Karan to stay here.

662
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:02,487
You’re sick.

663
00:45:02,607 --> 00:45:04,007
You should have someone to take care of you.

664
00:45:04,087 --> 00:45:07,367
Nowadays, companies won’t really care if you’re sick.

665
00:45:07,407 --> 00:45:09,047
I’ve thought of everything.

666
00:45:09,087 --> 00:45:10,807
Everyone will benefit from this.

667
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,407
It’s settled then.

668
00:45:14,607 --> 00:45:15,807
Thank you so much.

669
00:45:15,807 --> 00:45:16,527
Bye.

670
00:45:18,247 --> 00:45:19,607
I’ll send you new clothes.

671
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:31,727
(Does this mean Karan is moving into my house?)

672
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:43,407
Are you guys leaving already?

673
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,887
I’ve never seen you leave together.

674
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,367
I have to stay at Achi's house for now.

675
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:49,007
You can stay longer.

676
00:45:49,807 --> 00:45:50,607
Can I really?

677
00:45:51,327 --> 00:45:52,007
Yeah.

678
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,447
Since when did you watch me practice dancing?

679
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:57,007
Don’t tell me you’re my secret fan.

680
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:59,207
This is the first time I’m on a boat like this.

681
00:45:59,207 --> 00:45:59,767
Karan,

682
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:01,847
here’s a souvenir for your first boat ride.

683
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:04,927
(I’m about to live like a couple with Achi?)

684
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:06,247
(I can’t wait.)

685
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:16,207
[No matter what, I want to see Karan succeed in life
because he really deserves it.]
