Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,800
Please don’t worry, Achi.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,800
I promise I’ll do everything

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,300
to keep our relationship.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,830
Could you kneel down and apologize?

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,120
(If it will save my relationship with Achi,)

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,340
(I can do anything.)

11
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,770
Stand up, Karan.

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,350
You idiots.

13
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,630
Don’t even think you’ll get to do business with me again.

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,500
I feel like our relationship has grown another step.

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,970
No obstacles could come between our love.

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,320
Have you talked with him about your magical power?

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,620
Karan.

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,690
I have something to tell you.

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,300
Hmm?

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:00:59,900
Well…

21
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,370
I have mind reading power.

22
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,810
I really can read minds.

23
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,930
I’ve been hearing your thoughts all along.

24
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,500
I tried not to listen

25
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,510
but sometimes I couldn’t avoid it

26
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,100
because every time our bodies touch,

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,660
I hear everything.

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,540
Everything?

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,700
It might sound unbelievable.

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,000
(What’s going on? Is he going to surprise me with something?)

31
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,300
(But today is not a special occasion.)

32
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,280
What’s going on?

33
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,460
Is he going to surprise me with something?

34
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,400
But today is not a special occasion.

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,010
I understand if you’re angry.

36
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,800
(Is this true?)

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,900
Yes.

38
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,210
It’s true.

39
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,330
(So that means you’ve known all along how much I like you.)

40
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,940
(Can we move in together then?)

41
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,900
What?

42
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,700
How did I get to this point?

43
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,008
If you’ve heard me all along,

44
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:27,807
then you already know how serious I am about you.

45
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:31,997
But if you’re not ready,

46
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,908
it’s okay.

47
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:34,802
I can wait.

48
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:54,822
Let me help you with your stuff.

49
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:16,259
(Let’s test the system.)

50
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:17,859
(Can you hear me?)

51
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,004
(You know what, Achi?)

52
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:24,204
(I want to see our shoes)

53
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:27,057
(next to each other like this forever.)

54
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:39,619
(Test. Test.)

55
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:41,300
(What if I touch you here?)

56
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:49,102
(System testing.)

57
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:50,705
(Can you hear me like this?)

58
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,820
I can hear you.

59
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:57,605
(How about like this?)

60
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:03,905
What about here?

61
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:05,558
Don’t we have to test it?

62
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:16,309
(Let’s test again.)

63
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,859
(Can you hear my thoughts when I do this?)

64
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:20,423
I can hear everything.

65
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,579
(Achi, stop reading manga and read my mind instead.)

66
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,103
What else is there for me to read?

67
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:31,807
(Read that)

68
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:34,177
(I can say I love you all day.)

69
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:49,997
Achi.

70
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:51,997
You’re looking for this, right?

71
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:57,014
I prepared it for you.

72
00:06:57,152 --> 00:06:58,808
I remember you used this one.

73
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,305
Thank you.

74
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:27,482
Why?

75
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,860
You can see what I picture in my head too?

76
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:32,740
Yeah.

77
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:37,414
Well,

78
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:40,651
your cheeks are bouncy.

79
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:43,657
This is not just a thought anymore.

80
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:45,977
Sorry.

81
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:49,802
Hold on.

82
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:52,617
Did you see everything?

83
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:54,580
Yeah.

84
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:03,737
Which ones of my imagination have you seen before?

85
00:08:04,874 --> 00:08:05,705
That time…

86
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,208
Can you sleep okay?

87
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:23,219
Is my bed okay?

88
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,511
Yeah, I can sleep.

89
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:28,014
It’s very comfortable.

90
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,657
Will this make you more comfortable?

91
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,217
Feel free to toss and turn all you want.

92
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:44,284
I’m a heavy sleeper.

93
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,308
I won’t really notice.

94
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:55,804
Just sleep in your comfortable position.

95
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,703
Actually, I’m just nervous.

96
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:03,903
Other than my parents,

97
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,542
I’d never slept on the same bed with anyone.

98
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:13,114
I thought I was the only one who got nervous and couldn’t sleep.

99
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:16,602
Seeing you more nervous than me

100
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:19,219
is a relief.

101
00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:25,902
But since we’re sleeping next to each other,

102
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:31,912
can I ask you for something?

103
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:43,617
Can I hold your hand while sleeping?

104
00:09:58,687 --> 00:09:59,496
Good night.

105
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,103
Good night.

106
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:10,334
(Why do we have to sleep?)

107
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:13,208
(I’d rather look at Achi’s face all night.)

108
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:21,905
(A kiss on the cheek would give me sweet dreams tonight.)

109
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:24,005
(But what should I do?)

110
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:26,405
(I’m too scared to ask him for that on the first night.)

111
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,106
(What can I do to let Achi know?)

112
00:10:29,557 --> 00:10:31,402
(I’m definitely going to have a bad dream.)

113
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:42,779
Sweet dreams tonight.

114
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,177
Whose magical power is it really?

115
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:47,005
You’re so good at using it.

116
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,708
By the way,

117
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:55,505
how did you get this power?

118
00:10:58,078 --> 00:10:59,577
Did you get bitten by something?

119
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,905
No.

120
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,600
I read that

121
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:14,714
if you’re 30 and still a virgin,

122
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:16,776
you’ll have a magical power.

123
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,379
And you really gained the power?

124
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:23,017
Yeah.

125
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:32,349
(No matter how many times you’ve heard me say I love you in my head,)

126
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:33,613
(please don’t get tired of it yet.)

127
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:36,100
(I really can’t stop thinking about it.)

Achi.

135
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:16,220
Achi.

136
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,420
Wake up.

137
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,079
I prepared your breakfast and work outfit.

138
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,497
Let’s go to work soon.

139
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,965
Happy Monday.

140
00:12:58,617 --> 00:13:00,361
Let’s boost our energy before we deal with work.

141
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:06,538
What time did you wake up to prepare all this?

142
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:08,566
I always wake up early to run

143
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:10,464
and make breakfast.

144
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:13,365
Prepare to get used to it.

145
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,168
You’ll see this every day.

146
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,295
But what I proudly present

147
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:21,495
is this.

148
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:25,618
This four leaf clover

149
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:28,697
will bring you good luck all day.

150
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:33,018
You believe in this kind of thing?

151
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:35,420
Since I have a boyfriend who can read minds,

152
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,258
I believe in everything.

153
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,063
But why is your sandwich different from mine?

154
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:49,540
I’m already lucky

155
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:53,864
to have this day with you.

156
00:13:58,943 --> 00:13:59,867
That’s not all.

157
00:14:03,346 --> 00:14:04,870
Since we started dating,

158
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:08,571
I’ve been wanting to give you this.

159
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:15,670
Why Cherry?

160
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:18,421
Because

161
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:22,101
I love you cherry much.

162
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:26,657
What did you say?

163
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:28,041
Can you say it more clearly?

164
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,063
Are you teasing me?

165
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,021
I’m not.

166
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:43,168
There are our names on this too.

167
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:47,803
I’m not very good at embroidery, so…

168
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:48,941
Did you do it yourself?

169
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,174
Yeah.

170
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:52,141
Karan,

171
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:55,463
you already won my heart.

172
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,340
You didn’t have to do every little thing.

173
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:00,863
I can’t hold it back anymore.

174
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:03,098
I’ve wanted to say and do these things for so long.

175
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:06,266
Please bear with me.

176
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,169
Hang in there.

177
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:09,769
Okay.

178
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:13,418
I’ll try to hang in there.

179
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:16,965
Are you teasing me?

180
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:19,598
Let’s eat.

181
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:20,555
We don’t want to be late for work.

182
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:29,898
What are you guys celebrating?

183
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:30,715
Oh.

184
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:32,900
Rock got promoted.

185
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,572
That’s fast.

186
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:36,584
Yes.

187
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:39,663
I’m closer to your level now.

188
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,257
You can’t bully and order me to buy you coffee anymore.

189
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:43,457
Why?

190
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:47,057
Just because you got promoted, you stopped being kind?

191
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:49,984
Can you not get your Senior food and drinks anymore?

192
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:51,433
Huh?

193
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:52,500
Just kidding.

194
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:54,460
You’re still my Senior.

195
00:15:58,362 --> 00:16:01,196
Anyway, since the end of last year,

196
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:05,178
many of us have been promoted.

197
00:16:05,617 --> 00:16:08,738
How about we gather and celebrate together?

198
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:09,461
Good idea.

199
00:16:09,481 --> 00:16:10,522
Right?

200
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,275
Yeah.

201
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:12,860
Achi,

202
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:14,061
I’m curious.

203
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,863
In my job, I can get promoted from Junior to Senior.

204
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:19,046
But what about your job?

205
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,261
What’d be your title after getting promoted?

206
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:26,623
Oh.

207
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,420
My job has no career path.

208
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:32,177
Rock.

209
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:34,177
It’s okay.

210
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:35,664
Congratulations, Rock.

211
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:37,269
Thank you.

212
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,827
Don’t forget to invite me to your celebration.

213
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:41,666
Of course.

214
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:42,510
How about this evening?

215
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:43,518
Or at noon?

216
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,110
How about now?

217
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:45,186
I’ll go and ask for time off.

218
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:48,873
If Boss heard that, you’d be demoted right away.

219
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:50,506
You haven’t even received your new badge

220
00:16:50,518 --> 00:16:52,122
and you got carried away already.

221
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,451
Hit him hard.

222
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:56,334
Pai.

223
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,009
What?

224
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:02,661
I’m bruised all over.

225
00:17:04,645 --> 00:17:05,272
Pai.

226
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:07,707
What?

227
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,267
Do I look handsome in my new badge? Look.

228
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:10,697
Please, Rock.

229
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:13,103
When will you stop being crazy about your new title?

230
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,402
You’re still doing the same job.

231
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:17,470
We’re just going to work on different projects.

232
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:19,624
We have to work separately?

233
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,771
Yes,

234
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:22,368
because you’re not a junior anymore.

235
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,620
But if you can’t manage, you can tell me.

236
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:28,667
I can help.

237
00:17:31,236 --> 00:17:32,469
I can manage, of course.

238
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:35,103
I can take care of myself.

239
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:36,858
I can take care of my project.

240
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:39,264
Here.

241
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:50,672
And if someone walks into my life right now,

242
00:17:52,341 --> 00:17:53,701
I can take care of that person too.

243
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:01,566
Are you that shy?

244
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:06,069
Why are you that shy, BL fangirl?

245
00:18:06,082 --> 00:18:08,264
Will you ever find a man in this life

246
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:10,264
if you’re still fangirling about your ship like this?

247
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:11,673
Don’t let them know.

248
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:24,463
When will you know already?

249
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:35,661
Achi.

250
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:36,655
Hmm?

251
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:38,763
I can take a walk outside

252
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,261
while waiting to go home together.

253
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,260
It’s okay.

254
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,023
Jinta invited you too.

255
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,559
He said he had something important to tell us.

256
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:50,064
My friend.

257
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:50,983
Have a seat.

258
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:52,478
Hello, Mr. Karan.

259
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:53,104
Hi.

260
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:57,121
What’s going on?

261
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,463
Why did you want to meet up here?

262
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:00,766
When you called, you sounded very excited.

263
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:03,801
Well,

264
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:05,473
I have something important I want to tell you.

265
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:08,940
Someone bought the rights to my novel.

266
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:10,381
If nothing goes wrong,

267
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,827
by the end of next year, you’ll get to watch a series adaptation of it.

268
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:14,115
Are you serious?

269
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:14,479
Yes.

270
00:19:14,482 --> 00:19:15,598
I’m so happy for you, friend.

271
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:16,583
Thank you, friend.

272
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,983
You’ve accomplished your goal from five years ago.

273
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:19,758
Yes.

274
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:21,067
Five years ago at this place.

275
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,168
Do you remember?

276
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:25,266
You said if I could do it, you’d treat me to the most expensive meat here.

277
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:26,460
Of course, I remember.

278
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:28,177
I’m ready to keep my promise.

279
00:19:28,826 --> 00:19:30,334
Have you ordered?

280
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:31,270
Yes,

281
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:33,206
but just pay for the meat.

282
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,854
I’ll take care of the rest.

283
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:36,851
As for you, Mr. Karan.

284
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:37,944
Please enjoy.

285
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:38,669
Thank you.

286
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:40,129
Congratulations, Mr. Jinta.

287
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:40,981
Thank you.

288
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:42,177
Thank you.

289
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:47,501
Achi, if you want to drink with your friend, go for it.

290
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:49,018
I’ll take you home.

291
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:52,772
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

292
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:55,267
This one always collapses when he’s drunk.

293
00:19:58,061 --> 00:19:59,263
Achi has been drunk before?

294
00:20:00,747 --> 00:20:01,867
Rarely.

295
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,867
Only on special occasions.

296
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:06,666
Actually, only one glass gets me drunk.

297
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:09,208
Then let’s drink a bit.

298
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:10,301
Let me get you drinks.

299
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:15,861
This is for you, Mr. Karan.

300
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,266
And this is for my friend.

301
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:19,783
Thank you so much, friend.

302
00:20:20,506 --> 00:20:21,161
Come on.

303
00:20:21,175 --> 00:20:22,110
Let’s make a toast.

304
00:20:22,126 --> 00:20:22,743
Let’s make a toast.

305
00:20:22,774 --> 00:20:23,574
Cheers.

306
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:25,323
Let’s compete.

307
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:26,709
Who finishes their drink last loses.

308
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:27,372
Go.

309
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:32,811
Achi.

310
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:34,369
You might want to drink slowly.

311
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,673
Your stomach is still empty. You could get drunk.

312
00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:41,566
Thank you.

313
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:45,541
Your hand is all dirty.

314
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:46,366
Come on.

315
00:20:52,523 --> 00:20:53,946
This hand is dirty too.

316
00:20:57,907 --> 00:20:58,566
(Hey.)

317
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:01,058
(I’m so happy for your couple's life.)

318
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:03,700
(Don’t tease me.)

319
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,861
(Oh, you still can read minds?)

320
00:21:08,316 --> 00:21:09,821
(But I’m really happy for you.)

321
00:21:10,387 --> 00:21:12,768
(Seeing you guys makes me want to take care of Min too.)

322
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:14,141
(I want to have a partner too.)

323
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:15,660
(Then what are you waiting for?)

324
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:19,701
Why are you guys staring at each other?

325
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,666
No, we’re not staring.

326
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:23,981
We’re just talking.

327
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:26,667
Talking?

328
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:31,300
You mean you can do what Achi does?

329
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,218
Yes.

330
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:39,184
No wonder you touch each other often.

331
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:40,861
You do that to talk to each other.

332
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:42,725
You don’t need to be jealous, Mr. Karan.

333
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:44,663
Achi is not my type at all.

334
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,762
Just thinking about it makes me shudder.

335
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,569
Why?

336
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:48,498
Do you think I’m scared of you?

337
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,232
Do you want a piece of me?

338
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:50,300
Why not?

339
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,498
I’m not scared of you.

340
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:55,131
Why are you laughing?

341
00:21:55,676 --> 00:21:57,541
I’ve never seen you mad and clench your fist like this before.

342
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,337
Do it with me some other time.

343
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:04,101
It’s cute.

344
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:15,201
Let’s practice so you can fight back when you get attacked.

345
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:15,873
Come on.

346
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:25,666
(Are you free tomorrow?)

347
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:27,741
(I have something important to tell you.)

348
00:22:42,366 --> 00:22:43,069
Cheers.

349
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,263
Okay.

350
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:45,897
Bottoms up.

351
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:50,704
How are you doing?

352
00:22:50,777 --> 00:22:51,561
Am I heavy?

353
00:22:52,328 --> 00:22:53,168
No, not heavy.

354
00:22:58,475 --> 00:22:59,464
Is something wrong?

355
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:01,365
Oh.

356
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:02,965
Nothing.

357
00:23:03,054 --> 00:23:04,670
You can talk to me, Achi.

358
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,768
About anything.

359
00:23:10,673 --> 00:23:13,497
Today, both Rock and Jinta

360
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,072
have made a lot of progress.

361
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:20,168
Actually, I’m so happy for both of them

362
00:23:23,023 --> 00:23:27,569
but I don’t know why I’m also worried.

363
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:32,020
I feel like I’m the only one stuck in the same place.

364
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,775
If you’re happy with where you are now,

365
00:23:38,571 --> 00:23:39,538
isn’t it okay?

366
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:45,864
I don’t know if I’m still happy.

367
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:51,161
Five years ago I thought continuing like this

368
00:23:51,978 --> 00:23:53,169
would be fine

369
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:58,066
but if five years from now,

370
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:00,904
I’m still the same,

371
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:04,163
I’m scared of that somehow.

372
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,562
I believe that if you want to grow,

373
00:24:09,636 --> 00:24:10,969
you can do it for sure.

374
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:15,541
When a meticulous person like you takes something seriously,

375
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:17,067
it’s going to be a success.

376
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:20,961
But I’m already 30.

377
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,941
Isn’t it no longer time to try things?

378
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:26,061
You’re only 30.

379
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:28,472
You’ve only had a few trials and errors.

380
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:32,369
You may no longer like what you used to like

381
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:33,602
and want to try something new.

382
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:34,620
That’s okay.

383
00:24:34,778 --> 00:24:39,424
I believe you still have time to start something new at your age.

384
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:47,469
Karan.

385
00:24:47,504 --> 00:24:48,070
Hmm?

386
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:49,672
Can I get off here?

387
00:24:52,562 --> 00:24:53,544
Are you alright?

388
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:54,743
Are you feeling nauseous?

389
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:02,368
Thank you so much.

390
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:06,464
Thank you too

391
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,270
for telling me.

392
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,075
We’re leaving now.

393
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:26,769
See you next time.

394
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:27,473
See you.

395
00:25:27,947 --> 00:25:28,775
See you.

396
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:45,500
Take it.

397
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:47,064
I bought this as a thank you gift for you.

398
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:48,866
Hey.

399
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,140
It’s okay.

400
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:51,762
You already thanked me.

401
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:55,572
This time, I didn’t buy a gift to thank you for helping with my novel,

402
00:25:56,283 --> 00:25:57,543
but rather to thank you for something else.

403
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:04,572
Actually, I bought you these shoes

404
00:26:05,655 --> 00:26:10,470
because I have a hidden agenda.

405
00:26:15,104 --> 00:26:16,292
Hidden agenda?

406
00:26:18,418 --> 00:26:19,869
I want to drop you home.

407
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:23,264
I don’t want you to go home late by yourself.

408
00:26:24,491 --> 00:26:25,866
I want to know if you’ve arrived at home,

409
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:27,297
if you’ve had a stressful day,

410
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:29,269
if you’ve eaten all meals,

411
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:31,267
and what you’ve faced each day.

412
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,768
Love is weird.

413
00:26:35,618 --> 00:26:39,561
I never used to care about anything

414
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:41,261
but when it comes to you,

415
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,300
no matter how small,

416
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,472
everything matters to me.

417
00:26:46,998 --> 00:26:47,818
Love?

418
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:51,069
Uh…

419
00:26:51,552 --> 00:26:52,369
Yes.

420
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:57,294
Yes, I like you.

421
00:27:03,193 --> 00:27:04,143
Since when?

422
00:27:05,313 --> 00:27:07,371
Since the first few times we met.

423
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:09,623
Hey, watch out!

424
00:27:17,663 --> 00:27:19,738
If I came across this book

425
00:27:19,955 --> 00:27:21,620
and this sentence on a bad day,

426
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:23,269
I’d definitely get the energy to do everything.

427
00:27:23,615 --> 00:27:24,937
Every time we meet,

428
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,861
I like you more.

429
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,467
It feels so good that

430
00:27:29,598 --> 00:27:31,673
I want to have that moment every day.

431
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:41,667
You confessed your feelings but ran away.

432
00:27:42,814 --> 00:27:44,165
Now how am I going to get my happy ending?

433
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:50,670
I’m okay.

434
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:52,765
I accept all of it.

435
00:27:53,574 --> 00:27:55,566
Your gift, your thanks,

436
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:58,020
and your love confession.

437
00:28:00,408 --> 00:28:02,568
Madam Noi too if you’ll give her to me.

438
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:08,134
Okay.

439
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,368
Got it.

440
00:28:11,387 --> 00:28:12,460
But...

441
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,270
I still want to run.

442
00:28:15,322 --> 00:28:16,177
I’ll be right back.

443
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,710
Thank you for everything the company has given me

444
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:36,815
but now I think it’s time

445
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:39,007
for me to move forward.

446
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:44,582
I don’t want to be an admin anymore.

447
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:51,683
Is that so, Achi?

448
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,111
Let’s talk in my office.

449
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:04,621
I don’t have any excuses.

450
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:08,710
I really want to quit my admin role.

451
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:12,007
What’s so bad about being an admin?

452
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:13,613
It’s not that it’s bad

453
00:29:14,596 --> 00:29:19,213
but I want to explore outside of the role

454
00:29:19,698 --> 00:29:21,305
and see what I can do.

455
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:24,710
Actually, I’m currently evaluating myself and trying to figure out

456
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:27,910
if there are other things I’m good at.

457
00:29:29,924 --> 00:29:33,313
I planned to discuss it with you

458
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:36,299
but…

459
00:29:36,314 --> 00:29:38,007
If I have another role to offer,

460
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:40,007
would you be interested?

461
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,406
I have an idea

462
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:46,511
if you haven’t figured out your new role.

463
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:49,807
Toyokawa is opening a new branch.

464
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:52,204
I’m looking for someone to set up things there.

465
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,809
If you go, you’ll have to do everything by yourself

466
00:29:57,556 --> 00:30:00,111
but I believe that’ll make you grow.

467
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:04,339
If you can do it well, I’ll consider promoting you.

468
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:09,495
I accept.

469
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,510
You can think about it first

470
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:13,505
because it’ll require you

471
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,784
to move to Nakhon Si Thammarat alone for a month.

472
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:28,572
[New Branch Coming Soon: Toyokawa Nakhon Si Thammarat]

473
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:53,908
How can someone like me keep a long distance relationship?

474
00:30:56,914 --> 00:30:58,604
If I can’t read Karan’s mind,

475
00:31:00,585 --> 00:31:03,110
how will I know what he wants

476
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:04,510
and what he’s thinking?

477
00:31:07,052 --> 00:31:08,702
I’m definitely going to ruin it.

478
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:23,406
What’s wrong, Senior?

479
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:24,342
Well,

480
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,578
I saw Boss call Achi into his office.

481
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,804
He was carrying a white envelope going in there.

482
00:31:31,581 --> 00:31:34,513
If he resigns, how will I live?

483
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,141
Tell me honestly.

484
00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:43,622
Do you like Achi?

485
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,018
Are you crazy?

486
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:47,222
What makes you think that?

487
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:51,618
Then why are you worried about his problems?

488
00:31:51,741 --> 00:31:53,618
He’s my spirit lifter, you know?

489
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,581
Just to see him living his life makes me happy.

490
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:02,203
He makes me want to get up for work

491
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,899
and see his face.

492
00:32:04,496 --> 00:32:06,705
Even though I’m lazy that day,

493
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,902
I get the motivation to get out of bed.

494
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:18,003
Without Achi and Karan, working would be meaningless to me.

495
00:32:22,412 --> 00:32:24,105
I both get it and don’t get it.

496
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:26,908
Can you go a day without getting on my nerves?

497
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,864
I don’t understand why you care so much about Achi and Karan

498
00:32:30,876 --> 00:32:32,019
if you don’t have feelings for them

499
00:32:33,132 --> 00:32:35,428
but I understand what it’s like to have someone

500
00:32:35,442 --> 00:32:38,307
who makes you want to hurry through the traffic to get to work

501
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:42,308
and happy every time you come to work.

502
00:32:48,956 --> 00:32:51,062
Maybe I understand that more than you, Senior.

503
00:33:03,237 --> 00:33:04,114
Was that…

504
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,362
Which ship was that about?

505
00:33:10,832 --> 00:33:13,382
Duj and Tanaka?

506
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:16,514
Oh, Rock. I can tell.

507
00:33:21,994 --> 00:33:22,612
Achi.

508
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,799
How was your talk with Mr. Tanaka?

509
00:33:27,228 --> 00:33:28,107
Oh.

510
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:31,804
There’s no progress yet.

511
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,024
Don’t worry.

512
00:33:39,172 --> 00:33:40,616
It might take some time

513
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:44,366
but I’m sure Mr. Tanaka will find a good role

514
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:46,304
that suits your skills.

515
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:49,366
Mm.

516
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:24,210
It’s okay.

517
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:25,502
Go back to sleep.

518
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:26,496
I’ll dry your hair

519
00:34:26,742 --> 00:34:27,704
so you don’t get sick.

520
00:34:30,061 --> 00:34:31,859
(He must have had a tough day at work.)

521
00:34:32,176 --> 00:34:35,022
(It’s so good that I get to take care of him.)

522
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:44,172
[Getting around Nakhon Si Thammarat without a car]
[Getting around Nakhon Si Thammarat]
[Getting to Nakhon Si Thammarat]

523
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:03,110
Karan.

524
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:04,178
How’s it going?

525
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:06,178
Achi has consulted you

526
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,210
about going to Nakhon Si Thammarat, right?

527
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:11,492
Yes.

528
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:16,012
I understand that living in another city alone for a month

529
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:19,379
is a hard decision to make for someone in a relationship

530
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:23,804
but it'd be great if he could give me an answer today.

531
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:35,027
Achi.

532
00:35:37,326 --> 00:35:38,579
Are you free to talk with me?

533
00:35:53,563 --> 00:35:57,101
Mr. Tanaka asked me about assigning you to work in another city’s branch.

534
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:00,702
I didn’t know that.

535
00:36:04,182 --> 00:36:07,508
I’ve decided to say no

536
00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:10,505
so I didn’t want you to worry.

537
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:13,462
I’m sorry for not telling you.

538
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:15,704
I’m not angry with you.

539
00:36:16,196 --> 00:36:17,606
I was just shocked.

540
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:22,207
Actually, Boss wanted me to ask you

541
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:23,619
because he wants an answer today.

542
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:29,624
Okay.

543
00:36:30,082 --> 00:36:31,624
I’ll give him my answer soon.

544
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:42,384
But why would you reject this opportunity?

545
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:47,181
Because I’d have to be in Nakhon Si Thammarat for a long time

546
00:36:48,022 --> 00:36:49,584
and do everything by myself.

547
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:51,099
I’d have to worry about work

548
00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:53,501
and our relationship.

549
00:36:54,773 --> 00:36:56,311
I don’t think I can do it.

550
00:37:03,696 --> 00:37:05,806
I wish I could read your mind

551
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:10,212
to know what I should say

552
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,604
but I can’t.

553
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:19,416
So, please say what you think out loud.

554
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:22,816
(I want to listen to everything)

555
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:25,513
(you’re comfortable sharing.)

556
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:33,781
Actually, the opportunity Boss offered is interesting

557
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,059
but if we lived far from each other,

558
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:40,745
I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to read your mind.

559
00:37:41,797 --> 00:37:43,698
How could I be a good boyfriend then?

560
00:37:44,107 --> 00:37:47,799
I don’t want everything we’ve done to be together

561
00:37:48,295 --> 00:37:49,422
to go to waste.

562
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:53,911
Nothing will go to waste, Achi.

563
00:37:54,284 --> 00:37:55,711
You’ll be away for only a while.

564
00:37:56,711 --> 00:37:58,144
And about the mind reading,

565
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,313
if I felt there was a problem,

566
00:38:01,277 --> 00:38:02,806
I’d tell you honestly

567
00:38:02,994 --> 00:38:06,007
to make it feel like you’re reading my mind.

568
00:38:09,376 --> 00:38:12,908
But will you be okay?

569
00:38:13,864 --> 00:38:14,908
Of course.

570
00:38:16,464 --> 00:38:20,110
Soon I’ll get to be with you every day until we’re old.

571
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:25,402
It’s just for a little over a month that you’ll try something you want.

572
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:27,707
Of course, I can wait.

573
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,310
And I promise

574
00:38:37,093 --> 00:38:39,062
you won’t lose me because of it.

575
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:45,810
After hearing that, do you still want to reject the opportunity?

576
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:56,101
The internet signal there is not very good

577
00:38:57,996 --> 00:38:59,407
and the weather is bad.

578
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:01,806
The employees there might not respect you

579
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,304
because you’re still young.

580
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:08,622
You’ll have to plan, oversee, and check the work yourself

581
00:39:08,707 --> 00:39:10,107
then report it to me.

582
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:12,259
Are you ready for those things?

583
00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:14,584
I believe I’m ready.

584
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:21,711
(I lied.)

585
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,778
(I don’t believe I’m ready.)

586
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:33,714
(All this time, I’ve never felt ready for anything.)

587
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:37,784
(But it turns out that starting something)

588
00:39:39,954 --> 00:39:41,806
(even when I’m not sure I’m ready)

589
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:45,602
(is not as scary as I thought.)

590
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,402
(The scariest thing)

591
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:52,409
(is to limit myself)

592
00:39:52,898 --> 00:39:54,419
(because I’m scared beforehand.)

593
00:39:59,803 --> 00:40:01,538
I really want to try this.

594
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:02,505
Good.

595
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:03,861
Way to go.

596
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,511
How did it go?

597
00:40:33,796 --> 00:40:34,610
Did it go okay?

598
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:48,138
♪ Cause you are extraordinary ♪

599
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,773
♪ Turning days so ordinary ♪

600
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:52,036
♪ Into something wonderful ♪

601
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:56,213
♪ Every minute with you is so meaningful ♪

602
00:40:57,964 --> 00:40:59,203
I accepted the offer

603
00:41:00,397 --> 00:41:01,908
and I feel so good.

604
00:41:03,566 --> 00:41:04,938
Thank you so much, Karan.

605
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,113
(My magical power today)

606
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:13,116
(is nothing compared to the power of great love)

607
00:41:13,951 --> 00:41:16,311
(that makes me a braver person.)

608
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:23,807
Well done.

609
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,210
I’m proud of you, Achi.

610
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:28,810
Because I have you.

611
00:41:54,785 --> 00:41:56,782
(I have the courage to try many things,)

612
00:41:58,604 --> 00:41:59,720
(even)

613
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:08,202
(doing something I never thought I’d do.)

614
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:27,416
Will you go Loy Krathong with me?

615
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:28,016
Mm.

616
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:29,351
Which one do you think is better, Pai?

617
00:43:29,364 --> 00:43:30,356
Don’t tell me

618
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:32,108
you’re going Loy Krathong with Achi.

619
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:34,716
I booked a restaurant for this evening.

620
00:43:34,722 --> 00:43:36,880
After eating, let’s go shopping for Loy Krathong outfits.

621
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:37,621
Got it.

622
00:43:38,102 --> 00:43:40,716
I want you to go to the new branch on the 20th.

623
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:41,366
Oh, no.

624
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,082
I made a promise about Loy Krathong.

625
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:44,840
I don’t want to disappoint Karan.

626
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:45,471
Hello, Pai.

627
00:43:45,486 --> 00:43:46,582
I need your help.

628
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:47,510
Liar.

629
00:43:48,036 --> 00:43:48,804
Achi.

630
00:43:51,082 --> 00:44:00,532
[My magical power today
is nothing compared to the power of great love
that makes me a braver person.]
