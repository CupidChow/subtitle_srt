00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:31,458
(Yang Dae Hyeok)

3
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:53,880
Yes?

4
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:55,549
I'm from the real estate office.

5
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:00,420
Hello, ma'am.
We'd like to take a look at the place.

6
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:04,024
Please come in.

7
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:06,993
Perfect timing. You're both here together.

8
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:09,963
This couple here is newly married too,
and they won the housing lottery.

9
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:11,798
So the place came on the market
in a real rush.

10
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:15,702
Even though it's a villa,
listings like this are rare.

11
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:18,438
- Yes, come on in.
- Please come in.

12
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:20,540
We'll take a look at the master bedroom.

13
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,011
Did they open up the wall?

14
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:28,582
This place has such great energy.

15
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:30,083
You know, the land itself has to be good.

16
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,519
That's how couples get along better.

17
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,386
Isn't that so?

18
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:36,957
Well, yes.

19
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,861
- The bathroom...
- Yes, you should check that carefully.

20
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:44,998
The bathroom's spacious, isn't it?

21
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,534
Do you think it's okay?

22
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:48,602
It's not bad.

23
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,172
Excuse me.

24
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:54,007
Give it some thought and give me a call.

25
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:55,375
- We'll be in touch.
- Yes.

26
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,110
- Thank you.
- Take care.

27
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,582
Those two would be perfect.

28
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,519
But miss, you should smile a bit.

29
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,156
If the vibe feels off,
the house won't sell easily.

30
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:10,157
What do you mean?

31
00:02:10,157 --> 00:02:12,492
I didn't mean anything by it.

32
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:15,762
Why? Did you two fight this morning?

33
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,932
When we move out of this house,
we're getting divorced.

34
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:26,540
Right.
I was expecting clients at the office.

35
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:30,210
Well then,

36
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,078
I'll try to get back to you
as soon as possible.

37
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:42,088
(Love's Grace Period)

38
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:48,395
(Real Estate)

39
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:51,164
Life never goes exactly as planned.

40
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,203
After winning what everyone called
a jackpot, the newlywed housing lottery,

41
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:00,674
we decided not to love each other anymore.

42
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:05,879
One month until the apartment move-in.

43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,348
On that day,

44
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:10,884
we decide to get divorced.

45
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:29,336
I'll take the car today.
I need to stop by somewhere.

46
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,371
Here.

47
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:35,008
Ms. Won.

48
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:37,344
- Hey.
- Hello.

49
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:40,814
It's nice seeing you two
come to work together every day.

50
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:42,849
Then you should hurry up
and get married too.

51
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,786
At least set me up on a blind date
before saying that.

52
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:48,255
Did that last blind date not go well?

53
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:50,590
He never called for a second date.

54
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:55,262
Yoo Ri.

55
00:03:57,798 --> 00:03:58,765
Yoo Ri.

56
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:03,837
But why are you still living
in that house?

57
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:07,407
You're staying married
until move-in anyway,

58
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:08,642
so you don't really need to live together.

59
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:10,577
He has nowhere else to go.

60
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:15,115
He took an early severance payout
and put it all into the subscription,

61
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:17,117
and he still has loans.

62
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:19,085
That's what's strange.

63
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:20,887
I mean, if you're getting divorced,

64
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:23,256
who gives their ex-wife
the house and money?

65
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:25,759
Does he have some hidden agenda?

66
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:28,228
It's not like that.

67
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:29,229
Divorce.

68
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,399
I've been through it, so I know.
You have to be decisive.

69
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,401
When people are cornered,
they all act the same.

70
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:38,939
What are you, some kind of know-it-all?

71
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,043
I'm not a know-it-all,
but I do know a thing or two.

72
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:46,880
You don't still have feelings for him,
do you?

73
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:17,043
I told you to do it separately.

74
00:05:17,377 --> 00:05:18,345
I'll do it while I'm at it.

75
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:21,281
Take that with you.

76
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:23,884
Stop giving me things like this
all the time.

77
00:05:24,484 --> 00:05:25,519
It's just a habit.

78
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:28,955
It makes more sense
for you to use the car, right?

79
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:30,857
I don't mind.

80
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:33,460
How can you not mind?

81
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:37,264
Right. I'll use it tomorrow.

82
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:38,431
I'm going to look at rooms during the day.

83
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:40,834
I'll go with you.

84
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:45,806
Let's just get it over with.

85
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:48,708
I want to stop talking about this.

86
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:53,280
Why? Did he say something?

87
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:56,283
He wants to see you.

88
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:00,787
Then bring him home.

89
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:06,626
Bring him here?

90
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:09,529
Yeah.

91
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:11,198
Okay.

92
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:13,300
How much are the vitamins?

93
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:14,968
It's fine. It's nothing.

94
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:19,806
Don't call everything even like that.

95
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,019
Come on in.

96
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:35,722
This is the room.

97
00:06:51,104 --> 00:06:53,039
Why won't the window close?

98
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,075
It's just stuck for now.

99
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:56,643
I'll fix it before you move in.

100
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:03,817
Are you serious?
You really plan to live there?

101
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:05,552
The window doesn't even close.

102
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,188
It's close to my workplace.

103
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:25,205
Hello?

104
00:07:26,706 --> 00:07:27,541
Yeah.

105
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:30,777
Yeah.

106
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:32,712
No, I haven't eaten yet.

107
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,781
Yeah.

108
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:39,453
Okay, I'll call you back.

109
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:56,670
It's nice seeing you talk so much
after a long time.

110
00:07:58,138 --> 00:07:58,972
You're lying.

111
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,408
I mean it.

112
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:05,245
Just stay home.

113
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:07,047
That place isn't right.

114
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,409
Hey.

115
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:39,679
You didn't have to bring anything.

116
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:41,515
How could I do that?

117
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:43,450
Thanks.

118
00:08:43,884 --> 00:08:46,019
- Come in.
- Okay.

119
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,127
Hello.

120
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:56,997
Would you like some coffee?

121
00:08:57,464 --> 00:08:58,665
Yes, thank you.

122
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,315
You said you wanted to see me?

123
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:17,083
Yes.

124
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:19,953
I'll be straightforward.

125
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:22,222
To be honest, the fact that you two
are still living together...

126
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:24,724
makes me very uncomfortable.

127
00:09:25,392 --> 00:09:27,794
I know you've sorted things out
between you two,

128
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:29,062
but it still weighs on my mind.

129
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,798
You know how it looks.

130
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:35,068
Who would understand this situation?
Right?

131
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:37,737
So instead,

132
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:40,106
I think it would be better
if Yoo Ri moved into my place.

133
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:42,409
That's not what we talked about.

134
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,881
We have a lot of complicated issues
to sort through.

135
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:49,349
I heard you're moving
into a semi-basement.

136
00:09:49,349 --> 00:09:51,651
That would make Yoo Ri uncomfortable too.

137
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:55,455
As long as you both secure
separate places, isn't that enough?

138
00:09:56,123 --> 00:09:58,892
And we are seeing each other now.

139
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:01,328
You're using separate rooms, right?

140
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:03,230
Min Gi.

141
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,365
I just want things to be clear.

142
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:12,072
Yoo Ri cherishes this carpet.

143
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,341
I see.

144
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:16,710
This carpet?

145
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:21,781
I'm sorry, Min Gi,

146
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:24,951
but we're not divorced yet.

147
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:37,130
Okay.

148
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:43,537
Call me once everything's settled.

149
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:45,739
I'll leave now.

150
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:02,222
Don't you need to go after him?

151
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:04,524
Why would I? He was right.

152
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,127
You're unbelievable.

153
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:09,029
Is the carpet really that important?

154
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:10,397
Of course, it is.

155
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:19,473
Could you not make this about me?

156
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:34,114
Hee Chan.

157
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:36,016
You can't do that, okay?

158
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:38,785
Dad, Hee Chan bought a Benz.

159
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:42,456
Should I tell Mom to buy you one as well?

160
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,125
I want a Porsche.

161
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,660
Porsche? Okay.

162
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,928
I told you not to do that.

163
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,965
I told you not to.

164
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:05,479
Hey.

165
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:10,517
Do you want to have pork belly?

166
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,330
There's this Chinese drama I'm watching.

167
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,602
I saw. You've been watching a lot.

168
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:06,540
It's weird how people are flying around
in that drama.

169
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:09,609
They're not people. They're monsters.

170
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:43,543
I bought this near the house.

171
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:46,913
That place is run by the son now.

172
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:50,484
Yeah, the owner changed.

173
00:14:53,987 --> 00:14:55,255
How many episodes are there?

174
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:57,624
One hundred twenty.

175
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:00,894
If you watch it all, a year will pass.

176
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:10,537
- It's fun.
- With all that killing.

177
00:15:56,183 --> 00:16:00,687
(Application for Confirmation of Intent
for Mutual Divorce)

178
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:13,433
We're using separate rooms.

179
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:16,136
Should I take a photo and send it?

180
00:16:20,874 --> 00:16:22,943
I'm full. It's been a while.

181
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:24,110
Yeah.

182
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:26,546
I ate too much earlier too.

183
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:28,582
You really did eat a lot.

184
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:32,085
I need to feed it.

185
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:33,520
I already did earlier.

186
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:36,323
Yeah, thanks.

187
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:45,599
That guy.

188
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:49,569
You're seeing him
because you like him, right?

189
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:54,307
I hope it's because you like him.

190
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:57,777
Go all in...

191
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:01,348
in doing whatever makes you happy.

192
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:09,790
That's what I'm doing now.

193
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:13,226
And that's why everything's a mess.

194
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:25,172
Can we sleep together tonight?

195
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:40,887
Hey, Yoo Ri,
when are you ever going to shower?

196
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:43,657
I'm in a really good mood right now.
Don't interrupt me.

197
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:46,326
- Want me to let you shower?
- What are you doing?

198
00:17:47,227 --> 00:17:48,094
Hey.

199
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:49,930
Honey.

200
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:52,265
- Even my hair smells nice.
- Let me smell it.

201
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:54,801
No, don't. Don't smell it.

202
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:08,548
What if...

203
00:18:11,318 --> 00:18:12,919
we lived like this?

204
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:37,377
Get some more sleep.

205
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:45,745
If I don't hear from you,
I'll take it as us breaking up.

206
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:48,081
(Min Gi)

207
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:53,019
(A voice message has arrived.)

208
00:19:56,723 --> 00:19:57,924
Hello.

209
00:19:57,924 --> 00:20:02,295
The remaining balance for Pad Nine Park
View hasn't been received by the deadline.

210
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:06,466
If the remaining balance is not paid
within the designated move-in period,

211
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:07,400
the contract will be terminated...

212
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:12,005
Hey, Yoo Ri.

213
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:12,939
Won Yoo Ri.

214
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:17,544
Hey, wait.

215
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:24,518
- Just a second.
- You said you'd pay the balance.

216
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:26,853
I was so overwhelmed,
I got the schedule mixed up.

217
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:29,222
Is there anything
more important than this?

218
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:31,124
Okay, I'll transfer it right now.

219
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:32,492
That fixes it, right?

220
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:34,995
Ji Hoo.

221
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,965
Is this house really important to you?

222
00:20:41,968 --> 00:20:43,036
Of course it is.

223
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:47,574
Can we stop having this conversation?

224
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:48,441
Yeah.

225
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:51,178
That's why we're getting divorced.

226
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:54,247
We tried, didn't we?

227
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:57,684
I know this is the house
you've wanted forever.

228
00:20:57,684 --> 00:20:59,853
That's why I'm dealing with loans
and interest and all that.

229
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:00,921
Exactly.

230
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:03,690
That's why I said I wanted to give it up.

231
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:05,692
But you said we should at least
keep the house.

232
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:07,661
We have to. How can we just give it up?

233
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:10,230
Pay it or don't. Do whatever you want.

234
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:12,933
What's the point of any of it anyway?

235
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:14,835
None of it matters anymore.

236
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:19,940
It was supposed to be the house
we'd live in together.

237
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,077
The three of us.

238
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:32,853
But you were never there.

239
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:06,286
I'm going to go work out.

240
00:22:06,987 --> 00:22:08,588
I think I'm going to have nightmares.

241
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:10,223
Again?

242
00:22:15,095 --> 00:22:16,062
Try to get some sleep.

243
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:18,832
And stop crying. You're exhausted.

244
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:45,192
Is our house coming along okay?

245
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:47,461
You like it that much?

246
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:49,629
You're basically the site manager.

247
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,832
Hello. You're here for inspection again?

248
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:52,732
Hello.

249
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:02,008
It'd be great
if all these leaves were money, right?

250
00:23:02,008 --> 00:23:03,076
Yeah.

251
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:04,444
Let's take a picture too.

252
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:06,646
Careful.

253
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,752
That relaxed, rich-person look.
You know that, right?

254
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:13,687
Okay, trust me.

255
00:23:14,588 --> 00:23:16,923
Three, two, one.

(Insurance Policy - Children's Insurance)

262
00:24:56,823 --> 00:24:58,725
Hello, ma'am.

263
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:01,528
Yes, you've been well, right?

264
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:09,169
He asked not to contact you
under any circumstances.

265
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:14,207
The prenatal insurance cancellation
was handled by your husband at the time,

266
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:15,642
so everything was processed properly.

267
00:25:16,877 --> 00:25:18,712
He cried so much...

268
00:25:19,346 --> 00:25:21,715
that I was honestly worried
something might happen to him.

269
00:25:58,051 --> 00:25:59,052
Where did you go?

270
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,021
To wash the car.

271
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:03,290
You washed it yesterday.

272
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,328
How...

273
00:26:10,063 --> 00:26:11,364
did we end up like this?

274
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:16,436
Our car is probably the cleanest in Seoul.

275
00:26:17,437 --> 00:26:19,372
All we do is wash it, day after day.

276
00:26:21,741 --> 00:26:23,710
Without even knowing
what condition the car is in.

277
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:32,552
Why don't you ask?

278
00:26:35,622 --> 00:26:36,790
You know I cried.

279
00:26:38,692 --> 00:26:39,793
Did something happen?

280
00:26:40,794 --> 00:26:41,895
You're asking what happened?

281
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,664
Ji Hoo,

282
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:49,069
why do you go somewhere else to cry?

283
00:26:51,771 --> 00:26:53,206
You tell me to bring my boyfriend home?

284
00:26:54,674 --> 00:26:56,943
You tell me to take the house too?

285
00:26:58,411 --> 00:26:59,412
Is that even possible for you?

286
00:27:01,815 --> 00:27:03,583
How does everything work out for you?

287
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:06,386
Seriously,

288
00:27:06,753 --> 00:27:09,389
why do you always say it doesn't matter?
It's infuriating.

289
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,359
I'm the one messing everything up
right now.

290
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:14,027
I'm a wreck.

291
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:16,163
Acting like nothing matters,

292
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:17,931
wasn't it actually you who gave up first?

293
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,811
Yoo Ri.

294
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:36,516
I...

295
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:39,419
I lost you too.

296
00:27:42,923 --> 00:27:44,124
It's still so vivid.

297
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,662
Every night you saw me falling apart,

298
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:52,532
you went to work out at dawn
like you were escaping.

299
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:53,733
Seeing that,

300
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:56,369
"Is he actually some kind of sociopath?"

301
00:28:00,073 --> 00:28:01,007
Yeah.

302
00:28:02,442 --> 00:28:03,743
You must've felt suffocated.

303
00:28:05,912 --> 00:28:07,447
You must've been struggling too.

304
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:11,485
If at least you could breathe a little,
that was good.

305
00:28:14,855 --> 00:28:17,924
I thought things would get better
that way.

306
00:28:20,794 --> 00:28:21,761
But...

307
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:24,898
you were running away.

308
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:28,668
The man who wouldn't even change
a bathroom light bulb...

309
00:28:29,002 --> 00:28:30,637
no matter how many months I asked,

310
00:28:30,837 --> 00:28:32,639
suddenly doing laundry
and buying vitamins?

311
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,975
Why now?

312
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:38,812
Because that's all I can do.

313
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:42,482
You just...

314
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,919
did laundry
because you didn't want to face it.

315
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:48,922
The car wash,
the interim payment, everything.

316
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:49,923
I was scared.

317
00:28:56,396 --> 00:28:58,632
I was even scared to say I was scared.

318
00:29:01,935 --> 00:29:04,871
I didn't know how to say it to you.

319
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:09,576
I thought I'd ruin everything.

320
00:29:10,844 --> 00:29:12,712
I was afraid you'd regret all of it.

321
00:29:15,382 --> 00:29:16,283
I regret it.

322
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:22,756
I should've said I needed you.

323
00:29:26,126 --> 00:29:28,128
That I really hated you.

324
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:32,566
That I was in so much pain.

325
00:29:34,034 --> 00:29:35,602
We should've cried together.

326
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,706
I thought I couldn't fall apart.

327
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:42,642
That scared me the most.

328
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:44,411
You said...

329
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:49,015
you were scared.

330
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,618
Then...

331
00:29:53,386 --> 00:29:54,654
why did you leave me alone with that fear?

332
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:15,208
I'm sorry.

333
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:17,844
Now,

334
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:22,282
I want to stop hating you.

335
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:27,254
I hate myself for blaming you...

336
00:30:28,655 --> 00:30:29,589
all the time.

337
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:33,860
I hate that the most.

338
00:30:41,368 --> 00:30:42,402
I'm sorry.

339
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:46,940
Not "I'm sorry."

340
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:50,744
Can we...

341
00:30:53,146 --> 00:30:54,748
talk about something else,

342
00:30:58,018 --> 00:30:59,219
from now on?

343
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:19,906
Fall was short,

344
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:23,577
and we couldn't keep postponing
this moment forever.

345
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:27,380
Only after the crushing burden
of the interim payment...

346
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:30,684
and the resentment between us
finally ended...

347
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:33,420
were we able to cry together.

348
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:37,324
Only after crying for a long time...

349
00:31:38,358 --> 00:31:39,226
did we...

350
00:31:40,393 --> 00:31:42,329
accept a new season.

351
00:32:04,851 --> 00:32:07,687
It's been a while since we changed cars,
but there's not a single scratch.

352
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,589
We bought it because it's sturdy.

353
00:32:11,424 --> 00:32:12,926
You said an SUV was your dream car.

354
00:32:15,662 --> 00:32:17,197
I lied. I just wanted to look good
in front of you.

355
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:18,965
Then what?

356
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:21,301
A Ferrari?

357
00:32:23,603 --> 00:32:24,704
Guess I was fooled.

358
00:32:34,314 --> 00:32:36,082
After washing the car,

359
00:32:37,317 --> 00:32:38,819
I think I'm getting hungry too.

360
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:53,467
It's an apartment,
but you don't have much furniture.

361
00:32:57,838 --> 00:32:58,972
- Thank you.
- Yes.

362
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:08,715
Mom, Dad must've farted.

363
00:33:08,715 --> 00:33:10,083
It smells like ginkgo.

364
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,986
What did you say, Yeol?

365
00:33:14,254 --> 00:33:15,255
Come here.

366
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:20,760
We broke up,

367
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,395
and the apartment remained.

368
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,865
And one more thing.

369
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:27,634
The farther we drifted apart,

370
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:30,904
the more we wanted to keep smiling,
for longer.

371
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:33,340
That was...

372
00:33:34,207 --> 00:33:36,409
the unconditional feeling
we managed to protect...

373
00:33:37,377 --> 00:33:39,079
at the end of that fall.

374
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:57,998
Even now, sometimes,

375
00:33:58,765 --> 00:34:00,300
there are moments
when I still like you, honey.

376
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,805
I know.

377
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
