(Kang Han Na, Kim Min Gue)

3
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:40,192
("A Very Old First Love")

4
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,708
I was only going to read a few pages.

5
00:01:36,949 --> 00:01:38,450
("A Promise to You")

6
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,219
("Did you write these lyrics?"
"Yeah.")

7
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:41,854
("That's a nice title."
"It's nothing special.")

8
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:43,255
("No, it's really good.")

9
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:57,403
("A Promise to You")

10
00:01:57,403 --> 00:02:00,339
(No search results for "A Promise to You")

11
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:09,849
("A Promise to You")

12
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:12,117
(No search results for "A Promise to You")

13
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:17,923
So I guess it really is a song
that doesn't exist.

00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:22,421
(A Soundtrack Like No Other)

17
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:25,825
<i>What I used to know</i>

18
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:31,864
<i>Everything's all changed</i>

19
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:36,302
<i>Since I met you</i>

20
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:46,312
<i>I don't know why I'm this way</i>

21
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:50,816
<i>Nothing's the same</i>

22
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:55,721
<i>Because of you</i>

23
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:02,027
<i>Someone, feels like it's controlling me</i>

24
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:05,731
This song was made by a woman
who had endured a long, unrequited love...

25
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:09,368
to finally confess her feelings...

26
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:12,304
in the novel I wrote.

27
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,841
So...

28
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:19,645
this was originally a song
that doesn't exist in this world.

29
00:04:22,948 --> 00:04:25,851
I truly enjoyed reading your novel,

30
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,419
"A Very Old First Love."

31
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:32,625
The story of two people who silently
loved each other for 20 years...

32
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,693
shook me deeply.

33
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:39,498
The tenderness of them
circling one another,

34
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:43,102
and the feelings they kept unspoken
for each other, felt especially poignant,

35
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:46,038
And that's why it felt
like an even deeper kind of love.

36
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,142
I really wanted to hear
the music mentioned in the novel,

37
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,545
but it turns out
the song doesn't actually exist.

38
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:54,780
If it's not an imposition,

39
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:56,982
I wanted to try creating it myself.

40
00:04:57,716 --> 00:04:59,718
Please think of it
as a reader's response...

41
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:02,087
from someone who studies music.

42
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:06,592
Sincerely, Park Yoo Shin.

43
00:05:18,537 --> 00:05:21,540
("A Very Old First Love")

44
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:26,378
I thought no one would ever notice.

45
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:36,322
- I'll be back.
- Good luck.

46
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:40,659
No way. Isn't that basically a proposal?

47
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,997
How did you jump to the conclusion?

48
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:47,566
I mean, come on, anyone would hear that...

49
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,469
as "I'm interested in you."

50
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,205
The book didn't even sell many copies.

51
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:56,976
How did he find your email address?

52
00:05:56,976 --> 00:05:58,978
It was written on the book flap.

53
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:01,380
The flap?

54
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,648
I knew it.

55
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:04,016
Your profile photo's there too.

56
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:06,018
All moody and atmospheric.

57
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:08,621
You were super pretty back then.

58
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:11,524
I've never even taken a profile photo.

59
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:13,225
Really?

60
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,228
So he really contacted you
just because he liked the novel?

61
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:19,698
So he understands how two people
could like each other for 20 years...

62
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:22,268
without ever confessing?

63
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:24,203
That kind of foolish thing?

64
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:27,373
I guess so.

65
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,642
My goodness.

66
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,710
Wait.

67
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,913
Then never saying
"I love you" the whole time,

68
00:06:33,913 --> 00:06:35,748
and then the moment
he gets a terminal diagnosis,

69
00:06:36,782 --> 00:06:40,252
he goes, "Actually,
I've loved you for a long time."

70
00:06:40,252 --> 00:06:41,554
That makes sense to him?

71
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:46,492
"What? Actually, you were
also my true love all along."

72
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:47,493
That kind of thing?

73
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,062
Was it really that bad?

74
00:06:50,062 --> 00:06:51,297
Of course.

75
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:53,232
What was he doing
when he was strong and healthy?

76
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,035
If it were me, I'd never accept that.

77
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:00,506
If he hid his feelings to the end,
then I'd call that love.

78
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:04,443
If he left her a 1.4-million-dollar
apartment as an inheritance,

79
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,911
then I'd totally call that love.

80
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:09,782
Good thing I quit.

81
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:12,551
I can't even convince my friend
and you're this worked up.

82
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,186
Well,

83
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,388
even so,

84
00:07:17,156 --> 00:07:19,625
someone who truly understood...

85
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,494
your intention and emotional arc appeared.

86
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:23,996
That's the whole point of this.

87
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,464
Isn't it?

88
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:28,434
You sure can talk.

89
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:30,402
Hey.

90
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:33,172
Hey, Jung Ji Eum, where are you going?
Wait for me.

91
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:43,182
(I received your email.)

92
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:51,123
(The best reader's response...)

93
00:07:55,694 --> 00:07:57,596
- Pass.
- Nice.

94
00:07:58,297 --> 00:07:59,198
Shoot.

95
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:01,734
Nice.

96
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:03,502
Hey, one point left.

97
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:04,470
Hurry.

98
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,839
- Hey, stop fighting.
- Hurry.

99
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,140
(You have received an email.)

100
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:10,509
- Play.
- I'll go in.

101
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:11,443
Hey, what are you doing?

102
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:13,712
Hey, what are you doing? Come on.

103
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:14,880
What? Where are you going, Yoo Shin?

104
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:17,049
Just keep playing.

105
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:20,920
Nice.

106
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:24,356
I received your email.

107
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,492
It was the best reader's response.

108
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:31,464
The protagonist's choice in the novel
didn't receive much support.

109
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:34,767
But after listening to the song you sent,

110
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:37,870
I came to think
that maybe that doesn't really matter.

111
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:41,574
Thanks to you, I felt a little happier.

112
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:45,144
I hope today is a happy day
for you too, Yoo Shin.

113
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:46,445
Sincerely, Jung Ji Eum.

114
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:48,547
What are you doing?

115
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:50,149
Go on.

116
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:55,654
Guys, something urgent came up,
so I'm leaving. Sorry.

117
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:57,590
- Hey, where are you going?
- Hey, Park Yoo Shin.

118
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:00,759
P.S.

119
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,895
For a song Ha Rin made,

120
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:05,131
I thought it felt a little sad.

121
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:09,869
But Ha Rin, who chose love,
must have been happy.

122
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:28,387
You once said...

123
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:32,124
that after you came to like that person,

124
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,494
there wasn't a single moment
you were unhappy.

125
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:47,573
Thinking only from my own point of view,
I forgot that.

126
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:52,244
When will I be able
to read your next work?

127
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:56,482
I'm really looking forward
to how wonderful your next story will be.

128
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:13,132
Unfortunately,
I'm not writing novels at the moment.

129
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:17,703
There wasn't any particular reason
I stopped writing.

130
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:21,273
I just suddenly realized...

131
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,642
that I needed more experiences...

132
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:26,645
and more heart.

133
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:30,850
That realization
didn't make me depressed or sad.

134
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:34,954
Not everyone with talent
ends up using it that way,

135
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:38,524
and I think it's better
than spending your whole life...

136
00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:41,060
not knowing whether you had
that talent or not.

137
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:44,130
When I die,

138
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,765
I want to fully know...

139
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,801
what kind of things I was good at.

140
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:50,970
"Actually,"

141
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,340
"this line is from a movie I like?"

142
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:02,715
("Where the Light Fell")

143
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:14,827
Is it really fate?

144
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,768
No.

145
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:25,571
This is far too famous for that.

146
00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:36,115
(Unfortunately,
I'm not writing novels at the moment.)

147
00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:39,618
- Hey, Yoo Shin, you're early.
- Hi, Yoo Shin.

148
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:41,420
- Hey.
- Hi.

149
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,421
How unexpected.

150
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,991
I can't believe you're not late today.

151
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:47,459
I stayed up all night.

152
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:48,928
Gaming?

153
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:50,429
No.

154
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:55,034
Don't tell me you were working.

155
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:57,269
No way.

156
00:11:58,204 --> 00:11:59,905
I had a sudden meetup with my guildmates.

157
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:02,107
I drank way too much.

158
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,644
Aren't you scared...

159
00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:08,180
about meeting strangers like that?

160
00:12:09,215 --> 00:12:10,149
Hey.

161
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:13,118
Even if I look like I live carelessly,

162
00:12:13,118 --> 00:12:14,787
I'm actually very thorough.

163
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:18,390
I check their background in advance,
and figure out their personality.

164
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,391
I do all of that.

165
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,494
And what else do you check?

166
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:22,862
Next is...

167
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:24,763
their face.

168
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:27,600
So if they're ugly, you won't meet them?

169
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:30,970
Honestly,
you can chat endlessly in writing,

170
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,571
but meeting in person is
completely different.

171
00:12:35,407 --> 00:12:36,308
I see.

172
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,082
My concern these days is...

173
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,019
putting sincerity into my songs.

174
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:50,723
"If you speak in the tongues of men
or of angels,

175
00:12:51,423 --> 00:12:55,594
but do not have love,
I am only a clanging cymbal."

176
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:58,297
Do you know this saying?

177
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:01,333
Not becoming a cymbal.

178
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,836
That's my goal.

179
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:07,406
When I played you the song I made before,

180
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:10,042
you said that for a song Ha Rin made,

181
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,479
it felt a little sad.

182
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,148
Hearing that,

183
00:13:16,816 --> 00:13:18,784
it felt like my head cleared.

184
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:21,587
Like I'd found a clue...

185
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:23,856
to escaping being a cymbal.

186
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:28,060
So I tried making a new song.

187
00:13:28,461 --> 00:13:31,130
Would you listen to it?

188
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,198
(Send)

189
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:15,875
<i>With my eyes closed</i>

190
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:20,746
<i>Following the path already written</i>

191
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:27,520
<i>I try walking toward you</i>

192
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:33,259
<i>With every single letter</i>

193
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:37,997
<i>The feelings come through</i>

194
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:44,670
<i>With steps that never end</i>

195
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,645
<i>Slowly, right now, toward you</i>

196
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:57,483
<i>In every way</i>

197
00:14:59,285 --> 00:15:02,788
<i>No matter what we are</i>

198
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:07,459
<i>We'll stay as one through love</i>

199
00:15:11,163 --> 00:15:15,034
<i>Someone that's true</i>

200
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:20,105
<i>I'll be the one for you</i>

201
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:27,947
<i>Forever, and I will promise you</i>

202
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:50,369
I've been thinking about it,

203
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:55,274
and I think I really enjoy
talking with you, Ji Eum.

204
00:15:57,943 --> 00:15:59,778
So I worked up a bit of courage.

205
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,821
This is my messenger ID.

206
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:14,093
I thought asking for your number
might feel like too much.

207
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:19,131
It's okay if you don't want to.

208
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,402
We can keep talking by email
like we are now.

209
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:30,676
Think it over and reach out if you'd like.

210
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:40,586
It's hot.

211
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:49,829
P.S.

212
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:54,767
It'll be way more fun than emailing.

213
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:56,702
I really mean it.

214
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,898
You should silence your phone
in the library.

215
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:27,032
What are you saying?

216
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:36,475
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

217
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:45,084
Hi, Mr. Cymbals.

218
00:17:51,457 --> 00:17:52,224
Sorry.

219
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:56,929
It's here.

220
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:06,539
(Park Yoo Shin)

221
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:10,342
Yes! I'm the cymbal who's trying his best.

222
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:11,577
Your drink is ready.

223
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:13,913
Thank you.

224
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:18,217
At this hour, you may be at work.

225
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:20,953
If you don't mind me asking,

226
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:23,222
what do you do?

227
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:29,061
I work at an arboretum.

228
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:35,067
Have you always liked plants?

229
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:38,437
They felt familiar to me.

230
00:18:38,437 --> 00:18:40,606
My father worked in horticulture.

231
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:45,277
What about you, Yoo Shin?

232
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:47,413
When did you start doing music?

233
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:52,685
I decided in middle school.

234
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:55,588
I once went to karaoke with my parents.

235
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:58,357
When my mom sang,

236
00:18:58,924 --> 00:19:02,661
my dad looked at her
like a boy with a crush.

237
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:04,630
That's when it started.

238
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,284
What about you?

239
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:27,153
What do you do in your free time?

240
00:19:30,422 --> 00:19:31,991
I go out to eat good food.

241
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:34,894
What do you like?

242
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:37,696
Spicy rice cakes.

243
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,233
I once went all the way to Busan
just for them.

244
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:43,602
By train?

245
00:19:43,602 --> 00:19:44,637
By train.

246
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:49,475
Was there a guy who made
your heart flutter sitting next to you?

247
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:02,021
Unfortunately, no.

248
00:20:03,756 --> 00:20:05,024
Sounds like you were hoping
there might be.

249
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:07,827
A little.

250
00:20:08,928 --> 00:20:11,297
More like, "That'd be nice."

251
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:14,700
I've always dreamed...

252
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:17,770
that the woman sitting next to me...

253
00:20:18,037 --> 00:20:20,339
would be my intensely fated destiny.

254
00:20:21,774 --> 00:20:23,175
Does it have to be that intense?

255
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:26,512
Yes, an ordinary destiny won't do.

256
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:28,214
I'm a hardcore believer in destiny.

257
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:33,219
I'll keep that in mind,
Mr. Hardcore-Destiny Cymbals.

258
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:42,728
When do you think it started for us?

259
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:47,633
If even this conversation right now...

260
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:50,803
is part of some great current of fate,

261
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:56,842
when did it begin?

262
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:00,012
Well,

263
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,382
when do you think?

264
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:08,621
At first,

265
00:21:09,522 --> 00:21:12,191
I thought it started when I emailed you.

266
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,395
But the more I thought about it,

267
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,131
I think it goes back even further.

268
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,636
From when you made the song?

269
00:21:24,503 --> 00:21:25,404
No.

270
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:28,607
From when you wrote the novel.

271
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:31,777
If that novel hadn't existed,

272
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:34,747
none of this would have happened.

273
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:39,518
Then,

274
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,622
I guess I'm the one who reached out first.

275
00:21:45,357 --> 00:21:46,392
And you did it...

276
00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:49,829
with dreamlike tenderness.

277
00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:11,183
(And you did it
with dreamlike tenderness.)

278
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:14,854
Seems like he doesn't realize...

279
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:17,089
that he's the more dreamlike one.

280
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,694
(The sentences that made me)

281
00:22:21,694 --> 00:22:23,996
(Novel study notes)

282
00:22:23,996 --> 00:22:26,031
(Practice drafts notebook)

283
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:35,074
(AI columbarium?)

284
00:22:38,077 --> 00:22:39,778
(City-unfamiliar-both strange and new)

285
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:41,480
(City-loneliness-
but is everyone lonely in the city?)

286
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:32,298
Receiving encouragement
from someone I've never met.

287
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:37,069
Talking about movies we love.

288
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:40,706
Telling each other what we ate today.

289
00:23:43,642 --> 00:23:45,544
Sharing hints we never meant to give,

290
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:49,014
and answers we never even asked for.

291
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,987
Then saying, "Let's talk more tomorrow."

292
00:23:55,754 --> 00:23:57,223
Tomorrow.

293
00:23:57,957 --> 00:24:01,794
And like that, day by day, we became
part of each other's everyday lives.

294
00:24:02,962 --> 00:24:04,130
Did you get off work?

295
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,565
I'm trying out being a working adult
right now.

296
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,535
Why try out such a harsh trial?

297
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:21,580
How does that work?

298
00:24:22,982 --> 00:24:24,416
You know how in dramas,

299
00:24:25,217 --> 00:24:28,521
when the leads are troubled
or in a serious situation,

300
00:24:29,388 --> 00:24:31,357
they drink coffee on a rooftop...

301
00:24:31,357 --> 00:24:32,892
and suddenly everything clears up,

302
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:35,594
and the situation turns around?

303
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:42,101
I'm trying that out...

304
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:43,569
to see if it works for me too.

305
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,308
Is something wrong?

306
00:24:51,777 --> 00:24:53,245
Nothing serious,

307
00:24:53,646 --> 00:24:55,648
but there's something
I've been worrying about for a while,

308
00:24:55,648 --> 00:24:56,882
and it's quite frustrating.

309
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,320
What do you do when you're worried?

310
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,293
I think I just act first.

311
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,863
Whatever I'm thinking,
"Should I try this?"

312
00:25:10,863 --> 00:25:12,198
I just do it.

313
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,135
You have to act first
to fix things or clean them up.

314
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:18,103
That's how you move on to the next stage.

315
00:25:19,772 --> 00:25:23,075
If there's something floating around
in your head, Yoo Shin,

316
00:25:23,075 --> 00:25:24,710
just go for it.

317
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,381
Just go for it.

318
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:34,353
Go for it.

319
00:25:40,025 --> 00:25:41,327
(I'm ready too.)

320
00:25:41,327 --> 00:25:42,862
(I think I can start again.)

321
00:25:56,108 --> 00:25:57,710
Do you want to talk on the phone?

322
00:25:58,244 --> 00:25:59,278
I'll wait.

323
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:32,211
(Jung Ji Eum)

324
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:34,246
Hi.

325
00:26:44,523 --> 00:26:47,660
I wasn't expecting a video call.

326
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:50,062
Now that I think about it,

327
00:26:50,062 --> 00:26:52,064
I know what you look like, Yoo Shin,
but you don't.

328
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:11,917
You're right, Ji Eum.

329
00:27:13,752 --> 00:27:17,256
Even if it fails,
just going for it head-on...

330
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:19,725
seems like the right choice.

331
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,662
Can I ask what you're planning to do?

332
00:27:26,565 --> 00:27:28,534
I want to find out...

333
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:31,537
whether I'm still just a cymbal or not.

334
00:27:34,406 --> 00:27:35,341
Sounds good.

335
00:27:37,343 --> 00:27:39,411
Whether you're a cymbal or an angel,

336
00:27:39,678 --> 00:27:41,514
I'll do my best to find out.

337
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,417
What do I need to do?

338
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,558
I made a song...

339
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:54,994
out of the things we talked about.

340
00:27:56,395 --> 00:27:57,396
I'll play it for you.

341
00:28:26,091 --> 00:28:28,194
<i>Love with you</i>

342
00:28:29,762 --> 00:28:33,199
<i>Wherever you go, come with you</i>

343
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:39,071
<i>Always by your side</i>

344
00:28:40,372 --> 00:28:43,909
<i>Till the end of everything</i>

345
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:49,014
<i>Love with you</i>

346
00:28:50,616 --> 00:28:54,286
<i>Wherever you are, come with you</i>

347
00:28:55,988 --> 00:29:00,092
<i>Stay close by your side</i>

348
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:05,064
<i>Till the end of everything</i>

349
00:29:06,532 --> 00:29:09,635
<i>Oh, I need you</i>

350
00:29:11,437 --> 00:29:16,108
<i>'Cause all my love is with you</i>

351
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:20,980
<i>Thinking of you</i>

352
00:29:22,214 --> 00:29:26,252
<i>Thinking of you</i>

353
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:31,490
<i>I'm thinking of you</i>

354
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:38,664
<i>I'm thinking of you</i>

355
00:30:03,222 --> 00:30:04,156
Do you...

356
00:30:05,357 --> 00:30:06,592
want to go on a trip with me?

357
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:13,566
I want to see the ocean,

358
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,036
and I'm craving spicy rice cakes too.

359
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:21,507
Then,

360
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:24,310
by train?

361
00:30:26,745 --> 00:30:27,880
By train.

362
00:30:32,151 --> 00:30:33,118
Would it be okay...

363
00:30:34,653 --> 00:30:36,322
if I sat next to you?

364
00:30:42,328 --> 00:30:45,331
Doesn't that sound fun? Intensely.

365
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:49,802
Then,

366
00:30:51,437 --> 00:30:53,139
three hours from now...

367
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:54,006
One hour.

368
00:30:56,509 --> 00:30:57,776
I mean,

369
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:02,481
if it takes too long,
you might regret it for no reason,

370
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:05,684
and then start hesitating,
wondering if you should go at all.

371
00:31:06,785 --> 00:31:07,920
So what I'm saying is...

372
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,787
Okay.

373
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,391
One hour.

374
00:31:14,126 --> 00:31:17,763
Let's meet at Seoul Station in one hour.

375
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:20,733
Okay.

376
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,067
Don't be late.

377
00:31:23,636 --> 00:31:24,503
Okay.

378
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:39,385
(Video call ends)

379
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:04,410
Taxi.

380
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:07,213
Taxi.

381
00:32:07,913 --> 00:32:08,814
Taxi.

382
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:15,087
Hello. To Seoul Station, please.

383
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:20,059
Looking back,

384
00:32:20,793 --> 00:32:23,429
it was the most impulsive choice
of my life.

385
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:27,399
So much so that I wondered...

386
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:30,336
if excitement had completely
short-circuited my brain.

387
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:39,845
It was, quite literally, nothing but love.

388
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:44,517
It suddenly rushed out from the alley.

389
00:32:49,788 --> 00:32:51,624
Sir, I'll get off here.

390
00:33:19,652 --> 00:33:23,155
Just as I'd hoped, a trend was beginning.

391
00:33:38,204 --> 00:33:41,040
A huge trend
that existed only between the two of us.

392
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:49,648
I'm sorry.

393
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:31,757
Hi.

394
00:34:32,591 --> 00:34:33,559
Angel.

395
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:50,876
(Love conquers all.)

396
00:34:50,876 --> 00:34:55,648
- (So let us believe in love too.
- Vergilius)

397
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,305
What do you think love is?

398
00:35:57,376 --> 00:35:58,244
That was unexpected.

399
00:35:58,244 --> 00:35:59,278
- You go first.
- You go first.

400
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:00,613
I said it first, so you go.

401
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:01,747
You go first.

402
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:05,451
They're in love.

403
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:07,286
Should we ask AI?

404
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:09,021
Yeah.

405
00:36:09,321 --> 00:36:10,789
Love is...

406
00:36:12,224 --> 00:36:14,593
Wait, I think I left the gas stove on.

407
00:36:15,461 --> 00:36:16,829
One, two, three.

408
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:17,763
- Number of stars.
- Number of stars.

409
00:36:18,697 --> 00:36:20,766
I thought we wouldn't match again.

410
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:26,071
Why are your hands shaking?

411
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:30,743
Hey, Kim Min Ji.

412
00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:33,712
Love?

413
00:36:34,346 --> 00:36:37,716
Oxytocin, dopamine, serotonin.

414
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:40,586
Some kind of wild cocktail
of these hormones, I think.

415
00:36:43,189 --> 00:36:44,290
Being together.

416
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:47,927
Showing someone your weaknesses.

417
00:36:47,927 --> 00:36:50,029
For me, love is...

418
00:36:52,264 --> 00:36:54,733
I suddenly feel like crying.

419
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:56,569
Wait, sorry.

420
00:36:58,871 --> 00:36:59,872
It's...

421
00:37:01,874 --> 00:37:04,009
about being someone's Sailor Moon.

422
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:06,612
Realizing that the other person...

423
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:07,980
is someone who truly sparkles.

424
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,949
Wanting to see them every day.

425
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:11,617
When you're worn out and exhausted,

426
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:14,053
just thinking of them brings comfort.

427
00:37:14,053 --> 00:37:17,223
This good food and these warm words.

428
00:37:17,223 --> 00:37:18,457
Isn't that enough?

429
00:37:18,457 --> 00:37:22,394
Something you hope you'll win
at least once in life,

430
00:37:22,394 --> 00:37:23,562
like a housing lottery.

431
00:37:23,762 --> 00:37:24,897
Something that sweeps in...

432
00:37:25,931 --> 00:37:28,033
and carries you away helplessly,

433
00:37:28,868 --> 00:37:30,002
yet none of it...

434
00:37:30,803 --> 00:37:32,338
feels unpleasant at all.

435
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,009
Are you in love
with the person next to you?

436
00:37:38,577 --> 00:37:40,179
Love, my foot.

437
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:41,914
I was in love.

438
00:37:41,914 --> 00:37:44,083
I was, once.

439
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:46,685
I want to stab
those rose-colored glasses...

440
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:48,387
I was wearing back then.

441
00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:49,989
Still, don't stab. It hurts.

442
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:53,125
Someday,

443
00:37:54,693 --> 00:37:56,228
I hope I can love again.

444
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:00,432
Very much.

445
00:38:03,135 --> 00:38:04,069
Yes.

446
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:10,442
Interview over.

447
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,245
You worked so hard, even on the interview.

448
00:38:13,245 --> 00:38:15,614
I'm really looking forward
to your new novel.

449
00:38:16,382 --> 00:38:17,883
Me too.

450
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,320
Should we turn it off now?

451
00:38:26,325 --> 00:38:29,736
What will the title be?

452
00:38:29,737 --> 00:38:32,845
"Play Your Love."

453
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:33,993
"Love : Track."

454
00:38:33,994 --> 00:38:37,123
(Love : Track)

455
00:38:37,124 --> 00:38:39,124
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
