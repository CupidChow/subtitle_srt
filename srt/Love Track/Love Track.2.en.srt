00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:30,988
Yes, I'm here.

3
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:33,257
I'm near the studio you mentioned.

4
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,527
I'm sorry, Ms. Han. I might be a bit late.

5
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:39,230
It's okay. Take your time.

6
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,600
Everyone said they'd go straight
to the restaurant for the reservation.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,968
Let's meet there.

8
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:47,638
There's still some time
before the reservation.

9
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:50,741
I think I'll look around here for a bit.

10
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:53,511
But I didn't know
there was a place like this here.

11
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,846
The person who runs that place...

12
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:58,049
used to live in that neighborhood
before studying abroad.

13
00:00:59,383 --> 00:01:01,185
I see.

14
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:04,121
This place has a nice vibe.

15
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,758
Right.
Didn't you live around there too, Ms. Han?

16
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:09,160
I did.

17
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,961
But I haven't been back in a while.

18
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:14,131
Okay, be careful on your way.

19
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,599
Okay.

20
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,444
Welcome.

21
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:28,746

27

Stop right there.

28
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,278
What's his problem?

29
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:14,251
We weren't close,

30
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:17,955

35
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:47,385
Don't say anything unnecessary to him.

Hey, answer me.

39
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:09,006
I said answer me.

40
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:11,242
You told me not to say
anything unnecessary.

41
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,553
Let me borrow your MP3 today.

42
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,654

Did everyone have good dreams today,
as always?

Yes.

47
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:44,608
Okay.

48
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:48,112
If you're not staying for night study,
don't stay and kill the mood.

49
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:50,815
Go straight home or to your academy.

50
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:52,650

All right.

55
00:04:58,789 --> 00:04:59,623

Hey, Hyun Ha, let's go.

59
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,801
Yeah.

60
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:46,470
My Young Seo?

61
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:51,542
Young Seo says she's going
to the elite universities, of course.

62
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:56,180
Which major? Law school anyway.

63
00:05:57,214 --> 00:05:58,049
Yeah.

64
00:05:58,749 --> 00:05:59,650
Yeah.

65
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:04,989
Right. There's no one like my Young Seo.

66
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,859
Okay. I'll treat you.

67
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:12,830
There's nothing to worry about with her.

68
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:45,429
Why do you only listen to heavy metal?

69
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:48,899
Because it makes things quiet.

70
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:51,869
What? Where did you put mine?

71
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:55,439
Is that why you smoke too?

72
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,312
- Hey.
- Let's switch for a while.

73
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:03,948
What kind of nonsense is that?
Stop messing around and give mine back.

74
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:05,416
I'm not messing around.

75

If you like things quiet, listen to it.

76
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:21,632
Quiet.

77
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:29,507
Is he gone?

78
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:30,675
Hey, hurry up.

79
00:07:33,477 --> 00:07:34,912

It wasn't bad.

86

That's it?

87
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,682
What more should I say?

88
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:55,786
I just mean there's a lot of variety...

89
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:58,356
including music and anything else.

90
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:00,624
Anything else?

91
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,464
In cigarettes, too,
there's regular and menthol.

Hey.

00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:08,966
You don't even have to smoke.

94
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:12,236
You keep bringing up cigarettes.
Is that your leverage?

95
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,838
There's no need to be defensive.

96
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:16,440
If you're going to threaten me,
just go report it.

97
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:19,777
Even if you do, I doubt
the homeroom teacher would believe you.

98
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,014
Why?

99
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:25,783
Because it's coming
from a delusional student?

100
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,332
Not even practical music, but composition.

101
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,869
Our school isn't an arts high school.

102
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:46,203
It's a regular high school.

103
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:47,972
You know that too, Hyun Ha.

104
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,042
I like classical music.

105
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,511
Why that, of all things?

106
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,183
Because it quiets my mind.

107
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:04,555
Still, it's too late.

108
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:06,357
It's almost delusional.

109
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:08,292
It's my dream.

110
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:12,329
Yeah, dreams are fine,

111
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,099
but if it doesn't work out...

112
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,468
Then it can't be helped.

113
00:11:19,203 --> 00:11:20,204
But still,

114
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:23,107
does that mean you shouldn't dream?

115
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,887
You're awful.

116
00:11:39,256 --> 00:11:40,257

117
00:11:41,092 --> 00:11:42,727

00:18:58,562 --> 00:19:01,298
- Mind your own business.
- This is actually great.

191
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,650
You all saw it
on your way to school, right?

192
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,785
Yes.

193
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,921
Beethoven made headlines.

194
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,495
Congratulations.

195
00:19:34,165 --> 00:19:37,635
Han Young Seo,
come to the counseling room later.

196
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,542
Louder.

197
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:58,055
Your September mock exam score
is basically your CSAT score, Young Seo.

198
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:00,558
At this level, you can assume...

199
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:02,360
you won't get into any of the universities
you're aiming for.

201
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:06,330

202
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:08,499
Do they know
your September mock exam score?

203
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:10,935
Hyun Ha, congrats.

204
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:12,703
I knew you'd make it.

205
00:20:12,703 --> 00:20:14,972
Hyun Ha, I didn't know you were that good.
This is huge.

206
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:17,108
They even hung a banner at school for you.

207
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,342
Did you see it hanging over there?

208
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,344
I knew you'd make it.

209
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,013
It's nothing, really.

210
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,215
Hey, how is this nothing?

211
00:20:24,215 --> 00:20:25,816
I'm proud of you, my friend.

(There is no end to learning.)

213
00:20:33,424 --> 00:20:34,859
Are things hard for you these days?

214
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:37,628
You're not mad at me?

215
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:39,697
Why would I be?

216
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,867
You've always managed well on your own,

217
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,770
so I think it's my fault
for not paying closer attention.

218
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:48,606
It's not your fault, Mom.

219
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:52,710
I'm the one who's sorry
for disappointing you.

220
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:58,315
I'm not disappointed.

221
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:04,288
I know you'll do much better
in the real thing.

222
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:19,804
Don't do anything today. Just rest.

223
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,074
Go change and come out.
I'll make you something good.

224
00:21:23,774 --> 00:21:24,742
Okay.

226
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,114
Hey, how long is that thing
going to stay up?

227
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,015
I don't know.

228
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:06,384
It's kind of embarrassing
every time I walk into school.

229
00:22:07,084 --> 00:22:09,353
It'll probably still be up next year,
even after graduation.

230
00:22:09,353 --> 00:22:10,221
Exactly.

231
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:11,989
What about the CSAT?

232
00:22:13,057 --> 00:22:14,025
I gave up.

233
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:17,495
Hey, Han Young...

234
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,320
The owner of the laundromat
by the back gate filed a complaint.

235
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:46,657
They say there's still a student...

236
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,926
smoking in the alley
in front of the laundromat.

237
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,028
Therefore,

238
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:55,666
I will now conduct a bag check.

239
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:00,337
Freeze.

240
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:04,542
Starting from the first row.

241
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,785
Jae Hyung, you need to shave your head.

242
00:23:23,994 --> 00:23:25,763
What's this?

243
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,406
Ki Hyun Ha, is this yours?

244
00:23:43,814 --> 00:23:44,749
Yes.

Yes, sir.

248
00:24:13,511 --> 00:24:15,613
In the end, I couldn't find the courage.

249
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,582
And like winter arriving without warning,

250
00:24:19,884 --> 00:24:22,987

00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:32,463
- let's hope you guess well.
- I'll do my best.

255

- Okay.
- Thank you.

stay calm, and you'll be fine.

267
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:05,996
Why?

268
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:08,466
Is studying until the last day
too important to waste time on me?

269
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:11,102
Yeah, so hurry up.

signing me up for something like that?

276

does that mean everything's settled?

For me, yeah.

278

282

283
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,011
not to say unnecessary things.

of achieving anything,

He didn't want to dampen the mood
before the CSAT,

305
00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:00,438
so he left without telling anyone.

306
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,708
