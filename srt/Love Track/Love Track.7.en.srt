1
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,792
Well, yeah, that could work,

2
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,094
but isn't there a more flexible option?

3
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:29,629
Right.

4
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,465
Product reviews?

5
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,769
But those are subjective opinions.
They're not data.

6
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:38,271
Then what would you suggest?

7
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,974
Yes, ratings. Things like that.

8
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,611
I'd like a report based on numbers,
like conversion rates.

9
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,447
What I want is...

10
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,516
evidence everyone can agree on.

11
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,352
(Stardam Coffee)

12
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,454
Yes, exactly. Don't overthink it.

13
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,224
We just look at the numbers
and make a call.

14
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,094
Because numbers, at least,

15
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,997
don't betray you.

16
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,598
Let's talk again tomorrow.

17
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,070
(The Tasty 2025)

18
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,374
Five stars aren't only good
for stone beds.

19
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,911
These ratings, decided by the majority...

20
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,380
have dramatically reduced...

21
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,582
the time and energy
spent by busy modern people.

22
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:39,299
(STARLOVE blind date begins
in 10 minutes.)

23
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,569
Now applied even to people,

24
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,306
star ratings have become a powerful
barometer of Korea's dating market.

25
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,810
(Lee Joon)

26
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,111
(Bae Yoon Kyung)

27
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:54,881
We go through countless encounters
in life,

28
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,151
and connections,
every connection has a beginning.

29
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,621
- Through meeting and experience...
- Is this installation art?

30
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,224
I should post this on my Instagram.

31
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,258
Cool.

32
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:06,626
This is so cool.

33
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,161
Look at this. It's incredible.

34
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:11,931
How did they make this?

35
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,676
Sorry.

36
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,678
No, it's fine.

37
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,185
Birds of a feather flock together.

38
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,822
Five stars recognize five stars.

39
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,757
Excuse me.

40
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:39,792
Yes?

41
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,261
STARLOVE...

42
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,197
Honey.

43
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,033
Wait a second.

44
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,601
What did you say?

45
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,004
Well, nothing.

46
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:51,871
Sorry.

47
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:02,715
This.

48
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,617
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

49
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,119
Wasn't this an exhibition?

50
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,754
Jae Seong, let's clear this all out.

51
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:08,588
Yes.

52
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,491
This was trash?

53
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,328
STARLOVE, right?

54
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,365
Yes.

55
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,773
What?

56
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,517
Let's go.

57
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,586
The exhibition's on the third floor.

58
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,354
Why...

59
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:43,756
For a blind date.

60
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:01,975
(More Than Stars)

61
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,185
Since you suggested an exhibition hall,

62
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,021
were you expecting a more cultured look?

63
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,156
No, that's not it.

64
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,226
I mean, it kind of is.

65
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,395
Honestly, it is.

66
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,598
This place sets certain expectations.

67
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,501
And the timing too.
This is a bit unexpected.

68
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,470
Well, that's because...

69
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,171
I've been swamped day and night lately.

70
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,539
Lunch break works best for me.

71
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,444
And you need to meet on a weekday
and see how it feels...

72
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,546
to decide whether to see each other
on the weekend, right?

73
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,652
Are you an artist, by any chance?

74
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,654
Preparing for another exhibition?

75
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,656
No, I'm a wallpaper installer.

76
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,791
This place is my job site for two weeks.

77
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,427
I see.

78
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,266
Aren't you getting in?

79
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,003
The doors are closing.

80
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,180
Excuse me.

81
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,084
Isn't this kind of strange?

82
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,852
Having a blind date at your workplace.

83
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,555
My workplace is on the first floor.

84
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,058
And we're heading to the gallery
on the third floor for a blind date.

85
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,595
I get what you're saying,
but this is still a blind date.

86
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,763
From where I stand, it feels a bit...

87
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,933
You seemed
to really enjoy exhibitions earlier.

88
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,708
I'm Choi Ha Na.

89
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,078
Yes.

90
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,446
I'm Lee Kang Min.

91
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,450
Shall we check the rest of our profiles?

92
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,484
Sure.

93
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,097
Four point seven stars?

94
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,099
- Your rating...
- What's this?

95
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,171
Malfunction.

96
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,307
What?

97
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,074
What?

98
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,077
What? Why is it doing this?

99
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,380
I can't see anything.

100
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,347
Ms. Choi?

101
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,615
Ms. Choi!

102
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,319
(Under Inspection)

103
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,760
- Are you okay?
- What?

104
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,431
Yes, thank you.

105
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:44,137
Nothing today is going as expected.

106
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,141
This blind date
feels like a disaster movie.

107
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,744
A disaster movie?

108
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,015
Well, if it is,
you just wait to be rescued.

109
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,451
I think this is actually great.

110
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,854
It actually helps you focus on the date.

111
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,429
Should we call STARLOVE?

112
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:11,698
Why?

113
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,602
To ask why they matched
a five-star with a one-star?

114
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,805
Yes. This doesn't make sense.
They've never made a mistake like this.

115
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:22,742
A mistake?

116
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,010
What?

117
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,513
No, that's not what I meant.

118
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,783
It's just, this is my first time
meeting a one-star.

119
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,486
Right.

120
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,990
It's my first time
meeting a five-star too.

121
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,193
So are we not doing the blind date?

122
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,762
No, we are. We're doing it.

123
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,332
But how do you do a blind date...

124
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,468
in a dark elevator like this?

125
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,711
Why?

126
00:07:58,711 --> 00:07:59,679
Why...

127
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,149
- What?
- Come here.

128
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:04,984
Okay.

129
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,621
Poop that tastes like curry
versus curry that tastes like poop.

130
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,689
Which one would you rather eat?

131
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,158
You want to play
a would-you-rather game right now?

132
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,360
Lunch break's short.

133
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,895
If we want to get to know each other,
we have to be bold.

134
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,769
Curry-flavored poop, I guess.

135
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,405
Seriously?

136
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,306
Yes.

137
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,709
Then would you choose
poop-flavored curry, Ms. Choi?

138
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,944
Of course.

139
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,912
I'm eating curry.

140
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,050
What matters to me is what's real.

141
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,688
Okay, your turn, Mr. Lee.

142
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,427
Hurry. These things should be spontaneous.

143
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,235
Cha Eun Woo versus a billionaire.

144
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,036
Cha Eun Woo.

145
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,740
Is that even a question?

146
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,445
Cha Eun...

147
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,857
Okay, my turn now, right?

148
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,293
Yes.

149
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,798
Your standard for love.

150
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,467
Stars or feelings?

151
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,436
What are you, a teenager?
You fall in love just by feelings?

152
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,105
That's a bit...

153
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,240
Then you're saying you can love
based only on star ratings?

154
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,443
If I really had to choose,

155
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,580
yes. Because it's rational.

156
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,715
Let's see. There's education,

157
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,685
career, and lots of other factors.

158
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,921
And it includes
other people's evaluations too.

159
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,127
So you're the type
who trusts what others say.

160
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,095
But how did you get five stars?

161
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,364
Why? Does five stars seem strange?

162
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,699
Yes, it does.

163
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,670
Everyone rates you high,

164
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,639
but somehow dating is a no?

165
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,942
What are you talking about?
I was the one who said no.

166
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,012
Then how did you end up
with one star, Ms. Choi?

167
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,786
Why do you keep calling me a one-star?

168
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,187
What?

169
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,489
You round yours up.
Why do you round mine down?

170
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,091
I'm 1.7 stars.

171
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,228
Okay, fine.

172
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,067
But, Ms. Choi,

173
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,604
if you think ratings don't matter,
why use STARLOVE?

174
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,109
Meeting different people is fun.

175
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,646
STARLOVE is just a tool.

176
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,083
Mr. Lee.

177
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:54,287
Do you really think
you can judge someone by five stars?

178
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,325
Not exactly.

179
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,595
But numbers aren't meaningless either.

180
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,733
But when numbers come first,

181
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,668
people only see numbers.

182
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,403
Not people.

183
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,278
Is that coffee good?

184
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:29,322
You don't know food until you taste it,

185
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,524
and you don't know people
until you experience them.

186
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,402
Looks like our disaster movie
is reaching the end.

187
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,170
Seems like it.

188
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,575
Is everyone okay?

189
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,109
Yes, thank you.

190
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,682
Sorry.

191
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,183
- Take care.
- Thank you.

192
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:02,956
Are you okay?

193
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,525
You looked pretty startled earlier.

194
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,627
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

195
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,733
You're very calm, Ms. Choi.

196
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,135
About what?

197
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:20,106
About unexpected situations like these.

198
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:27,447
Just because something's unexpected
doesn't mean it's bad.

199
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,317
Sometimes it stays with you longer.

200
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,757
I enjoyed our disastrous blind date.

201
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,025
Take care.

202
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,896
Ms. Choi.

203
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,201
Aren't we going to see the exhibition?

204
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,910
Lunch break's over.

205
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,514
I see. Time flew.

206
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,951
Then take care.

207
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,123
Yes, Team Leader.

208
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,492
I'm here. I'm on my way.

(Bestseller Product Analysis)

212
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,155
But when numbers come first,

213
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,391
people only see numbers.

214
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,826
Not people.

215
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,298
Hey.

216
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,101
I heard you scrapped the data
for this promotion.

217
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,805
What's with you, Mr. Data?
You ditched numbers?

218
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:33,706
Well...

219
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,811
Hey, with gift sets,

220
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,414
the buyer and the user
are usually different, right?

221
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,248
Yeah.

222
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,449
So...

223
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,553
judging solely by figures or ratings
felt a bit off.

224
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,190
- She must've been pretty.
- What?

225
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,192
That one-star lady.

226
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,261
Ratings didn't mean anything.

227
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,996
What are you talking about? That's not it.

228
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:58,831
Really?

229
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,935
Then she must've been super pretty.

230
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,808
Right. I ran into Seo Hee.

231
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,811
Where?

232
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,149
Gongdeok.

233
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,351
She suggested dinner, the three of us.

234
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,620
There's no need.

235
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,489
Yeah, right. No need.

(STARLOVE
Your match's review has arrived.)

237

Hey, what is it?

238
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:43,576
Hey, I'm taking a half day off.

239
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:51,918
Excuse me.

240
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,227
You really came?

241
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,062
Why did I get one star?

242
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,299
What?

243
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,234
Why am I a one-star?

244
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,706
Sorry, everyone.

245
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:23,950
Sorry.

246
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,190
Did you really come all this way
just because of the rating?

247
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,959
"Just?"

248
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,396
Do you know how hard I worked
to make my rating five stars?

249
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,230
Excuse me.

250
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:41,200
I didn't give that score lightly.
I really thought it through.

251
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,170
Okay. So you didn't like me.

252
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,372
That's why I got one star. Is that right?

253
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,207
Yes.

254
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,610
Let's go on a second date.

255
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,579
A proper date this time.

256
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:56,983
Because of the rating?

257
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,522
As you can see, I'm pretty busy.

258
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,091
Hey, Chief Choi.

259
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,227
Hey.

260
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,230
What do we do?

261
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,198
I'm afraid you'll have
to swing by the Gongdeok site.

262
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:13,800
Gongdeok?

263
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:16,469
Who's he?

264
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,371
Nobody.

265
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,208
But why Gongdeok?
We wrapped that up last week.

266
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,043
I heard the final payment already came in.

267
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,779
Remember we left one room
unfinished back then?

268
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,415
The lady's been on the phone nonstop,
crying her eyes out.

269
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,417
What do we do? We can't really say no.

270
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,286
But right now?

271
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,587
By myself?

272
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,990
She says she'll pay quadruple.

273
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,025
Quadruple?

274
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,162
Still, how am I supposed to do this alone?

275
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,265
If you could at least send an assistant...

276
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,246
Excuse me.

277
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,715
Would you like to help out for the day?

278
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,084
No.

279
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,719
Careful.

280
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:08,855
Be careful.

281
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,125
But why are you so hung up on ratings?

282
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,829
Just because everyone else
gave five stars, do I have to do the same?

283
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,466
Isn't one star a bit harsh?

284
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,735
What did you dislike about me that much?

285
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,506
You said love is about ratings.

286
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,176
You see love as a résumé, Mr. Lee,

287
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,277
but I don't.

288
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,287
Love.

289
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:42,989
Love isn't something...

290
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:44,891
you can neatly measure...

291
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:48,161
like a task with numbers, right?

292
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,330
So what I'm saying is, love...

293
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,266
I mean...

294
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,713
I'll be honest with you.

295
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,817
I just wanted something to believe in,
even if it was a score.

296
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,257
Mr. Lee.

297
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,860
All this time,
while you were focused on ratings,

298
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,829
have you ever really looked at someone?

299
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,733
It just feels like...

300
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,301
you go on blind dates not for love,

301
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,169
but for the score, Mr. Lee.

302
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,474
I thought if I got good ratings,

303
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,144
love would follow naturally.

304
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,819
Then maybe now,
you can look at people, not numbers.

305
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,426
I'm right here.

306
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:05,738
You must be busy.

307
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:08,775
I'm really sorry.

308
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:11,644
No, it's okay.

309
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,248
So you're wallpapering the small room too?

310
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:17,984
Yes.

311
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,687
That room was left untouched,

312
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,189
which makes it harder.

313
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:32,265
(My mom)

314
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,246
This room...

315
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,848
used to be her son's room.

316
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,020
He died suddenly in an accident,

317
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,590
and she left the room
exactly as it was for over ten years.

318
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:00,960
Then...

319
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:04,497
she finally decided to remodel the house,

320
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,701
but said
she just couldn't touch this room.

321
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,573
So she decided to wallpaper it instead.

322
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,344
She must have hesitated a lot.

323
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:22,348
I think I understand how she felt.

324
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,055
(My mom)

325
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:42,468
The day I became
a certified wallpaper installer,

326
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,571
my mom passed away.

327
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:50,176
I had promised to do the wallpapering
for her once I get certified.

328
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,382
So I went back and forth,

329
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:01,120
wondering whether I should
go through with it or not.

330
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,458
But in the end, I just did it.

331
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,730
Covering old wallpaper...

332
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,498
doesn't erase longing.

333
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,870
But it does let you start a new story.

334
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,144
All right, let's get to work.

335
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:40,126
Hey.

336
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,594
What are you doing?

337
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,264
No, not like that. Just tear it off.

338
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:45,698
Wet it.

339
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,934
- Soak it.
- Water. Okay.

340
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:53,640
Okay, wallpaper's off.
I'm going to putty now.

341
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,348
I watched wallpapering videos.

342
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:03,917
I want to do this right.

343
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,758
This is really heavy.

344
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:18,331
No, not that one.
The big, white, round one.

345
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:19,299
That's not it.

346
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,734
That's not it?

347
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,969
No. Go back and get it again.

348
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:25,972
- Rock, paper...
- Scissors.

349
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:26,906
Hurry up and go.

350
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,451
This feels good.

351
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,321
You worked hard.

352
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:44,457
The others will finish the rest.

353
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:50,063
Ms. Choi.

354
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,466
Do you do partial wallpapering too?

355
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,536
There's a stain about this big
at my place.

356
00:23:58,171 --> 00:23:59,272
Of course.

357
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:01,474
What kind of stain?

358
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:02,842
Wine.

359
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,210
What?

360
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,385
Earlier,

361
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,455
you asked why I'm so obsessed
with ratings, right?

362
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,627
I...

363
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:23,129
once dated someone for three years.

364
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:25,565
One day,

365
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:29,202
she suggested we join STARLOVE
just for fun.

366
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,873
She got five stars.

367
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,476
And I got three.

368
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:38,578
And somehow,

369
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,114
after that day,

370
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:45,151
it felt like even the smallest things I do
were being graded.

371
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,020
I kept comparing myself to others.

372
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:51,057
Looking back,

373
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:55,061
I think I was always the one
falling short.

374
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:58,231
Eventually, we broke up.

375
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,901
Now I get it.

376
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:04,837
You had every reason
to give me one star, Ms. Choi.

377
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,151
If it hadn't been that one-star review,

378
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,821
we wouldn't have met again like this.

379
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:29,662
- Right?
- Yeah.

380
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,664
It's nice.

381
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:38,037
Come on, let's eat already.

382
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,306
We worked hard.
So let's eat something good.

383
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:42,175
But you said good places have a wait.

384
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:44,110
I'm starving. I can't wait.

385
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,112
- Good places naturally have a wait.
- No.

386
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:47,647
Then wait. I'll check the reviews.

387
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:48,648
Just a second.

388
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:50,950
- Why?
- If it tastes good, that's a good place.

389
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,918
Lee Kang Min?

390
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:01,027
Long time no see.

391
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:05,632
Hello.

392
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:12,872
It's been a while.

393
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,445
- Two oyster soup bowls, please.
- Yes.

394
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,519
Have you been well?

395
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,656
I was actually thinking of calling you.

396
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,392
Well, yeah.

397
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:38,331
That's unexpected.

398
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:40,967
I thought you hated places like this.

399
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:43,970
I used to.

400
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,639
I like them now.

401
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,182
I'm sorry, Kang Min.

402
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:00,887
Back then,

403
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,590
I was too calculating.

404
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:05,959
Always weighing things.

405
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:10,563
I thought you left...

406
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:12,899
because I wasn't enough,

407
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,735
because I fell short.

408
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:17,136
That wasn't it.

409
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:20,406
You didn't lose to anyone.

410
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,275
It's just...

411
00:27:23,276 --> 00:27:25,044
that my feelings changed.

412
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:27,547
And I used that as an excuse.

413
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:35,688
Seo Hee.

414
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,361
I think I knew that already.

415
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,564
I needed the excuse of ratings too.

416
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,367
It was easier...

417
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:50,136
than admitting your feelings had changed.

418
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:54,874
And...

419
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,510
I'm okay now.

420
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:02,382
I don't need excuses anymore.

421
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,299
Sorry to keep you waiting.

422
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,237
Wine?

423
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:33,279
If you even run into your ex here,

424
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,747
this place must be legit.

425
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:40,186
Just hurry and eat.

426
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,422
- Eat what? Nothing's out yet.
- You're right.

427
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,960
I don't know.
Just eat the chives, at least.

428
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,962
- This is so awkward.
- Of all the ways to meet...

429
00:28:48,962 --> 00:28:52,365
Then, falling in love in 100 days...

430
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:54,834
versus falling in love in five seconds.

431
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:58,471
Definitely five seconds. And you?

432
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,472
Definitely 100 days.

433
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,275
What are you, Ungnyeo?

434
00:29:02,275 --> 00:29:04,310
Even a bear becomes human in 100 days.

435
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,512
How can you fall in love in five seconds?

436
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,651
Some things are decided in an instant.

437
00:29:15,622 --> 00:29:16,489
We're here.

438
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,431
Thanks for today.

439
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,769
Drive safe.

440
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,639
You too, Mr. Lee.

441
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,681
Yes, it was good to see you too.

442
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,285
Ratings are just numbers.

443
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:46,920
Dinner's on me.

444
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,820
Hey, what are you doing?

445
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:52,091
Mental visualization.

446
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,660
I've got a blind date this evening.

447
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:57,664
Really?

448
00:29:58,932 --> 00:29:59,966
Wait.

449
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,669
Why have you been so quiet lately?

450
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,804
- STARLOVE?
- Yeah.

451
00:30:05,705 --> 00:30:06,806
I quit.

452
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:12,178
You quit STARLOVE?

453
00:30:12,612 --> 00:30:13,513
Why?

454
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:17,917
I don't need it anymore.

455
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:20,720
One-star?

456
00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:22,522
That lady...

457
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,357
must've been really pretty.

458
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:44,577
You scared me.

459
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,081
Second time,
and your posture's getting professional.

460
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:51,551
Just call me. I'm basically doing
the work of 100 people right now.

461
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:53,920
Anytime you need me,

462
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:55,688
just use me.

463
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,095
What about this?

464
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:05,798
Do you want to keep this?
Should I cut it out for you?

465
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:06,699
Yeah, cut it out for me.

466
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:08,801
Seriously?

467
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:11,337
What do you mean, seriously?
That was a joke.

468
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:14,007
Don't joke around.

469
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:15,875
Why are you holding a knife like that?

470
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,377
Let's just eat black bean sauce noodles.

471
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,412
- Noodles?
- Yeah.

472
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:24,317
I kind of want ramyun, though.

473
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:27,620
That was actually
a pretty dangerous thing to say.

474
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,290
You're trying to flirt with me,
aren't you?

475
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,059
What are you even thinking?

476
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,962
Come to think of it,
what do I usually think about?

477
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:38,031
- You're really strange.
- No, I mean...

478
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:39,365
What was wrong with what I said?

479
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:40,667
Wait a second, Ha Na.

480
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:41,768
Come here. I'll make you ramyun.

481
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:42,802
Don't.

482
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:45,038
What do you mean?
I said I'll make you ramyun.

483
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:46,072
I don't know.

Go away.

486
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:50,176
What kind of person did you think I was?

487
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:51,444
Let's just eat black bean sauce noodles.

488
00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:53,146
I think that thought is way stranger.

489
00:31:53,146 --> 00:31:55,481
Why is making ramyun such a big deal?

490
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,184
- Flirting, seriously?
- You were flirting.

491
00:31:58,184 --> 00:32:00,687
I just wanted ramyun.
