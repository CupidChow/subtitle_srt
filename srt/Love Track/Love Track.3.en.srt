00:01:25,173 --> 00:01:26,441
Have you already looked around?

00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:28,443

to feel a little wronged.

So why, damn it,

64
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,241
did you have to suggest tango
of all things?

65
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:49,377
Well, I heard the director
was learning tango, so...

66

Still, if I'd just landed it at the end,

67
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:57,085
you'd be getting promoted this time.
What a waste.

68
00:04:58,253 --> 00:04:59,554

on promotions lately?

It looks like Ha Ri's got that ready.

93
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:16,698
- Yes, as you told me,
- Look at the horse.

94
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:19,234

and let you know.

Yes, thank you.

98
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:30,578
So where are we going now?

99
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:34,749
Why do you always ask me?

100
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:35,884
Anywhere.

No.

106
00:06:57,272 --> 00:07:00,108

- Can you see?

108
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:05,847
I can't really see either.

109
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:09,784
- Goodness.
- What?

110
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:13,288
Why is it doing this?

111
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:15,456

131

It doesn't look like they're open.

132

Let's just wait in the car
and go when the rain stops.

133
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,798
You scared me.

134
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,201
Hello.

135
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,003
I thought no one was here.
What a relief.

136
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:41,042
Do you have a room?

137
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:45,446

Yes.

139
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:53,988
- Take this.
- Okay.

141
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:58,193
Sir, your cheek.

142
00:09:02,764 --> 00:09:03,731
Get some rest.

143

Thank you.

146
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,907
Sir.

147
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:30,058
Is there a charger in the room?

148
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,863
Give me your phone.
I'll bring it to you later.

149
00:09:34,863 --> 00:09:37,799
So there isn't one. I'm glad I asked.

150
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,666
Thank you.

151
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:42,270
Did it die again?

152
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,705
I told you to bring the charger.

153
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:45,306
You never pack what you need.

154
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:47,508
Just come already.

155
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:07,862
Saving it up and eating it all at once
is the best part.

156
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,133
You can wait a little more, right?

157
00:10:25,413 --> 00:10:26,915
Earlier, on the owner's cheek,

158
00:10:27,982 --> 00:10:29,350
didn't that look like blood?

159
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:39,093
That's not funny.

160
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:40,695
Too bad.

161
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:44,332
He looks kind of familiar.

162
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,268
Where have I seen him?

163
00:10:58,313 --> 00:11:00,415
In the middle of this,
you want to organize the schedule?

164
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:02,450
You've got a good memory.

165
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:04,686
I forget everything.

166
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,856
The call I got earlier today
was about the changed schedule.

167
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:20,835
What?
Why are they being so loud?

168
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:22,470
They must be in the good phase.

169
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:24,272
We were like that at first too.

170
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:26,241
Don't you remember? The meeting room.

171
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,417
Be quiet.

172
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:41,856
Ha Ri, I love you.

173
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:43,458
I really, really love you.

174
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,626
You're handsome.

175
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:46,327
It's thrilling.

176
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,937
We freaked out
when people suddenly walked in.

177
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:57,405
If we'd gotten caught then...

178
00:12:03,745 --> 00:12:05,246
Why? What?

179
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:14,189
Okay.

180
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:16,691
I'll call the front desk.

181
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:22,764
What?

182
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:25,667
The phone doesn't work.

183
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,303
Forget it. That's not what this is about.

184
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:34,776
Then what is it?

185
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:42,684
Just tell me.

186
00:12:42,684 --> 00:12:44,552
Stop driving me crazy.

187
00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:47,822
I'm driving you crazy?

188
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:49,424
I just haven't said it out loud,

189
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:51,226
but you've been like that lately.

190
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:53,595
You're either sulking or snapping.

191
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:54,729
And you're being distant.

192
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:57,799
You were on your phone
all day today, right?

193
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,733
That's...

194
00:12:58,733 --> 00:12:59,901
Even earlier,
when we went to see the horses,

195
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:02,170
we were the only couple not holding hands.

196
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:04,873
And what?
"They must be in the good phase?"

197
00:13:04,873 --> 00:13:06,140
"We were like that too?"

198
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,076
Then what about now?
What phase are we in now?

199
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:09,577
For you,

200
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:11,746
I don't even register.

201
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:12,914
We just keep dating like this,
and that's it.

202
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:14,582
Do you have any kind of plan with me?

203
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:16,217
No, you don't. Of course not.

204
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:18,653
What kind of plan?

205
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:21,022
What's the problem?
Why are you doing this?

206
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:24,726
Stop twisting my words.
It makes people lose it.

207
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:32,133
So this is it.
That damn thing hit you too.

208
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,835
What thing?

209
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:35,370
Everything's boring
because you know it all.

210
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,771
You yawn when we're together.

211
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:39,674
Honestly, you're even annoyed now
because I'm being like this, right?

212
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:41,242
That's what a slump is.

213
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:45,413
They're crossing the line.

214
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:47,315
Where are you going? Just leave it.

215
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,018
Don't go.

216
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:54,689
Those people have no manners.

217
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,529
Excuse me. We're downstairs.

218
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,831
It sounds like you're moving
furniture around.

219
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:05,099
You can't do that.

220
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:06,868
It's really loud.

221
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:11,806
Excuse me.

222
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:15,410
What?

223
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,226
Blood.

224
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:07,262
Blood...

225
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:12,400
Sir.

226
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,935
Are you okay?

227
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:22,243
Please help me.

228
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:25,647
Call the police.

229
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:27,115
The police?

230
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:28,349
That bastard...

231
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,751
Pardon?

232
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,419
That bastard...

233
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:35,490
Who is "that bastard?"

234
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,560
No, I'll...

235
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,695
I'll call the owner of the place for you.

236
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:44,766
I'm the owner.

237
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:46,734
I'm the owner.

238
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,808
Is that bastard still here?

239
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:55,176
What?

240
00:15:55,643 --> 00:15:56,477
Get some rest.

241
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:57,579
It's raining a lot outside, right?

242
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:58,646
I'll bring it to you later.

243
00:15:58,646 --> 00:15:59,781
Go inside. Get some rest.

244
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:00,982
It's raining a lot outside, right?

245
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,388
This won't come loose.

246
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:16,664
Looks like he talked.

247
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:31,679
What?

248
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:35,683
Damn it. I told him not to go.

249
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:41,723
Please save me.

250
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:55,436
Where are they?

251
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:56,671
What?

252
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:00,141
I know there's someone here.
Where are they?

253
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:02,243
I don't know.

254
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:05,113
I really don't know.

255
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:23,398
Hello.

256
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:31,072
What? The owner?

257
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:32,473
Ha Ri.

258
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:33,608
Dong Gu.

259
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:34,475
What is this?

260
00:17:35,043 --> 00:17:36,044
Ha Ri.

261
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:38,112
Get out.

262
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:39,247
What? Why?

263
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:47,422
Damn it. Hurry.

264
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:50,458
Come on.

265
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,161
Where are we going?

266
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:56,297
Where are we going?

267
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,501
What do we do?

268
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,104
What do we do?

269
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,740
Your phone.

270
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:07,542
Your phone's at the front desk, right?

271
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:08,343
Yeah.

272
00:18:09,577 --> 00:18:10,445
What?

273
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:12,113
Damn it.

274
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,285
Let me think.

275
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:19,120
Ha Ri.

276
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:21,055
Your phone's in the room, right?

277
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,023
Yeah.

278
00:18:23,424 --> 00:18:25,360
Why?

279
00:18:26,127 --> 00:18:28,563
Why? Don't do that.

280
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:35,803
Are you unhappy with the service?

281
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:39,541
No, I like it, but it's a little scary.

282
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:41,576
The...

283
00:18:50,118 --> 00:18:51,519
What now?

284
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,954
What do we do?

285
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:56,090
Why isn't it coming?

286
00:19:04,532 --> 00:19:07,302
Hey, get a grip and listen to me.

287
00:19:09,037 --> 00:19:10,138
You remember the meeting room, right?

288
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:11,039
You're handsome.

289
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:11,806
It's thrilling.

290
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,744
Are you crazy?

291
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,584
If you just trust me,

292
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,520
we'll be okay.

293
00:19:28,556 --> 00:19:29,457
Damn it.

294
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:38,199
One.

295
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:41,636
Two.

296
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:45,240
Three.

297
00:20:17,705 --> 00:20:18,706
I'll be right back, honey.

298
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:20,675
Don't call her "honey."

299
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:22,677
Time out.

300
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,321
My phone.

301
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:08,089
My phone.

302
00:21:12,594 --> 00:21:13,294
What?

303
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:14,162
(Call failed)

304
00:21:14,162 --> 00:21:16,331
What's wrong with this?

305
00:21:17,765 --> 00:21:18,900
Damn it.

306
00:21:20,568 --> 00:21:22,537
What? Why won't it work?

307
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:38,553
Dong Gu.

308
00:21:41,489 --> 00:21:42,724
Dong Gu.

309
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:45,159
Hey, Kang Dong Gu.

310
00:21:45,793 --> 00:21:49,097
Why are you so quiet, Kang Dong Gu?

311
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:53,401
It's really quiet.

312
00:21:54,068 --> 00:21:57,505
Hey, Dong Gu. Say something.

313
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,125
Damn it.

314
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,267
Sir.

315
00:22:28,436 --> 00:22:29,304
Sir.

316
00:22:30,471 --> 00:22:31,406
Sir.

317
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,841
Sir.

318
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:37,946
Sir.

319
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,881
Sir.

320
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:45,320
(Police)

321
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:49,791
Damn it.

322
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:50,892
(Please report to the police.)

323
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:54,195
(A person dead at the motel)

324
00:22:54,195 --> 00:22:55,296
(Report to police,
Person dead)

325
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:15,950
Sir.

326
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:17,352
Sir, here.

327
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:18,987
Sir.

328
00:23:19,654 --> 00:23:20,555
Sir.

329
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:25,493
- <i>Trash goes in the trash can</i>
- Sir.

330
00:23:25,493 --> 00:23:26,427
No.

331
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:29,430
Sir.

332
00:23:30,198 --> 00:23:31,332
Sir.

333
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:39,040
Please. Why is this happening?

334
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:50,451
(Report to the police!)

335
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:01,896
(Let's win first place
in the talent show.)

336
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:03,097
(Tango is all about momentum.)

337
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:05,867
Date plan.

338
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:07,468
Go see the horses.

339
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:08,870
Don't let go of her hand even if it's hot.

340
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,207
Ha Ri's recent
favorite ice cream, Bbababang.

341
00:24:12,707 --> 00:24:13,675
Vanilla flavor.

342
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:27,255
Watch out for sweaty hands.
Ha Ri hates it.

343
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:42,270
Kang Dong Gu, your palms sweat like crazy.

344
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:45,173
See you later, love you.

345
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:54,082
Ha Ri is the leader, I'm the sidekick.

346
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,322
No, Dong Gu.

347
00:25:01,322 --> 00:25:03,658
Dong Gu, no. Keep going.

348
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,728
This wasn't in my plan.

349
00:25:06,728 --> 00:25:08,463
We were supposed to bike to a sunset spot.

350
00:25:13,368 --> 00:25:14,502
- Ha Ri.
- Yeah?

351
00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:22,911
How beautiful.

352
00:25:23,645 --> 00:25:25,713
So beautiful.

353
00:25:29,517 --> 00:25:30,952
How is that even possible?

354
00:25:30,952 --> 00:25:32,320
Whatever the plan is,

355
00:25:33,121 --> 00:25:35,156
no matter how much of a mess it is,

356
00:25:35,957 --> 00:25:37,392
I'll make it happen for you.

357
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:39,394
If you're the leader,

358
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:41,496
I'm your sidekick.

359
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:47,969
I can't breathe.

360
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:49,170
I love you.

361
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:02,617
What do you think?
Should we just get married too?

362
00:26:04,085 --> 00:26:06,154
I'll think about it
when I become Assistant Manager Yoon.

363
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:10,792
Dong Gu's goal.

364
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:13,428
Propose to Assistant Manager Yoon.

365
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:17,332
That idiot.
When did he write all this down?

366
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,933
Things even I've forgotten.

367
00:26:21,236 --> 00:26:22,837
How annoying.

368
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:27,375
All right. Let's do this.

369
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:30,278
You think I'm just going
to die nicely for you?

370
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:31,946
You're dead.

371
00:26:31,946 --> 00:26:34,415
Even that last front tooth of his, I'll...

372
00:26:35,683 --> 00:26:36,417
What?

373
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:38,319
He'll get caught any second.

374
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:39,954
That's him.

375
00:26:39,954 --> 00:26:41,089
Yeah, that bastard.

376
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:08,616
Dong Gu.

377
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:10,785
I'm coming.

378
00:27:17,492 --> 00:27:19,928
I was going to go myself,
but you came to me on your own.

379
00:27:20,995 --> 00:27:22,163
I thought you looked familiar.

380
00:27:23,064 --> 00:27:24,999
You were on the wanted list.

381
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:29,103
Sharp eyes.

382
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:31,706
Exactly.

383
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:35,243
Dong Gu says that I've got a great memory.

384
00:27:48,456 --> 00:27:49,490
(Special note, wearing a hearing aid)

385
00:27:51,593 --> 00:27:52,794
(Wearing a hearing aid)

386
00:27:59,334 --> 00:28:00,168
Die.

387
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:02,637
Die, you bastard.

388
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:03,705
Get away.

389
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:20,655
Ha Ri.

390
00:28:20,955 --> 00:28:21,823
Hey.

391
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,358
Yeah, Dong Gu.

392
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,562
Your face is bleeding.

393
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:29,497
This isn't my blood.

394
00:28:29,497 --> 00:28:30,431
What?

395
00:28:30,431 --> 00:28:32,066
Who's worrying about who right now?

396
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:33,935
You look totally...

397
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:35,637
Ugly?

398
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:38,506
Handsome.

399
00:28:39,007 --> 00:28:40,008
It's thrilling.

400
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:45,547
Are you okay?

401
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:47,649
Does it hurt?

402
00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:48,716
That son of a bitch.

403
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,586
Get up. Can you get up?

404
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:53,755
Careful.

405
00:28:56,524 --> 00:28:57,458
Are you okay?

406
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:01,763
Are you a zombie now or what?

407
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:06,434
You're not going anywhere, you bastards.

408
00:29:11,372 --> 00:29:12,340
Dong Gu.

409
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,441
Yeah?

410
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:15,577
Do you know why we messed up our dance?

411
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,447
What?

412
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:22,784
Because I didn't trust you.

413
00:29:25,153 --> 00:29:26,387
You never changed,

414
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:30,058
but I doubted you.
That's why we messed up.

415
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:33,595
I was the one who hit that damn slump,
not you.

416
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,764
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:39,400
But still, Dong Gu,

418
00:29:41,135 --> 00:29:42,470
if you trust me,

419
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:44,973
that bastard too, and our damn slump,

420
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:46,507
I don't think I'll be scared of any of it.

421
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:50,879
Will you trust me?

422
00:29:53,915 --> 00:29:54,849
Of course.

423
00:30:02,156 --> 00:30:04,058
Look at these idiots.

424
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:30,151
Now I get the rule of the dance we do.

425
00:30:42,463 --> 00:30:43,631
Even if the steps get tangled,

426
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:48,469
even if you miss the beat...

427
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:50,705
One.

428
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,273
Two.

429
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:54,209
Three.

430
00:31:10,124 --> 00:31:11,693
As long as I don't forget you
in front of me,

431
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:14,395
the dance goes on.

432
00:31:24,806 --> 00:31:26,541
Hey, show me your teeth.

433
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:28,810
You picked the wrong people,
don't you think?

434
00:31:30,378 --> 00:31:31,713
You.

435
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:34,015
- You.
- You.

436
00:31:34,015 --> 00:31:34,916
Hit him one more time.

437
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,887
(Love Hotel)

438
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:43,157
We are at a motel
on the outskirts of Gyeonggi-do.

439
00:31:43,157 --> 00:31:46,094
Lee Gyu Han,
a serial killer on the wanted list,

440
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:47,562
was arrested here by police...

441
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:50,265
at around 7 a.m. this morning.

442
00:31:50,265 --> 00:31:52,200
After occupying this motel,

443
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,769
Lee went on a rampage,
including attempted murder,

444
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:56,938
leaving three with minor injuries
and one seriously injured,

445
00:31:56,938 --> 00:31:58,072
but fortunately, officials say...

446
00:31:58,072 --> 00:32:00,909
- the victims' lives are not in danger.
- Dong Gu.

447
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:02,243
Are you still curious about me?

448
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:05,046
Being with you...

449
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,316
is the most thrilling thing in the world.
