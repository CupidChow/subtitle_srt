1
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:31,987
Hey, Class 1 is playing dodgeball.
Hurry up.

2
00:00:31,987 --> 00:00:32,988
Sounds fun.

3
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:34,222
Hey, who do you think will win today?

4
00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:27,909
(Sammin High School 2-1)

5
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:29,578
Hey.

6
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:46,127
Thank you.

7
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:50,198
Hey, what's that?

8
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:56,271
(Min Ji, I like you. From. Min Ji.)

9
00:01:57,105 --> 00:01:58,640
"Min Ji, I like you."

10
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:00,609
"From Min Ji?"

11
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:01,876
What?

12
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:04,879
Which Min Ji?

13
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,082
(Song Min Ji)

14
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:11,419
(Yoon Min Ji)

15
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:14,889
(Kim Min Ji)

16
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:18,193
(Yoon Min Ji, Kim Min Ji, Song Min Ji)

17
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:21,796
(Min Ji, Min Ji, Min Ji)

18
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:23,632
But all three said it wasn't them?

19
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:24,532
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:27,302
So someone here is lying.

21
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:28,970
We need to do handwriting analysis...

22
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:31,139
and identify the culprit.

23
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:32,641
Don't be ridiculous.

24
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:33,875
Hyun Woo.

25
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:36,544
If you studied that hard,
you'd get into Seoul National University.

26
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:38,413
Sir.

27
00:02:39,014 --> 00:02:40,148
Forget it.

28
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:42,050
Second period is electives, right?

29
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,385
Yes.

30
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:44,519
All right, let's go.

31
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,787
Yes.

32
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:55,964
Hey, Yoon Min Ji, is that really not you?

33
00:02:57,565 --> 00:02:58,433
No.

34
00:02:58,733 --> 00:02:59,567
Really?

35
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:01,536
It wasn't me either.

36
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:03,605
Then you wrote it, Kim Min Ji, didn't you?

37
00:03:06,274 --> 00:03:07,242
It wasn't me either.

38
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:10,912
Maybe someone was just messing around.

39
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:12,547
Is that so?

40
00:03:12,547 --> 00:03:15,050
Just be honest
and say you wrote it because you like me.

41
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:17,586
Hey, class will start soon.
Get back to your seat.

42
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:19,421
Why? Are you nervous?

43
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,789
You're nervous, right?

44
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:21,890
No, I'm not nervous.

45
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:24,426
- Not at all.
- You are, aren't you?

46
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:25,961
You're nervous.

47
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:27,662
I'm really not.

48
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:29,965
Stop lying.

49
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,738
I'm home.

50
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:38,673
How was school?

51
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:47,315
What's going on?

52
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:59,361
Why did I write that there?

53
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:32,160
They said it'd come off with liniment.
Why won't it come off?

54
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:37,465
Why did I use a permanent marker?

55
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:45,340
(Min Ji, I like you. From. Min Ji.)

56
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,477
Hey, who did this?

57
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:50,946
Did they try to erase it?

58
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:52,581
It's completely smeared.

59
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:55,350
Why? What is it?

60
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,885
Looks like someone tried to remove that.

61
00:04:57,852 --> 00:05:00,088
Really?

62
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:02,123
That's funny.

63
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:06,561
Kim Min Ji.

64
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:09,698
It really wasn't you, right?

65
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,535
I told you it wasn't me.
How many times do I have to say it?

66
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:16,738
Fine. Don't shout.

67
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:21,776
I mean, it's got to be
either Song Min Ji or Yoon Min Ji.

68
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:24,279
I see.

69
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,215
There was something going on between them
ever since they were class and vice pres.

70
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:28,750
You know me. I've got good instincts.

71
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:34,489
- Really?
- Who likes who?

72
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:35,724
Song likes Yoon, probably.

73
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:36,992
No way.

74
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:38,727
It was Yoon who wrote it to Song,
I'm telling you.

75
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:41,429
Song's super popular with the guys
because she's pretty.

76
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:43,598
Yeah, that makes the most sense.

77
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:45,667
- They do look good together, though.
- Right.

78
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,835
What if they're already dating?

79
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:47,869
Already?

80
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:52,374
Song Min Ji totally looks
like the lead in a teen romance.

81
00:05:52,374 --> 00:05:53,241
Exactly.

82
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:56,344
It's Smart Min Ji and Pretty Min Ji.
This is straight out of a web novel.

83
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:58,980
Then what about Kim Min Ji? "Friend 1?"

84
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,383
Hey, she's out of the picture.

85
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:06,087
- It's obviously Yoon Min Ji.
- It's Song Min Ji, for sure.

86
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:07,689
Let's bet.

87
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:09,424
Okay, ice cream bet?

88
00:06:09,424 --> 00:06:10,558
- Deal.
- Okay.

89
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:11,793
- Song Min Ji, raise your hand.
- Me.

90
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:12,894
Then three of us vote for Song Min Ji.

91
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:14,396
- Two for Yoon Min Ji.
- Yoon Min Ji.

92
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:17,232
But Kim Min Ji...

93
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,135
No one, right?

94
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:21,303
Who's that?

95
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:22,437
Hey.

96
00:06:22,437 --> 00:06:24,472
- That's harsh.
- Just kidding.

97
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,009
- She's not here, right?
- Get out.

98
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:33,682
Yeah.

99
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:36,851
The handsome and smart
class president Yoon Min Ji...

100
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:40,722
and the pretty and kind
vice president Song Min Ji...

101
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:41,790
do look perfect together.

102
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:44,025
Not smart,

103
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:46,661
not even pretty,
and just ordinary Kim Min Ji is...

104
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:48,029
Min Ji.

105
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:50,865
Min Ji, do you want to eat lunch with me?

106
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:53,001
Everyone else is going to the snack bar.

107
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:55,036
Okay.

108
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:55,971
- Really?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:58,673
Yes! I'm having lunch with Min Ji.

110
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,210
- Isn't that Song Min Ji?
- Her?

111
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,078
Yeah.

112
00:07:05,113 --> 00:07:07,082
How far has that doodle story spread?

113
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:09,384
Everyone keeps asking you
if you wrote it too, right?

114
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:13,822
No, they don't ask me.

115
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:15,523
Really? Why not?

116
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:20,428
So that's why you kept
getting called out today.

117
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:21,963
But it really wasn't me.

118
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,934
I think people are making a bigger deal
because Yoon Min Ji is popular.

119
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:27,202
Him?

120
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:31,773
He's popular?

121
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,242
I see.

122
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:37,646
You didn't know?
He's been popular since elementary school.

123
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:40,348
Really?

124
00:07:41,182 --> 00:07:43,451
I see. Why though?

125
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:46,688
Well, he looks decent, gets good grades,

126
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:47,856
and he's good at sports.

127
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:50,525
And also, people say he smells nice.

128
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:54,296
I see.

129
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,464
Okay.

130
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:17,185
Hey, Kim Min Ji.

131
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:18,086
Yeah?

132
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:19,721
Me?

133
00:08:20,455 --> 00:08:21,256
Why?

134
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:22,791
That doodle.

135
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:25,026
Did you write it?

136
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:26,361
No.

137
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,532
I said it wasn't me.

138
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:35,070
Why do you think it's me?
This is ridiculous.

139
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:36,871
Really?

140
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:39,241
And you.

141
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:41,476
Ease up on the cologne.

142
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,012
What kind of student wears
that much cologne?

143
00:08:44,012 --> 00:08:44,980
How arrogant.

144
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:47,482
Cologne?

145
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:51,419
It's fabric softener.

146
00:08:57,158 --> 00:08:58,193
Ease up on that.

147
00:08:59,027 --> 00:08:59,928
It's not good for you.

148
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:01,396
Well,

149
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:03,398
okay.

150
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,333
I'll tell my mom.

151
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:07,469
Bye.

152
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:10,538
Hey, wait...

153
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:23,718
(Talk GPT,
What do you think of the name Kim Min Ji?)

154
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:28,757
(The name Kim Min Ji
is a very common Korean name.)

155
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:30,225
Common...

156
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,095
Common...

157
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:37,465
Mom.

158
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:39,034
Yeah?

159
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:41,603
Why did you name me Min Ji?

160
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:45,941
The name consultant recommended it.

161
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:50,111
Didn't you have another name?
Something more unique?

162
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:52,881
If a name's too unique,
it's uncomfortable.

163
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:55,850
Simple is better.

164
00:09:58,153 --> 00:09:59,521
I want to change my name.

165
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,958
Why all of a sudden?

166
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,059
Just.

167
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,529
I want at least my name to be special.

168
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:22,978
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

169
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:25,447
All right, open your books to page 12.

170
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:31,953
(Min Ji, I like you. From. Min Ji.)

171
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:33,722
You still haven't caught the culprit?

172
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:36,391
You're curious too, aren't you?

173
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,260
All three still say it wasn't them, sir.

174
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,462
Then some other kid
must've been fooling around.

175
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:41,396
What are you talking about?

176
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:43,665
We said it wasn't us either.
Do a forensic investigation.

177
00:10:43,665 --> 00:10:46,301
Yeah, do it.
That handwriting analysis thing.

178
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:47,369
Okay.

179
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:50,071
Sir, we made an ice cream bet.
Do you want in?

180
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:52,007
A bet? Keep it among yourselves.

181
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:53,341
Who did you bet on?

182
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:55,944
Me? I picked Song Min Ji.

183
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:58,046
Including me, seven picked Song.

184
00:10:58,046 --> 00:10:58,947
That doodle.

185
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:00,815
I wrote it.

186
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:04,185
What?

187
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:05,720
Wait a minute.

188
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:08,290
Then the Min Ji you like is...

189
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:10,091
Song?

190
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:14,596
Knock it off.

191
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:15,563
What's going on here?

192
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:19,234
All right, quiet. That's enough.

193
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:22,203
Calm down, guys,
and deal with the rest yourselves.

194
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:24,839
Let's get back to class. Page 12.

195
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,275
"Until the peonies bloom..."
Hey, flowers bloomed here too.

196
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:29,244
No.

197
00:11:29,244 --> 00:11:32,414
Let's read together.
"Until the peonies bloom," one, two.

198
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:35,951
Until the peonies bloom,

199
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:40,021
I will still be waiting for my spring.

200
00:11:49,598 --> 00:11:52,767
Why would he tell a lie like that?

201
00:11:54,202 --> 00:11:55,170
Hey, Yoon Min Ji.

202
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:57,739
Our sixth-grade class is meeting up today.
Do you want to come?

203
00:11:58,206 --> 00:11:59,708
Are you going?

204
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,809
Yeah, I am.

205
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:04,212
Okay, then.

206
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:05,080
Okay.

207
00:12:10,252 --> 00:12:13,955
Is he really trying to get close
to Min Ji?

208
00:12:15,457 --> 00:12:16,291
Darn it.

209
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:26,868
Should I ask why he did that?

210
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,839
But we're not even that close.

211
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:47,022
Min Ji.

212
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:48,957
You should get some rest.

213
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,494
Sorry.

214
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:53,561
It's okay.

215
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:56,264
- Hey, you're with me.
- What?

216
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:57,699
- Just do it.
- Do what?

217
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:58,533
Come on.

218
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:20,555
Are you okay?

219
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:22,591
Thanks.

220
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:25,093
Yeah.

221
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:28,330
Hey, watch where you throw the ball.

222
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:30,865
- Do you want some help?
- Me?

223
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:33,735
I'm fine.

224
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:35,337
Hold your hands out.

225
00:13:36,438 --> 00:13:37,606
No, I'm okay.

226
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:38,840
No, you're not.

227
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:43,178
Stand with your feet a little wider
than your shoulders,

228
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:47,582
and when the ball comes,
think of meeting it.

229
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,484
I really am fine.

230
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:50,852
So put your hand here...

231
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:54,022
- like this.
- Okay.

232
00:13:55,757 --> 00:13:56,891
I'll try it myself.

233
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:59,494
Okay.

234
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:05,367
No, not like that.

235
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:07,836
When the ball comes, catch it with...

236
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:09,204
No, it's okay, I've got it.

237
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:36,097
I'm really fine.
You didn't have to follow me here.

238
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:38,266
I felt bad.

239
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:41,836
Liar. You just wanted to skip class.

240
00:14:44,205 --> 00:14:45,040
You got me.

241
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:50,545
Hey.

242
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:51,947
Yeah?

243
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:54,783
Well, you know...

244
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:59,588
I eased up on the fabric softener.

245
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:00,522
The smell...

246
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:02,857
No.

247
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:05,894
That's not it.

248
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:07,395
Then?

249
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:12,667
The doodle.

250
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:16,438
Did you really write it?

251
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:20,642
That.

252
00:15:23,678 --> 00:15:25,780
Everyone was making
such a big deal out of it,

253
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:27,749
so I just said that
because it was annoying.

254
00:15:29,484 --> 00:15:30,552
I see.

255
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:32,554
Okay.

256
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:34,589
I thought...

257
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,359
You thought...

258
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:39,694
what?

259
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:45,433
That you liked Min Ji.

260
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:48,370
Really?

261
00:15:52,774 --> 00:15:54,109
I think I will.

262
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:57,479
What?

263
00:15:57,712 --> 00:16:00,348
I think I might actually
start liking her after this.

264
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:07,555
I see.

265
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:12,494
Really?

266
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:15,931
So that's why you lied.

267
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,999
I see.

268
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:18,934
That makes sense.

269
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:22,904
You two really look good together.

270
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:30,011
The bell rang. I should go.

271
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:31,212
No...

272
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,569
All right, who wants to come up
and solve these two problems?

273
00:16:58,506 --> 00:16:59,441
No one?

274
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:03,778
Then let's have the Min Jis come up
and solve them.

275
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:05,847
Yes.

276
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:11,052
No, not you, Kim Min Ji.

277
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:12,420
The class president
and vice president Min Jis.

278
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:25,166
Why?

279
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:27,869
Why not me?

280
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:30,305
What?

281
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:34,776
Why does everyone keep saying it's not me?

282
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:38,046
You call them
Smart Min Ji and Pretty Min Ji.

283
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:39,180
But why am I...

284
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:41,783
just Kim Min Ji?

285
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:46,288
Why do you all act
like I don't even exist?

286
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:50,525
Why do you act the same too, ma'am?

287
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,082
(Sammin 2nd Year, Class 1)

288
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:15,450
(@KimMinJi I have something to say.)

289
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:18,019
Crying Min Ji, I'm sorry.

290
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:20,689
I'll never call you Kim Min Ji again.

291
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:23,892
Yeah, Crybaby Min Ji, sorry.

292
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:27,062
Guys, stop joking
and let's actually decide on one.

293
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:28,763
How about Our Min Ji?

294
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:30,265
Peerless Beauty Min Ji.

295
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:39,574
Why did I cry there?

296
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:42,143
- Who's crying?
- What?

297
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:45,947
Nobody.

298
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:48,650
Right. About changing your name.

299
00:18:49,284 --> 00:18:50,318
Did you decide on a name?

300
00:18:50,785 --> 00:18:51,620
Yeah.

301
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:53,688
Well, I've got two.
Tell me what you think.

302
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:57,259
Option one is Yeon Woo.

303
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:58,393
Yeon Woo.

304
00:18:59,394 --> 00:19:02,364
Why are you here alone?
You should be with me.

305
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:10,505
Yeon Woo and Eun Woo
are pretty common these days, right?

306
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:13,742
Yeah. You said you hate common names.

307
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:16,611
And you said unique ones
are uncomfortable.

308
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:19,080
- Then,
- Yeah.

309
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,081
option two is...

310
00:19:21,683 --> 00:19:24,252
Yu Ju. What do you think? Pretty, right?

311
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:27,656
Ms. Han Yu Ju, come here.

312
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:28,723
Yes.

313
00:19:33,461 --> 00:19:34,329
Right.

314
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,264
Kim...

315
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:40,201
Ye Ppi. How about this?

316
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:50,745
Mom, I'm being serious right now.

317
00:19:52,347 --> 00:19:56,117
I think the problem isn't the name.

318
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:04,492
Min Ji, watch the vlog I just uploaded.

319
00:20:04,492 --> 00:20:05,493
You have to watch it.

320
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:12,667
Why should I watch this?

321
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:14,369
(Min Ji iamMINZI)

322
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:18,773
Ta-da.

323
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,910
It's been a while
since I wore a school uniform, right?

324
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:26,581
I'm on my way to meet my classmates
from sixth-grade after ages.

325
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:28,383
There's another friend
in my current class...

326
00:20:28,383 --> 00:20:30,619
who was also in the same class back then.
He's Yoon Min Ji.

327
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:33,989
So now, with him
and two other girl friends...

328
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:35,190
Do we really need to add this?

329
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,558
Yeah, because I like it.

330
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:37,592
Why?

331
00:20:37,592 --> 00:20:38,960
It's kind of cute.

332
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,562
Hey, are you guys still not done?

333
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:41,529
Why are you laughing?

334
00:20:42,797 --> 00:20:44,566
What are you doing after this is over?

335
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:46,101
- What should we do?
- Take photos?

336
00:20:46,101 --> 00:20:47,135
Let's take photos.

337
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:48,470
What's your MBTI?

338
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,739
- ISFJ?
- You were a J type?

339
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:51,873
I want to go up there.

340
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,376
Come a little closer.

341
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:55,911
Good. This looks nice.

342
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:58,947
Yeah.

343
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:01,216
They look good together.

344
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:03,885
You two look good together.

345
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:05,654
Satisfied?

346
00:21:05,654 --> 00:21:07,322
I don't want to leave.

347
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:09,190
Right.
Yoon Min Ji, I have something to ask.

348
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,792
Everyone, focus on Min Ji.

349
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:11,993
- What is it?
- What is it?

350
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:13,228
- Min Ji?
- Min Ji?

351
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:14,329
All right.

352
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:15,630
Yoon Min Ji.

353
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,599
Is it true that you have a crush on me?

354
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,367
What? No way.

355
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:20,635
No way. This is ridiculous.

356
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:22,771
Hey, stop it. Don't film.

357
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:26,107
Didn't you say you wrote
"Min Ji, I like you. From. Min Ji?"

358
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:31,179
I don't want to watch.

359
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:48,029
You're early.

360
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:50,498
Yeah.

361
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,668
I'm on duty this week.

362
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:56,171
You're early too.

363
00:21:58,807 --> 00:21:59,474
Yeah.

364
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:07,282
I always come early. Every day.

365
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,152
That's impressive.

366
00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:43,685
Do you watch Song Min Ji's vlogs?

367
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:47,455
Sometimes.

368
00:22:49,157 --> 00:22:52,527
Did you see the one uploaded yesterday?

369
00:22:58,867 --> 00:22:59,734
Yeah.

370
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:04,773
That's it?

371
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:08,443
What is?

372
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:11,046
Yoon Min Ji.

373
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,019
You little punk. I watched the vlog.

374
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:20,455
What happened?

375
00:23:20,722 --> 00:23:22,057
Did you confess properly?

376
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,460
What are you talking about?

377
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,999
All of you guys watched my vlog.

378
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:32,834
So why didn't you guys hit like?

379
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:33,935
Because we're jealous.

380
00:23:36,304 --> 00:23:38,373
So? Are the two dating?

381
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:41,076
Who knows.

382
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:43,111
What, is it an open ending?

383
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:44,946
Hey, what is it? Tell me.

384
00:23:44,946 --> 00:23:46,815
The bell rang, guys.

385
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:52,554
Let's start class. Page 7.

386
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:12,374
What are you doing?

387
00:24:13,842 --> 00:24:14,676
Nothing.

388
00:24:15,677 --> 00:24:16,544
Here.

389
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:19,648
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

390
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:22,183
Min Ji.

391
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:26,388
Should I set the vlog to private?

392
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:28,723
Why?

393
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,160
You don't look like you're in a good mood,

394
00:24:33,128 --> 00:24:35,130
and you cried back then too.

395
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:40,135
Actually,

396
00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:42,070
I'm...

397
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:45,674
jealous of you and Yoon Min Ji.

398
00:24:45,674 --> 00:24:47,442
Really? Why?

399
00:24:48,076 --> 00:24:50,478
You two feel like special Min Jis,

400
00:24:51,212 --> 00:24:53,748
but I don't think I am.

401
00:24:54,282 --> 00:24:56,785
It feels natural that everyone...

402
00:24:57,686 --> 00:24:59,087
just overlooks me.

403
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:00,555
Hey.

404
00:25:01,423 --> 00:25:05,460
Min Ji, you've never wanted
to change your name before, have you?

405
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:07,762
Of course, I have.

406
00:25:07,762 --> 00:25:08,630
Did you know?

407
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,899
In middle school,
my nickname was "Bad Min Ji."

408
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:13,168
Why?

409
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:16,438
There was another Min Ji in my class
who was super pretty...

410
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:17,672
and really kind too.

411
00:25:17,672 --> 00:25:19,874
So I suddenly became Bad Min Ji.

412
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:21,576
That's ridiculous.

413
00:25:24,613 --> 00:25:26,281
If I go to college,

414
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:28,717
and there's an even prettier Min Ji,
what will they call me then?

415
00:25:31,686 --> 00:25:32,687
So Min Ji,

416
00:25:33,888 --> 00:25:37,225
no matter what people call us,
let's not care.

417
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:42,631
And...

418
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:46,201
to at least one person, you're definitely
a special Min Ji right now.

419
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:49,037
Who? My mom?

420
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:52,240
You didn't watch my vlog, did you?

421
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,408
I did.

422
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:57,312
I watched it,

423
00:25:58,213 --> 00:26:00,615
but I didn't finish it.

424
00:26:01,683 --> 00:26:02,517
I'll watch it.

425
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:04,986
Make sure you like.

426
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:06,087
Okay.

427
00:26:06,454 --> 00:26:07,355
I'll go now.

428
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:09,057
Thanks.

429
00:26:23,838 --> 00:26:25,440
Everyone, focus on Min Ji.

430
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,608
- What is it?
- What is it?

431
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:27,842
- Min Ji? Why?
- Min Ji?

432
00:26:27,842 --> 00:26:29,010
All right.

433
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,245
Yoon Min Ji.

434
00:26:30,245 --> 00:26:32,213
Is it true that you have a crush on me?

435
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:35,350
- No way.
- No way. That's ridiculous.

436
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,385
Hey, stop it. Don't film.

437
00:26:37,385 --> 00:26:41,122
Didn't you say you wrote
"Min Ji, I like you. From. Min Ji?"

438
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:43,058
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean?

439
00:26:44,426 --> 00:26:47,062
Why do you think
that Min Ji has to be you?

440
00:26:47,596 --> 00:26:48,964
What?

441
00:26:48,964 --> 00:26:49,898
What are you talking about?

442
00:26:51,032 --> 00:26:52,634
You like Kim Min Ji, don't you?

443
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:54,202
Who is Kim Min Ji?

444
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:56,371
Guys, there's another Min Ji in our class.

445
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:57,272
What are you talking about?

446
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,108
You like Kim Min Ji, don't you?

447
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:04,145
Why do you think
that Min Ji has to be you?

448
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:13,088
But he said
he might start liking Min Ji...

449
00:27:20,095 --> 00:27:22,264
I thought you liked Min Ji.

450
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:24,032
I see.

451
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:30,805
I think I will.

452
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:33,208
What?

453
00:27:35,944 --> 00:27:38,446
I think I might actually
start liking her after this.

454
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,117
I always come early. Every day.

455
00:27:43,685 --> 00:27:47,756
They said it comes off with liniment.
Why won't it come off?

456
00:28:26,194 --> 00:28:27,228
What are you doing here alone?

457
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:28,997
Why?

458
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:32,067
Why?

459
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:36,204
What are you doing here?

460
00:28:36,371 --> 00:28:38,640
I was heading to the classroom.

461
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:42,010
The bell's about to ring.
Aren't you going in?

462
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,514
I am.

463
00:28:48,516 --> 00:28:50,418
I'll go first.

464
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:56,258
That doodle. It was me.

465
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,102
Really?

466
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,304
I didn't know.

467
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:12,941
You already knew everything.

468
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,412
Well, I only saw you trying to erase it.

469
00:29:18,747 --> 00:29:20,348
- What?
- Then...

470
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:23,985
which Min Ji do you like?

471
00:29:28,423 --> 00:29:31,526
That Min Ji might not be me, that's why.

472
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:34,863
Tell me.

473
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:39,134
If you've got nothing else to say,

474
00:29:40,168 --> 00:29:41,002
I'm going.

475
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:55,150
It's you.

476
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:05,260
By the way, that doodle.

477
00:30:06,895 --> 00:30:08,630
You were erasing it so seriously.

478
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,665
You were desperately trying to erase it.

479
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,470
And you said Song Min Ji
and I looked good together,

480
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:18,406
and what else did you say?

481
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,108
That I have a crush.

482
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,625
Who...

483
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:39,094
do you like?

484
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:46,568
I like you, Yoon Min Ji.

485
00:30:51,172 --> 00:30:52,107
Kim Min Ji likes me?

486
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:03,118
Call me.

487
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:06,755
Why?

488
00:31:08,189 --> 00:31:09,257
Just call me.

489
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:21,269
(Cute Min Ji)

490
00:31:45,427 --> 00:31:46,361
Min Ji.

491
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:47,896
I like you.

492
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:49,230
From. Min Ji.

493
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,365
(Min Ji, Min Ji, Min Ji)
