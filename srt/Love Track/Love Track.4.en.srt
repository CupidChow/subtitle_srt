3
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:28,116
I said I'd take care of it.

4
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:30,051
Didn't I tell you not to get
your hands wet?

5
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:31,086
Go inside and get some rest.

6
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:33,121
I just got here,
and I can shower right away?

7
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,923
Sure. I'll clean everything up.

8
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:39,427
Seo Dae Kang, I really, really love you.

9
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:40,395
You're so cute.

10
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:44,065
I'm cute, but I'm sexy too.

11
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:45,967
Are you going with "cute and sexy?"

12
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:47,235
- Yeah.
- Come here.

13
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:48,403
Where are we going?

14
00:00:48,904 --> 00:00:51,640
Hey, wait. I haven't showered yet.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,375
It's fine, just come.

16
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,543
Right here?

17
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:56,678
You're so dirty. Go wash up already.

18
00:00:56,678 --> 00:00:57,712
What is this?

19
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:00,215
Hey, clean this up. What is all this?

20
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:02,551
Just look at this place.

21
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:04,319
Shouldn't you be the one cleaning that up?

22
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:06,321
You're the one who ate that.

23
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:07,722
But I was on duty.

24
00:01:08,023 --> 00:01:09,090
So what?

25
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:13,595
Damn it.

26
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,701
This is driving me crazy.

27
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:22,404
I'm not doing it.

28
00:01:23,905 --> 00:01:24,906
Hey, where are you?

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,808
Why aren't you coming?

30
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:32,314
Like that's going to make you rich.

31
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:34,549
Jenny has a 39-degree fever right now.

32
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:35,517
Come home now.

33
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:42,057
Seo Dae Kang!

34
00:01:42,057 --> 00:01:43,291
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,861
I was hungry. I'm sorry.

36
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:01,142
Yes, sir?

37
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:02,544
Yes.

38
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:06,248
Okay, I'll head there right away. Yes.

39
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,002
- The person you're calling is not...
- She hung up.

42
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,336
It's really over.

43
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,241
I'll wrap things up cleanly
with Seo Dae Kang by the end of this year,

44
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:07,742
and start fresh next year.

45
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:10,846
Give it another thought.

46
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,181
Jenny is only five years old.

47
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:17,285
Dae Kang can be frustrating sometimes,
but he has a kind heart.

48
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:20,222
What's left to think about?
It's already over.

49
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,757
A kind heart? No way.

50
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:24,092
I can't even.

51
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:28,463
You're an animal communicator or whatever,

52
00:03:28,463 --> 00:03:31,199
and you appear on "Duck Heaven."
You're doing fine.

53
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:35,337
If you two just got along,
everything would be perfect.

54
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:36,938

00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:39,407
Who said I wanted to be on TV?

56
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:41,776
I wanted to keep working at the zoo too.

57
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:44,045
Mom.

58
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:45,981
Jenny, why are you awake?

59
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:48,517
Was it noisy? Sorry.

60
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:51,786
When is Dad coming?

61
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:53,121
I miss him.

62
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:59,494
Jenny, let's go back inside.
I'll tuck you in.

63
00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:00,695
Okay, let's go.

65
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:19,948
What?

66
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:21,816
Why do you keep calling me?

67
00:04:23,585 --> 00:04:24,452
Honey.

68
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:28,824
Did you cause some kind of trouble again?

69

73
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:07,696
Damn it.

74
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:08,663
Hey, honey.

75
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:12,567
I told you to fix that habit
of never closing the door properly.

76
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:15,504
You never do anything right.

77
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:16,505
So what now?

78
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:18,707
Just help me this once.

79
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,810
How long do you expect me
to keep cleaning up after you?

80
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:25,413
If I get fired over this,
how am I supposed to pay child support?

81
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:29,217
Are you even human?

82
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:30,652
You're using child support to threaten me?

83
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:33,355
I'm not threatening you
with child support.

84
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,825
We should send Jenny
to take ballet classes, don't we?

85
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:38,293
Shut up.

86
00:05:38,293 --> 00:05:41,463
Damn it. Why did I even come here?

87
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:42,531
You take care of everything.

88
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:44,132
Hey.

89
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:47,169
You should've reported it.
Why did you call me?

90
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:48,837
Damn it.

91
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:51,973
If I report it,
they might shoot Sun Jeong.

92
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:01,483
We still raised her together.

93
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:06,888
She followed you the most
like you were her mom.

94
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:08,623
She did.

95
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,829
Sun Jeong.

96
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:15,564
Here.

97
00:06:15,564 --> 00:06:17,432
Sun Jeong, this way.

98
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:18,366
Sun Jeong.

99
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:22,204
Come here.

100
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:30,445
- Come here.
- Sun Jeong.

101
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:32,214
No, come to...

102
00:06:32,214 --> 00:06:33,782
You're here.

103
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:35,016
Seriously?

104
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:38,887
Hey.

105
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:43,191
I feed you and clean up your poop
every single day,

106
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,494
but you only react when Dal Rae calls you.

107
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:46,995
Do you like her more than me?

108
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:50,532
Sun Jeong likes me more. Isn't it obvious?

109
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:52,934
Unbelievable.

110
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:58,206
I do everything by myself,
and I still don't matter at all.

111
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:01,776
And I like you more.

112
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,649
Hey.

113
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:08,884
Really?

114
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:20,328
Are you really going to let
Sun Jeong die and...

115
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:21,596
Damn it.

116
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:24,399
Hey.

117
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,034
What is wrong with you?

118
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:28,370
How long do I have to clean up your shit?

119
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,005
I'm so sick of this.

120
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:31,439
- It hurts.
- Hey.

121
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,842
Why do I always have to suffer?

122
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:36,611
I had it hard too.

123
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,613
What was hard for you?

124
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:40,715
This whole mess is because of you.

125
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,818
Fine.

126
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:44,586
Kill me.

127
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,589
- Kill me too, go ahead.
- Okay, then.

128
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:49,457
Go on, die.

129
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:50,725
Yeah, kill me too.

130
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:52,060
- You really want to die?
- Do it.

131
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,028
You little...

132
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:58,567
Is that Sun Jeong?

133
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:01,336
Yeah.

134
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:02,304
Let's go.

135
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:10,579
You're unbelievably good
at sniffing out poop.

136
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:13,281
Why did she poop so much?

137
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:15,684
Is she constipated?

138
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:17,619
She probably ate a lot.

139
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:20,989
No.

140
00:08:21,957 --> 00:08:23,024
That warmth.

141
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:25,026
That smell.

142
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,761
That look.

143
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:29,698
She definitely pooped not long ago.

144
00:08:31,132 --> 00:08:32,601
She's still nearby.

145
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:34,202
Look at you.

146
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:42,410
You've never fired a tranquilizer gun
before. What are you going to do?

147
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,613
Hey, I served in the military.

148
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,780
Besides,

149
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:48,283
we probably won't even need to use it.

150
00:08:49,217 --> 00:08:51,019
Even if I don't know much,
you're here with me.

151
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:52,521
Wake up.

152
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:54,322
Sun Jeong is a full-grown wolf.

153
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:56,458
A hungry wolf that just pooped.

154
00:08:58,827 --> 00:08:59,761
Wait.

155
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,667
If she pooped that much,
she must be hungry now, right?

156
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,105
What was Sun Jeong's favorite food?

157
00:09:11,673 --> 00:09:12,607
Chicken.

158
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,877
Sun Jeong.

159
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:18,413
Sun Jeong.

160
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:21,416
Sun Jeong, it's me.

161
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:24,352
- Hey.
- What?

162
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:26,655
Do you even know what my favorite food is?

163
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,225
How could I not?

164
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:32,427
You love spicy fish roe stew.

165
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:34,796
You go crazy for the cod milt in it.

166
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:37,766
So you do know.

167
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:41,169
Excuse me.

168
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:43,405
Then do you? Do you know what I like?

169
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:45,707
Of course I do.

170
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:47,309
Black bean noodles,
pork cutlet, and spicy pork.

171
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:49,077
Every guy's top three, right?

172
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:50,178
Unbelievable.

173
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:53,448
I like spicy fish roe stew too.

174
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:54,916
I love cod milt too.

175
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:57,419
You don't even eat milt.

176
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:58,954
You said pollock roe was your favorite.

177
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:07,896
Do you really like milt?

178
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:20,041
I like spicy fish roe stew and cod...

179
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:24,546
Is someone there?

180
00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:26,748
- How do I turn this off?
- What is it?

181
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:28,216
What?

182
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:30,986
My eyes are getting blurry.

183
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:33,155
Did I see that wrong?

184
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:41,163
Goodness.

185
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:48,770
If they find out she escaped,
I'm finished.

186
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:54,075
What was that earlier?

187
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:56,511
Do you really like milt?

188
00:10:58,346 --> 00:10:59,281
Yeah.

189
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:01,983
Because you liked it so much,

190
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,186
I said I didn't like it
and gave it all to you.

191
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:05,153
So what?

192
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:08,423
Really?

193
00:11:10,592 --> 00:11:11,526
Yeah.

194
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:16,832
Are you stupid?

195
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:18,600
How was I supposed to know
if you never said anything?

196
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:20,769
We could've just ordered extra milt.

197
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:22,871
What's the point of that?

198
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:25,373
I was going to give you all of it anyway.

199
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,843
Back then.

200
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:31,079
What are you saying?

201
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:36,351
I just want a hot bowl
of spicy fish roe soup...

202
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:38,286
loaded with cod milt and pollock roe.

203
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:42,390
We can go eat it together later.

204
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:53,702
Goodness.

205
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:58,173
I thought I heard something.

206
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,375
Maybe I imagined it.

207
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:10,785
Sorry.

208
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:18,660
But have you lost weight?
You seem thinner.

209
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:24,966
Are you still taking meds?

210
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:29,404
Do you even know
what kind of medication that was?

211
00:12:31,673 --> 00:12:33,074
Hey, I...

212
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:35,310
No.

213
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:37,412
Goodness.

214
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:40,815
Mom. What's wrong?

215
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:43,485
Mother?

216
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:46,555
Jenny woke up crying all of a sudden,

217
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:49,157
and she's burning up with a fever.

218
00:12:49,457 --> 00:12:50,425
What should we do?

219
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:54,429
Mom, there's a fever reducer
in the kitchen cabinet.

220
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:55,463
I'll be there right away.

221
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:57,799
Wait.

222
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,834
Jenny's sick.

223
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:01,570
If you leave now, you'll get caught.

224
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,138
I said Jenny's sick.

225
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:05,407
Wait. If you go now, he'll notice.
Just a second.

226
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:11,146
Hey, you always put yourself first,
don't you?

227
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:12,314
What?

228
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:14,549
You didn't eat milt because I liked it?

229
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:16,451
If you really liked it,

230
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:18,220
you would've eaten it all yourself.

231
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:23,859
What did I do so wrong this time?

232
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,761
Jenny is sick.

233
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:29,297
But you stopped me
because you're scared you'll get caught...

234
00:13:29,297 --> 00:13:30,832
and it'll blow back on you.

235
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:33,668
Right now, you matter more to you
than your sick daughter.

236
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,438
Hey.

237
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:39,708
Is asking you to wait a minute
really such an unforgivable thing?

238
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,675
Hey.

239
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:43,879
If you hadn't messed up
and dragged me out here,

240
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,647
I'd be with Jenny right now.

241
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:48,383
Honestly,

242
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:51,887
I'm the idiot...

243
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:54,289
for marrying someone like you
and having a kid.

244
00:13:58,493 --> 00:13:59,227
Hey.

245
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:01,363
Hey.

246
00:14:01,363 --> 00:14:02,464
Don't call me "hey."

247
00:14:02,464 --> 00:14:04,699
We're not together anymore,
and I'm older than you.

248
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,301
Are you done talking?

249
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:13,508
Seriously.

250
00:14:14,242 --> 00:14:17,779
Have you ever acknowledged me even once?

251
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:18,580
Have you?

252
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:21,416
I did my best too.

253
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:23,885
I tried my best.

254
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:28,924
What did you try your best at?

255
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:31,593
You kept your job.

256
00:14:32,027 --> 00:14:33,728
But my entire career got cut off.

257
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:36,298
Do you know how much I...

258
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:37,766
How much...

259
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:44,105
Forget it.

260
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:46,107
What's the point
of talking about this now?

261
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:49,878
Whether you find Sun Jeong or not,
do whatever you want.

262
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:01,389
(Staff Only,
Authorized Personnel Only)

263
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:04,192
Go check on Jenny
and let me know what's...

264
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:05,160
Chief Seo.

265
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:08,930
Yes, sir.

266
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:10,465
What are you doing here?

267
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:14,436
Who is this?

268
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,575
Her.

269
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,376
That person.

270
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:24,012
She's my...

271
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:25,714
wife.

272
00:15:26,414 --> 00:15:27,449
Hello.

273
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:30,252
I see.

274
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:32,787
But what brings you here at this hour?

275
00:15:33,221 --> 00:15:35,323
Well,

276
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:36,324
so,

277
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:39,194
I'm on duty tonight,

278
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:41,429
and Sun...

279
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:43,498
Sun...

280
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:45,534
I brought some soondae.

281
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:47,502
Soondae?

282
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:48,303
Yes.

283
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,740
He kept saying he was starving.

284
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,809
Look at this belly.
It's all late-night snacking.

285
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:56,378
Right?

286
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:58,914
- Then we'll get going.
- Yes.

287
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:02,083
Wait a moment.

288
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:07,856
By any chance...

289
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,791
Yes?

290
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:17,465
"Animal Heaven."

291
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:19,467
You were on that show, right?

292
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:21,703
The one who found that cat.

293
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:23,405
Yes.

294
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,944
I cried so much watching that episode.

295
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:30,178
But...

296
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:32,180
can you actually communicate
with animals telepathically?

297
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:37,152
Well, it's not exactly telepathy.

298
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:39,788
It's more about empathy,
understanding how the animal feels.

299
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:44,326
Why would someone who understands that
do something like this?

300
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:49,064
Anyway, it's an honor to meet you.

301
00:16:49,064 --> 00:16:50,031
Thank you.

302
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,134
- Chief Seo.
- Yes, sir.

303
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:55,170
Let's have a drink with some soondae
in the on-call room later.

304
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:57,639
- Okay?
- Okay.

305
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:00,609
Good luck to you too.

306
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:01,843
Yes, thanks.

307
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,880
I'll head out.

308
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,215
Enjoy some time alone together.

309
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,456
A drink in the on-call room?

310
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:17,492
What now, what is it?

311
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:20,929
You never change.

312
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:24,099
You like drinking your butt off
more than your wife and kid.

313
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,667
Drinking my butt off?

314
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,203
Are you going to keep talking like that?

315
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:30,605
Are you going to keep turning me
into trash?

316
00:17:30,605 --> 00:17:32,407
You are trash.

317
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:35,110
I was up every night until dawn
feeding the baby,

318
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,778
while you were out drinking,

319
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:38,914
pulling all-nighters
and crawling home at sunrise.

320
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:41,349
Why do you think I ended up like that?

321
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:44,586
Did you ever even treat me
like a human being when you were pregnant?

322
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:45,921
I can't even.

323
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,858
By someone you once loved,

324
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:52,160
being stared at every day
like you're something to be killed.

325
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,628
Do you have any idea what that feels like?

326
00:17:53,628 --> 00:17:55,597
Forget it.

327
00:17:55,597 --> 00:17:57,532
Even talking about this
is a waste of time.

328
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:00,435
Whether you drink your butt off
or look for Sun Jeong,

329
00:18:00,435 --> 00:18:01,937
clean up your own mess.

330
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:05,407
Fine. Go.

331
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:07,142
Go.

332
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:08,743
I hope you run into Sun Jeong on the way.

333
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:10,645
- You little...
- Stop.

334
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:14,749
How's Jenny?

335
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:17,452
Her fever went down a bit
after the medicine.

336
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:18,787
That's a relief.

337
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:20,121
Yeah, I'm heading over now.

338
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:21,289
About 30 minutes.

339
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:31,466
Hello?

340
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:32,400
Dal Rae.

341
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:35,637
Where did she go?

342
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:37,606
Since I don't hear any cries,

343
00:18:37,606 --> 00:18:39,274
it doesn't seem like anyone's noticed yet.

344
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:45,847
The more I think about Yoo Dal Rae,
the angrier I get.

345
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:49,084
What, try seeing it from her side?

346
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:52,521
She should try it first.

347
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:18,613
Why are you just getting home now?

348
00:19:21,449 --> 00:19:23,118
You scared me.

349
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:26,655
Did you drink again?

350
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:30,592
No, I didn't. I was working late.

351
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:31,660
Yeah?

352
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:34,162
If that's what you say.

353
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:37,399
Hey, Yoo Dal...

354
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:52,514
Should I have mentioned
I knew back then?

355
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:54,816
Whatever.

356
00:19:54,816 --> 00:19:56,384
Whatever.

357
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:12,133
Sun Jeong.

358
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:15,203
It's me, Dal Rae.

359
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:19,174
Don't you remember me?

360
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:38,760
Yeah.

361
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:43,965
We used to be really happy together.

362
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:48,403
Yeah.

363
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,545
Good girl.

364
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:25,440
Let's go back.

365
00:21:26,074 --> 00:21:26,875
Okay?

366
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:30,178
You can't wander around like this.

367
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:40,622
Why did she poop so much?
Is she constipated?

368
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:46,094
Sun Jeong.

369
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:49,297
Are you...

370
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:18,527
Sun Jeong.

371
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:29,938
Sun Jeong, no!

372
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:38,246
Dal Rae, are you okay?

373
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,448
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

374
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:41,416
Let me see.

375
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,287
You asshole. I almost died because of you.

376
00:22:45,287 --> 00:22:47,355
Yeah, I'm the asshole.

377
00:22:47,355 --> 00:22:48,657
I'm sorry.

378
00:22:48,657 --> 00:22:50,192
You're okay though, right?

379
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,234
Sun Jeong.

380
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:03,038
I didn't think she'd go after you too.

381
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:11,046
This won't do. We need to report it.

382
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:22,057
(Chief Seo)

383
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,894
Why isn't this guy answering his phone?

384
00:23:29,397 --> 00:23:30,265
Wait.

385
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:33,869
I think Sun Jeong might be pregnant.

386
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:35,604
What?

387
00:23:36,404 --> 00:23:37,239
Hold on.

388
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:47,148
She may have escaped to make a nest.

389
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:00,662
Damn it.

390
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:04,099
Why does everything I do
turn out like this?

391
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:09,704
With you and Sun Jeong,
there's nothing I ever get right.

392
00:24:09,704 --> 00:24:10,739
It's okay.

393
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:12,908
It might not have shown.

394
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:18,380
If I had checked more carefully,
this wouldn't have happened.

395
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:21,316
And actually,

396
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:25,253
I knew you were taking medication.

397
00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:27,389
What?

398
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:32,227
No, I didn't. I was working late.

399
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:34,262
Hey, Yoo Dal...

400
00:24:50,378 --> 00:24:51,680
(Psychotropic medication)

401
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,548
(Treatment for depression, anxiety,
and obsessive-compulsive disorder)

402
00:24:53,882 --> 00:24:55,016
Panic disorder...

403
00:24:57,986 --> 00:25:01,389
I think I just didn't want to know
any more than that.

404
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:02,858
I was afraid...

405
00:25:03,758 --> 00:25:05,494
that if I showed I knew,

406
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:09,831
it would confirm
that what I knew was right.

407
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:14,202
So I pretended not to know. I'm sorry.

408
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:28,416
You...

409
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:39,594
Did you ever treat me
like a human being when you were pregnant?

410
00:25:40,095 --> 00:25:43,565
By someone you once loved, being stared at
like you're something to be killed.

411
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:45,033
Do you have any idea what that feels like?

412
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:51,406
Seo Dae Kang, get up.

413
00:25:53,742 --> 00:25:54,676
Get up.

414
00:26:01,116 --> 00:26:02,017
Today,

415
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:05,954
when I saw Sun Jeong
get agitated and lunge,

416
00:26:07,322 --> 00:26:09,524
what you said back then
suddenly came to mind.

417
00:26:10,892 --> 00:26:12,427
Back then,

418
00:26:13,695 --> 00:26:15,263
I thought I was the only victim.

419
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:18,900
I understood animals' feelings,

420
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:21,636
but I didn't understand yours.

421
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:24,806
I'm sorry too.

422
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:35,150
No.

423
00:26:38,086 --> 00:26:39,988
You didn't do anything wrong.

424
00:26:41,156 --> 00:26:42,624
It was all my fault.

425
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:45,961
You're overreacting.

426
00:26:49,731 --> 00:26:51,132
I was a coward.

427
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:53,802
I was wrong.

428
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,605
I'm the one to blame.

429
00:26:57,572 --> 00:26:58,607
Dal Rae.

430
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:01,376
I should've held you.

431
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:02,377
What's gotten into you?

432
00:27:02,978 --> 00:27:04,179
Give me a hug.

433
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:07,449
Why are you being like this?
What do you mean, give you a hug?

434
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:11,453
Stop it. I'm not hugging you.

435
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:12,487
Give me a kiss.

436
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:15,257
Hey.

437
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:16,825
Hey.

438
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,695
Right.

439
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:22,831
Sun Jeong's comfort toy.

440
00:27:42,551 --> 00:27:44,719
She's pregnant,
so we can't use a tranquilizer.

441
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:45,687
Right.

442
00:27:46,488 --> 00:27:48,089
Damn it.

443
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:50,826
Okay.

444
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:52,727
I'll lure her.

445
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:55,430
- What?
- That's the best option...

446
00:27:56,298 --> 00:27:57,999
for you, Jenny, and Sun Jeong.

447
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:01,002
Are you insane?

448
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:03,638
If you die, I'm the one
who has to deal with the aftermath.

449
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:04,539
Then what do you want me to do?

450
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:06,842
What do you think?
We find her and send her back safely.

451
00:28:07,075 --> 00:28:08,610
Every time I say I'll do something,
you start nagging.

452
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,845
Don't talk nonsense.

453
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,969
Lure her.

454
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:34,903
You said you would.

455
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:36,204
Dal Rae, you do it. You're older than me.

456
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:37,706
Sun Jeong likes you more. Come on.

457
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:38,807
You only mention I'm older
at times like these.

458
00:28:39,975 --> 00:28:42,277
- Jenny needs her mom.
- She needs her dad too.

459
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:43,745
Her dad is basically already gone.

460
00:28:43,745 --> 00:28:45,213
You're the one who kicked him out.

461
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:47,048
Then you should've done better sooner.

462
00:28:49,784 --> 00:28:51,920
Wait. Sun Jeong.

463
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,356
- Get the gun.
- Gun.

464
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:56,158
Here's the gun.

465
00:28:56,158 --> 00:28:57,325
Shoot.

466
00:28:57,325 --> 00:28:59,094
What? Are you joking right now?

467
00:29:00,095 --> 00:29:01,530
You're insane. I'm leaving.

468
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,932
No.

469
00:29:03,932 --> 00:29:05,267
If you're going to die, die on your own.

470
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:21,883
That's when I realized.

471
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:27,122
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

472
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:31,359
The wedding was brutal.

473
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,261
I thought I was going to starve.

474
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:35,764
Here's the cod milt you love so much.

475
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:38,033
It's hot.

476
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:41,803
It's really good. Try it.

477
00:29:41,803 --> 00:29:43,438
No, you eat it all. I don't like milt.

478
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:46,708
But milt is the best. It's so good.

479
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:49,978
It's good.

480
00:29:51,012 --> 00:29:52,647
I promise to make you happy.

481
00:29:54,983 --> 00:29:56,084
Let's live well together.

482
00:29:57,052 --> 00:29:59,054
- I love you.
- I love you.

483
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:02,624
- Stop giving everything to me.
- Just one more.

484
00:30:02,624 --> 00:30:04,359
We really did love each other.

485
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:06,127
Is it good?

486
00:30:06,127 --> 00:30:08,196
And when that burning love ended...

487
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:12,601
It wasn't just one person's fault.

488
00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:27,148
- What?
- What?

489
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,858
Get in.

490
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:16,264
Check on Jenny,
and let me know how she is.

491
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:18,066
Okay.

492
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:22,070
It's gotten colder.

493
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:24,506
Take care.

494
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,041
Yeah.

495
00:31:27,475 --> 00:31:30,045
Dress warmly. It's cold these days.

496
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:31,279
- Right.
- Yeah.

497
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:41,189
- Bye.
- Bye.

498
00:31:41,189 --> 00:31:41,923

501
00:31:50,665 --> 00:31:51,733
Wake up.

502
00:31:52,634 --> 00:31:53,768
Come on, let's go.

503
00:31:54,603 --> 00:31:56,037
Let's go.

505
00:31:57,806 --> 00:32:01,610
Hey, my baby.
You got dressed all by yourself?

506
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,178
Who do you take after to be this pretty?

507
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:04,946
(Mom is the bubble queen.
Dad only looks at Jenny.)

508
00:32:04,946 --> 00:32:06,114
Dad and Mom.

509
00:32:06,114 --> 00:32:08,283
Not Mom and Dad?

510
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:10,886
You're making it hard. Don't ask.

511
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:12,087
Let's hurry.

512
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:14,022
Okay, let's go.
