1
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:29,653
(Kim Sun Young, Kim Dan)

2
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:32,489
(Oh Woo Ri, Kim Hak Sun)

3
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:40,196
This is actually good news.

4
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:42,165
I guess I was lucky.

5
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:43,500
Right?

6
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:50,240
They caught it early.
They said it's treatable.

7
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:53,810
Just don't tell Min Woo yet.

8
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:58,081
It's his final semester,
and he's really busy right now.

9
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:01,751
And he's even in Seoul.
What if he comes all the way here?

10
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:03,119
Even if it's stage one,

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,922
this isn't a cold. It's lung cancer.

12
00:01:06,423 --> 00:01:08,124
You can't just hide something like that.

13
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:10,827
Well,

14
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:14,698
he said he can't come home for a while...

15
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:16,266
because he's busy with his thesis
and job hunting.

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,702
So if we can hide it, then we hide it.

17
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:20,570
Okay?

18
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,453
Should I skip the alumni meeting?
I feel bad.

19
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:39,956
You already packed everything.

20
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,792
Then for the kimchi-making,

21
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:45,595
I'll come tomorrow,
and we'll do it together.

22
00:01:45,595 --> 00:01:47,297
No, it's fine. If we don't do it today,

23
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:49,265
you won't even have kimchi
to eat tomorrow.

24
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:51,201
Skipping it for one day won't kill me.

25
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:52,102
Really?

26
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:55,372
You, who can't take a single bite
without homemade kimchi?

27
00:01:56,706 --> 00:01:58,141
Then I'm really not doing it.

28
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,342
You're the one who said it's fine.

29
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:03,146
Should I really not tell Min Woo?

30
00:02:03,813 --> 00:02:06,950
Later, I'll tell him myself.

31
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,851
You can go.

32
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,098
Please wait for me.

33
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:24,768
Thank you.

34
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:27,170
Mom.

35
00:02:28,938 --> 00:02:31,207
How did you get here?

36
00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:32,242
Get in, quick.

37
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:44,888
Mom, should I take all this
into the kitchen?

38
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:48,124
Yeah. I'll head out in a minute.

39
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:54,431
- Just put it there.
- Okay.

40
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:57,067
Or should I put it out on the balcony?

41
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:00,270
Why wait to do it with Dad tomorrow?
Let's just do it now, with me.

42
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:03,640
And how about kimchi and boiled pork...

43
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:06,710
with soju for dinner today?

44
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,844
Soju, all of a sudden?

45
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:11,181
Fine, let's make kimchi.
But you're the only one drinking.

46
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:12,649
I'm on a diet.

47
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:17,821
Let's see how that diet holds up
in front of kimchi and boiled pork.

48
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,312
Anything I can help with?

49
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:43,179
This.

50
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:45,448
- Try it.
- Okay.

51
00:03:51,488 --> 00:03:52,689
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:57,494 --> 00:04:01,164
(Kimchi)

53
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,567
Done.

54
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,611
You really won't eat it?

55
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,414
That's not like you.

56
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:20,283
You don't know me.

57
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:23,787
And you, drunk like this,
don't feel like my son either.

58
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:27,791
You don't know me either, Mom.

59
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:31,394
How could I not know
the son I gave birth to in pain?

60
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:36,666
Looking at you,

61
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,868
I can see
you've been worrying a lot lately...

62
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:41,938
about job hunting.

63
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,042
So much that you came all the way home...

64
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:47,877
without saying a word.

65
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:51,414
Don't put yourself down.

66
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:56,019
You know you've been my pride
my whole life, right?

67
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,623
Not because you achieved something
or became someone.

68
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:04,628
- Just you, as you are...
- Makes you proud?

69
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:08,331
That's right.

70
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:10,000
If you need anything, just say the word.

71
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:15,472
Then, Mom.

72
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:16,272
Yeah?

73
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:20,877
Can you lend me 1,000 dollars?

74
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:25,949
My English scores just won't go up,
so I looked into an academy,

75
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,386
and the tuition is 1,000 dollars.

76
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:34,357
You didn't come all this way
just for that, did you?

77
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:39,129
You're busy. You could've just called.

78
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:41,598
If you told Dad, that would me...

79
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:43,199
Is there more soju?

80
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:45,568
You want to drink more?

81
00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:46,403
Yeah.

82
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:49,139
I want more.

83
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:54,577
(Husband)

84
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:56,980
Min Woo will be here tomorrow,

85
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,215
so be careful what you say
about my illness.

86
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:01,451
I made kimchi with Min Woo,
so don't worry.

87
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:04,154
It turned out really well.

88
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,858
(Start aptitude test problem-solving)

89
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:54,771
(Kang Sae Ra)

90
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:02,879
So what about the 1,000 dollars?

91
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:04,681
Did you manage to get it?

92
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,252
Did you get the money to give
that bastard who's blackmailing you?

93
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,254
Hello?

94
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:13,556
Did you say blackmail?

95
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:32,676
(Please enter your fingerprint or PIN.)

96
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:56,800
I can finally get through.

97
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:00,003
I've been waiting for you to answer.

98
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:01,338
I'm...

99
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:04,975
trying to make sense of this,
so let me ask clearly.

100
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:07,344
My Min Woo...

101
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:10,447
came home...

102
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:13,883
and asked for 1,000 dollars for tuition...

103
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:17,554
because of...

104
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:21,024
someone's blackmail?

105
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,794
Talk to Min Woo directly when he wakes up.

106
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:26,196
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:29,132
If he doesn't send the money
or report it to the police,

108
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,267
they're going to...

109
00:08:32,902 --> 00:08:35,772
expose that my son, Min Woo,

110
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:42,746
is "that?"

111
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:45,348
To his family, school, everything?

112
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,328
That's ridiculous.

113
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:00,864
That's not true.

114
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:01,998
Excuse me?

115
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,634
That's not true.

116
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:07,504
I can't even.

117
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:11,074
Didn't you see the photo
in the blackmail message?

118
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:13,209
I said it's not true.

119
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,211
Do you think I don't know my own son?

120
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:17,180
I'm his mother.

121
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:20,050
Then who are you?

122
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,551
Who are you?

123
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:23,987
Who do you think you are,
acting like you know Min Woo so well?

124
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:26,656
Just a friend.

125
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:02,859
What are you doing, Mom? Drinking?

126
00:10:06,596 --> 00:10:08,765
You said you weren't going to drink.

127
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:12,636
I sent 1,000 dollars to your account.

128
00:10:15,372 --> 00:10:17,007
What? Is Dad home?

129
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:21,378
No.

130
00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:24,781
I'm not telling your dad.

131
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:26,616
- There's nothing to tell.
- What?

132
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:31,621
When I remarried,
and we lived in that tiny room,

133
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:34,157
how old were you back then?

134
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:36,826
About ten, right?

135
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:43,466
You must be pretty drunk
since you're talking about the old days.

136
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:46,303
Do you remember what I used to tell you...

137
00:10:47,537 --> 00:10:49,406
all the time back then?

138
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,143
"Always remember this."

139
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:55,211
"For both you and me."

140
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:58,882
"In front of your stepfather
and grandmother."

141
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,751
I said once is a mistake,

142
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:05,422
but twice is a failure.

143
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:11,695
What are you trying to say?

144
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:21,571
You made a mistake, just once.

145
00:11:22,238 --> 00:11:23,139
Right?

146
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,212
One thousand dollars is cheap.

147
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,781
If anything, we were lucky,

148
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:34,517
because you caught it early.

149
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,855
But Mom, this is...

150
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:41,257
If you learned something from this,

151
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,927
that's enough.

152
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:46,796
Failure is not an option.

153
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:56,640
But this...

154
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:01,611
isn't a mistake,
and blackmailing is a crime.

155
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,981
I was blackmailed.

156
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:07,350
So you're saying that that's true?

157
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:11,621
No. It's a mistake.

158
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:16,660
Mom,

159
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:20,563
you're angry at me right now, aren't you?

160
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,367
Not at the blackmailer, but at me.

161
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:30,307
When...

162
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,111
I was blackmailed, I was scared.

163
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:37,013
I was scared you'd react like this, Mom.

164
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,149
Get a grip, Min Woo.

165
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,519
You just pay the money and end it.

166
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:00,303
You can't do this to me, Min Woo.

167
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:03,373
I have cancer.

168
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:04,841
Lung cancer.

169
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:09,846
The doctor strictly forbade alcohol.

170
00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:12,682
But I drank...

171
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:15,518
because of you.

172
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:21,424
Go to bed.

173
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:47,984
I'll take the first train back to Seoul.

174
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:49,853
I'm sorry.

175
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:52,555
And the 1,000 dollars.

176
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:54,624
Thank you.

177
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:11,207
The day after you left,

178
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:14,077
I threw up in the middle of a meal.

179
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:22,118
As you can see,
the tumor was completely removed.

180
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:23,553
My throat gets hoarse often.

181
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,590
When I cough, phlegm keeps coming up.

182
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:34,864
But I'm fine.

183
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:36,366
I really am.

184
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,001
You know why?

185
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:40,603
No matter how serious cancer is,

186
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:42,973
if you treat it, it gets better.

187
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,542
You can overcome it.

188
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:49,813
If even cancer can be cured,

189
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:51,581
then you can also cure "that."

190
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:57,387
I love you very much, son.

191
00:14:58,455 --> 00:14:59,522
You know that, right?

192
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,104
But are you really that busy?

193
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:17,273
Why haven't you contacted me for days?

194
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:18,908
(3 weeks later)

195
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:23,346
I thought I'd bring it myself
and see his face while I'm at it.

196
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:27,350
Honey, I'm here. I'll hang up now.

197
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,471
Min Woo.

198
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,840
Min Woo.

199
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:05,221
My goodness.

200
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:06,990
I'm so sorry.

201
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,494
I just brought some kimchi.

202
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:14,831
I truly had no idea...

203
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:16,900
that Min Woo had a girlfriend.

204
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:23,039
I mean,
he hasn't been in touch at all lately.

205
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:27,077
But I worried for nothing.

206
00:16:28,678 --> 00:16:30,146
A girlfriend? That makes no sense.

207
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:33,183
If you're not his girlfriend, who are you?

208
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:39,689
These days, do friends also...

209
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:43,293
Don't you remember me?

210
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,830
- You?
- We spoke on the phone last time.

211
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,635
I'm Kang Sae Ra.

212
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,936
We talked about the 1,000 dollars
last time.

213
00:16:58,008 --> 00:16:58,842
I see.

214
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:02,479
Okay.

215
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:09,886
Do you know where Min Woo is right now?

216
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:12,622
Why isn't he answering his phone?

217
00:17:13,957 --> 00:17:15,125
He disappeared.

218
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:18,595
It's been about two weeks now.

219
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:29,272
That day,

220
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:32,642
Min Woo sent the 1,000 dollars.

221
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:36,613
The guy who appeared in the photo
with him was blackmailed too,

222
00:17:37,747 --> 00:17:39,382
but he didn't send the money.

223
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:40,917
And then,

224
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:45,255
the photos were actually sent
to his family and everyone around him.

225
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,957
And a few days later,

226
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:49,526
he died.

227
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,703
In those photos that were sent,

228
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,471
did my kid's face show up too?

229
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:03,306
It didn't, right?

230
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,175
His face was covered, right?

231
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,115
Thankfully, it was covered.

232
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,652
He was Min Woo's boyfriend.

233
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,257
When I came here to check,

234
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:23,660
he was packing his things.

235
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,130
He said the blackmailer told him
the moment he reported it,

236
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,799
everything would be exposed
across the entire university.

237
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,601
That can't happen.

238
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,203
That absolutely cannot happen.

239
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:35,672
I asked him why he was packing.

240
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:36,773
And what did he say?

241
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:40,510
The blackmailer demanded 5,000 this time.

242
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,444
What?

243
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:46,316
He couldn't bring himself...

244
00:18:47,717 --> 00:18:49,152
to ask his mom, who has cancer,
for money again.

245
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:56,259
He's not the kind to run away
or cut off contact.

246
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:58,161
He's a genuinely good kid.

247
00:18:58,161 --> 00:19:00,864
He's never once caused trouble
since he was young.

248
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:04,634
Please send your son's photos
to this number first.

249
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:05,869
Okay.

250
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:09,105
Nothing serious will happen, right?

251
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,075
For now, we'll keep tracking his location,

252
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:15,078
and we'll contact you
as soon as we get a signal.

253
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:16,279
Yes, thank you.

254
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,650
But you said you visited the house
three weeks ago, right?

255
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,618
Yes.

256
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:23,186
Does anything come to mind?

257
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:26,589
Well,

258
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:33,797
he was really struggling with job hunting.

259
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:52,349
I'm only telling you this just in case.

260
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:56,453
I'm the only one who knows...

261
00:19:57,754 --> 00:19:59,422
that Oh Min Woo likes men.

262
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,595
What kind of relationship are you two?

263
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:09,232
I told you already
that we're just friends.

264
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:11,034
There's no such thing
between a man and a woman.

265
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:16,172
Do you like Min Woo?

266
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,641
No.

267
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:19,743
Not at all.

268
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,447
Jin Hyeok and Min Woo were together
for a long time.

269
00:20:25,148 --> 00:20:27,083
They even waited through military service
for each other.

270
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:29,552
So that makes it years.

271
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:32,722
Right. Jin Hyeok is...

272
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:33,790
Stop.

273
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,893
I got the answer to my question.

274
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:38,695
That's the name of the boy who died.

275
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,764
I said stop.

276
00:20:41,097 --> 00:20:41,965
I miss them.

277
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,802
Both Jin Hyeok and Min Woo.

278
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:49,239
They're friends I truly love.

279
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,574
You don't "like" Min Woo,

280
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:55,078
but you "love" him?

281
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:56,346
Yes.

282
00:20:57,681 --> 00:20:58,815
I love him.

283
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:03,820
Do you think...

284
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,326
you love Min Woo
more than I do, his mother?

285
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:12,195
You know,

286
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,130
I genuinely...

287
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:18,935
worry about and care for Min Woo.

288
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:21,438
That's what love is.

289
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,542
And since we're talking about it,
let me say this.

290
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,211
In the end,

291
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:32,782
look at what happened
to that friend, Jin Hyeok.

292
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:59,342
Do you know why Jin Hyeok
didn't send the money?

293
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,780
He trusted his family.

294
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:06,549
He believed
that kind of blackmail wouldn't work.

295
00:22:06,816 --> 00:22:08,718
That it would be okay
even if it was exposed.

296
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:10,020
That's a big dream.

297
00:22:12,522 --> 00:22:14,958
What kind of parent would support that?

298
00:22:16,326 --> 00:22:17,894
What kind of parent...

299
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:20,063
would encourage it?

300
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,401
Right.

301
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:29,706
So Min Woo's dream was small.

302
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,012
I'll scrape together
that 5,000 dollars somehow...

303
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:37,881
and end it, got it?

304
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:39,449
What if the amount keeps going up?

305
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,118
Will you keep paying whatever they demand?

306
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,388
The reason the blackmailer
can run wild isn't Min Woo.

307
00:22:45,388 --> 00:22:47,524
It's people like you.

308
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:48,692
Watch your mouth.

309
00:22:49,392 --> 00:22:51,428
Did I blackmail him? How is this my fault?

310
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:53,263
What if he cuts off contact completely?

311
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:56,433
What will you do
if you never see him again?

312
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:59,836
You say you love him so much,
but you really don't know Min Woo.

313
00:23:00,403 --> 00:23:02,739
Min Woo would never do that.

314
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:03,606
Got it?

315
00:23:05,575 --> 00:23:07,043
You're being incredibly cruel.

316
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:10,547
Why do you keep blaming me?

317
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,582
You know exactly
what kind of kid Min Woo is,

318
00:23:13,883 --> 00:23:15,685
and that makes you even more cruel.

319
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,189
Stepfather and grandmother
don't like rude behavior.

320
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:54,524
And what do they like?

321
00:23:54,524 --> 00:23:55,525
Kimchi.

322
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:57,294
Homemade kimchi.

323
00:23:57,994 --> 00:23:59,729
You salt the napa cabbage yourself,

324
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,965
grind apples and pears,

325
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:03,700
add salted shrimp and onion syrup,

326
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,436
then season it with anchovy fish sauce.

327
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:08,305
You don't need to know all that.

328
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,407
But what are you going to do now, Mom?

329
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:12,609
You can't eat kimchi.

330
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:14,311
You ate kimchi with me
and ended up throwing up.

331
00:24:15,445 --> 00:24:18,114
It's nothing. I'll eat it.

332
00:24:18,114 --> 00:24:19,983
There's nothing effort can't overcome.

333
00:24:19,983 --> 00:24:21,818
I tried, but you still couldn't eat it.

334
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,788
Min Woo.

335
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:30,026
We can live like everyone else now.

336
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,194
Okay?

337
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:32,562
Yeah.

338
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:43,306
Min Woo.

339
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:45,475
Hey.

340
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:47,277
What's that?

341
00:24:48,178 --> 00:24:49,079
Thanks.

342
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,851
The weather's nice.

343
00:25:33,256 --> 00:25:35,058
(My Son)

344
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,094
Hello? Min Woo?

345
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:40,096
Min Woo.

346
00:25:40,363 --> 00:25:41,298
Mom.

347
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:42,766
Yeah.

348
00:25:42,766 --> 00:25:44,501
Sorry I haven't been in touch.

349
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:47,804
Are you feeling okay?

350
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,675
What about you?

351
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:54,411
Me? I'm doing fine.

352
00:25:55,078 --> 00:25:57,647
I was actually thinking of going home
this weekend.

353
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,450
Do you and Dad have time?

354
00:26:00,784 --> 00:26:02,185
It's been a while
since we last saw each other.

355
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,086
He's here.

356
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:07,157
Hey.

357
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,458
Actually,

358
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:12,362
I have a girlfriend now,
and I wanted to introduce her to you, Mom.

359
00:26:13,763 --> 00:26:15,165
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

360
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:24,541
We really can't eat that much, ma'am.

361
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:27,911
You can stop peeling now
and maybe say something too.

362
00:26:28,178 --> 00:26:29,279
Yes.

363
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,480
Well, what should I say?

364
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,917
She's been asking all along
what I was like when I was young.

365
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:35,919
I see.

366
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,856
I'll just go to the bathroom for a moment.

367
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,665
They're suggesting
we go eat kimchi stew nearby.

368
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:23,066
They say it's a place people line up for.

369
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:27,504
I see.

370
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:30,540
Okay, let's go.

371
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,478
Do you feel a bit more at ease?

372
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,013
I feel uncomfortable...

373
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:42,152
watching Min Woo try so hard,

374
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:43,253
putting on this ridiculous performance...

375
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:45,555
for Min Woo's sake,

376
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,227
and pretending not to know anything.

377
00:27:59,202 --> 00:28:01,972
Let's say I understand that.

378
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,776
But then, what about everyone else?

379
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:10,013
Just because one person understands,

380
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:12,716
what actually changes?

381
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:14,617
What are you, Sailor Moon?

382
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:17,354
Who worries about the whole world
these days?

383
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:35,205
It's good, right?

384
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:36,773
My wife and I...

385
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:39,509
have been promoting this place
even before it was on TV.

386
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:41,611
- It's really good.
- Is it?

387
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:44,280
That's a relief. Eat up.

388
00:28:45,448 --> 00:28:48,385
You're really acting like a man, Min Woo.

389
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:50,754
Hey, I picked the right menu.

390
00:28:50,754 --> 00:28:52,722
Seeing you act like that is so cheesy,
so I need kimchi.

391
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,059
- Just to keep from staining her sleeve.
- Okay.

392
00:28:57,494 --> 00:28:58,561
Thank you for the meal.

393
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,635
Look how crowded it is.

394
00:29:41,271 --> 00:29:43,440
Why? Didn't you sleep?

395
00:29:45,442 --> 00:29:46,843
Or did you wake up
in the middle of the night?

396
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:52,682
Did you two decide to sleep separately?

397
00:29:53,817 --> 00:29:55,752
We're not at that stage yet.

398
00:29:58,021 --> 00:29:59,990
But you're at the stage
of bringing her home?

399
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:06,096
I just wanted to show her to you and Dad.

400
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:09,699
What's that?

401
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:14,738
This? It's popular these days.

402
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,539
Let me see.

403
00:30:17,974 --> 00:30:19,309
Is that popular these days?

404
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:23,046
Let me see.

405
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:30,253
What's wrong?

406
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:32,522
- It's not that, right?
- Why are you suddenly being like this?

407
00:30:32,856 --> 00:30:34,557
Min Woo, it's not that, right?

408
00:30:35,592 --> 00:30:38,361
What are you talking about?

409
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,635
Nothing. Sleep.

410
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:48,004
Good night.

411
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:52,942
Do you really want to see it?

412
00:30:58,381 --> 00:30:59,416
What did you say?

413
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,786
All right, let's see.

414
00:31:04,087 --> 00:31:05,021
Show me.

415
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,024
Show me.

416
00:31:11,194 --> 00:31:12,262
You're not that kind of kid.

417
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:14,931
Min Woo.

418
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:17,367
You are not that kind of kid.

419
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:19,436
Say you're not.

420
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:21,638
Say it right now.

421
00:31:22,872 --> 00:31:24,574
That's not you.

422
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,692
Say it.

423
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:44,995
Say that you're not.

424
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,734
(Deposit 10,000 dollars.
No payment, photos released.)

425
00:32:05,448 --> 00:32:06,516
Oh Min Woo, where are you going?

426
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:09,352
Answer me before you go. Come here.

427
00:32:09,786 --> 00:32:10,787
Min Woo.

428
00:32:30,173 --> 00:32:33,009
He's not answering his phone at all.
Where did he go?

429
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,812
Sae Ra has to go now,

430
00:32:36,112 --> 00:32:39,115
so I'll drop her off at the terminal
and come back, okay?

431
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:36,740
Do you really have to eat it?

432
00:33:41,344 --> 00:33:43,213
I'll take your side, Mom.

433
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:47,317
I'll convince them
that some people just don't like kimchi.

434
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:50,887
Isn't just me enough?

435
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:57,560
At least you have me on your side.

436
00:33:58,261 --> 00:33:59,095
Okay?

437
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,368
That's right, Min Woo.

438
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:15,512
I...

439
00:34:18,114 --> 00:34:19,282
held on...

440
00:34:21,785 --> 00:34:22,819
because of you.

441
00:34:27,724 --> 00:34:28,625
I...

442
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,062
survived.

443
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:39,636
Every time,

444
00:34:41,738 --> 00:34:42,639
for me,

445
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,908
you...

446
00:35:08,264 --> 00:35:09,966
Do you know where Min Woo might be?

447
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,102
There's something
I really need to say to him.

448
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:14,604
I don't know where he is either.

449
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,008
But...

450
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,645
if he went somewhere,

451
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,347
he probably went to Jin Hyeok.

452
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:27,817
The place where his ashes were scattered.

453
00:35:29,185 --> 00:35:32,155
The place where Jin Hyeok was scattered
like he was thrown away.

454
00:35:39,562 --> 00:35:40,530
Min Woo.

455
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:45,001
Min Woo.

456
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:49,773
Min Woo.

457
00:35:54,644 --> 00:35:55,812
Min Woo.

458
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,184
Min Woo.

459
00:36:02,485 --> 00:36:04,087
Min Woo.

460
00:36:16,232 --> 00:36:17,167
Every time,

461
00:36:17,867 --> 00:36:20,470
you...

462
00:36:21,705 --> 00:36:22,739
saved me.

463
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,209
Mom.

464
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:13,189
You...

465
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,825
never made a mistake.

466
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,629
So you never failed.

467
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,299
How did you get here, Mom?

468
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,901
I made the mistake. I did.

469
00:37:25,602 --> 00:37:27,337
So don't let me fail...

470
00:37:27,337 --> 00:37:28,638
by carrying this alone.

471
00:37:31,808 --> 00:37:32,809
I was wrong.

472
00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:35,679
Please, just give me one chance.

473
00:37:37,314 --> 00:37:40,750
I was wrong, okay?

474
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,651
I'm sorry.

475
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:43,286
I'm sorry.

476
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:51,828
Let me see.

477
00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:14,217
Let's go.

478
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:17,220
Let's go together.

479
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:22,158
Mom, I'm sorry.

480
00:38:25,562 --> 00:38:26,529
I'm not going.

481
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:29,432
Min Woo.

482
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,303
Let's go to the police station together.

483
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,409
Let's go together.

484
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,725
It's okay.

485
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:03,400
It's okay.

486
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:07,704
Mom, I'm sorry.

487
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:24,788
Honey, what is all this?

488
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:27,424
The house is a mess,
you're not answering your phone,

489
00:39:27,424 --> 00:39:28,758
and now the police station?

490
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:31,594
There's something
I need to tell you, honey.

491
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:33,263
What is it?

492
00:39:34,297 --> 00:39:36,866
Well, what I mean is...

493
00:39:42,305 --> 00:39:43,707
about the kimchi.

494
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:46,643
Kimchi?

495
00:39:46,643 --> 00:39:50,246
Why did it take me 15 years to say this?

496
00:39:52,115 --> 00:39:53,383
Over something so small.

497
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,785
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

498
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:57,520
This is nothing.

499
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,522
So why did I never even show it,

500
00:40:00,957 --> 00:40:04,160
and try so desperately like that?

501
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:07,764
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

502
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:10,433
Exactly.

503
00:40:12,335 --> 00:40:14,704
If I say that a little over a month...

504
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,509
is still too short a time for me,

505
00:40:22,445 --> 00:40:23,380
would that make sense?

506
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:27,417
If the only thing
I can barely understand...

507
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:32,222
is just kimchi,

508
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,992
would Min Woo understand?

509
00:40:39,095 --> 00:40:41,031
Honey, you're scaring me now.

510
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:45,368
I really...

511
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,408
Min Woo.

512
00:41:02,152 --> 00:41:03,720
hate kimchi.

513
00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:13,930
(Kimchi)
