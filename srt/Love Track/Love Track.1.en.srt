00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:48,906
I want it.

190
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:51,142
Just one last time.

191
00:17:57,214 --> 00:17:58,182
Okay.

192
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,218
I'll be generous.

193
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:03,521
A regular's perk.

194
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:06,324
Thank you so much.

195
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:10,962
Wait. No, this is bad.

196
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:22,640
Why aren't you peeling the onions?

197
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:24,775
Me?

198
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:27,745
You said it was a regular's perk.

199
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:45,096
Are you crying?

200
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:49,133
These onions are really strong.

201
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:53,437
That's why I took it off the menu.

202
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:57,408
Really?

203
00:18:57,808 --> 00:18:58,509
No.

204
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:00,778
Come on.

205
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:03,314
Why do you keep saying that?
Are you messing with me?

206
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:06,017
Every time you ordered it,

207
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:07,818
I peeled onions like that.

208
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:09,754
That's part of your job.

209
00:19:09,754 --> 00:19:12,223
I also clean the pharmacy
without complaining...

210
00:19:12,223 --> 00:19:13,424
when a younger pharmacist tells me to.

211
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:14,759
Because that's my job.

212
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,294
The 15th of every month.

213
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:19,063
How did you know?

214
00:19:19,463 --> 00:19:21,632
You always came in on the 15th
looking like you'd chewed on dirt...

215
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:23,134
and ordered onion soup.

216
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:27,572
I didn't look like I chewed on dirt.

217
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:33,444
You make the onion soup today.

218
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:36,514
I thought I only had to peel onions.

219
00:19:37,548 --> 00:19:40,017
You should learn how to make it
if you plan to eat it on your own later.

220
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,787
I told you. I'm not selling it anymore.

221
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:45,556
I mean, why aren't you...

222
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:50,027
Should I tell you my recipe or not?

223
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,564
Please tell me.

224
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:57,201
The key to onion soup...

225
00:19:58,002 --> 00:19:59,070
is waiting.

226
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:04,008
On low heat, very gently,

227
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:06,577
stir constantly so it doesn't burn.

228
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:12,450
Okay.

229
00:20:16,654 --> 00:20:18,289
How long is "constantly?"

230
00:20:18,756 --> 00:20:20,124
About 40 minutes.

231
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:21,592
Forty minutes?

232
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:23,828
It really takes that long?

233
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:28,065
That's why the flavor is so deep.

234
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:29,333
That's strange.

235
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,936
When I ordered it,
it felt like it came out in ten minutes.

236
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:34,238
I prep in advance.

237
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:36,107
I can't make customers wait that long.

238
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:38,476
But you never know
if anyone will order it or not.

239
00:20:39,377 --> 00:20:40,878
What if no one orders?

240
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:43,781
Then I throw it away.

241
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:48,753
What are you doing?

242
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:50,488
I told you to keep stirring
so it doesn't burn.

243
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:56,427
These onions are starting to cook down.

244
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:59,030
If you keep cooking,
the onions turn brown.

245
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,265
That's called caramelization.

246
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:05,069
Just keep going for another 35 minutes.

247
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:07,471
Thirty-five more minutes?

248
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,342
You can go take a break.

249
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:47,345
They're brown.

250
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,452
It's not perfect,

251
00:21:54,452 --> 00:21:55,253
but okay.

252
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:58,356
- Add the water.
- Okay.

253
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:17,708
This smell.

254
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:20,011
You recognize it, right?

255
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:22,647
What's next?

256
00:22:23,614 --> 00:22:24,382
That's it.

257
00:22:25,182 --> 00:22:27,184
- What?
- Simple, right?

258
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:29,387
That's all there is to onion soup.

259
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:32,290
But all I did was cook onions.

260
00:22:33,925 --> 00:22:35,459
The key to onion soup...

261
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:37,795
is waiting.

262
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,798
Time itself is the recipe.

263
00:22:41,832 --> 00:22:45,169
Spending time cooking and waiting.

264
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:48,506
That's all.

265
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:53,978
Waiting.

266
00:22:56,013 --> 00:22:57,381
Slice the bread like this.

267
00:22:57,381 --> 00:22:59,984
Then place the slices like this.

268
00:23:03,187 --> 00:23:04,355
Top lots of cheese,

269
00:23:05,523 --> 00:23:07,124
and bake for ten minutes in an oven.

270
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:10,027
I don't have an oven.

271
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:14,065
Then just use the microwave.

272
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:16,734
- You just need to melt the cheese.
- Okay.

273
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:36,654
But what did you mean earlier?

274
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:38,556
About what?

275
00:23:38,556 --> 00:23:39,857
In front of the restaurant,

276
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,693
you said I was too cruel to my joy.

277
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:45,930
You know,

278
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:50,201
my food isn't a dumping ground
for emotions.

279
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:52,536
That's not what I meant.

280
00:23:52,536 --> 00:23:54,005
Then what did you mean?

281
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:57,241
Your irritation, anger, depression,

282
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:59,010
sadness, pain, anguish.

283
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,679
You just pour them all out and leave.

284
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,315
That's not it at all.

285
00:24:07,218 --> 00:24:08,252
Then what is it?

286
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:11,489
Actually,

287
00:24:13,691 --> 00:24:15,359
there's nothing fun in my life.

288
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:17,628
Nothing to look forward to.

289
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:20,097
Every day feels the same.

290
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:25,236
So...

291
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:30,107
it feels like I've accomplished nothing,
even though I try hard.

292
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:31,676
I feel like I've just gotten older.

293
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:36,113
I'm really boring, right?

294
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:39,417
No.

295
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:45,823
You're incredibly, unbelievably boring.

296
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:53,664
And then I found...

297
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:56,100
your warm onion soup.

298
00:25:18,823 --> 00:25:19,690
What?

299
00:25:20,324 --> 00:25:22,526
Is it too sad to eat
because it's the last onion soup?

300
00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:24,428
No.

301
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:27,098
You made it today,

302
00:25:27,098 --> 00:25:30,067
so you can cook it at home anytime.

303
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:35,873
I'll enjoy it.

304
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:55,626
It's so good, so I'm asking.

305
00:25:55,626 --> 00:25:57,395
Can you please just sell it again?

306
00:25:57,395 --> 00:25:58,863
Don't take it off the menu.

307
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:01,933
I didn't want to wait.

308
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:04,635
What?

309
00:26:04,635 --> 00:26:06,304
I didn't want to wait for you.

310
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,509
That's why I took onion soup off the menu.

311
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:13,244
What are you...

312
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:16,581
You're joking again, right?

313
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:17,615
This one's...

314
00:26:18,816 --> 00:26:19,750
not a joke.

315
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,720
But why...

316
00:26:28,693 --> 00:26:29,727
Welcome.

317
00:26:45,943 --> 00:26:47,678
What can I get you?

318
00:26:47,678 --> 00:26:49,247
What's the hottest dish on the menu?

319
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:53,918
Onion soup. Shall I get you that?

320
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:06,731
Anyone would think the world had ended.

321
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:12,270
I hope this gives him some energy.

322
00:27:14,105 --> 00:27:15,339
Enjoy your meal.

323
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:41,899
How was the dish?

324
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:44,302
Yeah, it was so,

325
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:45,970
so delicious.

326
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:47,772
Thank you.

327
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,275
That's a relief.

328
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:57,114
At first, it was interesting...

329
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:01,819
how different you were
before and after eating it.

330
00:28:07,525 --> 00:28:10,061
It was also kind of funny.

331
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:36,487
I enjoy your dish every time.

332
00:28:40,524 --> 00:28:41,392
Thanks.

333
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,294
Bye.

(Energy Booster Taurine)

335
00:28:50,268 --> 00:28:51,836
That's when I started waiting...

336
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,140
for the look on your face
when my food made you happy.

337
00:28:57,642 --> 00:29:01,045
Today's onion soup prep was perfect.

338
00:29:03,915 --> 00:29:05,049
Is he not coming today?

339
00:29:17,695 --> 00:29:19,764
He must be doing better lately.

340
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:23,167
Since he's not coming for onion soup.

341
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,943
But I realized...

342
00:29:32,977 --> 00:29:35,980
that meant I had to wait
for you to be unhappy,

343
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:40,051
since you only came for onion soup...

344
00:29:40,718 --> 00:29:43,454
when you were tired,
depressed, and unhappy.

345
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,024
What?

346
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:48,693
Waiting for you to be unhappy...

347
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:51,929
just so you'd come to my restaurant.

348
00:29:53,764 --> 00:29:55,633
I didn't like that at all.

349
00:29:57,635 --> 00:30:00,071
So I took onion soup off the menu.

350
00:30:02,173 --> 00:30:03,341
I thought the entire universe...

351
00:30:04,108 --> 00:30:06,077
wanted me to be miserable.

352
00:30:11,048 --> 00:30:12,483
Now that you've tried it, you know.

353
00:30:14,018 --> 00:30:15,119
It's nothing special.

354
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:18,756
From now on,

355
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,558
make it yourself.

356
00:30:58,162 --> 00:30:59,030
It's good.

359
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:22,019
I looked it up
because I wanted to know what it meant.

360
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:26,057
What else is good here besides onion soup?

361
00:31:29,393 --> 00:31:30,561
Everything.

362
00:31:31,696 --> 00:31:33,264
Because I made it.

363
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:34,098
Then,

364
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,467
I'll come back and try everything,
one by one.

365
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:38,603

367
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:46,544
