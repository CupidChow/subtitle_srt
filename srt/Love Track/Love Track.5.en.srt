00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,632
(Kim Yoon Hye)

2
00:00:26,632 --> 00:00:27,766
Hello?

3
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:30,869
Honey, do you know what today is?

4
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:31,704
Today?

5
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,141
I don't know.

6
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:37,309
It's our 100th day together.

7
00:00:38,244 --> 00:00:40,913
Time flies, right?
Feels like we just met yesterday.

8
00:00:40,913 --> 00:00:42,448
I see.

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,985
One-hundredth day.

10
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:47,786
I bought a present for you.

11
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:48,787
I miss you.

12
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:49,755
Should I come by later?

13
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,992
Are you feeling really sick?

14
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,527
No, I'm fine.

15
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:01,000
Actually, right now, I'm...

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,034
Yes, sir?

17
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:04,703
Honey, I'm sorry. I'll call you back.

18
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:06,539
I love you.

19
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:07,439
Yeah.

20
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:26,458
Okay, who's carrying the casket?

21
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,660
Dad's casket?

22
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:30,963
My mom and I will.

23
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:32,932
Caskets are very heavy.

24
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:34,700
You'll need at least four people.

25
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:38,070
And spouses and children
aren't supposed to carry it.

26
00:01:38,537 --> 00:01:39,705
Why not?

27
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:42,007
There are proper customs.

28
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:44,710
The chief mourner can't do everything
including carrying the casket.

29
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:46,412
A funeral...

30
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:49,348
isn't something
women can just handle on their own.

31
00:01:49,348 --> 00:01:51,617
You really know nothing.

32
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:53,652
Isn't there a grown man around?

33
00:01:53,652 --> 00:01:56,055
A husband or a boyfriend? Anyone?

34
00:01:56,055 --> 00:01:58,791
No, you should wear it on the left.

35
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,560
And have you chosen
the shroud and the casket?

36
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:05,598
The price differences all have reasons.

37
00:02:05,598 --> 00:02:09,535
Sure, people say the deceased won't know,

38
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:12,371
but in the end,
funerals are for the living.

39
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,175
That doesn't mean I'm saying
you should choose the expensive one.

40
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:17,710
Have you booked the crematorium?

41
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:19,144
What time is it?

42
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:20,713
What about the hearse?

43
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:22,114
Is it a bus or a limousine?

44
00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:23,082
Excuse me.

45
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:26,418
How many meals and helpers
should we prepare?

46
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:29,788
You don't need too many. Extras cost more.

47
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:31,557
Shall we prepare about 30 servings?

48
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:33,158
One helper should be enough.

49
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:34,326
Excuse me!

50
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:38,564
Why are you raising your voice?

51
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:42,067
This may be your job,

52
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:43,769
but it's the first time for my mom and me.

53
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:48,073
It's the first time my dad died,
and the first time her husband died.

54
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:53,512
So we'll decide things one by one,
and let you know.

55
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:54,413
Okay?

56
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:00,886
All right.

57
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,557
If you need people to carry the casket,
let me know.

58
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:09,662
Why does he keep talking down to me?

59
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:17,002
Nothing about this is easy.

60
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:19,772
I'll take care of everything.

61
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,477
Are there friends
who could help carry the casket?

62
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:28,247
It's early morning on a weekday.
Who would come?

63
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:29,882
I don't want to ask and get criticized.

64
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:35,054
Should I call his friends?

65
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:38,490
Did anyone ever visit Dad
at the nursing hospital?

66
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:40,893
Let's just pay for it.

67
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:43,796
I make money to avoid asking favors.

68
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:48,834
I glanced at the price list earlier,

69
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:51,103
and it's 200 dollars per person.

70
00:03:55,174 --> 00:03:56,508
They're such vultures.

71
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,580
(No Father)

72
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,751
(My Father's Funeral)

73
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:40,486
Han Jung Min?

74
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,024
Hey.

75
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:47,459
Why are you here?

76
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,296
Don't say that.

77
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:51,931
Jung Min is much older than you.

78
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,135
Get out.

79
00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:58,237
I said, get out.

80
00:04:58,237 --> 00:04:59,538
Soo Ah.

81
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:03,709
I called him to help carry the casket.

82
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:06,412
Why would he do that?

83
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:09,481
I can't believe you actually came.

84
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:10,649
If you had any shame...

85
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,251
I came to say goodbye one last time.

86
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:16,088
He loved hiking with me the most,
remember?

87
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:19,458
Yes.

88
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:21,293
All right.

89
00:05:23,262 --> 00:05:24,129
Honey.

90
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:27,666
The son you cherished has come.

91
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:30,603
Father.

92
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:34,139
Your son is here.

93
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:36,575
I'm sorry I'm late.

94
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:42,681
Soo Ah, he's happy.

95
00:05:43,582 --> 00:05:45,084
He looks like he's smiling.

96
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:49,989
(May the deceased rest in peace.)

97
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:56,729
Soo Ah.

98
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,831
Soo Ah.

99
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:00,633
Choi Soo Ah.

100
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:03,936
Why are you here?

101
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:06,872
Don't tell me
you still have feelings for me.

102
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,675
You cheated, and now you have regrets?

103
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:10,609
Hey.

104
00:06:10,609 --> 00:06:14,213
We didn't date for a year or two.
We were together for ten years.

105
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,849
And what, "your son?"

106
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:19,451
"He liked hiking with me?" I can't even.

107
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:21,186
I seriously can't believe this.

108
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:24,490
I said I didn't want to get married,
and you went on a blind date.

109
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,259
Does the person you're seeing now
know you're here?

110
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:29,895
You know this is unfair to her too, right?

111
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,869
I'm sorry I went without telling you.

112
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,409
This isn't the time for excuses,
but you know my mom.

113
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,946
If I hadn't gone,
she would've said awful things to you.

114
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:47,913
So...

115
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:50,316
I tried to handle it myself.

116
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,818
No matter what,

117
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,754
it must've hurt you deeply, Soo Ah.

118
00:06:57,556 --> 00:06:59,291
I was too thoughtless. I'm sorry.

119
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:02,094
But...

120
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:05,231
your parents...

121
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:10,135
treated me like a son.

122
00:07:12,438 --> 00:07:14,907
I don't have feelings for you,
and I'm not seeing anyone.

123
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:18,110
I'll just say goodbye to your dad
and leave.

124
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:21,614
And this.

125
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:32,825
I realized these come in handy
at funerals.

126
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:48,073
(Knee support)

127
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:52,044
(Lean on me
when you're exhausted and worn out.)

128
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,450
He's annoying.

129
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:10,296
(Missed calls,
Director, Deputy Director)

130
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:13,399
- Soo Ah.
- Yeah?

131
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,967
- Guests are here.
- Okay.

132
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:20,773
Director.

133
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:24,476
I'm sorry. I just saw my phone.

134
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:27,413
Let me pay my respects first.

135
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,948
Yes.

136
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:55,307
His father was still so young.

137
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:56,609
Then how...

138
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:59,879
I heard he'd been hospitalized
for a long time.

139
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,513
And she never showed it?

140
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:04,083
Ms. Choi is honestly...

141
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,386
I didn't think it was right
to keep it to just bereavement leave.

142
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:08,520
You did the right thing, sir.

143
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,222
We almost would've passed by
without knowing.

144
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:11,724
Thank you.

145
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,393
By the way, who are you?

146
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:17,429
Ms. Choi's older brother?

147
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:18,297
No.

148
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:20,132
Soo Ah said she's an only child.

149
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,135
Well, I'm...

150
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:25,804
He's my cousin.

151
00:09:26,672 --> 00:09:28,641
We don't look alike at all, right?

152
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:31,544
I didn't inherit much from my mom's side.

153
00:09:32,177 --> 00:09:34,713
See, I have thin hair,

154
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:36,882
but he has so much.

155
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:39,618
My mom and aunt both have very thick hair.

156
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,288
How lucky.

157
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,193
Ms. Choi, have you eaten anything?

158
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:49,929
- Shall we eat together?
- Let's eat together.

159
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,463
I'm okay.

160
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:52,298
Hey, cousin.

161
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:54,934
Eat something.

162
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:56,368
I'll...

163
00:09:57,636 --> 00:09:58,904
bring it to you.

164
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,273
You can all eat together.

165
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,708
Please.

166
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,512
You two cousins are close.

167
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:07,746
How nice.

168
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,067
Honey.

169
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:30,703
What if someone hears you?

170
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:37,843
Well,

171
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,947
I was going to tell you,

172
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:45,417
but everything was so overwhelming,

173
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:47,086
so I couldn't really...

174
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:51,090
It must've been so hard.

175
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,493
Was your father unwell for a long time?

176
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:58,130
About three years.

177
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:01,233
The pancreatic cancer came back
after surgery,

178
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,302
so he stayed in the hospital.

179
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:06,772
I see.

180
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,077
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,049
Don't apologize for that.
It just makes me sad.

182
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:21,353
If it were me, I'd feel hurt.

183
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:25,824
Honey.

184
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:28,494
You're the one going through
the hardest time right now.

185
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:29,562
I understand.

186
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:35,901
But you...

187
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,836
Yeah?

188
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:39,104
You should...

189
00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:41,674
just think about yourself first, honey.

190
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:46,111
Why are you crying?

191
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,615
No, I'm sorry.

192
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:53,519
I just thought
your heart must be breaking.

193
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,421
When you said you couldn't see me
that weekend,

194
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:57,256
it was because you were visiting
your father, right?

195
00:11:58,224 --> 00:12:00,793
I didn't even know that and got upset.

196
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:02,595
And I complained
about not getting to see you.

197
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:04,763
I must've seemed so childish.

198
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:05,798
No.

199
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:07,399
That's not true.

200
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,001
It is.

201
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:10,970
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:13,672
I should've been someone
you could lean on.

203
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:17,309
I'll be more mature from now on.

204
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:20,246
Thank you.

205
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:22,314
No. Thank you.

206
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,919
I promise I'll really become
a reliable boyfriend,

207
00:12:27,486 --> 00:12:29,421
like an older brother.

208
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:31,924
Honey.

209
00:12:38,264 --> 00:12:39,265
Actually,

210
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,934
there's something I didn't tell you.

211
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:46,138
Tell me. I'm really fine with everything.

212
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:51,677
The man inside...

213
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:54,914
is not my cousin.

214
00:12:56,515 --> 00:12:57,583
What?

215
00:12:59,718 --> 00:13:01,186
He's my ex-boyfriend.

216
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:04,023
The one I dated for ten years.

217
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,700
Here you go.

218
00:13:26,045 --> 00:13:27,580
Jung Min.

219
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,148
What is this?

220
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:32,251
- Are you two getting back...
- No.

221
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:34,687
No.

222
00:13:38,324 --> 00:13:39,758
Then why are you here?

223
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:41,427
If you need anything else, just tell me.

224
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:45,431
Jung Min, come here.

225
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:46,365
Okay.

226
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:48,701
I'm not really sure what to do with this.

227
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:49,935
What is this?

228
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:52,338
This...

229
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:55,641
What? Why is Han Jung Min here?

230
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:58,777
Isn't he the guy you said
you're seeing these days?

231
00:13:58,777 --> 00:13:59,612
The junior from work.

232
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:02,581
Well, yeah.

233
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:04,383
I guess I mentioned him.

234
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:08,320
What? So your ex
and your current boyfriend are both here?

235
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:11,523
This is insane.

236
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:16,462
How long have you been dating?

237
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:20,032
A hundred days.

238
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:25,604
Hey, that's cute.

239
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:40,586
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning up.

240
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:53,332
Bye.

241
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:55,034
Thanks for coming all this way.

242
00:14:56,168 --> 00:14:57,636
Get some rest now.

243
00:14:58,137 --> 00:15:00,773
You've been through a lot,
taking care of your father.

244
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,175
I'll go now.

245
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:13,852
(Funeral Hall)

246
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,927
- Sir.
- Yes?

247
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:23,896
It's not you.

248
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:26,932
Where's that decent young man?

249
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:28,534
The one who said he'd carry the casket.

250
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:30,502
There he is. Excuse me.

251
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:31,370
Yes?

252
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:35,741
- About the casket transfer at dawn.
- Yes.

253
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:38,611
You'll need to help
from the moment it leaves the hall.

254
00:15:38,611 --> 00:15:39,378
Yes.

255
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:41,647
So be out front by 6:10 a.m.

256
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:42,715
Understood.

257
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:44,316
- Please write down your contact number.
- Yes.

258
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:49,321
- Okay.
- Thank you.

259
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:55,027
Excuse me.

260
00:15:57,663 --> 00:15:58,497
Me?

261
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:01,834
Why are you carrying
Soo Ah's father's casket?

262
00:16:04,103 --> 00:16:04,937
Pardon?

263
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:07,039
You're not her cousin,

264
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,174
and you're not family.
This makes me uncomfortable.

265
00:16:10,876 --> 00:16:11,844
Uncomfortable?

266
00:16:12,745 --> 00:16:14,079
You?

267
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:18,751
Please step aside. I'll carry it.

268
00:16:20,386 --> 00:16:21,320
Excuse me.

269
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:24,156
Did you know Soo Ah's father?

270
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:29,862
He would want me to carry it.

271
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:33,699
Did you ask him?

272
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:36,969
Every time we went night hiking,

273
00:16:36,969 --> 00:16:40,372
he said if anything happened, I should
take care of Soo Ah and her mother.

274
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:42,174
I'm just keeping that promise.

275
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:45,477
That was before he knew
you two had broken up.

276
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:47,947
If he'd known, he wouldn't have said that.

277
00:16:47,947 --> 00:16:51,050
What kind of father
would favor someone who hurt his daughter?

278
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:54,787
Is he too old to know
when to step in and when to step back?

279
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:58,591
When something hard happens, don't people
usually turn to their partner first?

280
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:01,660
What did you say?

281
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:06,098
That's what Soo Ah used to do with me.

282
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:08,334
Whenever things got hard,
she called me first and...

283
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:09,702
You insane bastard.

284
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:10,736
What do you think you're doing right now?

285
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:12,571
- There are lines you don't cross.
- Let go!

286
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:14,106
What are you two doing?

287
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:16,809
Honey, you decide.

288
00:17:17,476 --> 00:17:19,245
Is it right for him
to carry your father's casket?

289
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:20,279
I'll do it.

290
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:25,317
Yes, Soo Ah. You decide.

291
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:27,286
Who should carry your father's casket?

292
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:34,193
Who's carrying my dad's casket?

293
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:39,732
Why don't you just decide
by rock, paper, scissors?

294
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:44,303
Both of you should go home.

295
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:47,072
Honey.

296
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:48,407
Didn't you hear me?

297
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:51,277
I said both of you should just go home.

298
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,158
What's wrong with this?

299
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:09,762
No.

300
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,135
Damn it.

301
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,808
I'll stay upstairs.

302
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:14,927
Do you know...

303
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:20,900
what my dad looked like at the end?

304
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:25,938
He was down to skin and bones
and looked like a mummy.

305
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:34,013
I hated seeing him like that.

306
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:38,884
At the nursing hospital,

307
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,021
the elderly cry out...

308
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:45,457
because they're in pain,
and they're suffering.

309
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:57,570
Are you in pain?

310
00:19:57,903 --> 00:19:59,271
I'll give you an antibiotic.

311
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:03,642
That voice echoing down the hallway...

312
00:20:05,211 --> 00:20:06,745
was my dad's.

313
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:12,117
But in front of me,
he never showed it once.

314
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:20,993
I even thought it might be better
if he passed away.

315
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,397
Maybe that's why he left so quickly.

316
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:28,734
So I wouldn't suffer anymore.

317
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:34,840
Even if it hurt me,

318
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,512
I wish he'd stayed a little longer.

319
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:47,353
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:51,457
You must have been in so much pain.

321
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:04,470
Give it to me.

322
00:21:05,104 --> 00:21:06,205
I can do it.

323
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:08,007
Give it to me. I'll do it.

324
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:10,009
- No, I will.
- Give it to me.

325
00:21:18,517 --> 00:21:20,252
I'll go get something to wipe with.

326
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:22,087
Why did you do that?

327
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,128
I was really struggling.
Why did you do that?

328
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,299
They were looking for you
at the hospital too.

329
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:35,301
My dad really cared about you.

330
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:37,202
So I couldn't even say a bad word
about you.

331
00:21:37,202 --> 00:21:39,305
Do you know how hard that was for me?

332
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:53,252
Just go.

333
00:21:57,022 --> 00:21:58,157
I don't want to see your face.

334
00:22:04,964 --> 00:22:07,399
I wanted to know
how hard it was for you too.

335
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:11,203
When your father was diagnosed
with cancer,

336
00:22:11,737 --> 00:22:13,105
you were with me.

337
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:18,110
You took the call
and stayed in the bathroom forever.

338
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,212
I knew something was wrong.

339
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:23,148
Your eyes were all red,

340
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:25,985
but no matter how much I asked,
you said it was nothing.

341
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,988
I wanted to know.

342
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:33,659
I wanted to listen.

343
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:38,430
I wanted to hold you too, Soo Ah.

344
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:01,220
You came.

345
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:13,999
I hate all this talk
about who carries the casket.

346
00:23:16,802 --> 00:23:17,836
I just...

347
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:23,342
wish my dad were still alive.

348
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:28,247
My dad's casket.

349
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:32,685
I wish no one would carry it.

350
00:23:38,457 --> 00:23:39,725
I want to be alone.

351
00:23:49,635 --> 00:23:50,369
Excuse me.

352
00:23:57,576 --> 00:23:58,644
I'm sorry about earlier.

353
00:23:59,411 --> 00:24:01,513
My father passed away when I was young.

354
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:04,250
Soo Ah's father really looked after me,

355
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,452
almost like he was my own dad.

356
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:09,555
That stayed with me.

357
00:24:10,356 --> 00:24:13,459
I came just to say thank you. That's all.

358
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:15,828
But it turned out like this.

359
00:24:18,497 --> 00:24:21,734
Soo Ah's father was a really good man,
wasn't he?

360
00:24:23,802 --> 00:24:24,703
Yes.

361
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:26,472
I thought so.

362
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:30,342
Who would come all this way
to an ex-girlfriend's father's funeral?

363
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:35,180
May I ask your name?

364
00:24:37,383 --> 00:24:38,284
Kang In Ho.

365
00:24:38,684 --> 00:24:39,618
Kang In Ho.

366
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:43,489
Then he probably would've called you
"My son, Ho."

367
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,157
"My son, Ho?"

368
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:47,993
He used to say that someday,
when Soo Ah got married,

369
00:24:47,993 --> 00:24:50,729
his dream was to go
to the bathhouse with his son-in-law.

370
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:52,865
Like a father and son.

371
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:58,404
That's a shame.
I'm really good at scrubbing backs.

372
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:02,041
I see.

373
00:25:05,544 --> 00:25:06,612
You can go.

374
00:25:09,615 --> 00:25:10,549
Excuse me.

375
00:25:12,618 --> 00:25:14,320
You said sorry earlier, right?

376
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:34,940
Well, I feel way better now.

377
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:38,844
You didn't come here
because you still had feelings, did you?

378
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:42,982
Hey, what are you doing?

379
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:46,585
You're the guys from Room 5, right?

380
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:47,419
Yes.

381
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:49,021
Hey, you can't throw trash there.

382
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:51,690
No, that's not trash, it's...

383
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,791
Pick it up right now.

384
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:54,593
Yes, sir.

385
00:25:55,694 --> 00:25:56,762
But...

386
00:25:57,863 --> 00:25:59,865
are you two going home?

387
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:03,569
Leaving the lady from Room 5 all alone?

388
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:05,671
Well, she said she wanted to be alone.

389
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:06,705
Goodness.

390
00:26:06,705 --> 00:26:09,708
At times like this,
you just stay by their side.

391
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:12,811
You'd know
if you'd ever been through a funeral.

392
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:20,319
(The late Choi Myeong Gil)

393
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:25,124
(May the deceased rest in peace.)

394
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:28,193
Dad.

395
00:26:32,731 --> 00:26:33,699
Honey.

396
00:26:38,537 --> 00:26:39,505
Mom.

397
00:26:41,941 --> 00:26:42,775
Yeah?

398
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:46,979
Soo Ah.

399
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:49,415
Yeah.

400
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:56,755
But...

401
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,858
who's carrying his casket?

402
00:27:00,726 --> 00:27:02,127
Just pay for it.

403
00:27:03,295 --> 00:27:04,863
That's the easiest on the heart.

404
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,588
Yeon Ju.

405
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:31,390
What do we do?

406
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:35,027
Hey.

407
00:27:40,132 --> 00:27:41,233
Lie down, Mom.

408
00:28:20,806 --> 00:28:22,241
Thank you for coming.

409
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:23,175
You must be exhausted.

410
00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:41,493
You need to eat to keep your strength up.

411
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:33,245
Hold the casket by sliding your hands in
from top to bottom,

412
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:36,315
with the backs of your hands
facing the casket.

413
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:37,082
Yes.

414
00:29:37,082 --> 00:29:40,486
And when you head out,
watch the steps and thresholds.

415
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:14,119
Carry it.

416
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:29,235
Carry it.

417
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:39,311
(Funeral Hall)

418
00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:14,213
As if only now she could finally feel...

419
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:18,150
that this was her father's funeral,

420
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,855
the rain poured down,

421
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,625
heavy and cleansing.

422
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:33,766
Hearts willing to carry
someone else's burden,

423
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:38,771
asking for nothing in return,
quietly shimmered.

424
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:43,876
As if only now...

425
00:31:45,177 --> 00:31:47,046
she could finally feel...

426
00:31:49,882 --> 00:31:51,584
that this was her father's funeral,

427
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:55,888
the rain poured down,

428
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:02,628
heavy and cleansing.

429
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:07,833
Dad.

430
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:11,203
See you again.
