1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,160
Zhao Kai.

3
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,240
Because of you, I've been

4
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,080
reduced to this state.

5
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,360
Even if I die,

6
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,480
I'll drag you down with me.

7
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,400
Then kill me.

8
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,600
Kill me.

9
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,800
You'll get nothing.

10
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:44,039
You think you're so noble?

11
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,680
I only want money.

12
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,080
But you want lives.

13
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,759
If that's the case,

14
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,360
which one of us is more noble?

15
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,600
Zhao Kai.

16
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,000
Let me tell you,

17
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,490
this act doesn't work anymore.

18
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,560
Did you ever believe I loved you?

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,840
Love? Please.

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,820
You don't even love yourself.

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,880
Do you know that?

22
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,620
I never thought

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,079
that in the end, the one who understands me most

24
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,600
would be you.

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,160
Zhao Kai.

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,640
I've wronged you,

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,880
I owe you so much.

28
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,680
This card has

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,480
500,000 in it.

30
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,840
Do whatever you want with it.

31
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,820
You've already gotten your revenge anyway.

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Revenge is done.

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,130
What do you mean?

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,960
Meng Xiaoting took Yiyi away.

35
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,520
Don't play dumb with me.

36
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,160
I'll call her.

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,040
Give me the phone.

38
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,400
I'll call her.

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,160
Be quiet.

40
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,480
Hello, the number you have dialed is powered off.

41
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,410
Call the police.

42
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,360
I'm going to report this to the police right now.

43
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,620
Don't call the police.

44
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,360
If you provoke her,

45
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,980
Yiyi will be in danger.

46
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,579
Maybe it's just a misunderstanding.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
Chen Mo,

48
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
if anything happens to Yiyi,

49
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,010
I won't let you off the hook.

50
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,840
Yiyi.

51
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,519
Yiyi.

52
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,370
Where is she?

53
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,280
Yiyi.

54
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,080
Where is Yiyi?

55
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,600
I...

56
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,640
I don't know.

57
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,960
She was right beside me just now.

58
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,740
What do you mean 'she was just there'?

59
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,200
Where are you?

60
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,440
Yiyi was in my car just now.

61
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,080
I...

62
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,800
When I woke up, she was gone.

63
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,720
What did you do to Yiyi?

64
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,320
She's dead.

65
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,200
Get up.

66
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,040
Where is she?

67
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,320
Dead.

68
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,040
I'm asking where Yiyi is.

69
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,159
Lin Yazhi killed my child.

70
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
So I had to kill

71
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,220
her child for revenge.

72
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,320
I told you to kill Lin Yazhi.

73
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,800
Your child with Lin Yazhi is a child.

74
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,040
Isn't my child a child too?

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,800
Lin Yazhi killed our child.

76
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,320
Why don't I see you getting

77
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,920
this angry with her?

78
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,560
You're insane!

79
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,680
Are you going to call the police?

80
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,400
Go ahead.

81
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't forget,

82
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,120
you gave me the poison.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,240
You're involved too.

84
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,560
Report!

85
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,360
You made Yiyi drink the potion.

86
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
She passed out

87
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,960
and lost consciousness.

88
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,380
How much did she drink?

89
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,570
Isn't half a bottle enough?

90
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,770
Mengmeng, listen to me.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,800
That medicine

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,880
isn't lethal.

93
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
It's only deadly when taken

94
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
with Lin Yazhi's antidepressants.

95
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,680
Where is Yiyi?

96
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,720
Why isn't it poison?

97
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,120
Mengmeng.

98
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,240
Why isn't it poison?

99
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Mengmeng,

100
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,320
listen to me,

101
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,960
we can have another child.

102
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,040
Mengmeng,

103
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,159
you can't have children.

104
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,560
We can do something else,

105
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,080
we can adopt.

106
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,040
Try IVF,

107
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,460
anything is possible.

108
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,280
Trust me.

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,930
Trust me, Mengmeng.

110
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,770
We'll go to Bali.

111
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,600
We'll buy a house by the sea

112
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,650
and watch our children grow up.

113
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,200
We'll grow old

114
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,130
together there.

115
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Will you trust me?

116
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,200
Yiyi is my child too.

117
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,560
If anything happens to her,

118
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,820
I would be devastated.

119
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,740
You don't want to see me upset, right?

120
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,880
So,

121
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,600
where is Yiyi?

122
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,680
I really don't know.

123
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,040
I was choked unconscious by Zhao Kai

124
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,600
and when I woke up, Yiyi

125
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,920
was already gone.

126
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,520
Zhao Kai?

127
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,090
Zhao Kai took Yiyi away.

128
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,280
It was Zhao Kai.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,880
It was Zhao Kai.

130
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,180
If it's him, that's not so bad.

131
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,890
He just wants money.

132
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,040
Hey, Yazhi.

133
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,690
Everything's fine now.

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,200
A misunderstanding.

135
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,120
Is Yiyi's English class over?

136
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,799
Yes, I'm with Yiyi now.

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,799
Good.

138
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,400
If I don't see Yiyi when I get home,

139
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,330
I'll call the police immediately.

140
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,720
Hello?

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,400
You have Yiyi, don't you?

142
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,600
How much money do you want?

143
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,530
Name your price.

144
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,100
This has nothing to do with me.

145
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,480
Ask Meng Xiaoting yourself.

146
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,740
I didn't say you did it.

147
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,720
Listen to me.

148
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,040
Take Yiyi to the hospital,

149
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,840
I'll give you the money,

150
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,200
and this will have nothing to do with you,

151
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,640
okay?

152
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,600
I'm telling you, this kid,

153
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,000
I didn't touch her at all.

154
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,800
Then I'm calling the police.

155
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,840
Go ahead,

156
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,600
if you don't,

157
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,680
I'll do it myself.

158
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,720
Are you not telling me the truth?

159
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,120
Yazhi,

160
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,160
are you okay?

161
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,120
I'm fine.

162
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Please take care of Yiyi

163
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
for now.

164
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Everything goes according to plan.

165
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,960
How's it going?

166
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,600
Hey, Qingyu.

167
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,770
Can we put the matter

168
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,570
about the child on hold?

169
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,160
If anything happens to Yiyi now,

170
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,360
Lin Yazhi

171
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,080
will call the police immediately.

172
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,680
You just keep acting your part,

173
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,040
the rest is up to you.
