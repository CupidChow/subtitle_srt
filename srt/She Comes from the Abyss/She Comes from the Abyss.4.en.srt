1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,440
Honey.

3
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,560
What's wrong?

4
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,970
Are you feeling unwell?

5
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,730
You're back so early today.

6
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,960
I'm tired.

7
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,560
I skipped one lap.

8
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,700
Just finished showering.

9
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Right.

10
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,890
Use your knife and fork.

11
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,280
Sit up straight when eating.

12
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,960
Got it?

13
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,760
Honey, what's wrong?

14
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,079
Honey.

15
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,650
Are you feeling unwell?

16
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,160
No, I'm fine.

17
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
I might have a bit of low blood sugar.

18
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,160
I'll feel better after I eat something.

19
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,240
Thank you.

20
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,660
Coffee will be ready soon.

21
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,760
Those two

22
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,680
seem like they've known each other before.

23
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,280
Xiaoting,

24
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,500
where's your food?

25
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,000
I can just eat in the kitchen.

26
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,160
Come sit down and eat with us,

27
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,240
don't be shy.

28
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,120
Yeah,

29
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,160
don't be so formal.

30
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,690
Bring your food and join us.

31
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,880
Here, let Daddy help you.

32
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,960
Let me explain your job duties.

33
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
You'll take Yiyi to school every day

34
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040
using my car.

35
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,120
I happen to be free these next couple of days,

36
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,279
so I can go with you

37
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,930
and show you the routes.

38
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,760
Honey,

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,200
you should just rest.

40
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
I'll go with them.

41
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
After school today, Yiyi has

42
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,260
a one-hour English class.

43
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,520
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, after English class,

44
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,840
take her directly to horseback riding lessons.

45
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,920
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, she has gymnastics in the evening,

46
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,720
and you can rest on weekends.

47
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,360
Yiyi has neurogenic urinary incontinence,

48
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,690
so make sure she brings her electrotherapy device with her.

49
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,360
Don't worry.

50
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,760
You two go ahead and eat.

51
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,220
I'm going to take a shower.

52
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,840
Why do I always feel so uneasy?

53
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,280
Why are my slippers wet?

54
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,960
Honey,

55
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,780
Tingting and I are taking Yiyi to school.

56
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,240
Okay,

57
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,040
be careful

58
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,850
and come home early.

59
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,880
Will do.

60
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,680
Strange,

61
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,480
why isn't he leaving?

62
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,140
Is he waiting for her here?

63
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,840
Get in.

64
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,480
Let's go!

65
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,960
Hurry, let's go, quick!

66
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
You don't like it?

67
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,280
No, I don't.

68
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,260
Yazhi isn't doing well emotionally,

69
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,360
you're taking such meticulous care of her,

70
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,159
don't you...

71
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,010
What can you give me?

72
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,520
And what can I give you?

73
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,320
Are you afraid I'll cling to you,

74
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,810
or do you think I'm not good enough?

75
00:06:59,159 --> 00:06:59,960
Get out.

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
That's it.

77
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,480
I was overthinking.

78
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,600
Let's go back.

79
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,680
Sis.

80
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,680
I actually think you should

81
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,840
worry more about those female clients at your brother-in-law's studio.

82
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,640
Last time I passed by his studio,

83
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,720
all the women coming out were both rich and beautiful.

84
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,680
Sis,

85
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,960
what exactly does his healing studio do?

86
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,240
They say it's some kind of psychological healing,

87
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
but I don't know the details.

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,920
A therapist?

89
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,960
Something like that.

90
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,880
Chen Mo says music therapy can soothe the nerves

91
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,010
and relieve stress.

92
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,080
I doubt that

93
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,040
they're just using music therapy as a cover,

94
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
who knows what they're really up to.

95
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,200
I'm sorry,

96
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,169
I just took a phone call.

97
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,760
Why does he look so similar to Li Meng?

98
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,600
Could it be...

99
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,760
Chen Qingyu.

100
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,640
Director of Avex Listed Group,

101
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,440
emotional anxiety,

102
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,840
chronic insomnia.

103
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,120
Chen Qingyu.

104
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,040
Let's begin.

105
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
I don't know why,

106
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,980
but I always feel that Mu Xiaoting

107
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,700
resembles someone I know.

108
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,240
Who's there?
