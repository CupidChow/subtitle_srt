1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,160
Would you like to order, sir?

3
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,240
Um, just a moment please.

4
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,160
My friend hasn't arrived yet.

5
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,760
We'll order together when they get here.

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,480
Certainly. Just call us if you need anything.

7
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay, thanks.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,600
All right.

9
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,520
Senior.

10
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,360
From the very first day I stepped into Chenghai University,

11
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,620
I fell in love with you.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,360
I'm truly grateful that you

13
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,720
came into my life.

14
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,920
Yazhi,

15
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,560
why are you sorting vegetables?

16
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,220
Let me do it,

17
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,960
it's fine.

18
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm feeling great today.

19
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,360
Today

20
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,140
I'll let you taste my cooking,

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,440
okay?

22
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,140
Then I'll help you out.

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Yazhi,

24
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,960
there's something I need to tell you.

25
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,079
What is it?

26
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,240
Is it about Yiyi?

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,120
No, no.

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,240
It's

29
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,800
about your husband.

30
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
My husband?

31
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,520
What happened to him?

32
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,440
I went to

33
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,720
Teacher Chen's studio today

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,640
and borrowed 100,000 yuan from him

35
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
for my mother's medical treatment.

36
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,880
I offered to write an IOU,

37
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,560
but Teacher Chen said it wasn't necessary.

38
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,560
But I still think there should be some written record.

39
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,520
Sister Yazhi,

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,329
I'll pay it back gradually.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,920
Did Meng Xiaoting just come by?

42
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,540
No, she didn't.

43
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,579
Did you go to the studio today?

44
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,240
Weren't you there too?

45
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,000
Why would Chen Mo lie to me?

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,480
Sister Yazhi.

47
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,240
I'm sorry,

48
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,500
I should have told you in advance.

49
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,080
It's fine.

50
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,570
I'll go back to work now.

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,399
Sister Yazhi.

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,120
Yes?

53
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,320
There's something else

54
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,720
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

55
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,440
What is it?

56
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,680
Well,

57
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,120
are you close with your neighbor?

58
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,240
That Cindy.

59
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,080
I've noticed your husband

60
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,610
seems to be getting quite close to her lately.

61
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,960
She's probably just a new client.

62
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,760
It's nothing.

63
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,360
Yes.

64
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,360
Must be a new client.

65
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,560
Sister Yazhi,

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,240
it never hurts to keep an eye on things.

67
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,920
By the way,

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,080
you won't tell Mr. Chen what I just said, will you?

69
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,400
Don't worry,

70
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,880
I won't say anything.

71
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,320
Sister Yazhi,

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,520
I'm on your side.

73
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,600
After all,

74
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,240
we women need to stick together.

75
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,240
Xiaoting.

76
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,010
Thank you for your concern.

77
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,120
I'll go wash the vegetables.

78
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,200
Are you crazy?

79
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,200
If you don't love her,

80
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,480
then stay away from her.

81
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
I know you're just

82
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,400
a young punk.

83
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,520
How dare you challenge me.

84
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,920
Honey.

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,680
Darling.

86
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,760
Why are you home so late today?

87
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,730
Doesn't Yiyi love oranges?

88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,170
So I went to buy some.

89
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,840
Really?

90
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,850
Darling.

91
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
I'm going upstairs to take a shower.

92
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,040
I told you long ago that your brother-in-law was suspicious,

93
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,640
but you wouldn't believe me.

94
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,880
But borrowing money isn't such a big deal,

95
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,540
so why would he hide it from me?

96
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,260
What if it's not just about borrowing money?

97
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,280
Though this Meng Xiaoting is quite strange too.

98
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,120
She's just trying to distract you

99
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,380
so you won't catch her.

100
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,000
I think Meng Xiaoting is looking out for me.

101
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,280
My dear innocent sister,

102
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,040
stop overthinking this

103
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,220
and just do as I say.

104
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,220
Remember that.

105
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,880
Honey,

106
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,090
did you take your medicine?

107
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,000
I did.

108
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,540
Are you sleepy?

109
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,240
Go to bed.

110
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,340
Come on.

111
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Answer the phone.

112
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,480
Hello?

113
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,760
Hey, sis.

114
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,140
You finally answered.

115
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,200
Come out and see this,

116
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,800
look at that woman next door.

117
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,760
What nonsense are you talking about?

118
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,440
I can't believe Chen Mo is having an affair with her.

119
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,680
Her daughter even bullies Yiyi all the time.

120
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,520
Chen Mo doesn't even stand up for Yiyi, and now you're saying

121
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,320
he's having an affair with that woman?

122
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,000
I told you that you shouldn't have stopped me last time.

123
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,880
Tell me, sis,

124
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,720
what should we do about this?

125
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,050
I can't take it anymore.

126
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,650
Stay out of this.

127
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,620
I'll handle it myself.

128
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,160
Open the door.

129
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,340
What's wrong? Do you need something?

130
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,560
Wife.
