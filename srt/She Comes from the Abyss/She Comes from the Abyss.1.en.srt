1
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,360
My name is Lin Yazhi.

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,600
This is my husband

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,520
Chen Mo.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,640
We were supposed to have a life that others would envy,

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,640
but fate can be so cruel.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,770
An accident seven years ago

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,770
completely changed the course of my life.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,680
My world turned black in an instant.

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,520
I've been desperately trying to climb out of

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,250
this abyss that has trapped me.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,920
It's like a bottomless pit,

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,690
threatening to devour everything around me.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,960
My husband,

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,360
my child,

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
I can't lose them.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,440
Mom.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,120
Mom.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,800
Mom.

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,440
Mom.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,200
Who?

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,800
Li Meng.

22
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,200
You killed my child.

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,440
It must have been you who killed my child.

24
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,240
It wasn't me.

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,800
I didn't kill your child.

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,080
It wasn't me.

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,160
If it weren't for you,

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,620
my child wouldn't be dead.

29
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,800
Stay away!

30
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,060
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

31
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,720
You're on duty today?

32
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,840
Come find me if you get hungry later.

33
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,640
I brought some good food.

34
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,370
I brought some braised dishes.

35
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,400
Save my child!

36
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,079
How is it, Director?

37
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,010
The baby is gone,

38
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,079
she probably won't be able to conceive again,

39
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,760
it was the medicine you prescribed.

40
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,320
I didn't kill your baby.

41
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,400
I didn't kill your baby.

42
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,040
Yazhi.

43
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
You should prepare yourself,

44
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,240
according to our examination,

45
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,160
your child

46
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,200
may have a congenital central nervous system defect.

47
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,920
Defect.

48
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,680
Reality.

49
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,000
Dream.

50
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,720
Which one is real?

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,840
Yiyi.

52
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,800
I'm sorry,

53
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,970
don't be afraid,

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,040
mommy is sorry,

55
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,159
mommy was wrong.

56
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,080
It's okay,

57
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,260
let mommy hold you,

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,490
would you like a hug?

59
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,320
Honey.

60
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,240
It's me.

61
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,520
Honey, where did you go?

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,240
Yiyi is fine,

63
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,010
mommy just had a nightmare.

64
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,010
Are you feeling better?

65
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,930
Was it that dream again?

66
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,840
Honey.

67
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,280
Please find a nanny as soon as possible.

68
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,140
I'm afraid that like this,

69
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
I can't take good care of Yiyi at all.

70
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,360
I know,

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,960
the housekeeping agency is already looking for one.

72
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,690
They'll call me when they find someone suitable.

73
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Come and catch me!

74
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,080
Sis.

75
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,170
Do you want to talk to me?

76
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,040
I'll always be by your side anyway.

77
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,400
She wet herself!

78
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,800
Yiyi peed her pants!

79
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,120
It's hilarious!

80
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,080
What happened to Yiyi?

81
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,160
Mom!

82
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,600
It's okay.

83
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,720
What are you looking at?

84
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,200
Go home,

85
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,600
now!

86
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,880
My mom says

87
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,400
if a child is dirty, the adult is dirty too.

88
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,560
We won't play with this dirty kid anymore.

89
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,080
Who are you calling dirty?

90
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,360
Go home to your mom.

91
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,280
I'll ask her who's dirty.

92
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Let's go home.

93
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,000
We won't play with her.

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,760
I don't want this electrotherapy device anymore.

95
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,200
Yiyi.

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,130
The electrotherapy device is to treat Yiyi's bed-wetting.

97
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,720
Yiyi.

98
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,480
The electrotherapy device is Yiyi's special accessory,

99
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,000
something other kids don't have,

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,960
only Yiyi has it.

101
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,560
They're making fun of you because they're jealous.

102
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,090
Yiyi needs to be confident.

103
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,320
Hey, Yiyi.

104
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,400
Hello, Ms. Lin.

105
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
This is Nuannuan Housekeeping Service.

106
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,000
We'll arrange for a housekeeper to come for an interview soon.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,480
Would that be convenient for you?

108
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,410
Yes, that works.

109
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,240
What's your name?

110
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,600
My name is Yiyi.

111
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,180
I need to use the bathroom.

112
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
I'm coming!

113
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,160
Here I come!

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,880
I'm here!

115
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,000
So what's your name?

116
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,080
My name is...

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,260
Excuse me, who are you?

118
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,840
Hello.

119
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,080
I'm here for the nanny interview.

120
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,200
My name is Meng Xiaoting.

121
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,330
I brought my resume.

122
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,120
I'm sorry,

123
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,800
your husband just took my documents.

124
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:45,960
Honey,

125
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,930
you're back.

126
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,760
This is the nanny who came for the interview.

127
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,800
I've reviewed her resume and she seems suitable.

128
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
What do you think?

129
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,460
Her education and language skills are quite suitable.

130
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,780
I think Yiyi likes her too,

131
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,600
so maybe we should hire her.

132
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,560
I'm sorry,

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,860
thank you for coming all this way.

134
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,880
We need to discuss this first,

135
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,960
and we'll let you know once we've made a decision.

136
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,290
Okay.

137
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll be going then.

138
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,920
Goodbye, Yiyi.

139
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,080
Could you show me to the door?

140
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,679
Sure.

141
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,039
What's wrong, honey?

142
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,960
You don't think she's suitable?

143
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,280
It's nothing.

144
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,720
I saw how close she was with Yiyi,

145
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,220
and it made me feel a bit upset.

146
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,440
Yiyi hasn't been that close with me for a long time.

147
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,360
Honey,

148
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,730
don't overthink it.

149
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,240
You are Yiyi's mother.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,800
She'll always be closest to you.

151
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,220
Then let's choose her.

152
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,410
As long as Yiyi is happy.

153
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,440
Okay.

154
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,080
Honey.

155
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,480
Is my condition incurable?

156
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,120
What's wrong?

157
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,080
Why would you think that?

158
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,600
I've been feeling worse lately.

159
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,320
I have nightmares every day.

160
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,080
Your PTSD is quite severe.

161
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,580
Combined with major depression,

162
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,200
these symptoms

163
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,160
are unavoidable for you.

164
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,520
It requires a slow recovery process.

165
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,080
I feel I owe you so much.

166
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,660
It's been seven years.

167
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,210
You've taken such good care of me and Yiyi.

168
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,200
But

169
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,000
my dear,

170
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
I'll always be here for you and Yiyi.

171
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,040
What's wrong?

172
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,240
All these years,

173
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,520
I've never fulfilled my duties as a wife.

174
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,880
I've always felt a deep sense of debt to him.

175
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,400
Daddy.

176
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,960
Daddy, I wet the bed. You go to sleep.

177
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,090
I'll go check on her.

178
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,520
In this family,

179
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,980
it seems I'm the only one who doesn't belong.

180
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,600
What am I even holding on for?

181
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,920
Are you coming over tonight?
