1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,300
Meng Xiaoting.

3
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,000
Meng Xiaoting.

4
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,440
Meng Xiaoting was clearly at my house,

5
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,140
how could she possibly not exist?

6
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,540
Meng Xiaoting.

7
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,700
Meng Xiaoting.

8
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,940
I refuse to believe that no one has ever seen Meng Xiaoting.

9
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,600
Xiaocheng.

10
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,400
Xiaocheng.

11
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,240
Xiaocheng.

12
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,800
How is that possible?

13
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,200
Meng Xiaoting.

14
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,500
How could she possibly not exist?

15
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,010
That's impossible.

16
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,520
Senior.

17
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,000
Senior.

18
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,060
Senior.

19
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,570
Senior, what's wrong with you?

20
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,480
Senior.

21
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,320
Senior.

22
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,079
Brother-in-law.

23
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,410
What are you doing here?

24
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,680
Why so scared of me?

25
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,520
What have you done wrong?

26
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,010
Go back home,

27
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,890
your sister is already asleep.

28
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,520
Why so eager to get rid of me?

29
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,260
What are you really afraid of?

30
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Your sister just had a fight with me,

31
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,920
and now you're starting too.

32
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,720
My sister may be easy to fool,

33
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,080
but I'm not.

34
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,140
You make your lies sound just like the truth.

35
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,300
That's enough, Yingying.

36
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,600
My sister is such a fool,

37
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,240
she caught you two cheating with her own eyes,

38
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,520
and with just a few words

39
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,980
you convinced everyone she's mentally ill.

40
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,520
You know what?

41
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,160
I'm going to find this Meng Xiaoting for you.

42
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,960
Lin Yingying.

43
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,440
I've been tolerating you out of respect for your sister,

44
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,040
but my patience has its limits.

45
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,480
Pff!

46
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,240
You disgusting pervert, you scumbag.

47
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,440
I actually thought you had some self-control,

48
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,840
but you hooked up with that slut so quickly.

49
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,400
Get out.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,460
This is my sister's house,

51
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,040
I'll stay as long as I want.

52
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,880
Are you finished?

53
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,760
Not yet,

54
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,520
you filthy scumbag, you sick pervert,

55
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,180
you wolf in sheep's clothing.

56
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,520
Tell me

57
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,420
what's so great about that bitch compared to me?

58
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,960
You're just a dog,

59
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
gnawing on any trashy bone you find.

60
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,320
Say that

61
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,440
Meng Xiaoting is a slut.

62
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,880
Say it!

63
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,960
Meng Xiaoting is a slut.

64
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,610
You even want that slut,

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,680
you make me sick.

66
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,240
Honey.

67
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,040
Honey.

68
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,240
Honey.

69
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,960
Why did you fall asleep here?

70
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,480
I was reading too late last night

71
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,680
and fell asleep here.

72
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,300
What time is it?

73
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
Just after seven.

74
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,850
Why don't you go back to bed for a while?

75
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,560
I can't.

76
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,690
I have a client meeting.

77
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,880
I'll go take a shower.

78
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,409
You work so hard.

79
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
Who's lying here?

80
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,620
Do you recognize this?

81
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,500
Stockings?

82
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,620
Whose are they?

83
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,280
The ones you wore yesterday.

84
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,040
These aren't mine, are they?

85
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,170
Fishnet stockings.

86
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,600
If they're not yours, then whose are they?

87
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,880
Lots of people wear this kind of stockings.

88
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,160
Then how did someone else's stockings

89
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,680
end up on my couch?

90
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,520
They really are mine.

91
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Explain yourself.

92
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,520
Explain what?

93
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,000
Why are your stockings

94
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,559
on the couch in Chen Mo's study?

95
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,360
No, sis.

96
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,610
What do you mean?

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,860
Let me explain.

98
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,690
Have you lost your mind?

99
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm your sister,

100
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,880
and Chen Mo is my brother-in-law.

101
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,800
What are you thinking in that head of yours?

102
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,000
Keep your voice down.

103
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,400
Your coffee.

104
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,010
I help you with everything,

105
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
afraid you might get hurt even a little.

106
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,840
And now?

107
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,560
You suspect me.

108
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,020
Then how do you explain these stockings?

109
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,040
These are the ones you wore yesterday.

110
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
I carry so many stockings with me every day,

111
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,000
who knows when I left them on your couch.

112
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,280
Then do you dare to call Chen Mo

113
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,480
on speaker?

114
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,120
You want me to call him?

115
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,320
Well, I won't.

116
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,020
I'll tell you what,

117
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,410
I did sleep with Chen Mo.

118
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,600
How about that?

119
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,400
Happy now?

120
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,720
Yingying!

121
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,280
Lin Yazhi, let me tell you,

122
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,140
don't come to me for help anymore.

123
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,120
I don't recognize you as my sister

124
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
and you don't have me as your sister.

125
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,000
Take good care of your precious husband

126
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,880
because every woman in the world has her eye on him.

127
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,600
Yingying.

128
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,840
Yingying.

129
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,740
Yingying, move aside.

130
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,960
Are you crazy?

131
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,040
Move!

132
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,560
Yingying.

133
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,960
I haven't been in a good mental state lately

134
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,520
and I've been suspicious about everything.

135
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,980
If I've misunderstood you

136
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,480
I apologize.

137
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,330
Get out of my way.

138
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,760
You won't? Fine.
