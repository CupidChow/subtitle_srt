1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,480
When you were pregnant,

3
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
Chen Mo was already pursuing me.

4
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,120
Your child

5
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,400
was his biggest obstacle.

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So the person who wanted you

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,800
to miscarry the most was Chen Mo.

8
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,240
All these years,

9
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,720
haven't you had

10
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,240
a bit of suspicion deep down?

11
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,039
Lin Yazhi,

12
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,620
do you think I would believe what you say?

13
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,740
You're just trying to break us up.

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,650
I have a recording here,

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,080
listen for yourself.

16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,920
Who planned to take Yiyi away?

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,039
Chen Qingyu.

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,400
Why did you listen to her?

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,130
She wants me to get rid of Lin Yazhi and Yiyi

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,400
or else she won't stay with me

21
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,640
and I won't get everything I want.

22
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,800
Did you cause Li Meng's miscarriage?

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,800
Yes.

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,120
How did you do it?

25
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,780
I replaced her morning sickness medication

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,680
with abortion pills.

27
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,450
For our baby's sake,

28
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,690
remember to take

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,860
that medicine.

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,690
Don't worry,

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,360
I'll take it on schedule.

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:20,960
Good,

33
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,010
I'll come home after I finish work,

34
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,360
bye.

35
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,579
The person you should really take revenge on is Chen Mo.

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,800
Not me.

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,960
I admit,

38
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,000
I did suspect Chen Mo,

39
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,500
but I couldn't believe it.

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,720
I'd rather believe he still loves me.

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,160
I'd rather believe

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
that you killed our child.

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,260
I went to great lengths to get into your home.

44
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,290
I thought it was your happiness

45
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,760
that made me miserable.

46
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,170
I wanted to make you suffer,

47
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,600
make Chen Mo betray you,

48
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,200
make Yiyi hate you.

49
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,680
But what you don't know is,

50
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,320
he abandoned you,

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,970
not because he stopped loving you,

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,730
and certainly not because he loves me.

53
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,240
Then why?

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,720
Because he's hollow inside,

55
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,360
he doesn't love any of us.

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,560
He only sees

57
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,090
what value we have to offer.

58
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,120
For that value,

59
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,520
he can pretend to be anything

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
we want him to be.

61
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,360
To pursue us.

62
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,970
Get close to you.

63
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,400
I can give him the money

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,040
resources

65
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,560
and connections he wants.

66
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,400
My family

67
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,760
can support all his dreams.

68
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,040
Then why did he want me to harm you?

69
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,930
Because we were both too naive,

70
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,160
we trusted him blindly.

71
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,899
Since I became depressed,

72
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,480
he's been drugging me.

73
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,720
Hypnotizing me daily

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,440
to drive me insane.

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,800
Meanwhile, he

76
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,160
was out there maintaining

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,490
all those inappropriate relationships.

78
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,560
Now

79
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,320
he has a new target,

80
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,380
he wants to replace me.

81
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,600
Who?

82
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,720
From the first day you came to work as our nanny,

83
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,960
she was already Chen Mo's guest,

84
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,320
with more privileges than me,

85
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,440
and higher status.

86
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,770
Getting rid of me

87
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,280
was her idea, she manipulated Chen Mo.

88
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,480
Actually, I believe

89
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,080
the greatest prison for humans

90
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,340
is their mental world.

91
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,680
The mindset of successful people

92
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,409
is free and multidimensional.

93
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,850
The mindset of failures

94
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,840
is trapped in a cage.

95
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,360
Only when you break free from constraints

96
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,760
can you discover a new version of yourself.

97
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,720
As for Chen Mo,

98
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,000
he wants to use your sacrifice

99
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,450
to achieve his social class advancement.

100
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,770
Just as you said,

101
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,480
to avenge our child.

102
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,880
Just adding a little bit

103
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,010
to Lin Yazhi's food,

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,600
and she'll die without anyone

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,680
suspecting a thing.

106
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,540
Cause of death:

107
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,600
drug allergy.

108
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,690
After telling you all this,

109
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,159
do you believe me?

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,960
I believe you.

111
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,880
This recording

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,600
was made while Chen Mo

113
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,240
was under hypnosis,

114
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,960
so it can't be used as evidence.

115
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,040
I need you to help me put on an act

116
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,010
to find solid proof that he harmed your child.

117
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:55,800
Yiyi,

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
do you remember what

119
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,960
auntie just told you?

120
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
I remember,

121
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,440
but why do we have to trick daddy?

122
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,120
We're not tricking daddy,

123
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,040
we're playing a game with him.

124
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,820
Auntie is playing too.

125
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,200
Oh.

126
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

127
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,440
Yiyi,

128
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,290
your mom actually loves you very much.

129
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,920
I love her too,

130
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,040
but I'm afraid of her.

131
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,120
Come, Yiyi,

132
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,770
let's go lie down over there

133
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,240
and practice one more time, okay?

134
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,040
One last time.

135
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,490
Meng Xiaoting, what are you doing?

136
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,440
It's Daddy.

137
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,300
What are you afraid of?

138
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,360
Mommy, I'm scared.

139
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,920
Did Daddy just speak

140
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,960
harshly to Yiyi?

141
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,600
Daddy didn't mean to.

142
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,040
Mengjie.

143
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,520
Let's begin.

144
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,920
Hey, Mengjie.

145
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,490
You were driving on the road

146
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,840
at high speed.

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,040
Meng Xiaoting

148
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,170
suddenly went crazy and started hitting you,

149
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,280
grabbing at the steering wheel.

150
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,320
Meng Xiaoting

151
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,980
wouldn't listen to you at all.

152
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Just die!

153
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,040
Where's Yiyi?

154
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,640
Is she okay?

155
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Yiyi is just fine.

156
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,960
To drag me down with you,

157
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,960
you involved my own daughter

158
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
in a car accident.

159
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,880
Do you know how dangerous that was?

160
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,600
Could you take responsibility if something happened?

161
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,840
Don't worry about it,

162
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,720
and from now on,

163
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,960
you'll never see her again.

164
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,080
Yiyi is my daughter.

165
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,840
We may be divorced,

166
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,320
but she's still my daughter.

167
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,240
I'm her father,

168
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,280
and I have the right to see her.

169
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm afraid you don't have that right.

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,800
Oh, by the way.

171
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,840
That agreement to split my

172
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,080
trust fund with you

173
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,679
has been proven invalid.

174
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,679
I had a certificate of mental instability

175
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,760
from the hospital during that time,

176
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,159
so all the documents I signed

177
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,360
have no legal effect.

178
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,520
Next time you want to play dirty,

179
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,200
please find a more

180
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,680
professional lawyer.

181
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,360
Mengmeng.

182
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,690
See you in court.

183
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,600
Nurse.

184
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,740
I need to use the bathroom.

185
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,040
What are you doing?

186
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,720
There are other patients around.

187
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,600
I need to use the bathroom,

188
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,400
give me a bedpan.

189
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Are you crazy?

190
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,640
You have arms and legs,

191
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,600
can't you go to the bathroom yourself?

192
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,680
Can't you see I have a fracture?

193
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,140
How am I supposed to get up?

194
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,080
Who did this to you?

195
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,160
Nothing better to do?

196
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,040
Take it off now.

197
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,760
Lin Yazhi.

198
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,200
Lin Yazhi.

199
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,320
Lin Yazhi.

200
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,840
Honey.

201
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,920
The doctor says

202
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,080
they might need to amputate.

203
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,140
Does that mean you won't be able to go anywhere anymore?

204
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,500
Your hands are ruined too,

205
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,610
you'll never play the piano again.

206
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,520
We'll never

207
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,680
hear your beautiful music again.

208
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,520
You want a free lunch,

209
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,240
I'll make sure you don't even get breakfast.

210
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,290
That's not even the worst part.

211
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,320
The doctor says

212
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,050
he might become a vegetative patient.

213
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,040
Even if he wakes up,

214
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,880
he might not be able to take care of himself.

215
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,360
He'll be incontinent.

216
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,760
I'm sorry, senior.

217
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,080
If only I had run faster,

218
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,380
Teacher Chen wouldn't be in this condition.

219
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,010
But don't worry, Teacher Chen,

220
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,260
I'll take good care of your wife and Yiyi.

221
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,600
Teacher Chen,

222
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,160
Chen Qingyu,

223
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,400
due to negligence

224
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,080
causing severe disability.

225
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,580
He might face criminal detention

226
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,800
and legal consequences.

227
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,100
Back then, I was

228
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,280
like a fish out of water,

229
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,300
helpless and lost.

230
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,010
Perhaps we aren't perfect,

231
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,920
but please accept

232
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,560
her in your heart.

233
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,800
Everyone has the right to love and be loved.

234
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,020
Since you've chosen to move forward,

235
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
don't dwell on

236
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,680
past wounds anymore.

237
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,080
Mommy, look at the butterfly.

238
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,460
Has it fastened its seatbelt?

239
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,920
Then let's

240
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,040
take off.
