1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,880
Actually,

3
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,720
compared to a calm and peaceful relationship,

4
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,440
I prefer intense love.

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,330
Only through intensity

6
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
can I feel truly loved.

7
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,010
You know perfectly well

8
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,200
that I can give you everything you want,

9
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,840
don't you?

10
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,560
Your father is a powerful figure in the music industry.

11
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,280
Your connections are extensive.

12
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,920
But I

13
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,440
am content with my current life.

14
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,720
I have a happy family

15
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,539
and an adorable daughter.

16
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,800
Is that so?

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,280
You didn't mention having a virtuous wife.

18
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,800
Do you ever get the feeling

19
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,240
that your daughter is like a bottomless pit

20
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,160
that will drain all your savings?

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,960
Think about it.

22
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,520
Honey.

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,250
The awards at this art festival seem quite prestigious.

24
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
I'm definitely going to win a prize.

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,840
You're so confident.

26
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,280
But I believe in your abilities.

27
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,640
By the way,

28
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,220
you mentioned you were under a lot of stress.

29
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,880
Can you tell me why?

30
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,760
Your daughter is like a bottomless pit

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,680
that will drain all your savings.

32
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,960
You fell asleep in the music room again.

33
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,240
What is real,

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,160
what is fake?

35
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,600
Xiaoting.

36
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,480
Sister Yazhi,

37
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,520
you're awake.

38
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,560
Where's Yiyi?

39
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,180
She went to school.

40
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,100
What about Chen Mo?

41
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,260
Teacher Chen went to work too.

42
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,850
How are you feeling?

43
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,700
Did you sleep well last night?

44
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,490
Did you have nightmares again?

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm fine.

46
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,520
Sister Yazhi,

47
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,210
I made breakfast

48
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,340
and I'll get you a bowl.

49
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,090
Sounds good.

50
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,120
Yazhi.

51
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,020
Teacher Chen repeatedly reminded me

52
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,720
to remind you to take your medicine on time.

53
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,930
I already took it this morning.

54
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,740
May I ask you something personal?

55
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,280
How long have you been like this?

56
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,600
For quite a while now.

57
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,400
When I was in school,

58
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,000
I tutored at a lady's house.

59
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,560
She was also a housewife

60
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,090
who stayed home alone every day

61
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,280
without anyone to talk to.

62
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,960
After a few years,

63
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,650
she developed depression.

64
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,920
Later,

65
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,840
I started visiting her regularly just to chat.

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,520
At first

67
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,200
I was just talking non-stop

68
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,300
and she wouldn't respond.

69
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,370
She gradually started telling me about herself.

70
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,320
Back and forth like this,

71
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,730
her emotional knots began to unravel.

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,260
And guess what happened next?

73
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,210
Her depression was completely cured.

74
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,920
Housewives

75
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,160
are prone to depression.

76
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
Yazhi,

77
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
if you have anything troubling you,

78
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,820
you can talk to me about it,

79
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,200
I've got nothing but time anyway.

80
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,570
Enjoy your meal.

81
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,720
I want to see how long you can keep up this act.

82
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,220
I wasn't always like this.

83
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,600
Before I got married,

84
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,040
I was an OB-GYN at the hospital.

85
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,720
One of my patients,

86
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
suddenly had severe hemorrhaging.

87
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,700
How is she, Doctor?

88
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,680
She lost the baby,

89
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,640
and probably won't be able to conceive again.

90
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,170
A classic case of drug-induced miscarriage.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Yazhi.

92
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,240
I'm sorry,

93
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,010
it's not your fault.

94
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,840
Yazhi.

95
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,320
Yazhi.

96
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,000
Since then,

97
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,320
I've been traumatized.

98
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,880
And after giving birth to Yiyi,

99
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,480
I had postpartum depression

100
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
and never really recovered from it.

101
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,540
So what happened next?

102
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,610
What happened to that pregnant woman?

103
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,600
I never saw her again.

104
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,220
It's like she vanished into thin air.

105
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,800
It's been seven years now.

106
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,560
But recently,

107
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,520
I've been having this strange feeling.

108
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,480
I keep feeling like she's back,

109
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,680
like she's right beside me.

110
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,960
How do I explain it...

111
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,680
It's like

112
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,000
someone is watching me.

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
It's all in your head.

114
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,679
Dr. Chen already told you

115
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,919
that you're just imagining things.

116
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,340
Stop thinking about all this.

117
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,460
Think about something positive.

118
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,039
For instance,

119
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,340
Yiyi hasn't wet her bed for several days now.

120
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,760
Not once yesterday.

121
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,330
The electrical therapy device is working after all.

122
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,130
I've never told anyone about this before.

123
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
This matter

124
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,250
has been weighing on my heart like a stone,

125
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,720
making it hard for me to breathe.

126
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,690
But after talking to you today,

127
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,180
I feel much more relieved.

128
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,160
Oh, Xiaoting,

129
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,080
would you come with me to pick up Yiyi today?

130
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,740
I'd like to get out for a while.

131
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,560
Sure.

132
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,080
By the way.

133
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,770
You seem to feel like someone's watching you.

134
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,280
Actually,

135
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,740
I feel the same way.

136
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
I remember

137
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,000
there was a woman.

138
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,900
It's happened several times.

139
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,730
Acting all suspicious.

140
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,040
Where did you see her?

141
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,460
At the school gate,

142
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,280
when I was picking up Yiyi after school.

143
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,500
She was standing not far away.

144
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,720
This woman is strange,

145
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,860
she wasn't there to pick up any child.

146
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,000
She was just in the corner staring at me.

147
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
Staring at me the whole time.

148
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,170
It hasn't just happened once or twice.

149
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,130
Did you see what she looks like?

150
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,400
Did you see what she looks like?

151
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,730
What does she look like?

152
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,600
She has a pointed face.

153
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,560
She was wearing a mask and a hat.

154
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,920
Yiyi.

155
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,840
Why is this child's face red?

156
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,800
Mom, you don't understand art,

157
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,760
this is a dead child.

158
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,240
Why would Yiyi draw a dead child?

159
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,760
Mom,

160
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,480
would you kill me?

161
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,600
Yiyi.

162
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,770
What are you talking about?

163
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,760
Mommy loves

164
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you and your daddy more than anyone else.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,800
Mommy won't let anyone hurt you.

166
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,080
Mom,

167
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,240
have you ever killed children?

168
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,600
Who told you that?

169
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,440
You did, Mom.

170
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,920
I

171
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,800
never said that.

172
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,700
I have never killed any children.

173
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,440
Never.

174
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,280
Mom.

175
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,200
Have you ever killed a child?

176
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,680
Would you kill me?

177
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,280
I've never killed a child.
