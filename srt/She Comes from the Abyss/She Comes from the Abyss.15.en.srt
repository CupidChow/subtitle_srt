1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,600
Qingyu.

3
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,280
Have you done

4
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,480
what I asked you to do?

5
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,410
And you're fooling around with a maid.

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,800
Qingyu.

7
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,960
That maid

8
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,600
is just a pawn to get rid

9
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,130
of the mother and daughter.

10
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,760
Trust me.

11
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,440
If you don't want to lose

12
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,410
everything you've gained,

13
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,840
you should know

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,880
what to do, right?

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,330
Don't worry.

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,560
Whatever I want,

17
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,160
no one will stand in my way.

18
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,000
You should have

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,460
told me the truth earlier.

20
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
From the very first day

21
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,840
I imagined Meng Xiaoting,

22
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,320
you should have told me the truth.

23
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,100
That would have been very dangerous.

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,000
Because patients with mental disorders,

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
when triggered,

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,260
might harm themselves

27
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,520
or even hurt others.

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,240
Because their cognitive function

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,900
has already become confused.

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,600
So with these types of patients,

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,640
we must be extremely careful

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,240
and patient.

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,440
Honey,

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,320
why are you so good to me?

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,920
It's what I should do.

36
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,280
Senior,

37
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,200
senior.

38
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,320
Hey, Teacher Su,

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,120
could you please

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
help me look up a medication?

41
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,560
What is Meng Xiaoting

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,680
really like in your eyes?

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,700
She's very beautiful.

44
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,560
She should be

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,440
your type.

46
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,880
She is my type.

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,160
Isn't that

48
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,370
exactly what you look like?

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,800
It's not me.

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,600
But Meng Xiaoting

51
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,360
really resembles someone from before.

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,079
Who?

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,560
I can't remember.

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
So tonight,

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,440
can you sleep with me?

56
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I still can't stay with you tonight.

57
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,480
I was busy in the kitchen

58
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,880
when you just ran in.

59
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,520
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,700
Take your medicine and get some rest.

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,240
Senior.

62
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,080
Xiaocheng.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
How are you?

64
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,800
Are you feeling better?

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,280
You scared me to death that night.

66
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,080
You said on the phone

67
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,560
that you had something important to tell me.

68
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,360
What is it?

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,600
Also, about that day,

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,040
thank you for taking me home.

71
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,519
What exactly happened

72
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,779
the night before last?

73
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,000
What did Chen Mo

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,560
actually tell you?

75
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,220
Where is my senior sister's room?

76
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,570
Don't touch her.

77
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
What did you do to her?

78
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,080
That's a question

79
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,340
I should be asking you.

80
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
What did you do to my wife?

81
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,720
I'll ask you again,

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,040
what did you do to my senior?

83
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,040
She suddenly ran out,

84
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,530
I don't know why either.

85
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,320
What did she tell you?

86
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,320
Do you know

87
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,800
she was crying in the neighborhood?

88
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
If it wasn't because of you,

89
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,260
why would she be like this?

90
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,440
Her mental issues are serious,

91
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,250
she probably had a sudden episode.

92
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,680
Why are her mental issues

93
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,080
getting worse and worse?

94
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,120
You dare to bet?

95
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,880
Are you saying you have nothing to do with it?

96
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,720
Yazhi

97
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,200
is my wife,

98
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,250
everything I do is for her own good.

99
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,480
Chen Mo,

100
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,360
don't you think

101
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,820
you're being ridiculous?

102
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Thank you for bringing my wife back.

103
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,080
If there's nothing else,

104
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,520
you can leave now.

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,760
Chen Mo,

106
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
there's something you should know.

107
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,200
The truth can never be hidden.

108
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,760
You know that.

109
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,330
My condition is quite serious.

110
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,280
Before Chen Mo showed me

111
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,720
the test results,

112
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,690
I didn't know I had schizophrenia.

113
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,660
But yesterday he suddenly told me

114
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,640
that our housekeeper

115
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,040
was just my imagination.

116
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,880
So at that moment,

117
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,210
I had a bit of a breakdown

118
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,780
and couldn't control myself.

119
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,120
Senior,

120
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,840
what are you talking about?

121
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,480
What do you mean

122
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,800
the housekeeper is your imagination?

123
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,640
I always thought

124
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,960
we had a housekeeper

125
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,560
named Meng Xiaoting.

126
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,000
But actually,

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
she doesn't exist at all.

128
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,280
Senior,

129
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I've seen your housekeeper before.

130
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,400
You've seen her?

131
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,960
She does exist.

132
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,520
She's about this tall,

133
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,159
very thin and pale,

134
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,290
with a pointed face.

135
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,370
You've seen her?

136
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,400
Are you sure you've seen her?

137
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,460
Of course I'm sure.

138
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,760
Xiaocheng.

139
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,840
You're not just playing along

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,200
like Chen Mo, are you?

141
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,320
Senior,

142
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,650
Chen Mo must be lying to you.

143
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,520
Trust me,

144
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,320
he's definitely deceiving you.

145
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,180
And he's not just lying to you,

146
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,530
he wants to kill you.

147
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,120
The nail.

148
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,400
How did this nail get here?

149
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,240
It was put in after an injury from a fall.

150
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,760
Yingying.

151
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,680
Do you remember Li Meng?

152
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,320
How could I forget?

153
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,730
She hemorrhaged after a miscarriage.

154
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,640
Didn't she go insane afterward?

155
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Later she vanished without a trace.

156
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,760
No one has seen her since.

157
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,000
But I remember

158
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,760
she came to see me once.

159
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,360
Sooner or later,

160
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,220
I'll make you pay blood for blood.

161
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,080
I suspect Meng Xiaoting is actually Li Meng.

162
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,000
This thing is

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,330
what she used to warn me.

164
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,760
Then we

165
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,040
must find Meng Xiaoting.

166
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,370
I'll go search her room.

167
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,960
Hey.

168
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,000
Your sister won't be home tonight,

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,730
coming over?

170
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,480
Hey.

171
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
If you still want to be with me,

172
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,000
you better break up with

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,240
that bitch Meng Xiaoting soon.

174
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,040
You jerk,

175
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,480
how many women are you trying to juggle?

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,480
I've gotten rid of Meng Xiaoting.

177
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,200
Stay at your sister's place

178
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,480
and don't cause me any trouble.

179
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,210
I'll come see you when I'm free.

180
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,640
My sister is so gullible,

181
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,320
split personality -

182
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,160
such a ridiculous excuse

183
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,200
and she actually believes it.

184
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,600
You're just stringing her along.

185
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,240
But Meng Xiaoting,

186
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,640
that bitch won't get away either.

187
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,440
Just watch how I use

188
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,900
my sister to deal with her.

189
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,240
Sis.

190
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,040
I just searched their room,

191
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,500
but didn't find anything.

192
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,840
Sis.

193
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,600
Sis.

194
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,440
