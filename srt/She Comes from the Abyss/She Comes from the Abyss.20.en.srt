1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,920
Yazhi, you're here.

3
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,560
The keys.

4
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,920
Let's go.

5
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,520
Chen Mo!

6
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,760
Open the door!

7
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,680
Open up!

8
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,320
Honey, what brings you here?

9
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,720
Honey.

10
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,000
Are you alone?

11
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,920
Yes.

12
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,479
Why did you change the lock?

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,680
The lock cylinder broke.

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,759
I've been busy lately,

15
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,360
didn't have time to tell you.

16
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:58,680
Perfume.

17
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,040
Yes,

18
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,560
I put it on.

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,400
It smells familiar,

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
very similar to what someone

21
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,130
around me has been wearing lately.

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,759
Honey, you forgot again.

23
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,400
This is the perfume you gave me

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,440
on my birthday.

25
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,680
Honey.

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,890
Are you feeling unwell?

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Honey,

28
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,680
I think I saw Meng Xiaoting again.

29
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
Come, sit down first.

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,240
Come.

31
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,980
Did you skip taking your medicine again?

32
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,360
I did take it.

33
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,480
I even took two pills at once.

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,640
After taking them,

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,880
I felt really dizzy.

36
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
And guess what?

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,640
I ran into Meng Xiaoting in the neighborhood.

38
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,520
Honey,

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,080
do you think I took too much medicine

40
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,280
and I'm having side effects?

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, this medication,

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,530
one pill is usually enough,

43
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,640
but two pills shouldn't be a problem.

44
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,520
It's mostly psychological.

45
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,560
Since you're not feeling well,

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
you shouldn't go out.

47
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Just rest at home.

48
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,640
Then, later,

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,880
can you take me home?

50
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,440
Of course.

51
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,880
I wouldn't feel comfortable

52
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,340
letting you go back alone.

53
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,720
Honey.

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,520
I forgot to bring something.

55
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,040
Meng Xiaoting?

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,400
Chen Mo?

57
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,300
Why is Meng Xiaoting here?

58
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,400
Honey.

59
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,060
You forgot.

60
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,100
I can't see Meng Xiaoting.

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,650
Hallucination.

62
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,480
Since it's a hallucination.

63
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,360
I see you're hiding here

64
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,690
and feeling miserable.

65
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,400
After all, you're

66
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,960
a part of my personality.

67
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,600
If you suffer, I suffer too.

68
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,000
Come out.

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,560
Come out now.

70
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,640
Come out!

71
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,050
That's for trying to steal my husband.

72
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,920
Having a split personality isn't so bad.

73
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,380
I can vent whenever I want.

74
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,720
Honey, you should try it too.

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,960
Meng Xiaoting is right here.

76
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,960
You can't see her,

77
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,680
but just imagine her standing right here.

78
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,320
Give it two hard punches.

79
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,700
It's super stress-relieving

80
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,300
and really helps you vent.

81
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,560
Come on,

82
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:32,890
give it a try.

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,520
Hit it!

84
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,080
Honey, I know you're upset.

85
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,580
Can I take you home?

86
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,080
Xiaozhi.

87
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,240
What's wrong?

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,320
Are you afraid I'll stab her?

89
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,560
You've seen her?

90
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,210
I'm sorry, Azhi.

91
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,180
I've been unfaithful.

92
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,640
Could you

93
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,040
forgive me for Yiyi's sake?

94
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,840
Please?

95
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Stop right there.

96
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,370
You've been lying to me for so long.

97
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,330
Don't you even have an apology?

98
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,860
You don't deserve one.

99
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,920
Chen Mo.

100
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,880
For Yiyi's sake.

101
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,320
I can forgive you,

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,920
but this matter can't just be

103
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,320
swept under the rug.

104
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,280
Bring Meng Xiaoting home tonight.

105
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
I want all three of us present

106
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,800
to clear things up.

107
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,440
Otherwise,

108
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,160
I'll kick you out with nothing.

109
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,400
Hello.

110
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,159
Where's my daughter?

111
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,340
She's already been picked up?

112
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,000
Picked up?

113
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,970
Was she picked up by her father?

114
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,100
Your family's nanny took her.

115
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,280
Senior.

116
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,330
Didn't I tell you to watch Yiyi?

117
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,090
She was taken by Meng Xiaoting.

118
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,880
I...

119
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,920
Quick, take her down.

120
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,920
Ms. Ting.

121
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,360
We're not going home,

122
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,920
where are we going?

123
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,240
I'm taking you to meet a boy.

124
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,240
What's his name?

125
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,159
He's my son.

126
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,039
He's only six months older than you.

127
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,100
His last name is also Chen.

128
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,760
You have another child?

129
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,880
Yiyi.

130
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
Are you hungry?

131
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,140
Would you like some strawberry milk?

132
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,920
Do you

133
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,000
want one?

134
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,720
What is this?

135
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,560
Just as you said,

136
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,080
to avenge our child.

137
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,960
Just add a little bit

138
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,280
to Lin Yazhi's food,

139
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,320
and she'll die

140
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,920
without anyone suspecting.

141
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,800
The cause of death: drug allergy.

142
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,920
I can't do it myself.

143
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,400
If I were to do it,

144
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,900
I'd be too suspicious.

145
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,160
Mengmeng.

146
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,560
Let's start over.

147
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,720
Where have you hidden Yiyi?

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,800
Yiyi?

149
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Your cousin said you picked her up.

150
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,560
You're lying.

151
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,960
At a time like this,

152
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,840
you're still deceiving me.

153
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,720
Honey, if you don't believe me,

154
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,640
I'll call my cousin.

155
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,700
Stop playing dumb.

156
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,240
Tell me.

157
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,520
Where have you and Meng Xiaoting

158
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,840
hidden Yiyi?

159
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,720
It was Meng Xiaoting who took Yiyi away.

160
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,880
Stop pretending.

161
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,920
Thank you, Aunt Xiaoting.

162
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,080
Strawberry milk is so much better than plain milk.

163
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,880
Hmm.
