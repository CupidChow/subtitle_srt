1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,680
What beautiful hands.

3
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,800
I thought

4
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,920
I had time

5
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,600
to wait patiently

6
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,260
for you to achieve your dream,

7
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,120
but now it seems

8
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,440
I'm getting impatient.

9
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,479
Soon,

10
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,560
Meng Xiaoting

11
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,920
will be the final note

12
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,360
to fulfill our dream.

13
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,200
From now on,

14
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,140
you can only smell like me,

15
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,479
you cannot have

16
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,000
any other woman's scent on you.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,160
In this lifetime,

18
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,050
you'll never escape me,

19
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,960
you can only be mine.

20
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,840
I guess in my entire life,

21
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
I'll never find someone who loves

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,280
me as much as she does.

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,480
There's something wrong with the medicine,

24
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,880
which means

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,650
there's something wrong with Chen Mo.

26
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,520
However,

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,360
how can you be sure?

28
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
So Meng Xiaoting isn't just

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,960
someone you've imagined?

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,560
Would an imaginary person

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,240
have medical reports?

32
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,280
Chen Mo has left.

33
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Meet at the studio

34
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,520
at 3 a.m.

35
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,960
Hello,

36
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,280
who are you looking for?

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,040
There's a new swimming pool that just opened nearby.

38
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,840
Are you interested in swimming?

39
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,290
Whether you exist or not

40
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,680
isn't for Chen Mo to decide.

41
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,840
It's too dangerous for you to be alone, senior.

42
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,090
Professor Chen.

43
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,330
Playing the piano by yourself?

44
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,820
Have a seat.

45
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,500
Unfortunately, I'm just a common person

46
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,010
with no taste for such refined pleasures.

47
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,600
Go ahead, ask.

48
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,360
Have you seen my wife?

49
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,080
Yes,

50
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,850
but I don't know her.

51
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,290
When did you see her?

52
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:41,960
When I went to your house

53
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,490
looking for Meng Xiaoting.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,880
So what's your relationship

55
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,010
with Meng Xiaoting?

56
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
She owes me money,

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,180
I came to collect the debt.

58
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,330
You were looking for her and now me,

59
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,540
just to collect a debt?

60
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,200
Do I look like I'm lying?

61
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,160
No.

62
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,120
From the moment I saw you,

63
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,140
I knew you were a smart person.

64
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,040
You clearly have a story.

65
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,480
Promising since childhood.

66
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,280
You look a lot like

67
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,810
one of my younger brothers.

68
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,440
He really loved peanuts.

69
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,340
In the past,

70
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,700
we used to harvest peanuts together.

71
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,720
We'd go barefoot,

72
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,920
stepping in the soil.

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,960
The earth felt

74
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,540
cool against our skin.

75
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,730
You'd pull out a string of peanuts.

76
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,520
Peanuts at that time

77
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,380
were the tenderest and sweetest.

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,280
You'd lie down on the peanut leaves.

79
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,610
Clouds floating in the sky.

80
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,220
And you'd fall asleep.

81
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,800
Are Meng Xiaoting and Li Meng

82
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,280
the same person?

83
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,600
Yes.

84
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,360
Did Meng Xiaoting come

85
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
to take revenge on Lin Yazhi?

86
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,200
Yes.

87
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,000
Do you know Li Meng?

88
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,800
Yes.

89
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,520
When did you meet Li Meng?

90
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,040
I've known her since childhood.

91
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,000
When did you meet Chen Mo?

92
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,240
A long time ago.

93
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,960
The power's out in this building,

94
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,040
they're closing up.

95
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,920
Let's go!

96
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,780
You're giving up on the money?

97
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Let me tell you,

98
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,640
I know about all the dirty things you've done,

99
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,370
you'd better stay away from me.

100
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,320
Senior.

101
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:10,930
Let's go.

102
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,640
Whatever you know,

103
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,320
keep your mouth shut,

104
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,400
or I'll kill you.

105
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,680
Tell me everything you know.

106
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Miss Lin,

107
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,010
you've been hiding quite well.

108
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,720
Talk and I'll call an ambulance for you.

109
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,159
If you don't, I'll smash your head in. You believe me?

110
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,520
Go ahead if you dare.

111
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,240
You think we don't dare?

112
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,159
If you die,

113
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,159
Chen Mo will be the only suspect,

114
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,160
and we'll have nothing to do with it.

115
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,480
Do you still

116
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,080
think we don't have the guts?

117
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,530
Li Meng is Meng Xiaoting's cousin.

118
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,240
It was Li Meng.

119
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,400
She arranged for Meng Xiaoting to stay by your side

120
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,460
so she could find a chance to kill you.

121
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,680
How do you know that?

122
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,880
Li Meng and I are from the same hometown,

123
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,920
I've helped her many times.

124
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Meng Xiaoting's fake ID

125
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,080
was arranged by me.

126
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,640
Go on.

127
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,880
That's all.

128
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,440
Finished?

129
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,520
Fine,

130
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,640
you're done talking?

131
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,000
Then I'll send you to meet your maker first.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,929
I'm telling you, this is all I know.

133
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,159
If that's all you know,

134
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,120
then why would Chen Mo

135
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,450
kill to silence anyone?

136
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,120
Do you take us for fools?

137
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,880
Talk.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,159
Seven years ago,

139
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,920
Li Meng, in order to help Chen Mo.

140
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,840
She had just graduated then.

141
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,680
Are you pregnant?

142
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,480
Yes.

143
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,820
Congratulations.

144
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,960
Thank you.

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,560
Honey,

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,720
I'm home.

147
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,360
You scared me.

148
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
I have a surprise.

149
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,300
What surprise?

150
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,840
Take a guess.

151
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,320
Did you find a new job?

152
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,400
Guess again.

153
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,500
Then I have no idea.

154
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,880
I'm pregnant.

155
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
You don't like it?

156
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,000
No,

157
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,360
I do.

158
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,640
This is our child.

159
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,520
But right now

160
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,500
I don't even have a job.

161
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,960
I'm just a broke student.

162
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,020
Food, daily expenses,

163
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,240
and rent,

164
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,640
it's all from

165
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,000
your part-time jobs.

166
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,040
I can't even

167
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,320
afford the bride price to marry you.

168
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,920
I don't want any bride price.

169
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,160
As long as you're willing,

170
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,490
we can get our marriage license tomorrow.

171
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,600
You really don't mind that I'm poor?

172
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Just focus on your doctoral exam at home.

173
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,480
Once you get your PhD and make good money,

174
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,280
I'm counting on you

175
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,810
to buy formula for our baby.

176
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,840
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,160
There's actually quite a big gap between people.

178
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,600
I went for a check-up today

179
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,760
and met this young lady

180
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,600
who became a doctor right after graduation.

181
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
She's beautiful,

182
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,800
comes from a wealthy family,

183
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,330
a typical rich pretty girl,

184
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
and still single.

185
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,200
I can manage by myself.

186
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,100
You're studying psychology?

187
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,480
I'm preparing for my doctorate.

188
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,480
But compared to being a psychologist,

189
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,040
I'd rather be a pianist.

190
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,840
A pianist?

191
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,720
She said she wants someone tall,

192
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,600
slim,

193
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,560
refined,

194
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,920
preferably wearing glasses,

195
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,320
and involved in the arts.

196
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,730
Because pianos, like psychologists,

197
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,220
both have the power to move people's hearts.

198
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,040
You're

199
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,370
also from the medical department.

200
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,330
How did you know?

201
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,600
I...

202
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,240
You smell

203
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,330
like hospital antiseptic.

204
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,180
Is it that obvious?

205
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,810
Maybe I just have a sensitive nose.

206
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,640
I've been strange since childhood,

207
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,100
I don't care for perfumes,

208
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,080
but I love

209
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,570
the smell of hospital antiseptic.

210
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
You are quite strange indeed.

211
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm an OB-GYN.

212
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,880
Wow,

213
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,210
that's impressive!

214
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,020
So young and already a doctor.

215
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,130
You're impressive too,

216
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,560
about to take your doctoral exams.

217
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,280
Good luck.

218
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,800
Thanks.

219
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,800
Tonight at six,

220
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,400
Sure.

221
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,280
would you like to have dinner together?

222
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,080
Okay.

223
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,600
What food do you like?

224
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,480
My treat.
