1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,560
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,290
Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

3
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,840
She's right here.

4
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,880
Stop it.

5
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,560
It's fine.

6
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,960
I've hypnotized her.

7
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,810
She won't wake up anytime soon.

8
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,120
Professor Chen,

9
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,000
you're so devoted.

10
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,640
Even when she's this sick,

11
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,080
you still take such good care of her.

12
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,880
Of course.

13
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,120
Without her,

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,680
how could I have such a good life?

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,520
But she's about to...

16
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,280
What?

17
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,520
Are you going to kill her?

18
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,720
Chen Mo.

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,220
What are you doing?

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,700
What are you all doing?

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,400
Honey,

22
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,520
what's wrong?

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You bastard!

24
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,880
You bastard!

25
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,400
Honey.

26
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,760
Honey, what did I do?

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,520
Where are they?

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
Where did you hide them?

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,920
No.

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,560
You're dreaming.

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,320
Are you dreaming, honey?

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,040
There's nobody.

33
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,160
You're dreaming, honey.

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,440
I don't believe you.

35
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,760
What are they doing?

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,320
Honey.

37
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,480
Honey.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,520
Honey.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,640
Honey.

40
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,840
There's no one here,

41
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,240
honey.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,079
Honey.

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,079
Calm down.

44
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,560
Honey.

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,560
Honey.

46
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,079
What's wrong, honey?

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,920
Honey.

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,079
Impossible.

49
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,400
Mr. Chen.

50
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,560
You still have a long way to go.

51
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,920
Not to mention you don't understand your clients well enough.

52
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,959
Teacher Chen,

53
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm sorry,

54
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,000
I've failed again.

55
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,970
You know I'm afraid of cold,

56
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,880
so you created a scene with heavy snow

57
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,240
by a fireplace.

58
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,560
But you didn't consider that

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,440
someone who truly fears the cold

60
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,640
would never want to live in such a place.

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,800
I'd rather be lying on a beach in Bali.

62
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,540
More than this,

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,860
I prefer the sound of ocean waves.

64
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,040
Keep trying.

65
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm sorry,

66
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,720
but why does your piano music

67
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,000
make customers feel so relaxed?

68
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,159
My music can be tailored for each customer.

69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,180
Can you do that?

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,520
Mengjie,

71
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,520
our studio focuses on music therapy.

72
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,960
But you

73
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,760
want to be a hypnotist.

74
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,480
What's the difference?

75
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,280
They're completely different.

76
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,440
Yiyi.

77
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,360
Why are you here all alone?

78
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,940
Would you like Mommy to play with you?

79
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,440
Yiyi.

80
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,680
Come here.

81
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,320
Yiyi.

82
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,680
Let's not play with kids who are jealous of us, okay?

83
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's go.

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,520
Off we go.

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,240
Taking off now!

86
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,640
Coming!

87
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,720
Who is it?

88
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,320
I finally found you.

89
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,920
Xiaoting.

90
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,730
Who are you looking for?

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,480
Hello,

92
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,400
may I ask who you're looking for?

93
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,840
Hello,

94
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,000
there's a new swimming pool that just opened nearby.

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Are you interested in swimming?

96
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Not at the moment,

97
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
sorry about that.

98
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,080
Xiaoting,

99
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,300
close the door.

100
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,800
Two days,

101
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,760
100,000 yuan,

102
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,440
I promise they won't know.

103
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Then I'll get straight to the point.

104
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,090
I want to borrow 100,000 yuan from you.

105
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,920
I'll transfer it to you after signing.

106
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,320
After this, find an excuse to resign from my wife's company.

107
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,560
I don't want to see you again.

108
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,840
You don't think I'm blackmailing you, do you?

109
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,440
You might have misunderstood.

110
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
I'm just borrowing.

111
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,500
It doesn't matter.

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,320
If you need money,

113
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,890
consider it my help.

114
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,840
If this is blackmail,

115
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,620
I hope this money will make it go away.

116
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,690
I love my wife very much,

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,060
and don't want to complicate things.

118
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,160
Is it possible

119
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,780
that I just couldn't control myself?

120
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,080
Who says only men have desires?

121
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,240
You're so perfect,

122
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,880
standing naked in the bathroom in the morning,

123
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,360
water droplets on your abs,

124
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,800
what woman could resist?

125
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,920
It's okay,

126
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,600
I'll pay you back,

127
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,640
worst case, take it from my nanny salary.

128
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,530
Why was Meng Xiaoting coming out of Chen Mo's office?

129
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,800
What was she doing here?

130
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Li Meng.
