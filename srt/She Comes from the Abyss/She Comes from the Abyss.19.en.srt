1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,120
I still can't believe

3
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,740
Chen Mo would try to poison me.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,360
What's the reason behind all this?

5
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,760
For the money, of course.

6
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,280
Your parents set up

7
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,440
a $4 million trust fund for you.

8
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,480
To be honest,

9
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,680
this money has nothing to do with Chen Mo.

10
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,240
But if you die,

11
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,520
the money goes to Yiyi,

12
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,380
which means it becomes Chen Mo's.

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,160
But Chen Mo isn't short of money either.

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,039
My parents are wealthy too,

15
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,440
they've never put any financial pressure on him,

16
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,039
and his studio is doing well,

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,680
my money is his money too.

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,400
Have you ever considered

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,400
that he just wants to get rid of you?

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,160
He never loved you at all,

21
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,360
he just wanted to take

22
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,690
what he needed from you.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,600
And all those women he cheated with

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,200
had something he wanted,

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,160
just different things, that's all.

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,320
He had his motives

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,250
from the moment he approached you.

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,259
Think about it,

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,479
how could he get

30
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,440
his doctorate so easily

31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,160
if not through

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,720
your father's connections?

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,360
And also,

34
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,000
if it weren't for your family's

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,760
startup money for his studio,

36
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,880
would he be where he is today?

37
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,759
And those international concerts,

38
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,890
the media coverage,

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,920
all came through your family's connections.

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,240
He's already gotten

41
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,600
everything he wanted from you,

42
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,400
you have no value to him anymore,

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,040
he never loved you.

44
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,000
And that Li Meng,

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,920
who was so good to him,

46
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,440
he threw her away

47
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,360
like garbage

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,690
just to get close to you.

49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
You got lucky,

50
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,840
Li Meng had a miscarriage,

51
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,200
so he could

52
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,079
pursue you without any concerns.

53
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,770
What if it wasn't just luck?

54
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,200
Deliberately setting up Li Meng,

55
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
so he could be free of worries.

56
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,320
It's all just speculation.

57
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,280
We don't have any evidence right now.

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,720
But Li Meng's miscarriage back then

59
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,440
was very suspicious to begin with.

60
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,600
The director, to minimize

61
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,720
the impact of the incident,

62
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,560
pushed all the blame onto you,

63
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,560
but you know the truth.

64
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,860
Enough, stop talking.

65
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,040
I'm going to call the police now

66
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,240
and then divorce him.

67
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,080
What would you tell the police?

68
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,640
Fine,

69
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,840
you'll get justice for Zhao Kai,

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,520
Chen Mo will be charged

71
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,600
with intentional assault,

72
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,520
but what about you?

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,840
Your life will be completely ruined by him.

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,680
Listen to me first.

75
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
You now have evidence of his assault,

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,610
you can have him arrested anytime.

77
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,800
What you need to do now

78
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,000
is find evidence that he caused

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
Li Meng's miscarriage back then.

80
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,360
This way Meng Xiaoting won't harm you,

81
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,040
and you can clear your name.

82
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,240
Then I'll divorce him first.

83
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
Make him leave with nothing.

84
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,690
What's your reason?

85
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,360
Do I need a reason?

86
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,079
He's been poisoning me

87
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,210
for all these years.

88
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,800
First of all,

89
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,680
you have no proof

90
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,200
that it was poison.

91
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,200
He just used excessive amounts.

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,560
And he can easily claim

93
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,800
it was for your own good,

94
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,840
to cure you.

95
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,640
Besides, think about it,

96
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,200
if you divorce him,

97
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,810
can you get custody of Yiyi?

98
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,840
He'll definitely make a big deal

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,970
about your history of mental illness.

100
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,100
The court won't award Yiyi to you.

101
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,280
Yiyi?

102
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,210
What about Yiyi?

103
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,280
Chen Mo sent Yiyi

104
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,880
to his cousin's house to play.

105
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,400
How could you let him

106
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,240
take Yiyi away?

107
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,640
He's Yiyi's father.

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,940
He loves her very much.

109
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,000
I've never doubted that.

110
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,240
You should call

111
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,700
and check with his cousin.

112
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,420
Let me make a call to check.

113
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,079
Hello,

114
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,160
cousin,

115
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,240
it's Yazhi.

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,920
Where's Yiyi?

117
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,050
Is she having a good time at your place?

118
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,960
Yiyi?

119
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,440
She never came to my place.

120
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,240
What?

121
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,480
Where could he have

122
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
taken Yiyi?

123
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,920
Think quickly.

124
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,200
Where could he have taken Yiyi?

125
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,720
Doesn't Yiyi know

126
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
her way home?

127
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,850
The city isn't that big.

128
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,260
Yiyi remembers everywhere she goes.

129
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,160
She doesn't know the way.

130
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,800
Chengyu!

131
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:17,970
Let's go!

132
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,960
Who are you talking to?

133
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,320
Come on!

134
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,000
Go!

135
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,050
Where is this place?

136
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,720
Chen Mo, this is an old house in the suburbs.

137
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,040
Yiyi!

138
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Mommy.

139
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't cry,

140
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,240
Mommy's here.

141
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,440
Are you hurt?

142
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,520
Let Mommy see.

143
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,120
Are you hurt?

144
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,360
Xiaocheng.

145
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,920
After we go back,

146
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,200
can Yiyi stay at your place for a while?

147
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,400
Don't worry, senior,

148
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,130
I'll take good care of Yiyi.

149
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,159
Thank you.

150
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,260
Chen Mo, do you know

151
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,480
that your disbelief in Meng Xiaoting

152
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,940
is just your imagination?

153
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,730
He doesn't know yet,

154
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,520
but I don't have time to play along anymore.

155
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,280
Yiyi was almost

156
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
killed by Chen Mo and Meng Xiaoting.

157
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,400
Do you really think Meng Xiaoting

158
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,520
has such power

159
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,240
that she could make Chen Mo willing

160
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,640
to harm his own daughter?

161
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,160
Are you saying

162
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,980
it's because of that Ms. Chen?

163
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,760
Meng Xiaoting is just

164
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,800
a tool he's using to do his dirty work.

165
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
But this woman,

166
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
why would she do this?

167
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,520
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

168
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,159
Chen Mo wants to climb the social ladder,

169
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,159
so he must pay the price.

170
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
Anyone who dares to harm my daughter

171
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,880
will also pay the price.

172
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,320
What is this?

173
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,200
It's called an ocean drum.

174
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,080
Didn't you say

175
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,880
you like the sound of the ocean?

176
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,520
This way,

177
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,960
you can hear the ocean

178
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,360
in your office.

179
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,520
It's for you.

180
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,560
Thank you.

181
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,080
This gift comes with strings attached.

182
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,320
I knew it.

183
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,120
Go ahead.

184
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,559
I want to see if I can use it

185
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,530
to hypnotize a master like you.

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,400
If someone of your caliber

187
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,000
can be controlled by me,

188
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,320
then it means I've truly mastered it.

189
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,080
There you go again.

190
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,320
Why do you psychology students

191
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,180
always want to hypnotize people?

192
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,600
I'm not a hypnosis master,

193
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
just a

194
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,640
pianist

195
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,000
who talks about music

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,530
to help clients feel a bit better, that's all.

197
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,160
Teacher Chen, you're being too modest.

198
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,840
I've experienced

199
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,570
your music therapy firsthand.

200
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,250
Don't say I didn't warn you,

201
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,880
besides my teacher Eric,

202
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,600
no one has ever successfully hypnotized me.

203
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,520
I'll practice with you next time.

204
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,850
I have a client meeting.

205
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,280
You finally agreed to see me.

206
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,520
I'm sorry

207
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,610
for making you hide before.

208
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,520
Go ahead,

209
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,880
why did you ask me to come?

210
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,240
We shouldn't

211
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,170
see each other anymore.

212
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,600
Why?

213
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,740
Is it because of your wife?

214
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,880
I'm sorry,

215
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,820
it's not because of Yazhi,

216
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,820
it's because of someone else.

217
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,600
Who?

218
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,760
The first time I saw you,

219
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,640
I thought your eyes

220
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,250
looked just like an old friend of mine.

221
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,690
Unfortunately,

222
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,280
I haven't seen her

223
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,340
for many years now.

224
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,320
Okay.

225
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,800
Was she your ex-girlfriend?

226
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,480
I guess so.

227
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,100
But not really.

228
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
In my heart,

229
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,060
I never thought of her as an ex.

230
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,960
She's the love of my life.

231
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,700
Her name is Li Meng.

232
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,520
What happened to her?

233
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,210
I looked for her for many years.

234
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,960
She was my first love.

235
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,130
We were supposed to have a child

236
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,880
together.

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
She suddenly had a miscarriage.

238
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,600
I was young and reckless.

239
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,780
I said many hurtful things to her.

240
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,640
After that,

241
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,800
I never saw her again.

242
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,530
If you loved her so much,

243
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,360
why did you end up

244
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,760
marrying Lin Yazhi?

245
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,760
When I was with Li Meng,

246
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,720
back then,

247
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,920
Lin Yazhi was constantly pursuing me.

248
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,080
She was relentless.

249
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,490
After Li Meng disappeared,

250
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,850
she threatened to use her father's connections.

251
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,380
If I didn't get together with her,

252
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,320
I wouldn't be able to get

253
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,000
my degree.

254
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,320
Why are you

255
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,980
suddenly telling me all this?

256
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,600
I'm sorry.

257
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,970
From the moment I first saw you,

258
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,330
I've been seeing you as Li Meng.

259
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,820
Thinking about it carefully,

260
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,420
that's not fair to you.

261
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,820
I've been fooling myself.

262
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,600
So,

263
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,860
we shouldn't see each other anymore.

264
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,920
What if Li Meng suddenly came back?

265
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,060
It's been seven years,

266
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,120
that's impossible.

267
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,980
I'm just saying hypothetically,

268
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,840
if Li Meng came back,

269
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,720
would you be willing to give up

270
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,250
everything and go with her?

271
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,320
If she came back,

272
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,890
I would give up everything.

273
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,500
Actually, I've been back for a while.

274
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,880
Look into my eyes.

275
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,570
Don't you recognize me?

276
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,240
I'm Mengmeng.

277
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,480
Xiaoting,

278
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,860
don't be like this.

279
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,720
Qiushi Road,

280
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,320
number 58,

281
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,320
Xingfuli Complex,

282
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Building 3,

283
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,920
apartment 402.

284
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,840
That's where

285
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,240
we conceived our child.

286
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,440
Just focus on

287
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,130
your doctoral studies at home.

288
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,240
Once you get your doctorate and make good money,

289
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,120
we'll be counting on you

290
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,650
to buy formula for our baby.

291
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,120
Well, I don't make much money now

292
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,520
but

293
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,680
it's enough for food and housing.

294
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,160
Mengmeng.

295
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,680
Chen Mo.

296
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,740
I had plastic surgery.

297
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,280
But a person's eyes

298
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,640
never lie.

299
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,250
You didn't recognize me wrong.

300
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,720
I am Li Meng.

301
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,080
Mengmeng, why?

302
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,920
Why?

303
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,360
Where have you been all these years?

304
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,040
Why did you change your name?

305
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,160
Why did you come back?

306
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,200
Lin Yazhi killed our child.

307
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,640
What?

308
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,680
It was Lin Yazhi.

309
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Lin Yazhi deliberately

310
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
caused our child's death.

311
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,210
I want her to pay for this murder with her life.

312
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
Don't be ridiculous.

313
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,760
Chen Mo,

314
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,400
don't you want to

315
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,680
avenge our child?

316
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,520
Of course I do,

317
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,770
but have you thought about the consequences?

318
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,760
I can't lose you again.

319
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,840
No,

320
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,640
I can't let this go.

321
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,800
Mengmeng,

322
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,760
we can have

323
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,620
another child.

324
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,680
We can't,

325
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,600
I can't have children anymore.

326
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,120
This is all Lin Yazhi's fault,

327
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,600
everything because of her.

328
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,160
I'll make her pay with her life.

329
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,600
A life for a life.

330
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,200
So,

331
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,560
will you join me?

332
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,600
It's okay,

333
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,640
I can do it alone.

334
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,880
Mengmeng,

335
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,160
I'm with you.

336
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,840
Yazhi, you're here.
