1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,320
Hello?

3
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,660
Meng Xiaoting,

4
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,730
I'm sending you a location.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,660
Chen Mo has brought Yiyi here,

6
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
the room number is

7
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,080
306.

8
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,560
Hello?

9
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,920
Hello?

10
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,160
Who are you?

11
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,680
Zhouyu Hotel, room 306.

12
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,360
Chen Mo,

13
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,720
where's Yiyi?

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,320
When she came back earlier, she suddenly said

15
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,120
she wanted to play at the studio,

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,360
and Mengjie is with her now.

17
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,960
Then call Mengjie.

18
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,320
I want to see Yiyi.

19
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,940
She's really fine.

20
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,240
They're just playing together.

21
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,479
Are you calling or not?

22
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,210
If not, I'm calling the police.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,600
I'll call.

24
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,600
Mengjie,

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,800
where's Yiyi?

26
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,890
Her mother wants to see her.

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,440
She's been sleeping.

28
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,040
What's wrong, Teacher Chen?

29
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,480
Mengjie,

30
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,880
where have you taken Yiyi?

31
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,760
Where are you?

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,600
Tell me!

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,700
Let me tell you,

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,680
in this world

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,329
you can't trust anyone.

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,160
If the price is right,

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,460
everyone will betray you.

38
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,840
Tell me,

39
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,520
how did you hide Yiyi?

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,300
You're working with Zhao Kai.

41
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,640
I'm not like you.

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,580
Now you're different from me,

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,500
but you're just like that man.

44
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,840
Why do I feel that

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,120
when you hid Yiyi,

46
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,580
you were far more despicable than I ever was?

47
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,320
I trusted you so much before,

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,640
but you're just a bastard.

49
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,320
You trust me?

50
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,000
You planted Zuo Mengjie by my side,

51
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,200
testing and monitoring me,

52
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,560
and you call that trust?

53
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,280
Attorney Hao,

54
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,540
you can come in now.

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Let me introduce,

56
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,660
this is my divorce lawyer.

57
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,320
This

58
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
is the prepared divorce agreement.

59
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,940
According to this agreement,

60
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,079
after your divorce,

61
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,320
Chen Mo

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,120
will become your daughter

63
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,720
Chen Yiyi's sole legal guardian.

64
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,960
All marital assets,

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,079
including the house

66
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,540
where you currently live,

67
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,040
will belong to Chen Mo.

68
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,760
Lin Yazhi,

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,240
half of your trust fund

70
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,480
Half.

71
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,400
will also go to Chen Mo.

72
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,320
This agreement

73
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,360
I won't agree to a single term of it.

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,620
Then we have no choice.

75
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,720
We'll have to settle this in court.

76
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,970
Are you a professional lawyer?

77
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,840
The trust fund

78
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,280
is only in my name,

79
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,690
what does it have to do with Chen Mo?

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,600
I have

81
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,890
an agreement signed last year.

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,650
It's very clear.

83
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,240
It states that

84
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,680
once you two divorce,

85
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,480
your trust fund

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,600
will be split equally between you both.

87
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,720
You signed it.

88
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,280
This is not my signature.

89
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,200
I never signed this agreement.

90
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,800
You forged this.

91
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,880
When this agreement was signed,

92
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,680
there was a third party present.

93
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,900
The legal validity of this agreement

94
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,400
is without any flaws.

95
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,560
Honey.

96
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,300
Wake up, honey.

97
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,480
I suggest

98
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,920
you get a lawyer

99
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,480
and we can talk properly at the law firm tomorrow.

100
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,610
Yiyi is still young.

101
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,360
I don't want her to see us

102
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,820
fighting in court.

103
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,200
Attorney Hao,

104
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,120
let's go.

105
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,920
Mom.

106
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,040
Mommy.

107
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,600
Who are you?

108
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,200
Where am I?

109
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,400
My head hurts.

110
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,360
And who am I?

111
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,720
Mom, my head hurts.

112
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,160
Don't you remember me?

113
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,840
Mom, are you really my mother?

114
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,840
Yes.

115
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,560
Yes,

116
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,560
I'm Yiyi's mother.

117
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,640
I'm your mom.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Mom, my head hurts,

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,840
I can't remember anything.

120
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,700
Don't be afraid, Yiyi,

121
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,240
Mom is here.

122
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,280
Don't be afraid, Yiyi.

123
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,640
Don't be scared.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,800
Mom is here.

125
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,120
Mom will explain everything to you later,

126
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,960
okay?

127
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,040
It's alright.

128
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,100
Meng Xiaoting.

129
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,600
Meng Xiaoting, what are you doing?

130
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,360
Mom, who is he? I'm scared.

131
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,520
Yiyi,

132
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,440
this is your father.

133
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,600
You've forgotten. It's your dad.

134
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,840
Yes, Yiyi.

135
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,960
It's your dad.

136
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,780
What are you afraid of?

137
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,280
Mom, I'm scared.

138
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,440
Did I just speak

139
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,600
too harshly to Yiyi?

140
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,480
Daddy didn't mean to.

141
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,280
Daddy loves Yiyi the most.

142
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,560
Mom, I'm scared.

143
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,960
Okay.

144
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,530
Come.

145
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,480
Yiyi,

146
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,700
would you like to sleep a bit more?

147
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,200
Mom, I'm scared.

148
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,480
Mom needs to talk to Dad for a moment,

149
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,200
I'll be right back,

150
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,000
okay?

151
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,860
Get some more rest.

152
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,200
Let me ask you,

153
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,240
what's really wrong with Yiyi?

154
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
Yiyi has lost her memory.

155
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,210
Lost her memory?

156
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,980
Is it related to that medicine she drank?

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,320
She doesn't even remember who she is.

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,640
She thinks I'm her mother.

159
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,970
What do you want?

160
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,840
If our child

161
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,320
hadn't died back then,

162
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,740
they would be the same age as Yiyi now.

163
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,360
I can't have children anymore.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,040
But I can treat Yiyi

165
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,640
as my own child,

166
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,400
wouldn't that be perfect revenge -

167
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,600
taking Lin Yazhi's child away from her?

168
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,620
Killing two birds with one stone.

169
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,680
Isn't that a great plan?

170
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
Besides, you are

171
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,930
Yiyi's real father anyway.

172
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,160
From now on,

173
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,160
the three of us

174
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,680
can live happily

175
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,320
together,

176
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,300
what do you say?

177
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,840
Okay.

178
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,560
Yiyi.

179
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,200
Yiyi.

180
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,880
Yiyi.

181
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,240
Yiyi.

182
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,160
Let go of my daughter!

183
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,000
Yiyi!

184
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,760
Come to mommy!

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,040
Come here!

186
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,720
Yiyi!

187
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,880
Have you been playing house

188
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,920
with Auntie Xiaoting?

189
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,400
I'm your real mother!

190
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,800
Lin Yazhi!

191
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,440
Let go!

192
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,080
Calm down!

193
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,960
What have you done to Yiyi?

194
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,920
Yiyi is your own daughter,

195
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,800
how could you

196
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,720
do such a thing!

197
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,440
Let go!

198
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,200
Release my daughter!

199
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,000
Calm down,

200
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,010
you're scaring her!

201
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,200
Come to Daddy.

202
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,840
Daddy's here.

203
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,240
When our family of three is together,

204
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,570
we have nothing to fear.

205
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,640
Attorney Hao.

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
The client is emotionally unstable.

207
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,720
I suggest

208
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,720
we reschedule for another time.

209
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,460
When your client has calmed down,

210
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,600
we can set up another appointment.

211
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,530
Don't be afraid.

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,330
Everything's okay now.

213
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,120
Lin Yazhi.

214
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,000
I told you

215
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,520
you owe me

216
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,200
and I'll make you pay back every single debt.

217
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,720
Meng Xiaoting.

218
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,520
Have you ever considered

219
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,600
that I wasn't the one who caused your miscarriage,

220
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,560
but Chen Mo?

221
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,850
I have evidence.

222
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
What did you say?
