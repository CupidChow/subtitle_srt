1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,680
Three.

3
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,440
Two.

4
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
Teacher Chen.

5
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,860
I have some things to prepare,

6
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,320
so I'll go first.

7
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,880
How annoying.

8
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,160
Alright,

9
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,840
Yiyi,

10
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,370
fasten your seatbelt and let's go.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,400
The baby in my womb,

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,860
you killed it, didn't you?

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,490
What do you mean?

14
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,400
Your child

15
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,880
is also my child.

16
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,700
How could I possibly harm him?

17
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,000
But I couldn't even bring myself

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
to hurt your child,

19
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,960
how could you bear to kill

20
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,120
our baby?

21
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,260
Give me a break.

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,400
You just tried to kill my daughter.

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,320
I was the one who told Lin Yazhi

24
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,920
to take Yiyi to the hospital.

25
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,900
Yiyi was never in danger of dying.

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,530
Because you're the one who should die.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,200
What did Lin Yazhi tell you?

28
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,660
You actually believe her?

29
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,760
You think I came to your house

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
to get you to come back

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,960
to me?

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,290
Do you want to see for yourself?

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,240
What is it?

34
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,200
This date,

35
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,010
I should have been doing my prenatal checkup.

36
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,040
This date,

37
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,490
I must have just had a miscarriage.

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,520
Go ahead, ask.

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,970
When I was staying with Lin Yazhi at the hospital,

40
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,400
I found

41
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,200
the medication I used back then,

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,880
along with my prescription records

43
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,079
and medical records.

44
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,960
Guess what?

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,440
I even saw

46
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,370
that female doctor from back then.

47
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,560
Lin Yazhi.

48
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,680
Okay.

49
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,560
Director Li,

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,200
I'd like to discuss

51
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,680
a patient's condition with you.

52
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,440
Sure,

53
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,080
just give me a moment.

54
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,640
Yazhi,

55
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,360
I had no idea this incident

56
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,680
would cause you such psychological trauma.

57
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,839
I want to make up for my

58
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,440
momentary lapse in judgment.

59
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,640
Can we meet in person?

60
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,320
Yazhi.

61
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,200
I've reported to management that

62
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,360
you had nothing to do with Li Meng's medication.

63
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,520
But since some time

64
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,360
has passed,

65
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,020
I don't have any evidence.

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,320
Can we meet?

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,400
Based on this?

68
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,080
What does this prove?

69
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,210
Just based on these.

70
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,680
It only planted

71
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,120
a seed of doubt in my mind.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,800
Chen Mo.

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,720
No one is more reluctant than I am to believe

74
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,480
that you were responsible for killing the baby in my womb.

75
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,840
But the truth is just that cruel,

76
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,920
it's right in front of us.

77
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,500
Lin Yazhi showed me the video.

78
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,920
What video?

79
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,880
You replaced my morning sickness pills

80
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,440
with abortion pills in the video.

81
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
She's talking nonsense.

82
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,720
I didn't even know her back then.

83
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,720
How could she possibly have a video?

84
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,660
Zhao Kai was stalking me at that time.

85
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,320
He installed cameras

86
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,720
in our home.

87
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,160
Zhao Kai is just a liar,

88
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,480
this video must be fake!

89
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,280
Chen Mo,

90
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,160
are you still lying to me even now?

91
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,040
Chen Mo,

92
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,240
but the truth

93
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,440
is the reality,

94
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,560
it's right in front of us.

95
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,560
Don't touch me.

96
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,760
You're a monster!

97
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,320
Don't touch me,

98
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm driving.

99
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,280
Don't touch me.

100
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,080
You're a monster, don't touch me.

101
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,840
Beast!

102
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,040
Move away, don't touch me.

103
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
You're a monster!

104
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,280
Don't touch me!

105
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,840
Let go!

106
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,840
Give me back my daughter!

107
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,080
Give me back my daughter!

108
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Yiyi?

109
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
Where is Yiyi?

110
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,200
Yiyi is gone.

111
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,760
Chen Mo?

112
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,080
Why weren't you the one who died!

113
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,010
Impossible!

114
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,560
Where is Meng Xiaoting?

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,240
Find her!

116
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,680
Meng Xiaoting!

117
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,280
You still care about her!

118
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,080
Your own daughter is dead,

119
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,120
and you still care about her!

120
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,440
Only you survived.

121
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,000
You're the one who should have died,

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,400
why don't you just die!

123
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,680
It's all your fault!

124
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,320
If it weren't for you,

125
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,240
how would Yiyi have died?

126
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,440
Why would Meng Xiaoting have caused trouble?

127
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,200
Blame me?!

128
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,240
If you hadn't given her

129
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,880
abortion pills back then,

130
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,440
how would things have come to this?

131
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,720
That was because I loved you!

132
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,960
Wasn't it all for you?

133
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,000
I killed my child,

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
my own child.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,960
Don't you think it hurt me too?

136
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,840
Don't you think I suffered?

137
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
I'm human too!

138
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
You finally admit it.

139
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,880
You're setting me up!

140
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,600
Mengjie,

141
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,210
did you call the police?

142
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,320
I did.

143
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,920
You too!

144
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
Sister Yazhi,

145
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,680
I definitely can't do it.

146
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,520
Chen Mo has always

147
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,260
been hiding his true self,

148
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,320
he's very skilled at hypnosis.

149
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,640
If he could control you like that,

150
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,720
he's a monster.

151
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,960
I've tried to hypnotize him,

152
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,440
but I failed.

153
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,880
Hypnotizing him

154
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,159
is too difficult.

155
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,480
Mengjie,

156
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,920
don't panic.

157
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,000
I met his teacher before,

158
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,800
he said the only time Chen Mo

159
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,460
successfully hypnotized him

160
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,720
was after his teacher

161
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,920
stayed up for two nights straight

162
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,080
watching the World Cup.

163
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,760
People are indeed

164
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,560
in an extremely tired state,

165
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,160
more likely to let their guard down,

166
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,090
and more susceptible to hypnosis.

167
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,840
These are the sleeping pills

168
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,000
he usually gives me.

169
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,200
He only went to sleep at 5 AM today,

170
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,730
he must be extremely tired.

171
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,080
Give him one pill.

172
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,760
I... Sister Yazhi...

173
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,610
Don't worry,

174
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,040
I'm here.

175
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,170
I'll try my best.

176
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,890
It all depends on you this time.

177
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,290
Teacher Chen, you're here.

178
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,400
Get me a cup of coffee,

179
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,530
the strongest kind.

180
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,860
Do you need something?

181
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,580
You've been too tired lately,

182
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,200
you need to relax.

183
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,450
You're lying under a coconut tree.

184
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
The sun is shining brightly.

185
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,140
A gentle breeze caresses the sea,

186
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,480
bringing a cool, fresh evening breeze.

187
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,120
You've forgotten all your worries completely.

188
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,560
You've turned off all the surveillance in your office,

189
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
and let down all your guard with her.

190
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,170
This is a recording.

191
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,560
They want to harm you.

192
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,880
Mengjie.

193
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,840
Thank you.

194
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,480
What are you thanking me for?

195
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,960
All my tuition fees

196
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,160
have been paid by Uncle Lin and his wife.

197
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,040
Helping you

198
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,170
is the least I can do.

199
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,370
Call the police now,

200
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,600
this is the evidence.

201
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,250
It's not enough.

202
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,560
This small recording

203
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,560
doesn't prove much.

204
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,880
Besides, it was recorded

205
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
while under hypnosis,

206
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,840
so it can't be used as evidence.

207
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,600
What's your plan now?
