1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,600
The kid who wets his pants.

3
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,840
You're just a dirty kid.

4
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,080
You're a dirty kid.

5
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,640
You're a dirty kid.

6
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,200
Why do they always bully you?

7
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,640
Because you carry this thing every day.

8
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,759
Why do you carry it every day?

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,009
Wetting your pants.

10
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,520
Why do you wet your pants?

11
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,479
Are you sick?

12
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
It's all because of your mother.

13
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,360
How old are you anyway?

14
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,090
Learning calligraphy.

15
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,960
Learning dance.

16
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,880
Do you really like it?

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,400
Your mother has never loved you.

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,610
She's not treating you like a daughter at all.

19
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,720
She's just using you as her substitute.

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,160
Making you accomplish what she couldn't do herself.

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
She ruined her entire life,

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,280
so she needs to find her sense of existence through you.

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,079
Look,

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,040
you carry this thing every day.

25
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Look,

26
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,840
it's like Sun Wukong wearing his golden headband.

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,600
With this thing,

28
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,600
you'll never be happy,

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,040
never know joy.

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,460
All of this is because of your mother.

31
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,120
Yiyi.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,260
Your mother doesn't love you,

33
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,100
she just wants to control you.

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,780
You can't be afraid of her,

35
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,300
you need to fight back.

36
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,040
Not only should you not fear her,

37
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,970
you should hate her.

38
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,480
Understand?

39
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,200
Yiyi.

40
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,160
Aren't you going to ask

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,080
how Mom is doing?

42
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,880
I already told her.

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,160
Yiyi.

44
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,560
How was your day at school?

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,490
Did you have fun?

46
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,240
Come.

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,360
Come to Mom.

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,720
Go on.

49
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,400
Go to Mom.

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,760
Go to Mom.

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,880
Come to Mom.

52
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,120
Where's the electrotherapy device?

53
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,960
I don't want the electrotherapy device anymore.

54
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,600
I don't want to be sick.

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
It's all your fault.

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,720
I don't want to be sick.

57
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,640
I don't want to be different from other kids.

58
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,570
Yiyi is no different from other children.

59
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,480
Yiyi is

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,520
the kindest

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,960
and most adorable child.

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,320
She's mommy and daddy's only treasure.

63
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,880
Come, let mommy hold you.

64
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,440
I hate you.

65
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,920
Will you let mommy hug you?

66
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,040
It's okay.

67
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,280
I hate you.

68
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,840
Hate you.

69
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,520
I hate you.

70
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,399
It's alright,

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,060
mommy will wipe it for you.

72
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,840
Mommy will

73
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,200
wipe

74
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,600
it for you.

75
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,800
Mommy is sorry.

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,680
It's mommy's fault.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,840
Yiyi.

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,400
Yiyi.

79
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,680
What's wrong?

80
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,520
Nothing.

81
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,640
Yiyi,

82
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,900
it'll be fine after we wipe it.

83
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,440
It's okay, Yiyi,

84
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,880
let me wipe it.

85
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Let me wipe it.

86
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,680
Honey,

87
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,540
don't touch it.

88
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,020
Did Yiyi upset you?

89
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,120
I'll go get her.

90
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,020
It's not her fault.

91
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,440
Honey.

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,720
I'm a terrible mother.

93
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,120
Am I right?

94
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,980
No, you're not.

95
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,320
To me,

96
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,760
you are the most dedicated mother in the world.

97
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,160
A dedicated mother

98
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
wouldn't be crushed by her own child.

99
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,480
Honey,

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
she's just being immature,

101
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
it has nothing to do with you.

102
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,600
If it's not my fault,

103
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,560
if it's not my problem,

104
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,820
then whose fault is it?

105
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,640
Darling,

106
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,440
you'll never betray me and Yiyi,

107
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,000
will you?

108
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,400
Never.

109
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,880
Of course not.

110
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,520
Never ever.

111
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,040
Hello.

112
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,760
Hello, doctor,

113
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,920
I work for Lin Yazhi in bed 113.

114
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,720
Miss Lin has asked me

115
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,659
to find some relevant documents.

116
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
Lin Yazhi.

117
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,640
Okay.

118
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,240
Honey,

119
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,120
can you help me check out of the hospital?

120
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,640
No, the doctor said

121
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,920
you must stay in the hospital for treatment this time.

122
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,880
Take this opportunity

123
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,410
to rest for a couple of days.

124
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,160
I brought your medicine.

125
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,720
I brought you your favorite

126
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,210
barbecue-flavored sandwich.

127
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,050
Barbecue-flavored sandwich.

128
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,640
Do you remember

129
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,200
on our first date,

130
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,980
what you took me to eat?

131
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,080
Back then, I took an advance on a month's salary

132
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,560
because I wanted to treat you

133
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
to a fancy dinner,

134
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,400
but we ended up having barbecue.

135
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,280
You know what?

136
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,140
I couldn't even handle spicy food back then.

137
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,490
The thing is, I can't really drink.

138
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,240
Let's have a drink first.

139
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,800
I'm not good with alcohol.

140
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,060
Just drink as you like.

141
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,320
Okay.

142
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,440
Thanks.

143
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,600
Go ahead, eat.

144
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,760
Eat.

145
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
It's really good.

146
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,440
I love spicy food.

147
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,040
This barbecue place

148
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
is really famous.

149
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,600
Did you do that on purpose?

150
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

151
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,130
Try a bite first.

152
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,570
Take a big bite. Come on.

153
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,290
You're so messy.

154
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,780
That's so unhygienic.

155
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,720
Then next time

156
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,020
I'll wipe it off with my mouth.

157
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,920
Stop it!

158
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,080
Don't let Yingying see this.

159
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,240
Don't mind me,

160
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,860
just pretend I'm not here.

161
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,040
Come here.

162
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,440
BBQ flavored sandwich,

163
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,640
your husband bought it for you.

164
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,760
I don't want it.

165
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,650
Fine.

166
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,720
Honey, I'll head back first,

167
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,200
Yiyi is home alone,

168
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,360
and I'm worried about her.

169
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,120
You stay and chat with Yingying.

170
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,039
Then go home

171
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,700
and have a good talk with Yiyi,

172
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,360
ask her

173
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,730
what's really going on.

174
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,720
Remember to take your medicine.

175
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,880
Say goodbye to your brother-in-law.

176
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,410
Goodbye, brother-in-law.

177
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,010
What's wrong with Yiyi?

178
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,770
I don't know either,

179
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,610
she suddenly started acting strange,

180
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,320
and then suddenly seemed to hate me.

181
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,040
Hate you?

182
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,760
How could a child hate her mother?

183
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,200
I think

184
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,370
it's because of her,

185
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,600
Meng Xiaoting.

186
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
I can't remember the last time

187
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,930
I ate at a restaurant like this.

188
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,440
That's just how married men are.

189
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,780
So romantic before marriage,

190
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,360
but after,

191
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,400
they'd rather sleep in separate rooms.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,930
It's not that I don't want romance,

193
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,040
we're just an old married couple.

194
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,370
Sometimes it feels like

195
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,460
holding your own hand,

196
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
there's no spark.

197
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,520
I think you treat her well.

198
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,820
That's family affection,

199
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,490
it's different.

200
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,880
What about me?

201
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,680
Daddy.

202
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,480
Yiyi,

203
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,360
come here.

204
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,970
Are you full?

205
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,020
Have some more.

206
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,840
Here.

207
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,500
I'm going to the restroom.

208
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,000
Dad, do you like Ms. Xiaoting?

209
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,080
Why do you ask that, Yiyi?

210
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,920
Because I like Ms. Xiaoting too.

211
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
If you like her,

212
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,370
then Dad definitely likes her too.

213
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,640
Dad, my liking for Ms. Xiaoting

214
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,440
is different from yours.

215
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,280
Dad feels the same way you do.

216
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,880
Dad,

217
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,280
I wish Ms. Xiaoting could be my mom.
