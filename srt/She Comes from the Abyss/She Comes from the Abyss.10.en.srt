1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,930
Hey, Xiaocheng.

3
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,080
Are you home?

4
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,120
What's wrong?

5
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,480
Okay,

6
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,880
I'll come over.

7
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,810
Have a seat, senior.

8
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,200
Chengyu.

9
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,520
Yingying.

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
How could you?

11
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,040
Senior.

12
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,440
When did you and Yingying get together?

13
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,170
Didn't you say you were single?

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,680
Go ahead.

15
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,210
What do you want?

16
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
I've made myself very clear.

17
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,530
If you don't love my senior sister,

18
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,880
please leave her.

19
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,160
Otherwise?

20
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,180
Otherwise I'll let her know everything.

21
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,290
I've been very tolerant of your behavior.

22
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,340
Let me tell you,

23
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,160
I love your senior sister very much,

24
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,290
and she loves me too.

25
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,840
If I leave her,

26
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,200
she'll be devastated.

27
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,960
Do you want to see her suffer?

28
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,500
But do you think she loves you?

29
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,800
Of course.

30
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,440
Lin Yazhi.

31
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
Lin Yazhi.

32
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,560
Lin Yazhi.

33
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
Give me back my child!

34
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
Give me back my child!

35
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,120
Give me back my child!

36
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,120
Honey.

37
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,600
It's okay now,

38
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,360
it's me.

39
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,370
Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?

40
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,720
Sister Yazhi.

41
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,120
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,680
It's all my fault.

43
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,520
This morning I left Yiyi's palette

44
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,520
and her doll

45
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,690
in the sink and forgot to wash them.

46
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,920
I'm so sorry.

47
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,160
I need to go to school.

48
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,760
It's okay, honey.

49
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,400
I'm heading to the school now.

50
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,520
Honey, listen to me.

51
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,760
I just came from the school.

52
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,490
Don't worry,

53
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,720
Yiyi is fine,

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
she's doing well.

55
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,120
She's back?

56
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,160
I know.

57
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,000
Xiaoting told me.

58
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,240
Rest assured,

59
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,120
I've spoken with the teachers and security at school.

60
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,650
No one except the three of us

61
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,120
is allowed to pick her up.

62
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:30,840
Come,

63
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,360
let's get some rest.

64
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,720
The doctor said

65
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,320
your emotional distress is quite serious this time

66
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,000
and recommends hospital observation.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,320
Don't worry about anything else,

68
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,370
I'm here for you.

69
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,300
I won't let anyone hurt either of you.

70
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,500
I need to go back to the studio.

71
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,820
Is it okay if Xiaoting stays with you?

72
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,770
Go ahead with your work.

73
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,880
Call me if you need anything.

74
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,680
Okay.

75
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,680
I have all the time

76
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
in the world to wear you down.

77
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,880
Hello?

78
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,160
Hello, Ms. Lin.

79
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,920
This is Nuannuan Housekeeping Service,

80
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,520
I'm very sorry for keeping you waiting so long.

81
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,720
After extensive screening

82
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,080
and following your requirements for a full-time nanny,

83
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,880
could we arrange an in-home interview today?

84
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,880
Haven't you already found someone?

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,860
Found someone?

86
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,040
Did you find a suitable nanny

87
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,440
through another agency?

88
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,520
No,

89
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,850
she's from your agency.

90
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,120
She's been working for several days already.

91
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,520
I'm sorry, Ms. Lin,

92
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,920
but according to our system,

93
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,640
we haven't sent any nanny to your home.

94
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,120
Besides, your requirements are quite specific,

95
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,360
our screening process is very strict,

96
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,240
and we've just found two suitable candidates.

97
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,370
Isn't Meng Xiaoting from your agency?

98
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Her resume came from your platform.

99
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,720
Please hold while I verify this.

100
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,040
Is that Meng as in Mencius,

101
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,720
Xiao as in small,

102
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,580
and Ting with the female radical?

103
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,960
I'm very sorry, Ms. Lin,

104
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,840
but our agency

105
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,840
truly doesn't have any employee named Meng Xiaoting.

106
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,520
Yazhi.

107
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,480
The grapes today are especially fresh.

108
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,920
Who are you really?

109
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,880
What do you mean?

110
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,780
You're not actually from the housekeeping agency.

111
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,159
Yazhi,

112
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,320
I'm sorry,

113
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,400
I didn't sign with the agency

114
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,200
because they take half of the payment.

115
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,000
So?

116
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,920
But I promise,

117
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,000
everything on my resume is true,

118
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,560
I just didn't register with the agency.

119
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,210
Don't explain to me,

120
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,440
tell it to the police.

121
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,159
Yazhi,

122
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,159
I'm begging you,

123
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,600
please don't call the police.

124
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
My mother is sick,

125
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,930
I need to save money for her treatment.

126
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,560
I...

127
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,240
If I can avoid the agency's commission,

128
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,920
I can...

129
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,560
I can earn 50% more.

130
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,400
With that extra money,

131
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,600
I can buy better medicine for my mother,

132
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,660
maybe she could live a few more years.

133
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,420
I can take a pay cut,

134
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,400
even 40% less would be fine.

135
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,210
I can work weekends too,

136
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,490
I'll take care of Yiyi like she's my own daughter.

137
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,720
If my mother because...

138
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,120
because of me...

139
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Yazhi,

140
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,520
I'm sorry,

141
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,480
I really can't lose this job.

142
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,340
Why didn't you tell me the truth earlier?

143
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,840
Now you're telling me all this,

144
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,280
how am I supposed to believe you?

145
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,400
I'm sorry, Yazhi,

146
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,080
I'm sorry,

147
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,610
I'm really not a bad person.

148
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,159
If I were a bad person,

149
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,480
when I received that

150
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,960
100,000 yuan from your husband,

151
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,679
I would have run off with it, right?

152
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,210
I'm really not a bad person,

153
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,100
I just want to save more money.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,040
In this world,

155
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,680
my mother is my only family.

156
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,460
If because we can't afford medicine,

157
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,240
if she passes away like that,

158
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,240
I'll blame myself for the rest of my life.

159
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,520
I'm begging you, Yazhi,

160
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
please, please. Alright, alright.

161
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,760
Get up,

162
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,280
stand up.

163
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,120
Yiyi really likes you,

164
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,840
if you leave,

165
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,420
she'll be upset for quite a while.

166
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,250
You can stay for now,

167
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,880
get a complete medical examination according to agency standards,

168
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,320
if you pass,

169
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,360
you can stay,

170
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,440
okay?

171
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,720
Thank you, Yazhi,

172
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,880
I'll go right now.

173
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,240
Is that really true?

174
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,840
Sometimes,

175
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,360
I really can't figure you out.

176
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,810
There's nothing to figure out.

177
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,700
What you see right in front

178
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,540
of you is the most real.

179
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,320
Will you really always believe that?

180
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,120
Trust me,

181
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,060
no one can come between us.

182
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,410
Including your wife

183
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,520
and child?

184
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,000
I just don't want

185
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,650
them affecting our relationship.

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I believe

187
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,460
you can make it happen.

188
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,360
Chen Mo!

189
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,200
How could you do such a thing?
