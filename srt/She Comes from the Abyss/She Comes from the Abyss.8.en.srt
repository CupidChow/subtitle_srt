1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,840
Honey.

3
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,840
Yazhi, I'm sorry.

4
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,320
I...

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,120
Get dressed

6
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
and let's go home.

7
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,440
Chen Mo,

8
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,640
you brought your wife here

9
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,280
without telling me in advance,

10
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,880
I could've prepared a chair.

11
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,480
Drama queen.

12
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,960
Honey.

13
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,410
When did this start?

14
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,960
Last week.

15
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,960
I've been under a lot of stress lately,

16
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,360
so I wanted to relax a bit.

17
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,720
If you're stressed, you can talk to me.

18
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,760
You don't say anything,

19
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,820
this is how we'll slowly drift apart.

20
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,079
I know.

21
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,320
You haven't been doing well lately either.

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,120
Do you realize

23
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,400
gambling is highly addictive?

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,960
I know,

25
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
but don't worry,

26
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,120
these are all neighbors we know,

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,380
in one night we just...

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,170
If it makes you unhappy,

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,660
I won't go anymore.

30
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,940
Why did you lie to me today?

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,600
I didn't lie to you,

32
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,400
I was just afraid you wouldn't...

33
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,330
I'm talking about something else.

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,200
Meng Xiaoting clearly came to your studio,

35
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,900
why did you say she didn't?

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,780
What did she

37
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,079
tell you?

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,280
Borrowing money isn't something to be ashamed of,

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,740
why did you hide it from me?

40
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,610
I was afraid you'd misunderstand.

41
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
Besides, I've been treating you recently,

42
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,560
and the fewer things on your mind,

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,200
the better for your recovery.

44
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,800
So

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,760
I didn't want to complicate things.

46
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,880
Even though you mean well,

47
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,120
I hope you never lie to me.

48
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,280
Chen Mo

49
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,280
What's wrong?

50
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,360
Did you go to Meng Xiaoting's room last night?

51
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,140
Did you sleep with her?

52
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,159
What are you thinking, my dear wife?

53
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,040
Then you went to Cindy's place last night, right?

54
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,570
That wasn't a dream, was it?

55
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,320
Of course not.

56
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,480
I promised you yesterday

57
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,880
that I wouldn't play cards anymore.

58
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,480
Last night I dreamed that you

59
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,480
and Meng Xiaoting were

60
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,920
in the music room.

61
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,960
I can't remember.

62
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,560
It's okay.

63
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,480
Don't think about it anymore. It's giving you a headache.

64
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,280
Just let it go.

65
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,090
I'll get you some medicine.

66
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:49,120
I believe the greatest prison for humans is their own mind.

67
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,440
Successful people think freely and multi-dimensionally,

68
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,680
while those who fail

69
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,720
think within a cage.

70
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,280
Only when you break free from constraints

71
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,680
can you discover a new version of yourself.

72
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,280
Here.

73
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,520
Honey.

74
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,660
This medicine works well,

75
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,560
but you still

76
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,770
shouldn't let your imagination run wild.

77
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,320
Last night was no fun without you.

78
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,800
I knew you were fooling around with the maid.

79
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,880
Don't talk nonsense.

80
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
So what if you did?

81
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
It's not a big deal.

82
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,520
I don't mind.

83
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Just invite her to join us.

84
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,120
You're crazy.

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,159
Leaving so soon?

86
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
I can't promise

87
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
I won't tell your wife something.

88
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,420
What do you want to say?

89
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,120
For example,

90
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,920
you sleep with me,

91
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,250
you sleep with the maid,

92
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,370
but you don't sleep with your wife.

93
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,800
Do you know the price for spreading rumors?

94
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,240
About your wife having an affair with that young boy,

95
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,280
did you know?

96
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,930
How did you find out?

97
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,210
Good.

98
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,940
That's all.

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,730
Alright, please wait a moment.

100
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,039
Senior.

101
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,850
You're planning to leave Chen Mo, aren't you?

102
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,640
Who told you that?

103
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,490
Don't you want to leave him yet?

104
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,520
Xiaocheng.

105
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,400
I know.

106
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,040
It's partly because since I got sick,

107
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,770
my condition hasn't improved,

108
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,540
and I felt Chen Mo wasn't trying hard enough.

109
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,960
But that's not true.

110
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,120
Chen Mo is good to me.

111
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,760
He takes good care of me,

112
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,720
keeps me from overthinking,

113
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,290
and he also takes good care of Yiyi.

114
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,290
However,

115
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,240
balancing work and life is difficult,

116
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,920
and mental illness is hard to cure.

117
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,120
But I think we all need to be patient

118
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,490
and take it slow.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,960
Just because of this?

120
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,720
There's no other reason?

121
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,320
What reason?

122
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,160
Senior,

123
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,440
then why?

124
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,050
What do you mean why?

125
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,840
Xiaocheng,

126
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,440
please stop worrying about me, okay?

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,800
Senior,

128
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,480
don't you feel that

129
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,680
Chen Mo has been tormenting you all this time?
