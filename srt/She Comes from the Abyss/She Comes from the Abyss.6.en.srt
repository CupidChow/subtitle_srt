1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,560
Lu Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,290
Qi, Yang Zhenzhong, Zhang Kai.

3
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,760
How are you feeling?

4
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,880
Any better lately?

5
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:21,840
Much better,

6
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,760
just don't have much appetite,

7
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,920
can't keep anything down.

8
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,360
I'll prescribe some medicine for you first,

9
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,680
take it for a couple of days,

10
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,160
and if there's no improvement,

11
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,480
we'll have to start intravenous nutrition therapy.

12
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,120
Okay.

13
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,960
You're on duty today?

14
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,880
Come find me if you get hungry later.

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,840
I brought some braised snacks.

16
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,640
Thanks, sis.

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,720
Please save my baby.

18
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,960
Why did you kill my baby?

19
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,640
Why?

20
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,040
Why?

21
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,160
Li Meng.

22
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,970
I completely understand how you feel,

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,200
but please listen to my explanation.

24
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,280
Your miscarriage wasn't caused by the medication I prescribed,

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,880
but by an allergic reaction to the drug.

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,360
Li Meng,

27
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,620
you should believe the test results.

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,720
You poisoned my baby.

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,840
You poisoned my baby.

30
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,520
Give me back my child!

31
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,520
Give me back my child!

32
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,240
Give me back my child!

33
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,079
Why is Li Meng with Xiaoting?

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,120
What are those two plotting?

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,440
Are they trying to kill me?

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,840
Yazhi,

37
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,079
you're back.

38
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,800
I made some herbal tea.

39
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Don't you have something to tell me?

40
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,560
You two know each other,

41
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
that can't be a coincidence, right?

42
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,040
You followed me?

43
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,860
She sent you here, didn't she?

44
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,320
You figured it out.

45
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,840
Lin Yazhi.

46
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,280
Seven years ago, you killed my child.

47
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,760
It's time to settle this debt.

48
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,000
Open the door!

49
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,640
Lin Yazhi.

50
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,320
Seven years ago you killed my child.

51
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,720
You think I can let this go?

52
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,520
Open the door!

53
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,490
Where else can you hide?

54
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,680
Open the door!

55
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,000
Open the door!

56
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,080
Open this door right now!

57
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,560
Today you must die.

58
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,520
You must die for my child!

59
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,000
Open the door!

60
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,560
Open the door!

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,360
Mrs. Li,

62
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,320
we have the key, remember?

63
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,640
Did you think I couldn't find you if you hid?

64
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,560
There's no escape for you today.

65
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,160
If you had just drunk that water earlier,

66
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,300
you could have died more peacefully.

67
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,080
Go apologize to my child.

68
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,120
Do you want your child to see you like this,

69
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,920
to know his mother is a murderer?

70
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,760
She's the real murderer.

71
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
It was an accident.

72
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,360
You can refuse to accept reality,

73
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,960
but you can't blame anyone else.

74
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,760
Bullshit!

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,000
Why should my child die for nothing?

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,860
If you can't let go of your hatred,

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,360
your child will never rest in peace.

78
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,880
A life for a life.

79
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Only then can my child rest in peace.

80
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,400
I can let you go,

81
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,250
and not call the police,

82
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,140
but you need to understand

83
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,980
that Lin Yazhi did nothing wrong.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,080
You're not at fault either,

85
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,960
and the children are completely innocent.

86
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,600
Lin Yazhi has had nightmares for seven years because of her guilt.

87
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
My daughter

88
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,400
was born with urinary incontinence.

89
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,880
Is that fair for a child?

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,720
Is that fair to me?

91
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,920
Before I call the police,

92
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,000
just go.

93
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,880
Why can't fate be a little fairer to me?

94
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,280
Why did my child have to die

95
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,360
instead of hers?

96
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,000
I just wanted to suffer for my child,

97
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,440
I just wanted a child of my own.

98
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,520
Am I wrong?

99
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,560
It's okay now.

100
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,000
It's alright.

101
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,840
It's okay now, honey.

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,880
It's all over.

103
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,850
Don't worry.

104
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,480
Honey.

105
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,690
It's all in the past,

106
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,880
okay?

107
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,760
Honey.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,600
Honey.

109
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,410
Are you feeling any better?

110
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,200
I'm just a bit tired.

111
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,560
Go home and get some rest.

112
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,480
It's time for my client meeting.

113
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,960
Okay.

114
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,560
You go ahead with your work,

115
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,690
I'll head out first.

116
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,360
Take care.

117
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,080
Hello.

118
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,280
Was that your wife just now?

119
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,560
Yes.

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,490
Please, have a seat.

121
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,040
Let me prepare for a moment.

122
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,640
Your wife is very beautiful.

123
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
She's lucky to have a husband like you.

124
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,840
Thank you.

125
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,720
She doesn't seem to be in a good mental state.

126
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,210
Is she also receiving treatment here?

127
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,920
She has a mental illness.

128
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,539
She often gets lost in her own fantasies.

129
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,919
How long has this been going on?

130
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,880
Seven years.

131
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,919
Seven years.

132
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,900
You've been taking care of her all this time.

133
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,080
Don't you have any children?

134
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,760
Let's begin.

135
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,960
Actually, I believe

136
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,800
the mind is our greatest prison.

137
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,090
Successful people think freely and multi-dimensionally.

138
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,320
While failures think within a cage.

139
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,960
Only when you break free from constraints

140
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,360
can you discover a new version of yourself.

141
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,160
Yiyi.

142
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,720
Take your backpack

143
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,500
and go home with Ms. Xiaoting.

144
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,760
Come on, let's go.

145
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,610
Come on, get your things packed up.

146
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,040
I'll carry your backpack

147
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,760
but can you hold your snacks yourself, okay?

148
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,120
I don't want to leave now.

149
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,400
Why not?

150
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
I don't feel well.

151
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,320
I'll wait until they leave first.

152
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,680
Are you really that afraid of Qingqing?

153
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,220
Let me tell you something,

154
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,680
the more afraid you are of her,

155
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,880
the more she'll bully you,

156
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,610
understand?

157
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,280
I'll tell you a secret,

158
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,360
but don't tell Mom.

159
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Did you secretly turn off the electrotherapy device?

160
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,720
One night I saw

161
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,040
Dad going to Qingqing's house to see her mom.
