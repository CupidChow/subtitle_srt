3
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,979
Honey.

4
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:00,340
Honey.

5
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,100
Where are you?

6
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,079
Honey,

7
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,760
you can see now?

8
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,260
Where are you, honey?

9
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,459
I just dreamed about Dad.

10
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:13,900
He was covered in blood.

11
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:15,659
Just like Mom.

12
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,120
Honey, where are you?

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,519
I'm so scared.

14
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,379
Honey.

15
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,180
Honey.

16
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:25,719
Honey.

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,060
It's okay.

18
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:31,980
It's okay.

19
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,140
Just a nightmare.

20
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,000
I visited Dad today.

21
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:37,340
He's fine.

22
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:38,579
No.

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,420
No.

24
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,500
It felt so real.

25
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,579
It was absolutely terrifying.

26
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,780
Alright.

27
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,359
Stop crying.

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,159
Dreams go by contraries.

29
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:56,459
Dad will live a long life.

30
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,719
(We clearly made eye contact.)

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,020
(Was that...)

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,719
(just my imagination?)

33
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,060
(It's bad.)

34
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,900
(He suspects I can see.)

35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,620
(I can't let him find out.)

36
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,620
Honey.

37
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,099
Why do you smell

38
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,159
of a woman's perfume?

39
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,900
Why do I smell it here, too?

40
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:30,199
Honey.

41
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:30,919
Really?

42
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:32,479
Yes.

43
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,560
How could there be women's perfume?

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,120
Why the perfume smell?

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,439
Honey,

46
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,879
I remember now.

47
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:53,599
In the elevator today,

48
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:55,000
there was a woman

49
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,840
wearing strong, cheap perfume.

50
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,319
It gave me a headache.

51
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,780
Come to think of it,

52
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,379
my head still hurts.

53
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,199
Don't be so mean.

54
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:10,740
(She can still laugh?)

55
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,000
(It proves her eyes)

56
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,219
(haven't recovered.)

57
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,919
(Ye Dong,)

58
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,680
(you monster.)

59
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,039
(I want to tear you apart.)

60
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,979
(I was blind.)

61
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,139
(I let the wolf in.)

62
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,500
(I killed Dad.)

63
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,500
Who?

64
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,280
Who's shouting?

65
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,379
Ms. Lin,

66
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,919
I'm Qin Yufei.

67
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,879
Here to deliver documents.

68
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:41,539
Are you okay?

69
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:42,800
Y...

70
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,020
Yes.

71
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,180
Dong,

72
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,879
there's an old mutt

73
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,280
dead in the basement.

74
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:51,680
Go dispose of it.

75
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:54,400
Mom,

76
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,080
since when do we have an old dog?

77
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,740
Some stray crawled into the basement.

78
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,960
Honey.

79
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,060
Quick.

80
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,120
Go help Mom.

81
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,199
Help her out.

82
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:10,819
Mr. Ye,

83
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:11,539
Ms. Lin,

84
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,060
if there's nothing else,

85
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,400
I'll take my leave.

86
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,079
Wait.

87
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,279
Mr. Ye,

88
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,120
any other orders?

89
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:25,360
Yufei,

90
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:26,920
since you're here,

91
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,120
do me a favor.

92
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:29,399
Lend a hand.

93
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:31,279
Mr. Ye,

94
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm scared of dogs.

95
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,139
It's just a dead dog.

96
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,579
Nothing to fear.

97
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,459
Come.

98
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:44,220
Honey,

99
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:45,459
stay here

100
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,019
and rest.

101
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,339
I'll be right back.

102
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,079
Honey.

103
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,600
What's wrong,

104
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,980
honey?

105
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,980
Come with me.

106
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:42,420
Honey,

107
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,740
is anything wrong?

108
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,279
Just come with me.

109
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,319
It's all sorted out.

110
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,560
Come in and help.

111
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,600
Lady,

112
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:13,319
this work...

113
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,319
I really can't do it.

114
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,420
We're in this together.

115
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,819
How could you stay clean?

116
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:23,860
Let's go.

117
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,420
Honey,

118
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,480
why did you stop?

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,459
The stench is overwhelming.

120
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,579
Honey,

121
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,439
are you okay?

122
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,620
Yes.

123
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,120
I'm okay.

124
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:02,879
It's just...

125
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,240
I suddenly feel nauseous.

126
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,800
Xia,

127
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,740
your complexion looks

128
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,740
a bit off.

129
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,560
Are you feeling unwell?

130
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,480
It's nothing.

131
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:23,720
I'm fine.

132
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,079
I'll cook you something nutritious later

133
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:27,439
to boost your health.

134
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,600
No need.

135
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,439
Dong,

136
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,139
two more bags inside.

137
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,600
Go help us.

138
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,300
(Dad,)

139
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,459
(your death was so tragic.)

140
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:48,699
Yufei,

141
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,220
thank you for helping today.

142
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,480
I'll remember this kindness.

143
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,079
Honey,

144
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,139
don't wander off.

145
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:24,959
Wait here for me.

146
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,800
I'll be right back.

147
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,000
Baba.

148
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:33,039
I'm here.

149
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,639
Master.

150
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,899
Call Na.

151
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,659
Okay.

152
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,700
Hello.

153
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,919
Na.

154
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,720
My mother-in-law
has been staying with us for days.

155
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,279
I haven't bought her any gifts yet.

156
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,200
So...

157
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,919
could you help me buy

158
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,299
some high-end gold jewelry?

159
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,860
Around five million in value will do.

160
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,419
I want to surprise her.

161
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,179
Alright.

162
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,440
It hurts.

163
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,919
Honey.

164
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,899
Honey.

165
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,480
When did you get here?

166
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:48,840
You walked quietly.

167
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,200
You scared me to death.

168
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,360
Honey.

169
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,759
You dropped something.

170
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,860
What is it?

171
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,299
Honey.

172
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,120
When did you find this?

173
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,600
When I came upstairs,

174
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,639
I accidentally lost it

175
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,320
and couldn't find it.

176
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,559
I see.

177
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,360
Then I'll...

178
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,340
tie a tight knot for you.

179
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,039
Then it won't fall off.

180
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,519
