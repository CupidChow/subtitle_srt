=Episode 19=

3
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,459
Men

4
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:05,980
are all the same.

5
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,340
But why can't I

6
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,019
remember last night clearly?

7
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:17,500
You're awake.

8
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,219
You didn't leave.

9
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,260
Since you're awake,

10
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,219
have breakfast.

11
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,140
(What's going on?)

12
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,099
(Didn't Ye Dong and Bai Cha
catch him red-handed?)

13
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,500
(I'm so charming!)

14
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,540
(It didn't take much effort to get him.)

15
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,219
(He even made me a hearty breakfast.)

16
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,239
Last night my wife came
to catch me red-handed.

17
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,879
Ye Dong set me up, right?

18
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:58,099
No need to deny it.

19
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,659
I've figured it out.

20
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,459
But

21
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,099
I never expected

22
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:04,980
you'd sacrifice yourself

23
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,859
for him.

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,120
What do you mean?

25
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,400
Let me put it bluntly.

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,819
I hate beating around the bush.

27
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:17,219
I prefer

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,919
laying all cards on the table.

29
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:22,460
My marriage is over,

30
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:26,340
because Ye Dong is always interfering.

31
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,539
To be clear,

32
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,060
I'm a plastic surgeon.

33
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,620
I can't resist

34
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,819
any beautiful things.

35
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,460
You're the most

36
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,580
gorgeous girl

37
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:41,960
with a perfect figure.

38
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,280
Actually,

39
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,580
your appearance

40
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,500
draws me in.

41
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,219
But

42
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,340
as you're working for Ye Dong,

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,780
you must be materialistic.

44
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,180
What are you implying?

45
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,180
This card has 10 million.

46
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:04,900
My plastic surgery hospital

47
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,460
has annual revenue in millions.

48
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:10,979
Stay with me,

49
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,159
and all this

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
will be yours.

51
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,219
What?

52
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,379
Trying to retaliate?

53
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,659
Your tricks won't work on me.

54
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,080
The money in this account

55
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,900
can be transferred to you immediately.

56
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,520
My hospital

57
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,780
can also be under your name.

58
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,219
Besides,

59
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,659
Ye Dong is a madman.

60
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,020
No woman

61
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,020
genuinely likes him.

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,120
You want to help him.

63
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,699
What price should you pay
to keep helping him?

64
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,280
Stay with me,

65
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:42,939
and all

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,759
this fortune

67
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,979
will be yours.

68
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,080
No.

69
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,539
More than a madman,

70
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,900
he's a demon.

71
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,560
If I betray him,

72
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:55,900
he'll kill me.

73
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,719
I can help you escape him.

74
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,099
Then you'll have

75
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,620
true control of your life.

76
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:01,819
What do you mean?

77
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:03,139
How can you help me?

78
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:05,900
I have my ways.

79
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,340
Eat first.

80
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:08,939
I'm afraid

81
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,780
you'll lose your appetite.

82
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,039
Explain yourself.

83
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,219
Make it clear.

84
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,259
How did you get this?

85
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:41,019
What's your goal?

86
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,459
Master,

87
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:49,660
have breakfast.

88
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:50,939
Thank you.

89
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:51,500
Master,

90
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:52,620
today's breakfast

91
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,360
comes with explosive side dishes.

92
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,519
What is it?

93
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,500
You told us to monitor Ye Dong.

94
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:58,939
Last night,

95
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,100
he took Bai Cha to a hotel

96
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,100
to catch

97
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,939
Cheng Nuo and Qin Yufei red-handed.

98
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,300
Qin Yufei?

99
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,199
Jiuyao's new CFO?

100
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:10,779
This matter

101
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,060
is quite intriguing.

102
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:12,819
Exactly.

103
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,920
Bai Cha stormed off in anger right then.

104
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,060
What's more infuriating

105
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,980
is that Cheng Nuo didn't come after her.

106
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,180
He stayed at the hotel all night.

107
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:21,259
What a scumbag.

108
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,779
But Ye Dong

109
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,220
was after Bai Cha all the way.

110
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:25,740
At last, Bai Cha told him

111
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:27,500
if he can make her

112
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,019
Jiuyao Group's CEO,

113
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,779
he will have a chance.

114
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,620
Bai Cha made us speechless.

115
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,279
Exactly.

116
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,819
Jiuyao Group is

117
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:35,980
a prominent group after all.

118
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,779
Can anyone become its CEO?

119
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,300
If she wanted material gains,

120
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,620
she could've asked for money

121
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:44,699
or asked Ye Dong to marry her.

122
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,319
But she wanted

123
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,560
the impossible position.

124
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:49,980
Even if she becomes CEO,

125
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,779
can she lead the group?

126
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,040
If she can't,

127
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,120
she'll

128
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:56,060
face ridicule

129
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:57,500
and unbearable pain.

130
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,220
Maybe she made up some excuse

131
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,980
to refuse Ye Dong.

132
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:03,660
But why this one?

133
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,660
It doesn't sound like an excuse,

134
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,620
but more like...

135
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:11,160
Like what?

136
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,720
Like what?

137
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,000
Premeditation.

138
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:27,459
Good morning.

139
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:28,540
Have you washed up?

140
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:29,579
Yes.

141
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,019
Come and eat.

142
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,860
Thanks, Mom.

143
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,019
I don't know

144
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,579
where Cheng Nuo went last night.

145
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,459
His phone's turned off.

146
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:46,939
Mom,

147
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:49,180
Cheng Nuo is an adult.

148
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,339
Stop worrying about him.

149
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,420
Not him,

150
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,939
but you.

151
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,899
Eat the egg.

152
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,980
As your husband,

153
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,540
he stayed out all night

154
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:11,100
with his phone off.

155
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,720
Utterly disgraceful.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,879
When he comes back,

157
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,980
I'll teach him a lesson.

158
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:20,240
Mom,

159
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,579
thank you.

160
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:27,019
Once I lived

161
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,779
in constant underworld

162
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:34,699
and surrounded by demons

163
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:38,980
who desperately wanted to consume me.

164
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,319
So

165
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,180
I tried to escape.

166
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,860
I ran for my life.

167
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,699
Finally, one day

168
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,399
I broke free from that underworld.

169
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,180
But along the way,

170
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:52,699
I met someone.

171
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,120
I thought he

172
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,899
desperately needed my help.

173
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,899
Yet because of him,

174
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,959
I got back into the underworld.

175
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,139
I truly believed

176
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,339
after that,

177
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,060
I'd not see light again

178
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,459
or trust anyone again.

179
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:15,319
What's going on?

180
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:16,420
Bai Cha,

181
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,839
why are you crying?

182
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:20,899
What underground?

183
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:22,300
What demons?

184
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,180
You don't mean Cheng Nuo, huh?

185
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,660
Did he do something to hurt you?

186
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:30,540
When he gets back,

187
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:32,460
I'll beat him.

188
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,659
You're a wonderful girl,

189
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,100
yet he doesn't appreciate you.

190
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,659
Let me

191
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,580
apologize on his behalf.

192
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,139
Don't cry now.

193
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,299
Mom,

194
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,960
thank you.

195
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:49,220
I hope you'll always

196
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:50,960
stay happy

197
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,340
and healthy.

198
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,259
I'll always remember you.

199
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,259
Let's eat.

200
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,019
It's delicious.

201
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,779
What exactly happened?

202
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:12,620
Tell me.

203
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,840
I'll take care of it for you.

204
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,379
Can't you stay?

205
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:36,539
Bai Cha,

206
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,500
remember to come back early.

207
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,519
You have my number.

208
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,159
Remember to call me.

209
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:42,820
Just

210
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,059
call me.

211
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:55,299
I bought Yunwu Manor for you.

212
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:57,200
Today I'm taking you there.

213
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:57,860
I'm not going.

214
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,220
What's wrong?

215
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,379
Don't you like it?

216
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:01,940
Where to live?

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,919
Do you know

218
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:06,539
who I hate the most?

219
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,320
Cheng Nuo?

220
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,120
Or

221
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,919
me?

222
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,059
So who is it really?

223
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,940
Lin Xia.

224
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,620
Then now

225
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,460
I know where you want to live.

226
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,179
But

227
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,460
my mother is living there.

228
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,759
Isn't that perfect?

229
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,340
When you're busy,

230
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,980
I'll help take care of her.

231
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:37,340
