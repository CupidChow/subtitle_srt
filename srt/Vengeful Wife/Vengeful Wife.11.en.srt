00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,904
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,520
What's wrong?

4
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,939
I was thinking

5
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:02,399
if Lin Xia has regained her sight.

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,079
Something feels off to me.

7
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,459
Dr. Zhang

8
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,959
can't be fully trusted.

9
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,900
Tomorrow,

10
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,579
should we bring her

11
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,120
to the shareholders' meeting?

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,219
If anything goes wrong,

13
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,459
we'll lose everything.

14
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,159
I have a way to check

15
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,340
if she's regained

16
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,359
her sight.

17
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,219
What?

18
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,200
It depends

19
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,620
on whether you

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,040
are willing to make sacrifices.

21
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,819
If it works,

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,760
certainly I'm willing to.

23
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,579
My way works on any woman,

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,140
especially a blind CEO

25
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,260
who once stood above everyone.

26
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,939
We'll tear apart

27
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:51,060
the last remnants of her dignity

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,540
piece by piece,

29
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,840
until she's completely humiliated

30
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,700
and her true self is exposed.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,639
(No results yet.)

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,379
(Na must be in trouble.)

33
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:19,259
(Ye Dong must have noticed something.)

34
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,620
(Na,)

35
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,740
(this is my fault.)

36
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,560
Honey.

37
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,759
Honey.

38
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,379
I've drawn you a bath.

39
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,500
Let me take you to the bathroom.

40
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,800
(Why did he)

41
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:07,219
(bring them here?)

42
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:09,620
(To test me?)

43
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:11,379
(Or to humiliate me?)

44
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,560
(Demon!)

45
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,740
(You deserve to die a thousand deaths.)

46
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,860
Honey.

47
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:25,280
Honey,

48
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,020
I don't feel well.

49
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,020
I don't want to.

50
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,479
Taking a bath

51
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,060
will make you feel better.

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,439
I added rare herbs for you.

53
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,020
Don't waste them.

54
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:41,840
Well,

55
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:44,740
let me help you undress.

56
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,860
(If I keep refusing,)

57
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,419
(his suspicion will grow.)

58
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,080
(But how can I bear to be exposed)

59
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,379
(before strangers?)

60
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,199
(Heavens!)

61
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,379
(Why haven't you stricken him down?)

62
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:05,780
Honey,

63
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,539
I'll do it myself.

64
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,379
Fine.

65
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,480
Honey,

66
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,500
your figure

67
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,660
is perfect.

68
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,139
Take off your underwear too.

69
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,680
Fine.

70
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,500
Honey,

71
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:08,959
you're so beautiful.

72
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,360
Let me take care of you.

73
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,879
The bath

74
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,459
can wait.

75
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,779
Honey,

76
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:21,639
I really don't feel well.

77
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:23,699
I don't want to bathe.

78
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,600
(Ye Dong,)

79
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,879
(at tomorrow's shareholders' meeting,)

80
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,740
(I'll expose your vile nature)

81
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,259
(to everyone.)

82
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,779
(I'll personally make you)

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,079
(suffer a thousand)

84
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,899
(no, ten thousand-fold)

85
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,000
(for what you've done to me.)

86
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:49,620
Demon!

87
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,360
You deserve to burn!

88
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,379
Honey!

89
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,779
Honey!

90
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,040
What happened?

91
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,139
Cheng Nuo,

92
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,860
save me!

93
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,759
Our child...

94
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:10,500
The baby...

95
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,639
Don't be afraid.

96
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:16,399
We're going home now.

97
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,600
Don't fear.

98
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,959
I'll take you home.

99
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,720
Honey!

100
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:24,939
Honey!

101
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,180
(Those who hurt you)

102
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:47,699
(will not escape me.)

103
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,459
Honey,

104
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:01,420
about last night,

105
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,680
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,180
It's my fault.

107
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,360
My love for you became overwhelming,

108
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,860
so I acted roughly.

109
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,160
It's okay.

110
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,600
Honey,

111
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:14,860
today's your big day.

112
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,040
Excited?

113
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,180
What's there to be excited about?

114
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,500
Every day with you

115
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,079
is my big day.

116
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,939
But today

117
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,980
I'm actually nervous.

118
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,740
(You beast!)

119
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,820
(Of course, you're nervous.)

120
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,620
(Today I'll publicly)

121
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,399
(expose your true colors.)

122
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,240
Honey,

123
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:43,519
don't be nervous.

124
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:46,059
Today,

125
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,200
I'll handle everything.

126
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,620
Rest assured.

127
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:58,500
Okay.

128
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:21,779
After today,

129
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,759
that woman will lose all her value.

130
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,379
She still has her value.

131
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,340
After all,

132
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,720
she'll be the top girl

133
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,600
in the nightspot.

134
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,899
Who wouldn't want to get close

135
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:35,340
to Jiuyao's beautiful CEO?

136
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,100
Plus her figure

137
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:38,820
is absolutely stunning.

138
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,980
You lucked out yesterday,

139
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,220
pathetic loser.

140
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,519
Qin Yufei,

141
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,720
you're truly shameless.

142
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,899
Such twisted schemes

143
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,220
only come from you.

144
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:50,500
Show some respect!

145
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,220
I'm Dong's woman!

146
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:53,759
So what?

147
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:55,700
He has plenty of women.

148
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:57,100
You're just one

149
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,279
of his stress-relief toys.

150
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,159
He only cares about profits.

151
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,340
If the day comes

152
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,820
when you lose your value,

153
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,460
he'll kick you to the curb.

154
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,299
Yet

155
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,700
I'm different.

156
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,220
Join me,

157
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,139
and I'll make sure every day

158
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,039
is comfortable for you.

159
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,539
I'll keep proving my value.

160
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:16,220
Women admire strength.

161
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,820
Want me to join you?

162
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:19,059
Are you worthy?

163
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:19,980
Qin Yufei,

164
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,460
looking for a beating?

165
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:22,059
Go ahead!

166
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,220
Hit me.

167
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,340
If you dare

168
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,860
risk me reporting to Dong.

169
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:44,759
Mom,

170
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:45,980
we're heading out.

171
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,820
Dong,

172
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,740
wait.

173
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,899
Let me divine for you.

174
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:06,019
Mom,

175
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:07,379
have you finished yet?

176
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,919
Catastrophic omen.

177
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,740
Two readings are catastrophic.

178
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,519
Dong,

179
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,679
stay home today.

180
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,460
It isn't easy

181
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,019
to call this shareholders' meeting.

182
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,940
Miss it today

183
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,340
and we don't know

184
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:23,960
when we'll get another chance.

185
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,360
(Will he listen to his mother)

186
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,580
(and stay home?)

187
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,320
Right.

188
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,960
Today's crucial for us.

189
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,860
We must go.

190
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:36,500
I never believed in this.

191
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,539
Xia and I

192
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:39,740
earned everything

193
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:41,860
through our own efforts.

194
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:42,980
Let's go.

195
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,340
Dong now

196
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,940
dares disobey me!

197
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:55,820
All is that vixen

198
