00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,680
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,820
Master,

4
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,820
this is so strange.

5
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,259
Bai Cha's blood DNA

6
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,179
don't match her hair's.

7
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,619
This makes no sense!

8
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,299
The testing agency is incompetent

9
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,380
to give such a conclusion.

10
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,659
The DNA of Bai Cha's hair

11
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:01,500
should match

12
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:02,619
that of Lin Xia.

13
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,740
No.

14
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:08,180
The mystery deepens.

15
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,180
Fascinating.

16
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:10,819
I thought

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,780
they would match.

18
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,140
Normally,

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,459
should be mismatched, huh?

20
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,859
They're two different people.

21
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:17,060
So that means

22
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,260
Bai Cha isn't Bai Cha,

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,379
and Bai Cha isn't Lin Xia.

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,540
Then who is she?

25
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,239
Master,

26
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,519
you're confusing me.

27
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:26,900
What are you saying?

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,420
Bai Cha must be Bai Cha.

29
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,379
I thought Bai Cha was Lin Xia.

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,739
Yet Lin Xia

31
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:34,340
isn't Bai Cha.

32
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,340
Then who is she?

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,659
If Lin Xia was Bai Cha,

34
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:39,340
then who was Lin Xia?

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,180
Master,

36
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,099
you're making my head spin.

37
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,700
Seems only Cheng Nuo

38
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:44,739
can give us answers.

39
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,959
What does he have to do with this?

40
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,900
Because

41
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,939
he's a top plastic surgeon

42
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,140
who can change people's faces.

43
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,500
Master,

44
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,019
you mean

45
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:57,260
you thought

46
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,780
the current Bai Cha

47
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,540
is Lin Xia,

48
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,819
so Bai Cha is Lin Xia,

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,739
but the hair doesn't match the body,

50
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:05,620
so that person

51
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,459
isn't Lin Xia.

52
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,099
Another possibility.

53
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:13,759
What?

54
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,379
Bai Cha is Lin Xia,

55
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:17,099
while that body

56
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:18,259
simply had

57
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,039
Lin Xia's face.

58
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:19,939
However,

59
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,259
the body's DNA

60
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:22,340
doesn't match

61
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,099
Bai Cha's.

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,020
This means

63
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:24,979
that body

64
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,659
is neither Bai Cha

65
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,419
nor Lin Xia,

66
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,439
but

67
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,620
someone else.

68
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:35,979
Cheng Nuo killed someone.

69
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,080
Dong.

70
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,139
Let go.

71
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,099
No one listens to me.

72
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:54,539
Mrs. Ye is so domineering,

73
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,780
controlling you at her age.

74
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,020
Those who know

75
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:59,360
say you're filial.

76
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:00,860
Those who don't

77
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,780
think you're a pushover.

78
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,080
Dong...

79
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:09,939
Get lost!

80
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,419
Qin Yufei,

81
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,340
are you trying to help?

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,580
I...

83
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,360
Wei,

84
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,659
just do as I taught you.

85
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:32,900
I'm sure

86
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,020
he will treat you well

87
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,719
and adore you.

88
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:36,259
I will

89
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:37,180
obey you.

90
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,860
I'll be filial to you from now on.

91
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:39,860
Mom,

92
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:40,979
come out here!

93
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,360
Ye Dong,

94
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,400
what's going on?

95
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,900
I forbid you from drinking.

96
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,759
Why are you drunk?

97
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:51,900
With some drink,

98
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:53,539
you dare push me?

99
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,580
I dare you!

100
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,419
Looking to die?

101
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,800
Even defying me.

102
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,860
You need proper discipline.

103
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,019
Wei,

104
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,040
watch how I deal with him.

105
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,139
Please

106
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,300
don't be angry.

107
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,699
This isn't his fault.

108
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,579
You should

109
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,100
blame that wretch in there.

110
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,779
Put me down.

111
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,379
Ye Dong.

112
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,100
Let go of me!

113
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,860
Ye Dong!

114
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:06,980
Ye Dong!

115
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,660
Let go!

116
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:33,579
Lin Xia?

117
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,000
The look in your eyes

118
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,620
reminded me of Lin Xia.

119
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,720
(Has he seen through it?)

120
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:55,300
Are you crazy?

121
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,939
Back then I chose Lin Xia

122
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,959
because she looked

123
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:05,939
exactly like you.

124
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:09,459
But the truth is,

125
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,319
I've always loved you.

126
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,980
So what if you love me?

127
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:19,899
We can't be together.

128
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:20,939
Why?

129
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,980
Because

130
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,540
you're

131
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,920
not a complete person.

132
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,220
Think carefully.

133
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:30,860
Has your mother

134
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,319
got along with any of your girlfriends?

135
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,819
Because

136
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,279
she won't allow you

137
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,540
to love any woman more than her.

138
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:45,980
Go ask your dear mother.

139
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:51,220
Why

140
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,180
can't you both get along?

141
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,259
Why can't you both

142
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,139
love me together

143
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:06,660
peacefully?

144
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,139
Why don't you ask her?

145
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:14,639
Oh right,

146
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,500
she

147
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,160
has prepared a special gift

148
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,300
for you.

149
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,639
Ye Dong!

150
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,199
You ungrateful brat.

151
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,139
Get out here right now.

152
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,259
Go ahead.

153
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:33,220
Her

154
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,839
precious son.

155
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:41,779
Wei,

156
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,019
watch closely today

157
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,639
how I train your husband.

158
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:49,339
Ye Dong,

159
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,100
kneel down!

160
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:53,139
Mom,

161
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,379
you're going too far!

162
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,779
If you don't kneel,

163
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,600
you won't have a mother anymore!

164
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,779
Mrs. Ye,

165
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,300
I support your decision.

166
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:09,819
Cut all ties with him.

167
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,220
Then he and I

168
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,040
can live happily together.

169
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,139
Who do you think you are?

170
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,939
How dare you speak here?

171
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,579
I'll rip your mouth open!

172
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:21,500
Oh!

173
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,019
You're so powerful.

174
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:25,519
Well,

175
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,620
I'll stop talking.

176
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,060
Handle it your way.

177
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:34,620
Bai Cha,

178
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,980
go upstairs.

179
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,340
Ye Dong,

180
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:46,419
kneel down!

181
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:02,019
Wei,

182
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:03,259
see that?

183
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:04,980
In this household,

184
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,320
I'm the one in charge.

185
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:15,779
Wei,

186
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:17,379
let me tell you.

187
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,059
If you want someone

188
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,399
to obey you,

189
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,179
you must make him

190
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,299
remember his place.

191
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,279
Some boundaries

192
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,000
should never be crossed.

193
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,580
Make sure

194
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,720
he never forgets it.

195
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:31,519
Please

196
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,740
stop hitting him.

197
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,000
It's painful to watch.

198
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,419
Stop hitting him.

199
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,419
Stop it.

200
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,379
