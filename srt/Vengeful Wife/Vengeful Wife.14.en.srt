=Episode 14=

3
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,039
Today,

4
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:51,780
I'll announce something important.

5
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,939
Let's see what this fool

6
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,939
is up to today.

7
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,979
Keep it low-key.

8
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,140
The arrogant

9
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:02,340
will meet their fate.

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,420
From today onwards,

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,579
remove all projects

12
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:07,900
and traces

13
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,060
of the Lins from Jiuyao Group.

14
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:12,219
Moreover,

15
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,180
last night I gathered the media

16
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,500
and announced this matter.

17
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:17,859
This...

18
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:18,620
How can he do this?

19
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,879
This won't do.

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,560
Mr. Ye,

21
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,659
Ms. Lin is your wife.

22
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,480
As she's blind now,

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,739
so she's

24
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,459
lost her value to you.

25
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:28,900
There has

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,500
to be a bottom line, right?

27
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:31,379
Indeed,

28
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,700
you even gathered the media

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,980
and announced this.

30
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,159
You want to show others

31
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,739
how ruthless the core

32
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,299
of Jiuyao Group is?

33
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,140
What you're saying

34
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,180
makes sense.

35
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,579
It was painful for me

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,019
to make this decision.

37
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,859
But for the group's future,

38
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:51,900
I must do this

39
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,459
and act quickly.

40
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:54,680
Fine,

41
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:56,180
let's hear

42
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,799
why you're being heartless.

43
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,560
Let's see how you'll justify it.

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,299
(Lin Xia,)

45
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:08,860
(former CEO of Jiuyao Group,)

46
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,460
(is suspected of killing Lin Na,)

47
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,219
(former CFO of Jiuyao Group.)

48
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,620
(Fled in fear of punishment,)

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,860
(she is wanted citywide.)

50
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:16,780
This is impossible.

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,620
I never thought she was like this.

52
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,539
She did such a thing.

53
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,360
Appearances can be deceiving.

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,900
Exactly.

55
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,500
Fortunately,

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,219
she's no longer in the group's

57
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:28,180
leadership core.

58
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:29,280
Otherwise,

59
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,479
our stocks would have taken a hit.

60
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,500
This time,

61
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,939
thanks to Mr. Ye

62
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,419
for announcing this in advance.

63
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:36,819
Mr. Ye,

64
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,180
you've saved the group again.

65
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:40,319
Yes.

66
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:40,819
Right.

67
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:42,099
Now,

68
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:43,860
you know his decision

69
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,180
is wise, right?

70
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,300
Mr. Ye,

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,740
I was blind

72
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:50,020
to your wisdom

73
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,460
and your worth.

74
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,580
Here I am

75
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,300
to offer my apologies.

76
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:55,460
I believe

77
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:56,939
that under your leadership,

78
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:57,979
our group

79
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:58,639
will

80
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,099
reach new heights.

81
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,360
It will.

82
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,039
Yes.

83
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,620
Mr. Wang,

84
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:04,219
you flatter me.

85
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,819
As a member of Jiuyao,

86
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:07,979
I must prioritize Jiuyao.

87
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,539
In the days to come,

88
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,539
let us work together

89
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,460
to create brilliance.

90
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,379
Alright.

91
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,539
(Clues)
Lin Xia suddenly regained sight

92
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,819
and escaped after a murder.

93
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,020
This is unbelievable.

94
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,659
She's been faking blindness.

95
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,060
Every action a person takes

96
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:36,180
presents

97
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,979
a different state

98
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,099
to achieve

99
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,259
the greatest advantage

100
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:40,039
to survive

101
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:41,860
in a specific context.

102
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,500
If by faking blindness,

103
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,979
she can avoid danger,

104
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,379
of course she'll do it.

105
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:50,500
She's self-protecting.

106
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:51,860
Or perhaps

107
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,979
she's waiting for a chance.

108
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,379
Qiao,

109
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,460
take a team

110
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,280
later

111
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:57,340
to visit Lin Xia's

112
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,180
attending physician

113
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,659
to get full details.

114
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,360
Okay.

115
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:02,180
Master,

116
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,379
you're something.

117
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,632
No trace of Bai Cha
in the neighboring city.

118
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,780
Cheng Nuo's lying.

119
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,939
Your gut was right.

120
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:10,379
The key figure

121
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,580
in both cases

122
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:13,180
is him.

123
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:16,500
Sirs,

124
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,339
Mr. Cheng hasn't appeared today.

125
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,420
His phone's unreachable.

126
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,379
He missed two scheduled surgeries.

127
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,920
This is worrying!

128
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,339
Did this happen before?

129
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,139
Never.

130
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,500
He is meticulous

131
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,620
and highly responsible.

132
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,300
He's never delayed any surgery.

133
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:33,379
Do you know

134
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:34,139
his home address?

135
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:34,980
Yes.

136
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,040
We sent people there,

137
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,019
but nobody's present.

138
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,379
Well.

139
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:43,779
If things go wrong,

140
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,420
call me immediately.

141
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,220
Okay.

142
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,819
Thank you.

143
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,620
Could I take a look around?

144
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,620
Of course.

145
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,980
This way, please.

146
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,459
Young lady.

147
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,839
What's stored inside here?

148
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,019
Some medications need refrigeration.

149
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,259
May I inspect inside?

150
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,779
Mr. Cheng ordered that

151
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:31,759
without his permission,

152
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,040
no one enters.

153
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,259
We suspect Cheng Nuo

154
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,579
is related to a murder.

155
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,579
We need to force

156
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,500
the door open now.

157
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:39,300
Cooperate.

158
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:40,459
Fine.

159
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:41,680
I'll get the keys.

160
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,379
What's inside?

161
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,699
A freezer containing

162
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:02,819
medical supplies.

163
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:16,360
Master,

164
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,819
nothing here!

165
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,220
A strand of hair.

166
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,939
A corpse

167
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,240
was stored here?

168
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,199
Notify the testing center

169
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,279
to collect samples

170
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:36,899
and run a genetic comparison

171
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,220
with Bai Cha's blood found

172
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,019
under the cliff.

173
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:39,959
Yes.

174
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:44,360
Young lady.

175
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:45,540
Please show me

176
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,899
your CCTV footage.

177
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,819
They're malfunctioned recently.

178
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:50,360
Mr. Cheng never asked to repair.

179
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,139
My beautiful CEO,

180
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,220
awake at last?

181
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,019
I dislike

182
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:21,620
your defiant attitude.

183
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,300
Think you're the Lin family heiress?

184
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,959
Hmm?

185
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,300
Still rebellious?

186
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,180
What?

187
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,480
Feel bad?

188
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,019
Come here.

189
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,060
Unchain this door.

190
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,720
Now,

191
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,040
get out.

192
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,420
Crawl out like a dog!

193
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:01,660
Refusing, huh?

194
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:03,800
Out!

195
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,139
Lin Xia,

196
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,019
you have one chance today.

197
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,399
Beg me and I'll

198
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,519
release you.

199
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,139
Okay?

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,959
Refusing to beg?

201
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,720
Good.

202
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,360
Come on.

203
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,279
Give it to me.

204
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,360
Scream!

205
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:26,980
Keep screaming!

206
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,180
You can really take it.

207
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,240
The high and mighty.

208
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
The golden heiress.

209
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,519
Now you're like a pet

210
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,399
lying on the ground.

211
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,139
Fine.

212
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,639
I've served your family

213
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,019
for all these years,

214
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,820
so I'll give you one last chance.

215
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,860
Kneel

216
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,720
and beg me.

217
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,840
If you beg me,

218
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,480
I'll let you go today

219
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,720
to spare you some pain.

220
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,919
Agree?

221
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,460
Oh, right.

222
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,840
Show you something.

223
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,700
(Lin Xia,)

224
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,299
(former CEO of Jiuyao Group,)

225
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:05,139
(is suspected of killing Lin Na,)

226
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,639
(former CFO of Jiuyao Group.)

227
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,080
(Fled in fear of punishment,)

228
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,320
(she is wanted citywide.)

229
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,340
Well?

230
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,460
Doesn't it feel like

231
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,279
hopeless weakness?

232
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,799
Like the whole world

233
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,240
has abandoned you?

234
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,879
Feeling helpless?

235
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,779
If you're a man,

236
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,360
kill me!

237
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,639
Pah!

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,500
Alright.

239
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,840
Lin Xia,

240
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,440
getting you to yield

241
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,740
is so hard.

242
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,799
I gave you a chance today,

243
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,600
but you rejected it.

244
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,679
Then don't blame me

245
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,919
for being ruthless.

246
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,360
Stop!

247
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:47,159
Dong.

248
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:48,620
Dong.

249
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,639
Look at me.

250
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,240
I said look at me!

251
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,120
Your eyes

252
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,320
make me sick.

253
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,139
Pah!

254
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,659
I treated you so well,

255
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,039
yet you betrayed me.

256
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,279
Never imagined

257
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,120
you're still

258
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,000
hiding behind your mask.

259
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,960
How pathetic.

260
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,620
I bowed my head

261
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,759
to your father,

262
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,039
doted on you endlessly,

263
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,159
and respected every person

264
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,279
and matter in the group.

265
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,279
And you?

266
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,039
Plotted to expose me,

267
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,000
ruin me at the meeting,

268
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,799
destroy my reputation,

269
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,799
and land me in prison!

270
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,440
Lin Xia,

271
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,639
you heartless witch!

272
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,340
After all I've done for you!

273
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,159
You make me sick.

274
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,840
You treated me well?

275
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
You treated me well,

276
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,340
so hooked up with others before me?

277
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,200
What have you done?

278
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
You killed my father.

279
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,279
Murdered Lin Na.

280
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,139
You're an animal.

281
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,840
No,

282
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,480
worse than an animal!

283
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,600
I should sell you to underground dens

284
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,440
for public use

285
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,840
and humiliation!

286
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,879
But now,

287
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,759
your face

288
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,000
disgusts me completely.

289
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,340
You'd better kill me now.

290
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:43,600
If I get one chance,

291
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,419
I'll make you beg for death.

292
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,440
I hate

293
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,240
your eyes.

294
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,480
No!

295
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:38,519
No!
