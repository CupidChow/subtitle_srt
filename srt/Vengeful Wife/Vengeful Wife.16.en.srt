=Episode 16=

3
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:50,820
Honey,

4
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:52,259
I'll go get the car.

5
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:53,759
Go ahead.

6
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,500
Tell me.

7
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,379
Why did you hide and avoid me?

8
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:21,459
Do you know how worried I was?

9
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,459
I missed you so much.

10
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:31,500
Worried about me?

11
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:33,299
So

12
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:35,959
you pushed me off that high cliff

13
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,540
and killed my child.

14
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,420
Now you claim

15
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:40,900
you were worried about me?

16
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,219
I'm warning you.

17
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,659
We

18
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,019
have no connections.

19
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,939
Right now

20
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,780
I wish I could kill you.

21
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,780
Is this how you see me?

22
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:54,500
That day

23
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,900
if you had

24
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,060
drunk the abortion medicine I prepared,

25
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:59,500
you wouldn't have

26
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,180
fallen by accident.

27
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,139
Do you remember this place?

28
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,580
We used to

29
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:15,939
have so many passionate memories here.

30
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:17,900
Ye Dong,

31
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:19,099
I'm warning you.

32
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,099
Don't say that again.

33
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:21,819
And

34
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,460
this is our final meeting.

35
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,699
From now on,

36
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:27,419
we're completely through.

37
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,740
I've blinded Lin Xia.

38
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,139
We can be together soon.

39
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,099
You're insane.

40
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,139
She's your wife.

41
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:41,659
How could you

42
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,240
do such a thing?

43
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,780
To be with you,

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,699
I'd do anything.

45
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,460
We once vowed

46
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,020
to stay together

47
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,819
forever.

48
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:00,379
I remember that.

49
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:03,419
And I won't let you break that vow.

50
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:06,620
Ye Dong,

51
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,580
your love is twisted

52
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:09,939
and distorted.

53
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,500
It terrifies me.

54
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,500
You love him?

55
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:16,539
Deeply.

56
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,060
You should only love me.

57
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,300
I'm warning you.

58
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:28,259
Stay out of my life.

59
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,780
If

60
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,139
he disappears,

61
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,979
will you

62
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,020
come back to me?

63
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,020
I'm warning you.

64
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:42,340
Stay calm.

65
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,419
Don't make me hate you.

66
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,500
Drink this.

67
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,180
No.

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,020
You're crazy.

69
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,180
Drink it.

70
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,019
What did I drink?

71
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,519
Once the child is gone,

72
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,579
you'll come back to me.

73
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,339
Don't vomit.

74
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:40,939
Be good.

75
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,939
Stop being stubborn.

76
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,860
Drink it.

77
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:50,220
Drink it up.

78
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,079
No.

79
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,699
Please.

80
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,540
Drink it.

81
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:57,500
Ye Dong,

82
00:04:58,779 --> 00:04:59,420
get closer

83
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:01,360
and I'll jump off here.

84
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,519
You value your life so much

85
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,379
that you'd never jump.

86
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,500
Be good.

87
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:17,180
Listen to me.

88
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,899
Drink it.

89
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,420
No!

90
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:21,740
No!

91
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,019
Please.

92
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,300
Bai Cha!

93
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,220
Bai Cha!

94
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,019
After you fell off the cliff,

95
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,660
I was too heartbroken to breathe.

96
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,740
I searched for you crazily,

97
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:39,220
but I couldn't

98
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:40,939
find you.

99
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:43,339
I thought

100
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,939
wild beasts had taken you.

101
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Losing you feels

102
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:52,819
like being abandoned by the world.

103
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,740
But lately

104
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,699
when I heard you were still alive,

105
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,779
I felt alive again.

106
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:03,420
So

107
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,339
I'll never let you leave me again.

108
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,220
Drop your act.

109
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,420
You killed the child I was carrying.

110
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,060
The original Zhang Susu died long ago.

111
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,300
The one alive now

112
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:26,180
is Bai Cha.

113
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,579
We

114
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,339
have no connections.

115
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:30,860
If you come again,

116
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,019
I'll make sure we both ruin.

117
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:35,939
Let go.

118
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,579
Ye Dong,

119
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,899
I'm warning you.

120
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:44,060
Keep this up and I'll call the police.

121
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,060
Go ahead!

122
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:49,379
Want to ruin together?

123
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,420
Then let it be!

124
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:57,300
Ye Dong.

125
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,740
Ye Dong.

126
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:01,379
Honey.

127
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,060
Honey?

128
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:06,860
Honey?

129
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,540
Are you done yet?

130
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,240
Almost ready.

131
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,139
I'll take a call.

132
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:11,980
Then I'll

133
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,660
bring the cart over.

134
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,300
No need.

135
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,259
I'll be there soon. Be patient.

136
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,540
Ye Dong,

137
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:28,939
I'm warning you.

138
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:30,220
Don't come here anymore.

139
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,579
No future for us.

140
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,100
From inside out,

141
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,899
I know you completely.

142
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,120
Nothing about you

143
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,379
could ever attract me.

144
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,680
Understand?

145
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,699
I don't believe it.

146
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:45,439
In your heart,

147
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,060
there's a place for me.

148
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,139
Right?

149
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,379
Stop flattering yourself.

150
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,019
Honey,

151
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,259
put them in the car.

152
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:15,779
Your shoulder is hurt?

153
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:19,939
It's nothing.

154
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,019
I scratched it accidentally.

155
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,060
Who bit you?

156
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:30,899
No one did.

157
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,459
Honey,

158
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,259
please believe me.

159
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,860
You're the only one in my heart.

160
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm asking who bit you!

161
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,299
Was it Ye Dong?

162
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,299
I know you knew each other before.

163
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,139
Honey,

164
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,620
it was really itchy,

165
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,659
so I scratched it.

166
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:58,100
That's all.

167
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,039
Please believe me.

168
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,860
We'll talk at home.

169
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:08,980
Get in the car.

170
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,500
Get in!

171
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:18,940
Master,

172
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,700
bad news.

173
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,100
What?

174
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,179
A female body is found by the river

175
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,179
and it's confirmed

176
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:24,139
to be Lin Xia.

177
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:26,899
Bring to me

178
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:28,059
the autopsy report.

179
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:28,899
And contain

180
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:29,860
the information.

181
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,100
Don't let anyone

182
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:32,220
know this case,

183
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,059
especially Ye Dong.

184
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:34,700
Understood.

185
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,620
Here, put this on.

186
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:00,820
Thanks.

187
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:01,779
I'll do it myself.

188
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,419
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:07,980
I was too rough earlier.

190
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:16,419
Cheng Nuo,

191
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:18,139
let me tell you again.

192
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,779
Under any circumstances,

193
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:21,700
show no mercy.

194
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,340
I know him better than anyone.

195
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,840
He

196
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,440
is so paranoid he doubts himself.

197
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:31,740
Do you understand now,

198
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:34,000
honey?

199
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,720
