3
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:01,500
Ye Dong, Lin Xia,

4
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,340
bye.

5
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:03,380
Keep in touch.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,500
Bye.

7
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,260
Let's go.

8
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,159
Okay. Let's go.

9
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:13,920
Honey.

10
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,159
It's safer

11
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,599
in the back.

12
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:19,840
Okay.

13
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,519
Darling.

14
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,260
Attend tomorrow's press conference

15
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,260
with me.

16
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,980
We'll use this chance to announce

17
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,780
your promotion

18
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,500
to vice president of the group.

19
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:45,500
Honey.

20
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,019
Having one strong woman
in our family is enough.

21
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,340
I'm not interested

22
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,180
in the group affairs.

23
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,459
That won't do.

24
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,340
No matter how capable I am,

25
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,900
I'll always be your little woman.

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,340
Now, my dad has stepped back.

27
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,340
If you don't help me,

28
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,019
who will?

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,840
Okay.

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,980
Whatever you say.

31
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,500
You're so sweet, darling.

32
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:21,984
(Lin Family Villa, One Month Later)

33
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,280
Mr. Ye,

34
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,419
the group's financial secrets

35
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,139
are only accessible to the chairman.

36
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,699
I must respectfully

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,099
decline your request.

38
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,340
Yufei.

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,099
You reached the position

40
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,060
of group finance VP at such a young age.

41
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,900
I've always thought

42
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,860
you are smart,

43
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,900
pragmatic,

44
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:04,939
and know what's appropriate.

45
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:07,819
And especially

46
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,379
where the tide is turning.

47
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:12,340
Mr. Ye,

48
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,500
please don't.

49
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,099
CFO

50
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,500
of the Jiuyao Group

51
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,780
earns ten million annually

52
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,219
plus bonuses.

53
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,780
Do you want

54
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,060
to climb higher?

55
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,500
Of course.

56
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,819
But Na is the CFO

57
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,259
and Ms. Lin's best friend.

58
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,979
How could it be my turn?

59
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,340
Soon, the entire Jiuyao Group

60
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,479
will be under my control.

61
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,699
If I say you're qualified, you are.

62
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,680
However,

63
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,539
the condition

64
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,439
is your obedience

65
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,780
and

66
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,280
showing me your ambition.

67
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,759
Understood?

68
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,400
Darling.

69
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,580
Darling.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,480
Are you here?

71
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,180
Dr. Zhang.

72
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,819
What are the chances

73
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,819
of my wife's eyes recovering?

74
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,480
Don't worry.

75
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,879
Ms. Lin's condition is excellent.

76
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,660
I can responsibly say

77
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,579
there's a 99% chance

78
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,839
of vision recovery.

79
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:40,699
Dr. Zhang.

80
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,420
I want that 99% chance

81
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,019
to become zero.

82
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:52,540
I want her

83
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:54,819
blind.

84
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:01,899
Shh.

85
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,259
Stay quiet.

86
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,980
Or else

87
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,980
face the consequences.

88
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,019
Darling.

89
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:21,939
Who?

90
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,220
Who's there?

91
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,139
Darling.

92
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:31,699
Is that you?

93
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,980
Darling.

94
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,699
Who?

95
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:41,139
Darling.

96
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,519
Where are you?

97
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,279
Honey.

98
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,579
Darling.

99
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,459
Why did you wander out alone?

100
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:51,819
You might get hurt.

101
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,620
You should've told me.

102
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:57,579
Just now,

103
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,379
that troublemaker Garfield

104
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:00,448
knocked over the mic.

105
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,259
Later,

106
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,180
I'll discipline it.

107
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,660
I see.

108
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,439
Ever since I lost my sight,

109
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:08,819
I've always felt

110
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,579
someone is hiding everywhere.

111
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,519
Darling.

112
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,779
The doctor said

113
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,819
I might

114
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:16,899
never regain my vision.

115
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:18,379
The group's affairs

116
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,259
will be entrusted

117
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,360
to you.

118
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:21,540
Don't worry.

119
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,439
I'll always be

120
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,699
your support.

121
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:25,420
But right now,

122
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,259
your eye treatment

123
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:29,199
is more important than the group.

124
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:30,620
I don't know

125
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,699
when my eyes will recover.

126
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,420
The group is our family's life's work.

127
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,660
It can't go leaderless.

128
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:37,420
Darling.

129
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,680
I intend to transfer the CEO position

130
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,639
to you.

131
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:49,740
Honey,

132
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,240
you know

133
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,819
I'm a free spirit

134
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,980
with no ambition.

135
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,420
Darling.

136
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,060
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm the group's chairwoman and CEO,

138
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,620
but in my current state,

139
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,620
I have to rely on you.

140
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,180
Don't worry.

141
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,500
When you recover,

142
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,040
I'll definitely return the group

143
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,180
to your hands in perfect order.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,079
I miss my father.

145
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,519
Why hasn't he visited me lately?

146
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,339
You know Dad has heart problems.

147
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,180
If

148
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,620
he learned about your accident

149
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,620
and critical state,

150
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,300
he'd become extremely agitated.

151
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:25,500
That would harm his health.

152
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,079
So I took it upon myself

153
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,519
to suppress

154
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,420
this matter.

155
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:30,980
I see.

156
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:31,759
By the way,

157
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,240
where's Xiaoli?

158
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,920
Why hasn't she been around?

159
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:35,980
Look at you

160
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,319
in this condition.

161
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,000
You and Dad

162
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,300
aren't managing anything,

163
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,939
so the company matters

164
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:43,579
require my attention.

165
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,339
I don't trust anyone else at home

166
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:46,819
to care for you.

167
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,860
So,

168
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,860
I called over my mom.

169
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,459
She should arrive tomorrow.

170
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,040
That's wonderful news.

171
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,279
But darling,

172
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,079
don't overwork yourself, understand?

173
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,740
Lin Na and Kun Tai

174
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,939
are trustworthy.

175
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,500
I'll instruct them

176
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:01,379
to assist you.

177
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:02,899
Good.

178
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,920
What's wrong,

179
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:06,740
darling?

180
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,459
Ms. Lin,

181
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,180
well,

182
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,319
Mr. Ye has worked
diligently for the group,

183
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
but some in the group claim

184
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,980
he's living off you,

185
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:15,139
unjustified

186
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:15,740
and unworthy

187
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,379
of his role,

188
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,980
managing

189
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,860
without a title.

190
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,420
Recent rumors even suggest

191
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,779
Mr. Ye created the accident

192
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:22,980
to seize control

193
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,860
of Jiuyao Group.

194
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,339
Nonsense!

195
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,480
Do you know the rumor sources?

196
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,360
Investigate it

197
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,560
and expel them.

198
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,740
But Mr. Ye's only a VP,

199
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,580
so it's understandable

200
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,820
if no one follows him.

201
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:36,820
Mu Feng.

202
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,740
The company affairs

203
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,179
stay out of our home.

204
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,100
Understood?

205
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

206
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:42,919
Don't worry.

207
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,840
I'll make those who gossip

208
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,940
about you pay.

209
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,299
Tomorrow, I'll hold a board meeting

210
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,700
and announce you

211
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,840
as the group's CEO.

212
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:00,919
Drink it.

213
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,659
Drink it.

214
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:03,259
No.

215
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:03,899
Drink it.

216
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,460
What's that?

217
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,100
Once this baby's gone,

218
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:10,259
you'll come back to me.

219
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:15,980
Don't spit it out.

220
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,759
Be good.

221
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,299
Stop being stubborn.

222
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,120
Drink it.

223
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:32,179
Just drink it.

224
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,179
I won't.

225
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,019
Please.

226
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:37,899
Drink.

227
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:38,820
Ye Dong.

228
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,419
Drink.

229
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:40,899
Take one more step,

230
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,740
and I'll jump.

231
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:47,860
You value your life too much.

232
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,860
You'd never jump.

233
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,000
Be good.

234
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:55,820
Listen to me.

235
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,340
Drink it.

236
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,220
No.

237
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,460
Please.

238
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:05,740
Bai Cha!

239
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,759
