=Episode 3=

3
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:56,128
(Basement of the Lin Family Villa)

4
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:33,472
(Lin Xia's Father)

5
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:35,459
Water.

6
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,500
Give me...

7
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:37,420
Give me water.

8
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,420
Let me drink water.

9
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:43,620
Water.

10
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:48,780
Water.

11
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,219
Beast.

12
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,700
What exactly are you trying to do?

13
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,460
Nothing.

14
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,460
It's just my pride acting up.

15
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:14,819
This is a world

16
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,219
that values cause and effect.

17
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:18,699
When you

18
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,479
looked down on me years ago,

19
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,580
humiliated and belittled

20
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,020
me publicly

21
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,139
and privately,

22
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,840
and said I wasn't good enough
for your daughter,

23
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,740
you sealed today's bitter fate.

24
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,340
From the first moment I saw you,

25
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,900
I knew you had a rotten character.

26
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,860
Father,

27
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,419
if

28
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,020
you weren't the chairman
of Jiuyao Group,

29
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:46,860
just an ordinary man,

30
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,900
a regular father,

31
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,419
you

32
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,939
wouldn't have looked at me that way,

33
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,900
right?

34
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,259
Ye Dong.

35
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,900
Promise me.

36
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:00,939
Let me go.

37
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,340
Disappear from Lin Xia's life

38
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,379
forever.

39
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:07,819
I'll give you 20%
of Jiuyao Group's shares

40
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:08,580
and cash...

41
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,020
Name any amount you want.

42
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,580
Enough for lifetimes.

43
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,460
Father,

44
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,340
don't you see how stupid you are?

45
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:23,020
I meticulously approached Lin Xia,

46
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,900
set up a hero-saves-damsel trap,

47
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,300
and used love and warmth,

48
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:31,500
step by step,

49
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:33,979
to trap her.

50
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:36,699
What do you think

51
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,300
is my goal?

52
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,340
Beast.

53
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,099
You're nothing but a beast!

54
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,740
Obviously,

55
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,780
I want to take everything from her.

56
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,740
Darling.

57
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,259
I can't see anything.

58
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,180
Why bother with makeup?

59
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:12,340
I'll do your makeup

60
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,620
and make you gorgeous.

61
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,060
You're blind.

62
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,379
But your husband isn't dead.

63
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,259
Darling.

64
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,500
Stop the nonsense.

65
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,459
Take that back.

66
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,579
Okay.

67
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:23,712
I take it back.

68
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,060
I've got a loose tongue.

69
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,240
Punishable.

70
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:28,839
Oh, right.

71
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:29,459
Darling.

72
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,459
Are the board meeting documents ready?

73
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,060
All prepared.

74
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,019
Don't worry.

75
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:34,980
It's foolproof.

76
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,060
Just waiting for our chairperson

77
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,860
to sign them.

78
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,100
Bring them here then.

79
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,120
Okay.

80
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:49,759
Here.

81
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,620
They're here.

82
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:52,439
Good.

83
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:57,344
(Signature)

84
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:01,856
(Acting CEO Appointment Document)

85
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:05,184
(Share Transfer Agreement)

86
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:06,439
Here.

87
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,699
Okay.

88
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,579
It's Mom's call.

89
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,939
She might be here.

90
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:27,819
I'll go get her.

91
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,620
Honey,

92
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:29,579
wait here for me.

93
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,259
I'll be back.

94
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,120
Okay.

95
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,680
Darling.

96
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,139
Explain to Mom

97
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,339
about my eyes.

98
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,860
It's inconvenient to greet her.

99
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,819
It's okay.

100
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,500
Don't worry.

101
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:13,139
Honey.

102
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:16,420
Darling.

103
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,220
Why do you walk so quietly?

104
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,420
You scared me to death.

105
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:22,980
Honey.

106
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,500
Why are you alone

107
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,699
in the basement?

108
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,980
What if you trip?

109
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:27,899
Darling.

110
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,740
I just heard

111
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,060
thumping noises.

112
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,779
Something's knocking on the door.

113
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,819
Honey.

114
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,459
Are you sure you heard it?

115
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
Yes.

116
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,139
Ever since I lost my sight,

117
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,500
my hearing's become sharper than ever.

118
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,620
I couldn't have misheard.

119
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,600
Alright.

120
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:47,899
The basement's damp.

121
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,939
Let's go upstairs.

122
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,980
I'll check it out later myself.

123
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,680
Darling.

124
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:55,579
Did you hear that?

125
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,779
That's the sound.

126
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,540
There must be something trapped inside.

127
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:03,740
Let me open it.

128
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,699
Darling.

129
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:27,740
What do you see?

130
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:28,620
I see

131
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,779
a huge old dog.

132
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:32,700
Old dog?

133
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,539
How could there be a dog here?

134
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,019
And it's a pitiful thing,

135
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,940
skin and bones from starvation.

136
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,620
Should I make it bark

137
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,419
so you can hear?

138
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,860
There's really a dog?

139
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,340
Just kidding.

140
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,460
There's no dog.

141
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:49,379
The noise probably

142
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,379
came through the skylight
on the first floor.

143
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,580
You misheard.

144
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,379
Skylight?

145
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
That doesn't sound right.

146
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,220
I clearly heard something

147
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:00,299
like banging against a door.

148
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:22,860
Darling.

149
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,580
Is there really nothing there?

150
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,100
Can you check again?

151
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,700
Honey.

152
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,620
The basement's chilly.

153
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:36,740
Bad for your recovery.

154
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:37,779
Later,

155
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,019
I'll close the skylight.

156
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,460
No more noises then.

157
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,740
If there's another sound

158
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,940
scaring my wife,

159
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:46,940
that won't be good.

160
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,539
Darling.

161
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,820
You're so good.

162
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:53,960
Let's go.

163
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:12,539
Mom.

164
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,139
Mom, you're here.

165
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:18,580
I can't serve you in this state.

166
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,659
Please forgive me.

167
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:22,059
How dare I let

168
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:23,740
a pampered princess like you

169
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,019
wait on me?

170
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,059
I came here

171
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:28,700
to take care of you two

172
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,500
and cleanse

173
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:30,940
the bad energy.

174
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:31,779
Mom,

175
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,179
why throw Xia's clothes

176
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:34,100
on the floor?

177
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:35,500
These are valuable.

178
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:36,419
Valuable?

179
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,740
More valuable than your life?

180
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:40,580
You've only been married a few years.

181
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:42,059
See this color?

182
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,379
Red.

183
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:44,700
It attracts bloodshed.

184
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,860
No wonder you had
that terrible accident.

185
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,580
Look at you now,

186
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,259
filled with resentment.

187
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,179
If we don't clear out

188
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,360
that filth,

189
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,460
worship the gods

190
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,659
and perform rituals,

191
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,259
the next disaster will strike

192
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,340
the closest person

193
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,659
to you.

194
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,460
Mom,

195
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,379
that's enough.

196
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:03,779
We have

197
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:04,860
important things to do.

198
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,700

Rest well.

Xia,

201
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,139
I mean well.

202
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,720
Don't take my words

203
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:17,980
to heart.

204
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,000
Mom,

205
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,980
we're leaving now.

206
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,100
Dong.

207
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,220
Your eyes

208
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:26,740
look dim and yellow,

209
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,659
and your temples

210
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
show a dark bluish hue,

211
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,179
which indicates
you could face imprisonment.

212
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:32,899
Mom,

213
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:33,940
here you go again.

214
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:35,700
Stop talking nonsense all the time.

215
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,139
I haven't done anything.

216
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:38,539
Why would I face imprisonment?

217
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:40,799
Dong,

218
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,019
this is an amulet.

219
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,059
Keep it with you.

220
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,539
Goddess will bless you.

221
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,299
Understood.
