2
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,680
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:14,799
Master.

4
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:15,819
By the way,

5
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,260
verified things

6
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:17,900
with Bai Cha?

7
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,299
I went to Cheng Nuo.

8
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,099
He said

9
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:21,000
he sent her

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,319
to another city
with better medical resources.

11
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,019
So I asked him to video call her,

12
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,340
but she never answered.

13
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:29,540
So this matter

14
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,659
remains unresolved.

15
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,120
We might have been deceived.

16
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,180
Let's go to him.

17
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,819
Honey,

18
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,560
your hands are so cold.

19
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,040
Are you nervous?

20
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:56,079
Honey,

21
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,799
I've seen it all.

22
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,040
Do I look nervous?

23
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,519
Yes,

24
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:02,920
you're

25
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:05,260
the revered goddess CEO.

26
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,540
I should be

27
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,700
the nervous one.

28
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,659
You

29
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:09,879
always mock me.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,379
By the way,

31
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,340
I prepared a gift for you.

32
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,520
What is it?

33
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,199
Open it and see.

34
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,439
Okay.

35
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,800
(It's Na's clothes.)

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,860
(Na...)

37
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,560
(This beast is so paranoid.)

38
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,719
(He's still testing me.)

39
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,120
Honey,

40
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,879
is this a piece of clothing?

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,919
Yes.

42
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,759
But the texture

43
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,020
feels unusual.

44
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:00,819
On the fabric,

45
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,219
there are dyed patterns.

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,020
What patterns?

47
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,360
An ocean,

48
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,919
meaning even to the ends of the earth,

49
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,680
you'll always stay by my side.

50
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,500
Honey,

51
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,240
you're truly romantic.

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,699
Do you like it?

53
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:17,780
Yes.

54
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,500
As long as you like it.

55
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:54,479
Sirs.

56
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:54,979
Sirs,

57
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,580
wait.

58
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,319
Please wait.

59
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:57,500
What brings you here?

60
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,699
We want to see Mr. Cheng.

61
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,060
Please wait here.

62
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,740
I'll inform him.

63
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,300
No need.

64
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,120
I'll go directly.

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,300
Cheng Nuo!

66
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,060
Mr. Cheng,

67
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,319
I'm sorry,

68
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:15,699
Mr. Luo,

69
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:16,980
want some water?

70
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,680
No need.

71
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,660
Where is your wife's corpse?

72
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:25,180
Mr. Luo,

73
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,060
she is alive and well.

74
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,899
Watch your language.

75
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,220
Cheng Nuo,

76
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,379
I've handled

77
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,660
many bizarre cases.

78
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,180
My instincts

79
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,500
have never been wrong.

80
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:38,259
Don't fool me.

81
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,500
You didn't harm her,

82
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:42,360
but what are you hiding?

83
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,420
Did Ye Dong offer you something

84
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,420
to cover for him?

85
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,060
No wonder you're a detective.

86
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:51,459
Such wild imagination.

87
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,379
I said

88
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,399
my wife is alive.

89
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:59,040
Fine.

90
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,100
Then tell me

91
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,779
which hospital

92
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,579
she is at,

93
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,040
the ward number

94
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:06,540
and attending physician.

95
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,100
I don't think

96
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,399
I need to tell you that.

97
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,600
You'd better

98
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:14,779
cooperate with our investigation.

99
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,800
Otherwise,

100
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:17,620
I'll have to take you in.

101
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:23,879
You're

102
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,500
really looking out for me.

103
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,800
Fine.

104
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:27,879
Listen,

105
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:30,800
she is at Wangjiang Hospital

106
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,079
in another city.

107
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,800
Ward 302.

108
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,399
Her attending physician

109
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,220
is Zhang Mo.

110
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:37,540
Is that enough?

111
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,019
Call

112
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:40,699
and verify it.

113
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,540
Yes.

114
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:53,420
Your office is full of her photos.

115
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,019
You two love each other deeply.

116
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:00,259
Of course.

117
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,819
Our love

118
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,279
has always been strong.

119
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:06,980
But

120
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,259
these aren't recent photos.

121
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,439
Got any of her older photos?

122
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:12,899
These were

123
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,060
taken after we got together.

124
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,060
Before that,

125
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,220
she didn't take any.

126
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:21,180
Where did she work before?

127
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:23,660
She

128
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,040
used to be a DJ at a nightclub.

129
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:29,079
Doesn't that bother you?

130
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:33,560
Do you know

131
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,819
Ye Dong

132
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,699
used to work as a security guard

133
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,019
at her workplace?

134
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,300
After meeting him that time,

135
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,000
she confessed to me.

136
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,240
They did have a history.

137
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,180
On the day she died,

138
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:50,980
the cameras captured

139
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,180
they were

140
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,040
in the same car.

141
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,480
Aren't you worried

142
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,420
they might still

143
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,399
be involved?

144
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:01,019
Mr. Luo,

145
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:02,740
I'll say this one last time.

146
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,379
My wife is not dead.

147
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,699
She's very much alive.

148
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,259
Alright.

149
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:06,759
Fine.

150
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,319
Then I'll

151
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:10,120
rephrase my question.

152
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,800
Is there any chance her fall

153
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,560
had anything

154
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,279
to do with Ye Dong?

155
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,759
I've said this repeatedly.

156
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,339
That was an accident.

157
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:23,980
No one else was involved.

158
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:32,220
Master,

159
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,060
I've verified.

160
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,399
All's true.

161
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,699
Mr. Cheng,

162
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:41,560
I'll leave you be.

163
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,879
See? Nothing to worry about.

164
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:02,100
You're

165
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:04,300
not always right.

166
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,360
Go to Wangjiang Hospital.

167
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:08,879
Regardless of what others say,

168
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,639
verify Bai Cha's identity

169
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:11,839
with your own eyes.

170
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,319
Master,

171
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,139
this

172
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:15,019
isn't necessary.

173
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:16,000
That's an order.

174
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,079
Get lost.

175
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,079
Yes.

176
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,399
Dong, Ms. Lin,

177
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,139
we're here.

178
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:31,420
Honey,

179
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:32,740
let me help you.

180
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,019
Okay.

181
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:46,740
Mr. Ye,

182
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,200
what are you doing?

183
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:01,820
We don't need her anymore.

184
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:02,620
Mu Feng,

185
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:03,799
take her back.

186
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:05,039
Yes.

187
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,120
Outrageous.

188
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,000
He's crossing the line.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,820
Controls everything.

190
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,580
Why does Ms. Lin trust him so much?

191
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,279
He's just a live-in son-in-law.

192
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,120
He's here.

193
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:17,200
Why is he alone?

194
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:19,899
Thank you for waiting.

195
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,460
I'll chair

196
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,600
today's meeting.

197
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,080
Any objections?

198
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,379
Ye Dong,

199
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:28,059
you don't regard us

200
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:28,960
with any respect.

201
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,399
You aren't

202
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,639
the acting CEO yet.

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,360
Even if you're the CEO,

204
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,240
we can unite and oust you.

205
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:37,080
Exactly.

206
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,980
Out of respect for Ms. Lin,

207
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,500
if you have sense,

208
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,059
we might support you.

209
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,299
But

210
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:44,700
you're so arrogant.

211
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,299
Today,

212
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,320
I'll never agree

213
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,980
to make you

214
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:49,879
the acting CEO.

215
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,500
- Me neither.
- Exactly.

216
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,460
I disagree.

217
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,200
All of you

218
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,440
are being ridiculous.

219
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,700
If you disagree,

220
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,220
withdraw your investments.

221
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,019
Does Jiuyao Group

222
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:03,940
lack capital?

223
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,460
Ye Dong,

224
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,159
who do you think you are?

225
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:08,179
Even Ms. Lin

226
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:09,460
wouldn't dare speak that.

227
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,440
Have you lost your mind?

228
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,299
Ye Dong,

229
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,360
all of us will

230
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,960
jointly cancel you.

231
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,740
Not even Ms. Lin

232
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,759
could protect you.

233
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:21,299
You'll never lead

234
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:22,860
Jiuyao Group.

235
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:25,379
Shareholders,

236
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,740
Ms. Lin Xia

237
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,820
has transferred
all her Jiuyao Group shares

238
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,259
to Mr. Ye Dong.

239
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,639
This means

240
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,179
Mr. Ye Dong is now

241
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:34,759
the largest shareholder.

242
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:36,120
Does anyone here

243
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,039
have the right to expel him?

244
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:39,620
Or rather,

245
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,580
dare to expel him?
