00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,808
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,299
You're a murder suspect.

4
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:52,619
Join us at the station.

5
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:53,780
What?

6
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,060
Sir,

7
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,659
there must be some mistake.

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,880
How could he be involved in murder?

9
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,179
The case is under investigation.

10
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,759
No details can be disclosed now.

11
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:04,459
Take him.

12
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:04,980
Wait!

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,060
Clarified the facts

14
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,980
before arresting him.

15
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,480
Honey,

16
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:13,739
don't worry.

17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,379
I'll go with them.

18
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:17,060
I'm innocent.

19
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:18,579
I'll return safely.

20
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:20,159
Okay,

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,200
honey.

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,420
Mr. Ye,

23
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:24,540
shall we?

24
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:34,620
Min!

25
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,280
Yes?

26
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:37,019
Get Mr. Yan immediately

27
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:37,859
to accompany Mr. Ye.

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,819
Right away.

29
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,040
Mrs. Ye,

30
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,859
name your price and I'll pay it.

31
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,580
I swear

32
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,939
I won't press charges against your son.

33
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:16,180
Lin Yuanshan,

34
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,699
you think

35
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,500
I want your money?

36
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,740
Aren't you all about money?

37
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,819
We want not only your wealth,

38
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,060
but also your life.

39
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,340
Your birth chart shows regal fortune,

40
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,860
destined for prosperity.

41
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,900
I'll borrow your destiny

42
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:42,539
to fulfill my son's fate.

43
00:02:58,979 --> 00:02:59,860
Using

44
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,020
the Twelve Destiny Manipulation Skill,

45
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,379
I'll insert these steel needles

46
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:09,180
into your vital organs

47
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:13,219
to claim your destiny.

48
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,139
You crazy old hag!

49
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:17,539
You're crazy!

50
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,219
This is a new era!

51
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,659
Still believing in this nonsense!

52
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:23,580
You superstitious old fool!

53
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,620
When my son returns,

54
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,300
I'll perform the ritual.

55
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,180
However,

56
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,860
your current fate is too resilient.

57
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,740
Let's start with some bloodletting.

58
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,180
If my husband broke the law,

59
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,419
let justice take its course.

60
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,300
But I believe he's innocent.

61
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,780
I trust your department

62
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,620
will uphold justice.

63
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,680
Ms. Lin,

64
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,979
rest assured.

65
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:52,300
We'll clear Mr. Ye's name.

66
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,039
Great!

67
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,479
Xia,

68
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,580
if he's really

69
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,460
related to the murder,

70
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,259
what will you do?

71
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,180
Impossible!

72
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,800
At the crucial period

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,139
of the group handover,

74
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,500
someone's obviously framing him

75
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,060
to sabotage Jiuyao Group.

76
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
Appearances can be deceiving.

77
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,020
Why him

78
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,699
of all people in the group?

79
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,060
If it's true,

80
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,020
what would you do?

81
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,979
Whoever breaks the law

82
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:16,459
must face punishment.

83
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:19,660
(Police Interrogation Room)

84
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,300
Ye Dong,

85
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,939
this surveillance footage

86
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:24,819
shows you speeding

87
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,620
with Bai Cha beside you.

88
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,000
Soon after,

89
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,899
she disappeared.

90
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:32,399
Heavy bloodstains were found
by the cliff

91
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,819
near the surveillance zone.

92
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,779
It's verified

93
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:36,540
the blood belongs to Bai Cha.

94
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:37,839
Ye Dong,

95
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:39,699
confess truthfully

96
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,899
where her body is.

97
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,740
I gave her a ride

98
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:48,180
because we knew each other.

99
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,500
As to what happened after that,

100
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,139
I have absolutely no idea.

101
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:53,660
But Mr. Luo,

102
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:54,860
that mountain area

103
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,699
hosts wildlife.

104
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:57,220
You'd better

105
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,139
step up the search.

106
00:04:58,779 --> 00:04:59,579
Make sure she won't

107
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,699
end up as prey.

108
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:01,620
You're lying.

109
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:03,699
You killed her!

110
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,540
Mr. Luo,

111
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,779
mind your position.

112
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,100
You're publicly slandering me!

113
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,740
I want my lawyer.

114
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:13,959
Fine.

115
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,500
Then explain

116
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,980
how you met Bai Cha.

117
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:21,060
We

118
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:22,860
met at a resort hotel

119
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,100
by coincidence.

120
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,699
Also there was her husband

121
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:26,519
Cheng Nuo.

122
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,259
Such a coincidence?

123
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:32,579
Did you

124
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,339
meet before?

125
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,699
Or

126
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,980
were you lovers?

127
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,300
So it's a crime of passion.

128
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,379
I'll say this one last time.

129
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,339
I had nothing to do with her case.

130
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,259
If you have evidence,

131
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,040
then charge me.

132
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,420
You're the prime suspect now.

133
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:53,939
Want evidence?

134
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:55,100
It's easy to find.

135
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,560
Master.

136
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:58,860
Chief is calling you.

137
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,819
What's wrong?

138
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:13,420
Are you insane?

139
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:14,339
What happened?

140
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:15,540
An old hag

141
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,740
smashed your wedding photo!

142
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,819
What?

143
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,660
Disgraceful!

144
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:20,939
Shameless!

145
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,180
Taking these indecent photos

146
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,220
brings shame

147
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,620
to the Ye family.

148
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:27,500
How dare you display it

149
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,600
in the most visible spot!

150
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,339
If relatives or friends see this,

151
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,579
won't you feel ashamed?

152
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:32,860
Mom,

153
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,779
those are artistic wedding portraits.

154
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,660
They were taken by a famous...

155
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,779
Nonsense art!

156
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:39,860
The Ye family has its own traditions.

157
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:41,459
No more

158
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,899
of such vulgar things.

159
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,019
Not a single copy remains!

160
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,579
Destroy it!

161
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:46,199
Step on it!

162
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,120
Step!

163
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,399
You old hag!

164
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,379
You're going too far!

165
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,459
This is

166
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,740
the Lin family's home,

167
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,899
not the Ye's!

168
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:54,420
- You...
- You have no right

169
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,500
to smack things here.

170
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:57,180
In all my life,

171
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,899
I've never seen such a tyrannical

172
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:00,100
and mentally twisted person.

173
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:01,319
Xia,

174
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,819
so this is Ye Dong's cruel mother?

175
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:04,180
Like mother,

176
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,420
like son.

177
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,980
Given Ye Dong's behavior,

178
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,060
he's no saint either.

179
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,600
Wake up, Xia!

180
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,660
You shouldn't have

181
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,040
made him the acting CEO.

182
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:13,459
Justice prevailed!

183
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:14,699
The police officers came

184
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,939
and arrested

185
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:17,939
that murderer.

186
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:19,100
Na, stop it.

187
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,699
What?

188
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:20,759
Ye Dong

189
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,220
was arrested by the police?

190
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:22,899
Lin Xia,

191
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,939
what happened?

192
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,240
Don't worry, Mom.

193
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,220
He is just giving a statement

194
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,379
and will return soon.

195
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,779
I saw it this morning

196
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,259
that he's destined for prison.

197
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,199
He may be back soon.

198
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,100
Or he may

199
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,740
never return.

200
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,819
I'll shut your trap myself!

201
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:38,779
Bring in on then!

202
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:39,279
You!

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You old hag!

204
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:43,980
Both of you!

205
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:45,839
I'll tear your mouth apart!

206
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:47,259
Stop fighting!

207
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:52,899
Stop!

208
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:54,980
We can't do this.

209
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:57,819
He's our prime suspect.

210
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:58,779
We can't release him.

211
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,439
Don't be stubborn.

212
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,699
The Speaker himself called me

213
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:03,699
and started

214
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:04,579
lecturing me harshly.

215
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,779
I can't handle this.

216
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,800
Moreover,

217
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,199
we don't have concrete evidence.

218
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,220
I'm absolutely sure

219
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,500
he's the murderer.

220
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:13,620
Show me the evidence,

221
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,720
and I'll cover you.

222
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,120
If you can't,

223
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,100
release him!

224
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,300
There must be evidence.

225
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,720
Just give me more time.

226
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,560
Then release him first!

227
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,319
Deal?

228
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,379
We can't release him

229
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,300
before 24 hours.

230
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,259
This is rule.

231
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,100
Unless you claim the Speaker

232
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,339
is above the law?

233
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,059
Recording is

234
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:33,940
enabled by accident.

235
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,360
You...

236
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,200
Of course, he's not.

237
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,960
Follow standard procedures.

238
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,059
Wise decision!

239
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,128
(Lin Na)

240
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,620
Master.

241
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:16,539
Cheng Nuo!

242
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:17,899
Perfect timing.

243
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:19,899
I have more questions for you.

244
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:20,779
Mr. Luo,

245
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,340
I need to speak with you too.

246
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:23,940
A mix-up.

247
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,779
A huge mix-up.

248
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,460
My wife Bai Cha

249
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:27,419
has been found.

250
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:30,820
Found?

251
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:31,779
Yes.

252
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:32,700
What happened?

253
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:35,580
She went hiking

254
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,019
with her friend Ai Li.

255
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:38,940
As Ai Li's phone died,

256
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,620
we lost contact.

257
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,059
When we finally reached her,

258
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:41,700
we discovered

259
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:42,980
my wife fell off a cliff

260
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,820
accidentally.

261
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:45,820
Fortunately,

262
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:47,299
she's stable

263
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,080
and has been hospitalized.

264
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,500
Sorry for the trouble.

265
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,059
Mr. Luo,

266
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:57,980
what's wrong?

267
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,820
Your wife and Ye Dong

268
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,620
knew each other, huh?

269
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,700
No,

270
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,460
we met at the hotel.

271
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,960
Ye Dong's very magnanimous

272
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,480
and generous.

273
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,620
We instantly clicked.

274
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,019
Mr. Luo, if nothing else,

275
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,179
I'll go tend to my wife.

276
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,340
At least she's safe.

277
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,639
In this case,

278
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:25,179
we will need

279
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,399
her statement.

280
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,259
Okay.

281
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,320
But she's recovering in the hospital.

282
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,639
She needs rest.

283
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,200
After she recovers,

284
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:37,539
I'll bring her here

285
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:38,779
to check it.

286
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:39,299
Okay?

287
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,600
Fine.

288
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,220
But proper procedures

289
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:43,019
must be obeyed.

290
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:43,519
Naturally.

291
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,840
Silly Qiang,

292
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,820
accompany him to the hospital

293
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,659
to confirm it.

294
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:49,860
Yes, sir!

295
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:56,659
While taking photos,

296
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,059
I stood too close to the edge.

297
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,639
Slipped and fell.

298
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,919
Luckily I got immediate care.

299
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,659
I'm out of danger now.

300
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,379
Thank you for your concern.

301
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
Alright.

302
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,019
Thank you.

303
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:11,159
Sir,

304
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:12,340
thank you

305
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,580
for coming all this way.

306
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,000
It's just a misunderstanding.

307
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,620
Right now,

308
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:18,299
I just want my wife

309
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,919
to heal properly

310
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,659
and get well soon.

311
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,860
So,

312
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,740
I hope this matter...

313
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,799
Don't worry.

314
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,919
Almost done here.

315
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:28,940
I wish your wife

316
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,700
a speedy recovery.

317
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,440
Goodbye.

318
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,980
Thank you.

319
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:40,288
(Bai Cha's best friend Ai Li)

320
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,539
What's going on here?

321
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,539
Didn't you say

322
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,620
you cleaned it up?

323
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:44,399
Dong,

324
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,899
at the cliff that day,

325
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:47,139
I just found some blood,

326
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:48,419
not Bai Cha's body.

327
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:49,259
I thought,

328
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,419
falling off the cliff,

329
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,340
she must be dead.

330
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:52,399
Besides,

331
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,340
wild beasts

332
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,379
were roaming nearby.

333
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,340
She must've been dragged away.

334
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,059
So,

335
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,360
I just left.

336
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:01,220
You almost ruined everything.

337
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,000
Dong,

338
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,340
I really didn't mean to.

339
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,940
The police

340
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,519
have cleared you of suspicion,

341
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,500
which means Bai Cha

342
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:08,620
must still be alive.

343
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,080
Right.

344
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,740
She's not dead yet.

345
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,620
That means I have hope.

346
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,200
Yes.

347
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,220
Go investigate her whereabouts.

348
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,740
Got it.

349
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,379
She can only be my woman.

350
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,820
