00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,606
=Episode 25=

3
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,700
I've paved the roads for you.

4
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,060
As long as you don't confess,

5
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,420
no one can prove you're Lin Xia.

6
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,539
The rest depends on you.

7
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,200
I'll disappear for a while,

8
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,980
as the police are onto me.

9
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:14,700
Speak.

10
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,780
Master,

11
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:16,900
Cheng Nuo has fled.

12
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:18,939
Apply for a warrant.

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:19,920
Yes.

14
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:22,459
Qiao,

15
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:24,500
inform Ye Dong

16
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:25,420
to claim

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,900
Lin Xia's body.

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,120
Master,

19
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,579
what's this about?

20
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:31,019
The body was Ai Li's.

21
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:32,659
Why ask him to claim it?

22
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,739
What's the strategy here?

23
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,340
We need to stir the waters

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,680
to make

25
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:39,379
the fish jump out.

26
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:43,920
Never imagined

27
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,340
you'd manage the company

28
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,540
so well during this period.

29
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,659
Truly impressive.

30
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,579
The group's systems are robust.

31
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,700
While minor decisions

32
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:56,900
don't need my approval,

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,959
major decisions

34
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,500
go through management voting.

35
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,099
Any idiot

36
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,420
could handle this position.

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,340
You make it sound simple.

38
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,580
Proves your talent

39
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,680
in this field.

40
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,659
But

41
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,900
the way you act now

42
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:20,819
reminds me of Lin Xia back then.

43
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,680
Seems

44
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:27,580
you're still hung up

45
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,919
on your ex-wife,

46
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:31,379
always mentioning her.

47
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,500
Why get jealous

48
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,020
of a murderer?

49
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:38,300
But

50
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,139
did she really kill Lin Na?

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,039
Then

52
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,060
what's her motive?

53
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,340
Well,

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,139
only she

55
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,580
and Lin Na knew.

56
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:53,419
Could it be

57
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,699
that you killed Lin Na

58
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,360
and framed her?

59
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,199
Two birds, one stone.

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
Bold imagination

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
and bold questions.

62
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,780
If it was me,

63
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:11,639
would I admit it?

64
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,740
No ruthless tactics,

65
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,060
no victory.

66
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,840
Your confession means nothing.

67
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,960
Anyone with half a brain

68
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,439
can figure it out.

69
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,060
Enough digressions.

70
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,780
You promised

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,939
if I made you CEO

72
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,159
and gave you shares,

73
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,020
you'd give me a chance.

74
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:33,139
Now

75
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,159
it's time to deliver.

76
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,500
I did say a chance,

77
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,659
but

78
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,319
a chance to marry me.

79
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,860
Before our wedding day,

80
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:57,500
no intimacy.

81
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,199
Don't push your luck.

82
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,360
The chance is yours.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
Seize it

84
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,159
or lose it.

85
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,759
My patience has limits.

86
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:13,719
Nobody

87
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,399
tests me twice.

88
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,240
Same goes

89
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,779
for you.

90
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,199
Fine.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,160
I'll marry you.

92
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,240
Suits me.

93
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,100
Mr. Ye,

94
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:41,699
Ms. Bai.

95
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,060
Mr. Ye,

96
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,259
police want you to claim Lin Xia's body.

97
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,959
You're certain?

98
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,240
Absolutely.

99
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,939
(The police found her body?)

100
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,920
(Could they know something?)

101
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,560
(They can't have evidence.)

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,759
(Otherwise,)

103
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,040
(this isn't about claiming a body.)

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,920
We'll discuss

105
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:10,620
details later.

106
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:14,579
Let's go.

107
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,819
(The police found the body long ago.)

108
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:23,200
(They've been keeping it under wraps.)

109
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:25,879
(They suddenly want him to claim it.)

110
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:27,699
(What's their intention?)

111
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:31,079
(What if he realizes)

112
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,139
(that isn't me?)

113
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,360
Honey,

114
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:50,579
I've imagined

115
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:52,199
countless times

116
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,639
how we'd meet again.

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,720
But I never imagined

118
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,439
you'd become this cold body.

119
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,399
Though you killed Lin Na,

120
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,639
it doesn't change that

121
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,120
you were my beloved wife.

122
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,879
My current achievements

123
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,680
and status

124
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,000
are all because of you.

125
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,759
I'm taking you home now.

126
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,920
Mr. Ye,

127
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,720
please checkmark these body features.

128
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:20,800
Here,

129
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,600
here,

130
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,319
and here.

131
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,000
The large mole on her arm.

132
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,060
Mole on her arm?

133
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,279
(Lin Xia's arms were flawless.)

134
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,319
(There's no mole.)

135
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,660
(She had a scar on her leg)

136
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,519
(from a dog bite in childhood).

137
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:49,819
(Why isn't it here?)

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,399
(This isn't Lin Xia's body.)

139
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:55,620
(No.)

140
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,839
(How is this possible?)

141
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,100
(I'd recognize her)

142
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,040
(even if she turned to ashes.)

143
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,839
(It's definitely Lin Xia.)

144
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,180
(The injuries around the eyes)

145
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,319
(were all my doing.)

146
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,040
(But this body...)

147
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,360
Mr. Ye?

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,519
Mr. Ye,

149
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,500
what's wrong?

150
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,040
Nothing.

151
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,480
By the way,

152
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,360
where did you

153
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,600
find her body?

154
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,199
In the river by a fisherman.

155
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,439
If everything checks out,

156
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,480
please sign here.

157
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,360
No problem.

158
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,240
Don't sign!

159
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,480
Mr. Ye,

160
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,519
our apologies.

161
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,339
Internal procedures aren't complete,

162
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,480
so can't claim the body now.

163
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,000
Fine.

164
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:53,639
Contact me anytime

165
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,759
when you're ready.

166
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,639
Master,

167
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,079
Ye Dong realized Lin Xia isn't Lin Xia.

168
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Watch them

169
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,160
around the clock.

170
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,439
This case

171
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,139
will close soon.

172
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

173
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
What's going on?

174
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,000
The face is Lin Xia's,

175
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,439
but the body isn't.

176
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,959
Impossible!

177
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,120
Dong,

178
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,399
maybe the body is Lin Xia's.

179
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,799
Could you be mistaken?

180
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,740
She was my wife.

181
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,919
How could I forget her body?

182
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,960
This is not Lin Xia!

183
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,720
That's bizarre.

184
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,200
Unless

185
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,139
this body consumed Lin Xia's body,

186
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,559
leaving only her face?

187
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,679
Are we writing a horror novel?

188
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,039
Bai Cha is Lin Xia.

189
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,679
Bai Cha is Lin Xia?

190
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,039
No way.

191
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,019
If Bai Cha were Lin Xia,

192
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,960
she'd have killed for revenge.

193
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,399
But this body

194
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,120
isn't Bai Cha's either.

195
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,159
Lin Xia didn't swap faces with Bai Cha.

196
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,179
We need verification to be certain.

197
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,960
Why do you keep

198
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,559
staring at me today?

199
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,799
You look beautiful when working.

200
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,519
I never imagined

201
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,220
that one day

202
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,139
you'd become Jiuyao Group's CEO.

203
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,019
I never imagined

204
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,120
you, timid and submissive before,

205
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,399
would become Jiuyao's chairman.

206
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,960
Do you remember?

207
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,960
When we first met,

208
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,840
you wore

209
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,059
a red silk dress

210
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
on the DJ platform,

211
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,879
captivating everyone.

212
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,080
Seems

213
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,259
you don't care

214
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,879
about our past at all.

215
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,600
When we first met,

216
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,039
I was

217
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,440
in purple, not red.

218
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,419
Right.

219
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,320
My favorite is red,

220
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,440
yours is purple.

221
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,559
(He indeed)

222
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,480
(recognized that body wasn't me.)

223
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,879
I've always

224
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,759
wanted to see you in red,

225
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,960
but you never fulfilled that wish.

226
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,480
So now,

227
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,399
will you grant me this once?

228
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,639
After we marry,

229
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,159
I'll give you

230
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,559
whatever you want.

231
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,240
No.

232
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,559
I can't wait.

233
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,960
Come with me.

234
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,440
Where to?

235
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,840
You'll see soon.

236
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,500
I want to hear your signature song.

237
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,960
Haven't played for years,

238
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,139
my skills are rusty.

239
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,279
Some talents

240
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
are ingrained in your bones.

241
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,960
I believe

242
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,600
you couldn't have forgotten.

243
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,759
What?

244
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,440
Have you forgotten who you were?

245
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,159
Since you're so eager,

246
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,019
then

247
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,179
as you wish.

248
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,240
(Luckily, Cheng Nuo was thorough,)

249
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,159
(or I'd have been exposed.)

250
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,320
Remember

251
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,200
what this tattoo means?

252
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:17,840
(It means)

253
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,360
(needing to be loved.)

254
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,600
Don't move.

255
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,039
But now

256
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,200
I don't need love anymore.

257
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,120
(Cheng Nuo replicated Bai Cha's marks)

258
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,200
(on me and erased mine.)

259
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,019
Mr. Ye,

260
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,379
have some self-respect.

261
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,519
Also,

262
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,600
our little game

263
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,679
should have ended long ago.

264
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,440
Let's get married.

265
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,539
Did you ask your mother?

266
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,559
Our relationship

267
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,799
is none of her concern.

268
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,259
Pitifully,

269
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,320
Ye Dong,

270
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,240
without her approval,

271
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,919
you're not even qualified as a person.

272
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,580
Your backbone is too weak

273
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,720
to bear a husband's responsibilities.
