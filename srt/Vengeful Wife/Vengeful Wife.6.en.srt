2
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,680
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,679
Sirs,

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,079
you...

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,904
(Ye Dong, new CEO of Jiuyao Group
is a Live-in Son-in-Law)

6
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,280
Mr. Cheng,

7
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,180
Mr. Ye Dong is asking to see you.

8
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,299
(He has been so moody lately.)

9
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,640
(That look in his eyes)

10
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,719
(scared me to death.)

11
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,379
Should

12
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,459
I send him in?

13
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,980
Show Mr. Ye in.

14
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,379
Right away.

15
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:44,859
Hello.

16
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:46,099
Mr. Cheng will see you now.

17
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:50,260
Wait here.

18
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,099
Have a seat.

19
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Ye Dong,

20
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,379
what brings you here?

21
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,340
What a wonderful surprise!

22
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:15,900
When I passed by earlier,

23
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,500
the sign read Cheng Nuo.

24
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:18,780
My gut told me

25
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,699
it is you,

26
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,939
so I dropped in.

27
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,699
You...

28
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,500
I must admit,

29
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,379
your gut is sharp.

30
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,099
I just saw the news

31
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,060
that

32
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,699
you're taking over Jiuyao Group.

33
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,020
Who would've thought?

34
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,699
You're the Lin family's son-in-law!

35
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,979
Your good fortune

36
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,580
makes me jealous.

37
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,740
Are you mocking me too?

38
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,740
Not at all.

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,780
You really

40
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,699
make me jealous.

41
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,020
You'll be a father.

42
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:49,500
How are your wife and child?

43
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,460
What's wrong?

44
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,020
Bai Cha fell off

45
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,020
a cliff recently.

46
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,060
She survived,

47
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:06,979
but the child

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,300
didn't...

49
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,379
What?

50
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:11,900
How could this happen?

51
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,180
Let me tell you,

52
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,479
I wish it had been me instead.

53
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:20,740
Cheng Nuo,

54
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,379
don't you dare think that way.

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,219
You're both

56
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,340
still young.

57
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,020
You can have another child.

58
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,340
I'll never

59
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:33,900
have another child.

60
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:35,939
One wife,

61
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,240
one child. That's all.

62
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:42,500
Wait.

63
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,020
How did you know about the child?

64
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,939
I never mentioned it.

65
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,419
Lin Xia told me.

66
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,139
Women talk about everything

67
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:03,060
among themselves.

68
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,620
That explains it.

69
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,460
Right.

70
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,259
For a moment there,

71
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,819
I almost

72
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,860
suspected something going on

73
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,019
between you and Bai Cha.

74
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,180
Now,

75
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,300
don't spread nonsense.

76
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,980
Bai Cha

77
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,259
wouldn't appreciate it.

78
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,180
And if Lin Xia found out,

79
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,139
she'd run wild beyond control.

80
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:31,660
Just joking with you.

81
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,660
No need to panic.

82
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:34,339
Let me make this clear.

83
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,300
I trust Bai Cha completely.

84
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:38,100
She loves me deeply,

85
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:40,899
and since we got together,

86
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:44,879
she's never betrayed me.

87
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,579
What?

88
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:55,699
Nothing.

89
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,779
Just think

90
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,779
her devotion to you

91
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:02,420
is truly admirable.

92
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,459
Absolutely.

93
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,379
You don't know
how we cherish each other.

94
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:09,019
How to put it...

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,920
Our love

96
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,759
is earth-shatteringly intense.

97
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,180
Let me spell it out.

98
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:18,339
If anything happened to her,

99
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,300
I'd trade my life

100
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:22,220
for hers in a heartbeat.

101
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,459
Never imagined

102
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,420
you'd be such a rare man.

103
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:28,019
By the way,

104
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,180
how's

105
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:31,579
her recovery?

106
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:32,939
Which hospital?

107
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,899
I want to visit her with Lin Xia.

108
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,000
She's in...

109
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:40,959
She's in...

110
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:44,060
Never mind.

111
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,779
By the way.

112
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,220
I heard

113
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,420
Lin Xia was in a car accident

114
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,819
and lost her eyesight.

115
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,899
As patients,

116
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,279
what could they talk about?

117
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,100
Comparing

118
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:57,779
their medical conditions?

119
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:03,060
You and I

120
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,100
are brothers in misery now.

121
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:07,139
But since Bai Cha's hospitalized,

122
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,300
we should at least visit.

123
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,819
Right?

124
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,579
I appreciate it.

125
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,620
What she needs most right now

126
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,540
is peace and quiet to recover.

127
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,779
When she's better,

128
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,180
I'll take her

129
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,420
to meet both of you.

130
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:24,300
Okay.

131
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:25,740
It's settled then.

132
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:27,620
I'll let you get back to it.

133
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,860
Meet another day.

134
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,339
I won't walk you out.

135
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,579
Tied up with a surgery.

136
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,100
No need

137
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,779
for formalities.

138
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,819
I'll head out.

139
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,579
Cheng Nuo,

140
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,220
about the child,

141
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:50,779
it's truly heartbreaking.

142
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,074
(Ye Dong)

143
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,339
Bai Cha,

144
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,259
in this lifetime,

145
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:52,379
you'll never escape my grasp.

146
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,420
Mom,

147
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:58,779
what's going on?

148
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:00,579
This isn't my fault.

149
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,819
She had to

150
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,860
run around

151
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:04,139
and slipped herself.

152
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,259
There's a board meeting tomorrow.

153
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,100
If any complications arise,

154
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,339
it'll ruin my plans.

155
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,139
Rest assured.

156
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,500
Just a minor issue.

157
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
She passed out.

158
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,740
She'll wake up soon.

159
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:17,779
Dong,

160
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,220
bad news.

161
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,060
Go on.

162
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,100
Currently,

163
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,420
someone's spreading rumors

164
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:26,480
using the case,

165
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,560
calling you unworthy.

166
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,579
Jiuyao Group's stock

167
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,439
keeps plummeting.

168
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,460
This poses serious risks to

169
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,700
your inauguration.

170
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,419
If I ever find out

171
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,200
who stabbed me in the back,

172
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,440
I'll make sure they regret being born.

173
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,019
I clearly changed your fate already.

174
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,700
How could this still happen?

175
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,940
I understand now.

176
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,259
Lin Yuanshan

177
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,259
is still clinging to life.

178
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,779
Only by eliminating him

179
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,620
will your prosperous destiny manifest.

180
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,700
So he must die.

181
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:02,419
Must die.

182
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,220
Dong,

183
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:10,659
what should we do now?

184
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,740
Use the group's authority

185
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,460
to make the police clarify it.

186
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,259
Notify the legal department

187
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,399
to sue all rumor-spreading

188
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,139
social platforms and official accounts.

189
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,179
Understood.

190
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:23,059
But

191
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:24,240
I suggest

192
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,019
we find the original victim

193
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,600
and have him clarify in person.

194
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:28,740
So the impact

195
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,100
would be stronger.

196
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,220
I see.

197
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,500
Handle that first.

198
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:33,899
Alright.

199
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:57,620
Want to try something exciting?

200
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,059
What do you mean?

201
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,720
Come to my place right now.

202
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,620
It's so late.

203
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,460
Not a good idea.

204
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,539
In 20 minutes,

205
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,539
if you aren't here,

206
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,220
bear the consequences.

207
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:41,460
(Although Ye Dong has ulterior motives,)

208
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:42,980
(for my future,)

209
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:45,179
(I have to side with him now.)

210
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:46,299
I can see now.

211
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,340
I can see again.

212
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:57,820
Honey.

213
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,539
If Ye Dong finds out

214
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:08,299
I can see again,

215
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:09,740
he'll be overjoyed.

216
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,460
Honey.

217
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,960
Only when you're dead

218
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,080
will my son

219
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,600
truly claim your destiny.

220
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,039
Once he achieves his goal,

221
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,679
I'll send your daughter

222
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,919
to keep you company.

223
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't thank me.

224
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,919
I despise lucky people like you.

225
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,279
Honey.

226
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,080
This is your wife's bedroom?

227
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,600
This isn't appropriate.

228
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,320
Relax.

229
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,399
Makes it more exciting.

230
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,720
She was just sleeping here.

231
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,320
Where is she?

232
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,379
(Call the police.)

233
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,980
(Call the police now.)

234
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,500
Your wife is coming.

235
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,320
She's blind.

236
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,600
Can't see anything.
