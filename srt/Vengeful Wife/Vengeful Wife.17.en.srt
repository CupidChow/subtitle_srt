3
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,500
Yufei,

4
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,619
there's something

5
00:00:58,899 --> 00:00:59,979
I need your help.

6
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,420
Dong,

7
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,219
as your woman,

8
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,180
I'll do anything you ask.

9
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,900
I want you

10
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:11,099
to seduce someone.

11
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,239
Dong,

12
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,900
what do you mean by this?

13
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:16,540
Hmm?

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,780
You refuse?

15
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:22,700
I could do it,

16
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,060
but

17
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:25,700
you know

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,459
my heart belongs only to you.

19
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,420
Once it's done,

20
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,879
you'll get your reward.

21
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,959
If you put it that way,

22
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,079
I take offense.

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,739
I need no rewards

24
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,000
to help you.

25
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,540
I just want a small place

26
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,659
in your heart.

27
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:47,900
Here's

28
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,579
Cheng Nuo's profile.

29
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,200
Make him betray Bai Cha.

30
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:58,019
Expose his true color to her.

31
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,099
Don't worry.

32
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,500
When I make my move,

33
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,780
no man can resist.

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,540
I'll have him wrapped around my finger

35
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,099
and be obedient completely.

36
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,400
Really?

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,379
I look forward to it.

38
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:16,900
But for now...

39
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:18,919
Dong,

40
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,900
let me

41
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,020
take good care of you.

42
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,120
Who...

43
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,199
Who are you?

44
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:42,659
I've missed you so much.

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,400
Let me take a good look at you.

46
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,860
I was terrified!

47
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:50,580
Great you're safe.

48
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,020
That's great.

49
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,780
Mom,

50
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,180
what brings you here?

51
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,500
Trying to worry me to death?

52
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:01,659
Bai Cha went through such trauma,

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,460
yet you didn't tell me.

54
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,340
Mom,

55
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,979
how did you find out?

56
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,139
If Mr. Luo hadn't

57
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,099
called me,

58
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,460
I wouldn't know about her fall

59
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,379
or the miscarriage.

60
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:17,500
Bai Cha,

61
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
you've suffered so much.

62
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,379
It's Cheng Nuo's fault.

63
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,099
He failed to protect you.

64
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:25,300
Mom,

65
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,479
I'm fine.

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,520
See?

67
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:28,819
I'm perfectly healthy.

68
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:31,979
Falling from that height

69
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,860
must've left some damage!

70
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,180
Mom,

71
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,780
are you planning

72
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,379
to stay long?

73
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,419
Absolutely.

74
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,699
Bone injuries need three months to heal.

75
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,139
We'll both

76
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,099
look after Bai Cha

77
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,460
during this period.

78
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,300
Understand?

79
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,500
Understood.

80
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,259
Thanks, Mom.

81
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:53,659
No need.

82
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:55,900
Silly girl.

83
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,819
I just have

84
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:58,979
one request for you.

85
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:00,300
What is it?

86
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,419
Don't treat me as a stranger.

87
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,099
If you're hurting,

88
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,139
sad,

89
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:07,979
or scared,

90
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,539
tell me everything.

91
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,979
If the sky falls,

92
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,300
I'll hold it up for you.

93
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,060
Hear me?

94
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,480
Good girl.

95
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,819
This is

96
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:24,180
my life savings.

97
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,300
Take it.

98
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,740
Buy whatever you need.

99
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,160
I can't accept this.

100
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,259
I told you

101
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,860
not to treat me as a stranger.

102
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,199
There's not much in this account.

103
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,579
Just take it as a token of affection.

104
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,019
Accept it.

105
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,220
Then...

106
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,980
Then just take it.

107
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,500
Alright.

108
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:44,639
I see.

109
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:51,579
Why

110
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:53,379
are you crying again?

111
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,300
Nothing.

112
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,740
She must be

113
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:57,980
made of water.

114
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:02,500
Cheng Nuo,

115
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,019
do you bully her often?

116
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,540
Why is she so upset?

117
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,899
There, there.

118
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,540
Alright.

119
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,180
Stop crying now.

120
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,319
No more tears.

121
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:12,800
There, there.

122
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,680
No more crying.

123
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,259
Master,

124
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,540
Lin Xia's autopsy report.

125
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:23,860
Okay.

126
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,100
Primary cause of death was asphyxiation.

127
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,699
Irregular burn marks around the eyes

128
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,160
and other injuries on the body.

129
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:33,160
No foreign object in the airway.

130
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,339
No fluid in the lungs.

131
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,379
So she died before drowning.

132
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:39,259
Master,

133
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,139
Lin Xia was murdered.

134
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:42,160
The killer

135
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,860
is likely

136
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,220
the mastermind behind all this.

137
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,000
I strongly recommend

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,480
a full investigation on Ye Dong.

139
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,540
Master,

140
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,319
it must be Ye Dong.

141
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,899
Should we arrest him now?

142
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,139
Without concrete evidence,

143
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,420
requesting a warrant

144
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:58,899
would only alert our suspect.

145
00:05:59,279 --> 00:05:59,839
Moreover,

146
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:01,500
he's currently the city's

147
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,339
commercial councilor

148
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,939
and close with the Speaker.

149
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:05,139
Hard to deal

150
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,100
with him.

151
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:12,699
This is

152
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,920
a cunning serpent

153
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,519
entrenching at the highest level.

154
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,360
We get only one shot.

155
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:20,300
We must

156
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,160
strike decisively.

157
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,259
Otherwise,

158
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:23,740
endless trouble!

159
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:35,459
Sir,

160
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:36,319
help me.

161
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,259
Someone's after me.

162
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,100
How?

163
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,939
Where is she?

164
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:49,860
Over there.

165
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,459
They've left.

166
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:58,740
Wait a bit longer.

167
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:00,399
My legs are weak. I'm scared.

168
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,779
Wait until they

169
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,579
get further away.

170
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,300
That was terrifying.

171
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,680
Good thing you were here.

172
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:17,639
Thank you.

173
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:18,639
No trouble at all.

174
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,439
Goodbye.

175
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,819
What's wrong?

176
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,100
Something else?

177
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:25,620
I'm feeling

178
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,060
so unsettled right now.

179
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,660
I need someone to stay with me.

180
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,180
Will you listen to me?

181
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:31,980
Sorry,

182
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,139
I'm busy.

183
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm the CFO of Jiuyao Group.

184
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,139
My name

185
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:41,980
is Qin Yufei.

186
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:44,220
(Knowing who I am,)

187
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,720
(he'll try to cozy up now.)

188
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
(You rascal.)

189
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,480
(Playing hard to get.)

190
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,939
True.

191
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,500
Late at night,

192
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,259
a beauty like you

193
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:54,899
shouldn't be out alone.

194
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:57,500
After reconsidering,

195
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,360
I'll stay with you.

196
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,699
Let's hear your story.

197
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,860
If you want my story,

198
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,420
buy me a drink.

199
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,699
Deal?

200
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:09,939
Deal.

201
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:11,660
Let's go to

202
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,100
somewhere private.

203
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,220
This wine smells nice.

204
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,419
This is more than enough to drink.

205
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:57,620
Bring the bottle over.

206
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,539
Today, let's drink

207
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,460
until we're drunk!

208
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,700
Okay.

209
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:22,620
To the beauty!

210
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,799
Cheers!

211
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,500
Cheers!

212
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,659
What can I do?

213
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,620
You are

214
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,799
Mrs. Cheng, right?

215
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,299
I'm

216
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:56,820
a friend of Cheng Nuo and Bai Cha.

217
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,779
I'm Ye Dong.

218
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,700
Hello.

219
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,620
Please come in.

220
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,019
Cheng Nuo isn't back yet.

221
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:02,860
Bai Cha is home.

222
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:03,419
Alright.

223
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:04,580
Have a seat.

224
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,460
Bai Cha,

225
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,460
Ye Dong is here.

226
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:14,980
Mom.

227
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,580
Go ahead and chat.

228
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:23,740
I'll get you some fruit.

229
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:24,340
Okay.

230
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:25,019
Thank you.

231
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:34,659
What?

232
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:35,100
Let go!

233
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,379
Don't you miss me at all?

234
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,500
No.

235
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:44,379
You're not welcome here.

236
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:45,179
Get out now!

237
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,340
Let go!

238
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,860
Let...

239
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,340
You better behave.

240
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,720
If Mrs. Cheng sees this,

241
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:09,700
it won't end well.

242
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:11,740
Let go!

243
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,379
What do you want?

244
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,740
I missed you

245
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,460
so much that I can't eat or sleep.

246
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,899
What do you think I want?

247
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,200
Ye Dong,

248
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:36,820
let go!

249
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,139
Let me go.

250
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:47,860
You're a lunatic.

251
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,039
You're a madman.

252
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,360
Bai Cha,

253
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,360
the fruit is almost ready.

254
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,679
Take care of Ye Dong.

255
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,340
Alright.

256
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,740
Mom,

257
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,980
I will.

258
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:05,179
I'm begging you.

259
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:06,379
Don't let her see this.

260
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,320
Be reasonable!

261
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,059
Beg me.

262
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:19,220
I'm begging you.

263
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,000
Go.

264
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,179
Where?

265
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:30,500
I'll take you

266
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,460
to watch a good show.

267
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,399
Let's go.

268
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,759
The fruit's ready.

269
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,919
