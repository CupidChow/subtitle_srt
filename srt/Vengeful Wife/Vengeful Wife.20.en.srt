00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:47,629
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:50,039
Master,

4
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,100
breaking news.

5
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,539
Ye Dong took Bai Cha away and settled
her in the old house of Lin family.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,420
After Lin Xia's incident,

7
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,659
Ye Dong moved out soon.

8
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,299
This time, he actually put

9
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,159
his new lover

10
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,700
in his ex-wife's home.

11
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,299
This is unexpected.

12
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:09,719
She might not be a new lover.

13
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,819
According to inside sources of Jiuyao,

14
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:15,159
Ye Dong will reveal
the candidate for CEO

15
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,299
at press briefing tomorrow.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,239
Is he seriously making Bai Cha

17
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,939
the CEO of Jiuyao Group?

18
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,140
Bai Cha?

19
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,659
Mom.

20
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,099
Mom. Why are you still awake so late?

21
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:53,540
Mom,

22
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:54,739
what's wrong?

23
00:01:59,540 --> 00:01:59,939
Mom.

24
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,140
Still remember I'm your mother?

25
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:03,140
No,

26
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:05,459
you're my mother.

27
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:06,980
I should honor you.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,219
I should worry about you.

29
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,000
Mom,

30
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,539
why are you saying these?

31
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:15,340
Are you a demon?

32
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,740
Today, Bai Cha

33
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,340
was taken by someone

34
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,139
named Ye Dong.

35
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,259
I can see

36
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:23,840
something is on her mind.

37
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:26,819
She looked distressed and sad.

38
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,419
She said everyone around her is a demon.

39
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,919
Doesn't that mean you?

40
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,479
Be honest with me.

41
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,060
What outrageous things have you done?

42
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:42,080
You...

43
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:42,879
You...

44
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:44,539
You...

45
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,699
You won't say, huh?

46
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,219
You brat,

47
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,860
just admit it.

48
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,419
Mom,

49
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:50,259
what are you doing?

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,819
Cheng Nuo,

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,620
no matter what you've done,

52
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,860
be honest

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,539
and explain it to me.

54
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:00,539
Make amends where it's needed,

55
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:03,219
and make up for what's lost.

56
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,139
If you are wrong,

57
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:06,139
you must admit it.

58
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,580
I believe

59
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,259
you're not an irredeemable person.

60
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,699
Mom,

61
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,860
please don't worry.

62
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,500
If I don't, who will?

63
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,300
Bai Cha has no parents.

64
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:19,900
As her mother-in-law,

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm her guardian.

66
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,180
Want me to stay out of it?

67
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,360
Unless you stop being my son.

68
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,939
She got pregnant for you

69
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,240
and had a miscarriage,

70
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,939
yet you betrayed her.

71
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,900
Last night, you didn't come home.

72
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,199
Are you...

73
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,139
You,

74
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:46,580
you!

75
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,319
Mom.

76
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,740
You brat,

77
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,319
admit it.

78
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:50,639
Mom.

79
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,280
Admit it.

80
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,300
Admit you're wrong!

81
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:56,180
Mom,

82
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,020
I wronged Bai Cha.

83
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,460
I wronged our child.

84
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:05,979
Cheng Nuo,

85
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,379
no matter what you've done,

86
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,259
I have only one request.

87
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,500
Now,

88
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,560
make amends with her

89
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,939
and bring her back.

90
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:16,660
Mom,

91
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:21,740
Bai Cha

92
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,060
will never come back.

93
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,139
The real Bai Cha

94
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,319
was dead

95
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:11,959
when she

96
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,779
fell off the cliff.

97
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,379
She's dead?

98
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,339
Don't talk nonsense!

99
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,339
That's...

100
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,040
That is

101
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:22,899
Lin Xia.

102
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,660
What Lin Xia?

103
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,579
How is this possible?

104
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:27,899
But she clearly is...

105
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:28,379
Mom.

106
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,100
Mom,

107
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,620
listen to me.

108
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:15,740
Lin Xia

109
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:17,779
hates Ye Dong so much.

110
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,339
She assumed Bai Cha's identity

111
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,180
to start anew

112
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,899
and reclaim what belongs to her.

113
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,860
What a pitiful girl!

114
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,540
And my poor daughter-in-law,

115
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,220
Bai Cha.

116
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,060
Both are victims of demon Ye Dong.

117
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:39,259
Cheng Nuo.

118
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,540
Let's call the police now.

119
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,740
Have that demon arrested.

120
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:44,620
Mom,

121
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,620
I have my own plans.

122
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,740
I kept it from you

123
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,139
for your own safety.

124
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,300
Cheng Nuo.

125
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,420
I understand your difficulties.

126
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:54,939
I won't interfere.

127
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:56,100
But

128
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,980
promise me one thing.

129
00:06:58,939 --> 00:06:59,459
Tell me,

130
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:00,139
Mom.

131
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:04,220
Protect yourselves,

132
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:06,740
especially Lin Xia.

133
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,160
She's suffered enough in this life.

134
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:11,860
I understand.

135
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,339
(From now on,)

136
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,379
(you are no longer Lin Xia.)

137
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:32,139
(You are Bai Cha.)

138
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,980
(All of this)

139
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,680
(is Ye Dong's fault.)

140
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,120
(Ye Dong,)

141
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,879
(I will reclaim everything)

142
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,220
(I've lost.)

143
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,279
You saved me.

144
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,540
Everyone thinks

145
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,100
Bai Cha

146
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,779
was merely injured.

147
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,300
But she died
when she fell off the cliff.

148
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:05,980
It's Ye Dong's fault.

149
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:08,939
I imagine you hate Ye Dong

150
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:11,139
no less than I do.

151
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:16,699
I want him to face proper judgment.

152
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,899
I'll reclaim what's rightfully mine.

153
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,540
I can help you,

154
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
but I have one condition.

155
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:28,379
What is it?

156
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,720
I can help you reclaim

157
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,700
everything you've lost,

158
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,740
but you must promise me

159
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,659
to follow my plan exactly.

160
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,580
What plan?

161
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,440
Now that your face is disfigured

162
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,019
and you're wanted everywhere,

163
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:48,860
you should

164
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,620
assume Bai Cha's identity

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,480
and return to Ye Dong.

166
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,860
Have you been monitoring him all along?

167
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,779
Yes.

168
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,139
Then my father's death...

169
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:01,740
Your father...

170
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,179
I discovered his death

171
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,220
when I tracked them dumping the body.

172
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,460
At that time,

173
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,500
I tried to save you,

174
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,820
but failed.

175
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,220
Lin Na's death

176
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,899
was also an accident.

177
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:24,440
Why didn't you call the police earlier?

178
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,620
If you called the police,

179
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,639
Na wouldn't have died.

180
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,820
I considered doing so,

181
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:29,820
but do you know

182
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,500
Man City has no death penalty?

183
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,740
I want that bad guy

184
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:38,519
to pay for his crimes

185
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,220
with his life.

186
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:57,000
Hello.

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
Why didn't you pick up earlier?

188
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,259
Miss me so much

189
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,299
that you fell asleep?

190
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,500
Guess.

191
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,500
I just finished the group meeting.

192
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:08,919
Everything's arranged.

193
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,259
Your appointment as CEO tomorrow

194
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,799
is a done deal.

195
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,500
I'm coming to celebrate

196
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,639
with you now.

197
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,620
If you come,

198
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,100
I'll leave.

199
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:21,659
Hang up.

200
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,500
Bai Cha,

201
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,460
you're becoming more fascinating.

202
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,379
Playing hard to get

203
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,240
makes me crave you more.

204
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,580
Dong,

205
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,600
women understand women best.

206
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,159
The more you flatter her,

207
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,460
the more arrogant she becomes.

208
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:03,759
Exactly.

209
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,659
The one I carve for eludes me.

210
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,379
The one I push away still stays.

211
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,320
Just like you.

212
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,799
I won't

213
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,940
leave even if driven away.

214
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,179
I'll stick to you.

215
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,500
You're wearing new perfume.

216
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,279
This scent

217
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,960
is so alluring.

218
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,019
Right.

219
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,080
I'll dress up for those who love me.

220
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:28,340
Dong,

221
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,720
love me.

222
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:36,019
(Cheng Nuo made the perfume for you.)

223
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,799
