00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,680
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:01,320
Don't get closer.

4
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,719
No.

5
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,359
Ye Dong.

6
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,400
What are you up to?

7
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,340
You almost scared me to death.

8
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:18,900
I just had a hallucination.

9
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,140
I thought I saw Lin Xia.

10
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,239
You've done so many shady things.

11
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,620
It's so late.

12
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,900
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:37,819
I wanted to see you.

14
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,980
You've seen me.

15
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:39,980
You can leave now.

16
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:05,340
Do you

17
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,819
not miss me at all?

18
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:11,900
No.

19
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,060
Ye Dong,

20
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,919
you destroyed my family

21
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:18,620
and want me to miss you?

22
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,259
Yes.

23
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:26,620
I did use some tricks.

24
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,060
But I helped you

25
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,620
see Cheng Nuo's true color.

26
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,139
So we

27
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,900
can forgive each other.

28
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,099
No.

29
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,699
Let go of me.

30
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:52,599
Ye Dong,

31
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:53,780
let go of me.

32
00:02:58,979 --> 00:02:59,939
No.

33
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,780
Let go of me.

34
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,379
Ye Dong.

35
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,460
You've changed.

36
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:24,240
In the past,

37
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,199
even if you refused,

38
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:28,360
when I forced you,

39
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,139
you'd fight till the end.

40
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,900
But now,

41
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,860
you seem so indifferent.

42
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,599
People

43
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,039
do change.

44
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,900
You can't live in the past forever.

45
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,159
You aren't in a good state today.

46
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,939
Why not

47
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,979
go out first?

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,300
Lately,

49
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
I've been a bit tired.

50
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,099
Take a good rest.

51
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:09,539
Tomorrow,

52
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,659
I'll pick you up.

53
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,259
Mom,

54
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:47,939
don't eavesdrop.

55
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,259
If you're so curious,

56
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,699
go in and listen.

57
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,100
Follow me.

58
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,240
(This scent)

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,279
(can tap into people's
subconscious fears.)

60
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,300
(Be careful.)

61
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,420
(I don't have any emotions,)

62
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,740
(including fear.)

63
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,819
You're a famous entrepreneur now.

64
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,300
Why did you grovel before a woman?

65
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,139
There's no woman you can't get now.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,079
Bai Cha is different.

67
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:51,899
Her heart

68
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,000
has never truly belonged to me.

69
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,720
I must conquer her.

70
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,420
That's more thrilling than anything.

71
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,019
Look at how pathetic you are.

72
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,360
As your mother,

73
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,240
I have plenty of ways to deal with her.

74
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,019
What ways?

75
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,420
Stop messing around.

76
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,860
Ms. Lin, how does it feel

77
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,300
to return to Jiuyao?

78
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,079
Mr. Luo,

79
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,352
what brings you here?

80
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:41,199
Just now,

81
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:41,920
you called me?

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,120
It's Bai Cha.

83
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,980
I only saw your back

84
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,220
and made a mistake.

85
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,300
Then,

86
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,000
Ms. Lin you mentioned was...

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,819
Jiuyao's former chairman

88
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:53,500
and CEO,

89
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,480
Lin Xia.

90
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,680
You look different,

91
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,959
but everything else

92
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,220
feels the same.

93
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,800
From your tone,

94
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,079
you seem to be quite familiar

95
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,100
with Lin Xia.

96
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,480
Right.

97
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,600
I even personally

98
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,480
examined her body.

99
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,139
Mr. Luo,

100
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,220
what do you mean?

101
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,199
They said

102
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,519
Lin Xia is at large.

103
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,899
What are you...

104
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:22,920
Oh! This is bad!

105
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,720
Why

106
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,680
did I blurt that out?

107
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,040
Remember,

108
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,920
keep this secret.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,500
By the way,

110
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,019
I heard today

111
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,399
you'll take over as CEO.

112
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,579
Lin Xia used

113
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:37,000
to be Jiuyao's CEO.

114
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,120
You two do

115
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,519
have a special bond.

116
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,680
Mr. Luo,

117
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:43,860
I have urgent business.

118
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:44,800
I'll get going.

119
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,540
Okay.

120
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:57,879
(Mr. Luo suspects my identity.)

121
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:08,800
(CEO Appointment Letter)

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,560
Ms. Bai,

123
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,639
we heard you were a hostess in clubs.

124
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:12,459
How

125
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,680
did you become

126
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,399
a renowned group's CEO step by step?

127
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,259
Hello,

128
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,519
this reporter.

129
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,639
First,

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,439
let me correct one thing.

131
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,540
I worked as nightclub DJ,

132
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,420
not hostess.

133
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,639
Moreover,

134
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,620
I studied business management theories

135
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,620
and got the certificates

136
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,740
through hard work.

137
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,039
Everyone,

138
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,139
today

139
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,200
I have another announcement to make.

140
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,580
Ye Dong, Jiuyao Group's

141
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,759
chairman,

142
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,159
has decided

143
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,539
to transfer ten percent of his shares

144
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,679
to me

145
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,360
as encouragement.

146
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,679
Here,

147
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,179
I want to express gratitude

148
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,799
to Ye Dong.

149
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,820
Mr. Ye,

150
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,440
are you giving Ms. Bai so many shares

151
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,679
because you fancy her?

152
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,879
My heart has always belonged

153
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,539
to my ex-wife Lin Xia alone,

154
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,620
though she...

155
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,580
The shares transfer to Ms. Bai

156
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,320
is a recognition of her business acumen.

157
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,080
I hope Ms. Bai will

158
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,220
contribute to our group's success

159
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,880
and achieve win-win cooperation.

160
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,019
Alright,

161
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,419
today's press conference

162
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:27,100
concludes here.

163
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,240
Thank you all.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,100
Transfer ten percent...

165
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,120
Ten percent of his shares!

166
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,759
That's astronomical wealth.

167
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,759
He's so generous.

168
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,240
Don't judge him by normal standards.

169
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,460
Qiao,

170
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,000
run a DNA comparison

171
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,379
between this hair

172
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,379
and Bai Cha's

173
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:46,120
blood sample

174
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,940
from the crime scene.

175
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,059
I need results as soon as possible.

176
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,279
Whose hair is this?

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,679
Bai Cha's.

178
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,440
Master,

179
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,639
what's this about?

180
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,559
We have her blood sample.

181
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,639
Her hair

182
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,539
will be redundant.

183
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,659
No more questions.

184
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:03,639
Also,

185
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,860
compare this hair's DNA

186
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,320
with that

187
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,879
of Lin Xia's body.

188
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,440
Bai Cha and Lin Xia?

189
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:12,919
That's impossible!

190
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,820
What are you trying to prove?

191
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
I can't follow your logic.

192
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,019
It hurts.

193
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,019
It hurts?

194
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,840
You've lost your mind.

195
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,299
Daring to spout

196
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,120
nonsense

197
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,100
before the media.

198
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,120
Ten percent of my shares?

199
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,139
Why don't you just rob?

200
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,559
The shares are under your name.

201
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,240
If you refuse to transfer, then don't.

202
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,779
Or

203
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,779
are you going to go

204
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,340
back on your word?

205
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,340
Do you realize you're

206
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:51,340
slandering and ruining me?

207
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,039
I wonder how you

208
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,820
managed to sweet talk Lin Xia

209
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:00,779
into transferring all her shares to you.

210
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,580
She gave you everything

211
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,559
as she loved you so much.

212
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,720
But I'm

213
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,799
asking for ten percent from you,

214
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,519
less than one-fifth of what you get.

215
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,279
You are so furious now.

216
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:19,879
Ye Dong.

217
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,840
Did you obtain your position

218
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,779
