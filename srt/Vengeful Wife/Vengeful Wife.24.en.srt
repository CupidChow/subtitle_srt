00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,680
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,500
Someone will come over here.

4
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,000
It's fine.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,859
Come on, baby.

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,540
No.

7
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,920
If Dong finds out,

8
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:09,219
he'll kill us.

9
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:10,760
If we both keep quiet,

10
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,120
how would he know?

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,760
He focuses on her mom at the hospital,

12
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,260
barely managing the company.

13
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:17,819
Has no time to check on us.

14
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:18,640
Let's do it.

15
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:20,739
This isn't sustainable for us.

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,620
Working for him keeps us shackled.

17
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:24,079
We're living like pets.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,700
He takes his anger out on us.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,480
Stop talking.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,680
Your words make me furious.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,180
Come on.

22
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,976
There's an investment fund.

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,659
If you can get Dong's seal,

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,040
we'll take the money and disappear,

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,319
living carefree.

26
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,420
Better than

27
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,599
being his lapdog forever.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,819
You're saying

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,400
we just need to get the seal?

30
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:41,959
Right.

31
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,900
I know where his seal is.

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,319
It's in the safe.

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,620
And I know the code.

34
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,640
I'll get it.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,700
Perfect.

36
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,640
As long as you get that seal,

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,620
I'll give you

38
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,659
whatever you want.

39
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:53,159
Really?

40
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,140
Want me to approve East Suburb project?

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,520
Forget about it!

42
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,580
Kuntai,

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,199
if you refuse to sign,

44
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:13,699
don't you fear angering Mr. Ye?

45
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:15,599
What if I anger him?

46
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,300
He can't touch me.

47
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:18,960
At Jiuyao,

48
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,520
he holds absolute power,

49
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,180
but

50
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,580
the East Suburb project

51
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,699
is completely under my control.

52
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,860
You want a piece of this cake?

53
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,020
Not a chance.

54
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,020
But

55
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,419
you're a Jiuyao shareholder.

56
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,199
The East Suburb project

57
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,219
is crucial to our strategic plan.

58
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,419
Your refusal to sign

59
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,080
only hurts your interests.

60
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,020
So what?

61
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:42,080
I can afford it.

62
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,900
I simply

63
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,379
can't stand

64
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,659
you hypocrites.

65
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,400
So

66
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,159
you seem to hold

67
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,439
a grudge against Mr. Ye?

68
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,520
Heaven sees what people do.

69
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,360
Don't think you can control everything.

70
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,960
One day,

71
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,520
your evil deeds will be exposed.

72
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,039
Let me remind you.

73
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,419
I've rescued An Dong

74
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,199
and what he's provided

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
will cause you

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,979
problems.

77
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:14,280
You found Mr. An?

78
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,979
What do you want?

79
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,280
We can negotiate.

80
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,159
Negotiate?

81
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,979
Negotiate with the police!

82
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,740
Mr. Kuntai,

83
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,439
I'm Lin Xia.

84
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,400
Ms. Bai,

85
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,639
have you lost your mind?

86
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,719
Lin Xia was probably killed by you.

87
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,520
What?

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,139
Now you're impersonating her?

89
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,060
Mr. Kuntai,

90
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:48,020
your right leg

91
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:50,000
has severe rheumatism.

92
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,939
When the weather changes,

93
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,419
the pain is unbearable.

94
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,280
You've researched me well.

95
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,080
What?

96
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,960
Coming after me now?

97
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,460
You have this condition,

98
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,240
because 30 years ago,

99
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,860
you saved me from the icy river.

100
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,719
Back then,

101
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,000
your right leg

102
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,419
were suffering from severe rheumatism.

103
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,459
Then it got cut by ice shards,

104
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,459
resulting in disability.

105
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,980
I never told anyone about this,

106
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,699
not even the former chairman.

107
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,319
How did you find out?

108
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,500
Mr. Kuntai,

109
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,040
I really am Lin Xia!

110
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,220
Impossible!

111
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,139
You must've captured and tortured her.

112
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:38,879
You all deserve to die!

113
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,319
I used Bai Cha's appearance.

114
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,920
With this new identity,

115
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,860
I'll take revenge on Ye Dong.

116
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:57,319
Look at

117
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,180
the video of the procedure.

118
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,459
You...

119
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:16,360
You're Lin Xia.

120
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,699
You're really Xia.

121
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:20,920
Yes,

122
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
I'm Xia.

123
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:25,920
As long as you're safe.

124
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:27,980
Being alive is enough.

125
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:28,879
So great!

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,899
With your testimony,

127
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,560
I'll put Ye Dong behind bars.

128
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:40,379
Right now

129
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,120
we can't do that.

130
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,680
Why?

131
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,120
He and his mother killed my father

132
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,019
and Lin Na

133
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,500
and caused Bai Cha's death.

134
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,420
Putting him in jail now

135
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,220
is letting him off lightly.

136
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,160
Xia,

137
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,560
what's your plan?

138
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,560
We need

139
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,459
to unite with other shareholders

140
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,319
to gain absolute

141
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,680
decision-making power.

142
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,420
Alright.

143
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,600
Mom,

144
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,259
you've recovered enough.

145
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,360
Let's go home.

146
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,379
The company

147
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,300
has many matters waiting for me.

148
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,060
You haven't spent a full month with me.

149
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,500
You're not going anywhere.

150
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,240
Otherwise,

151
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,839
I'll disown you as my son.

152
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,160
Fine.

153
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:52,699
I'll obey.

154
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,019
After I'm discharged,

155
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,519
I'll arrange your wedding with Wei.

156
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Cut ties with

157
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,079
those random women.

158
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,079
Let's

159
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:08,259
discuss it later.

160
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:10,560
This matter

161
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,420
is non-negotiable.

162
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,800
Wei's destiny

163
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,759
aligns perfectly with yours.

164
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,000
If you two marry,

165
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,579
our Ye family

166
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,819
will reach new heights.

167
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,500
Are you still thinking about that woman?

168
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:28,740
I'm warning you

169
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:29,899
that tramp

170
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,120
is bad luck.

171
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,600
She'll bring misfortune to you

172
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,139
and even me.

173
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,560
Stay away from her.

174
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,660
Understood?

175
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,240
Dong,

176
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,819
help me!

177
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:44,959
What happened?

178
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,660
It's

179
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,019
Mu Feng.

180
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,660
He used your seal to withdraw funds.

181
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,420
I said I'd call you,

182
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
but he beat me.

183
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,899
He wanted the money and elope with me.

184
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,660
When I refused,

185
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,019
he nearly beat me to death.

186
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,779
Dong,

187
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,660
Mu Feng has betrayed you.

188
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,259
Luckily, I was smart enough

189
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,860
to escape with an excuse.

190
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,680
But

191
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,759
he threatened my parents' lives.

192
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,600
If I don't give him the money tonight,

193
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,259
he'll kill them.

194
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:09,899
Dong,

195
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,959
please settle this for me!

196
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,560
How dare he

197
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,959
betray me!

198
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,960
Why did Yufei choose such a remote spot?

199
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,419
Whatever.

200
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,159
Once I get the money,

201
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,419
I'll have fun with her

202
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,019
and be out of here.

203
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,259
Dong.

204
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,080
Feng,

205
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,059
your plan has been exposed.

206
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,120
Hand over the seal.

207
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,460
Let Dong decide your fate.

208
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,259
Dong.

209
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,019
Get him!

210
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,500
Dong,

211
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,200
I've followed you for years

212
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,779
risking my life.

213
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:01,639
Never expected

214
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,320
over petty cash today,

215
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:03,840
you

216
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,759
want to kill me.

217
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,519
After these years with me,

218
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,580
you should know better

219
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:18,820
what happens to traitors.

220
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,259
Feng,

221
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:29,799
stop pretending.

222
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,940
Dong,

223
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,799
please forgive him this time.

224
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:41,519
Go

225
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,179
kill him.

226
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:49,860
Qin Yufei,

227
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,059
Dong said

228
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,779
if you don't kill her today,

229
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:53,600
both of you

230
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:54,779
will die.

231
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,340
(Feng,)

232
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,519
(I had no choice).

233
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,720
(Feng,)

234
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,899
(I don't want to kill you.)

235
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,019
(That demon forced me!)

236
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,480
No.

237
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,279
No.

238
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,220
(Clues)
After checking Cheng Nuo's connections

239
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,919
and comparing fake Lin Xia's body,

240
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:43,000
we discovered

241
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,820
the victim's

242
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,399
characteristics closely match a woman

243
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,320
named Ai Li.

244
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,299
Ai Li was Bai Cha's best friend.

245
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,259
Then we went to Ai Li's mother

246
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,820
and DNA tests confirmed

247
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,360
the body was indeed Ai Li's.

248
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,700
So I conclude

249
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,159
Cheng Nuo as a plastic surgeon

250
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,820
used his skills

251
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,100
to transplant Lin Xia's

252
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,799
face onto Ai Li's body,

253
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:02,740
so as to

254
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,820
create a diversion

255
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,220
to cover his crimes.

256
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,360
If your theory holds,

257
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:08,659
where's Lin Xia's body?

258
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,159
Here's the key point.

259
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,080
Lin Xia isn't dead.

260
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,960
She took Bai Cha's face

261
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,340
to approach Ye Dong

262
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,019
for revenge.

263
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,340
So you're saying

264
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:18,580
the current Bai Cha

265
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,120
is actually Lin Xia?

266
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,860
Correct.

267
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,620
Then where's

268
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,379
the real Bai Cha?

269
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,019
She died

270
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,899
after the cliff fall.

271
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:29,500
Cheng Nuo fabricated evidence

272
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,120
to make us think she survived.

273
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,299
What's his motive?

274
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,059
I can't figure out.

275
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,100
He should hate Ye Dong,

276
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:41,720
yet he helped cover his crimes.

277
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,519
No death penalty in our country.

278
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:44,960
The maximum

279
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,860
is life imprisonment.

280
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,360
Cheng Nuo

281
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,759
loved his family deeply,

282
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:50,899
so he must hate

283
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,059
Ye Dong deeply.

284
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:54,519
A feud to the death.

285
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,279
If that's true,

286
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,899
Cheng Nuo's actions make sense.

287
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,860
Master,

288
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,259
what's our next move?

289
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,200
Arrest Cheng Nuo.
