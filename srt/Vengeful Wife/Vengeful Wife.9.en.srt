=Vengeful Wife=

2
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:47,725
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,119
This bracelet is really beautiful.

4
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:54,179
How much?

5
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:55,539
150.

6
00:00:58,179 --> 00:00:59,179
150?

7
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:01,340
Are you trying to shortchange me?

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,079
Too cheap

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,060
for me.

10
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:12,459
1.5 million.

11
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,099
1.5 million?

12
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,579
It's really 1.5 million.

13
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,700
This tiny bracelet

14
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,879
is worth that much?

15
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,379
Where I'm from,

16
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:25,879
this could buy a house.

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,939
Your daughter-in-law
bought all these for you.

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:29,980
Well?

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,140
She's good, isn't she?

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,159
Ye Dong just

21
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,659
got into prosperity.

22
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,239
It's brought me good fortune.

23
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:38,819
Absolutely.

24
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,719
Marrying into the Lin family

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,140
is the epitome of good fortune.

26
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:44,519
Your ancestors' graves

27
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,859
must be glowing with pride.

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,819
Girl,

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,140
you have excellent facial features.

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,939
Why don't you marry my son?

31
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,799
Listen, old woman.

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,299
You have another son?

33
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,019
No.

34
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,040
Just joking.

35
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,180
I just think you're quite decent.

36
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,420
(This old hag's such a snob.)

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,539
(Last time she said I looked doomed.)

38
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,500
(Now, she claims I have good features)

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,439
(and am decent.)

40
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,900
(So money-obsessed.)

41
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,800
(But people like her)

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,560
(are simple.)

43
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,539
(Just keep giving her benefits,)

44
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:18,879
(and she'll stay manageable.)

45
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,520
(But)

46
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,419
(watch out for insatiable greed.)

47
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,560
Na.

48
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,379
Xia,

49
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,020
you can see now?

50
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:50,919
(Oh, no.)

51
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,580
How I wish

52
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:55,020
I could see.

53
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:57,939
You can't imagine

54
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,259
a world

55
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,560
of complete darkness.

56
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,000
The chilling embrace

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,439
of loneliness.

58
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:04,780
No end in sight.

59
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,520
No hope, either.

60
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,259
Even breathing

61
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:10,979
feels suffocating.

62
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,780
Xia,

63
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,099
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,439
It's fine.

65
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:24,319
This is just how things are now.

66
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,599
Besides,

67
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,240
this isn't your fault.

68
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:29,539
By the way, Na,

69
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,199
did you bring all the gifts

70
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:32,639
for Mom?

71
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:33,699
They're all here.

72
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,879
Your mother-in-law

73
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,060
loves them.

74
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,400
You do have a heart.

75
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,699
My affection

76
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:41,939
for you wasn't wasted.

77
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,060
Mom,

78
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,419
I specifically had Na pick

79
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:47,939
these collector's editions.

80
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,900
They're not only expensive

81
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,379
but also collectible.

82
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,020
So

83
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,180
take good care of them.

84
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,939
They're just little trinkets.

85
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,740
I prefer to stay low-key.

86
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:01,860
Well then,

87
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,500
I'll put them away.

88
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,860
(I need to get this devil away,)

89
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,060
(so I can ask Na for help.)

90
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,740
Xia,

91
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,860
when I visited Mr. Lin the other day,

92
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,139
he wasn't home.

93
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,060
And Mr. An

94
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,100
hasn't answered calls.

95
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,819
Is anything wrong?

96
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,259
(You're really putting me on the spot.)

97
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:34,660
Nothing's wrong.

98
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
Why do you ask?

99
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,180
My husband

100
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,699
just saw my father days ago.

101
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,100
Ask him if you

102
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,899
don't believe me.

103
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,459
Your husband, your husband.

104
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,180
Always talking about him.

105
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,540
How much do you love him?

106
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:46,939
Ye Dong,

107
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,899
Xia

108
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:49,779
used to be such an icy businesswoman.

109
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:51,819
How did she turn into
such a simp around you?

110
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,939
Did you give her

111
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:53,860
a love potion?

112
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:58,339
You've got it wrong.

113
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,579
I'm actually the simp.

114
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,939
Dad's been resting lately.

115
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,259
You can't reach him.

116
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,100
That's normal.

117
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,660
Mr. Lin's health
hasn't been good recently.

118
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,899
Enough of this.

119
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,939
Honey,

120
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,220
Na loves drinking

121
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,860
our hand-ground coffee.

122
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,100
Go make her a cup.

123
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,579
Alright.

124
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:28,199
Na,

125
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,379
come help me.

126
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,819
I'll tell you one

127
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,000
of Xia's secrets.

128
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,980
Secret?

129
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,620
Good.

130
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:38,899
Na.

131
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:42,540
Honey,

132
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:43,800
are you

133
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,779
trying to tattle to Na?

134
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,060
We haven't seen

135
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,220
each other in ages.

136
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,379
I want to catch up with her.

137
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,920
It's fine.

138
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,139
We'll talk later.

139
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,459
Actually, I'm quite interested

140
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,939
in the secret he mentioned.

141
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,079
Secret.

142
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:06,939
Spit it out.

143
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,060
What secret?

144
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,220
Why the sigh?

145
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:15,060
Out with it.

146
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,279
Lin Xia plans

147
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,439
to announce
at tomorrow's shareholder meeting

148
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,459
that she's transferring all her shares

149
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,259
to me.

150
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,680
What?

151
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,860
Are you sure?

152
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,459
Complete transfer?

153
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:28,459
Is she out of her mind?

154
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:30,639
No way.

155
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,860
Unacceptable.

156
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,100
It's complete madness.

157
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,660
Does Mr. Lin know about this?

158
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,939
If he did,

159
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:37,019
he'd drop dead from anger.

160
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:38,300
This concerns

161
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,860
the very foundation of Lin Group.

162
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,339
She's not thinking straight,

163
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,699
and you're following her?

164
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,839
Exactly because it's wrong,

165
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,579
I'm asking you to persuade her.

166
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,060
Let me persuade her?

167
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:50,939
Ye Dong,

168
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,259
let's be honest.

169
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,339
Aren't you even slightly tempted

170
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:56,819
by this mountain of wealth?

171
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,699
I don't believe there exists

172
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:00,819
such a perfect person.

173
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,379
I'm not perfect.

174
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:06,939
But who holds the shares

175
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,019
doesn't matter to me.

176
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,620
How could it not matter?

177
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,899
If the shares go to you,

178
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,759
and you abandon her later,

179
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,259
Xia would lose everything.

180
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,899
Human nature is the most complex thing.

181
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,639
Even if you don't inform me,

182
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,980
once I know about this,

183
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,060
I'll stop her with everything I've got.

184
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,579
Clearly, you

185
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:28,379
genuinely care about her.

186
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,540
Her current actions

187
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,220
are irrational.

188
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:31,579
Please make her see reason.

189
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,740
Of course,

190
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,180
it's extremely irrational.

191
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:36,019
Actually, she's doing this

192
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:37,420
all for my sake.

193
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,500
She just wants me

194
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,839
to look authoritative

195
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,139
in the acting CEO position.

196
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,920
That's why she's risking everything.

197
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,180
Honestly,

198
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:47,699
it's putting huge pressure on me.

199
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,579
You must be secretly enjoying this.

200
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:07,920
Xia,

201
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,399
when did you become

202
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,259
such a lovesick fool?

203
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,180
What's wrong?

204
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,199
How can your shares

205
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,579
be transferred so easily?

206
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,259
Does Mr. Lin know?

207
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,459
He doesn't, right?

208
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:18,779
If he does,

209
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:19,819
he'd be furious.

210
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:20,860
Honey,

211
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,660
you even told Na about this?

212
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,420
You tried to hide something

213
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,660
this important from me?

214
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,300
Do you even think of me as your bestie?

215
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,379
I knew you wouldn't agree,

216
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,180
so I didn't discuss it with you.

217
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:31,980
You!

218
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,620
Enough, Na.

219
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,000
I've made up my mind.

220
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,740
Don't try to persuade me.

221
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,700
Na,

222
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,840
do you remember

223
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,519
the promise we made as kids?

224
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,460
If one of us makes a decision,

225
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,419
the other

226
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:46,019
will support her unconditionally.

227
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,700
If I hadn't seen

228
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,019
the SOS you wrote

229
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:51,480
on that van,

230
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,059
you might've been sold off
by traffickers.

231
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:55,240
My mom said

232
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,299
SOS

233
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,980
is a distress signal.

234
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,059
I'm Lin Xia.

235
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,179
What's your name?

236
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:02,500
I'm Lin Na.

237
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,019
Let's be friends.

238
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,259
(Do you remember that?)

239
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:08,740
Yes.

240
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,340
Of course I do.

241
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,799
So,

242
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,720
you'll support me

243
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,860
in transferring

244
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,539
all my shares to my husband Ye Dong,

245
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,600
right?

246
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,059
(Xia can see.)

247
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:31,039
(She's pretending.)

248
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,740
(She's signaling for help.)

249
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:40,659
Xia,

250
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:41,580
of course.

251
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,700
I'll absolutely support you.

252
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:46,080
Thank you.

253
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:48,940
Ye Dong,

254
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,259
I've been here this long,

255
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:52,059
and you haven't cut any fruit for me?

256
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,379
Are you unhappy to see me?

257
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:54,440
Go.

258
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,919
Go prepare some fruit.

259
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,419
My apologies.

260
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,659
Mu Feng.

261
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,460
(Why is there no signal?)

262
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,480
(What should I do?)

263
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,220
Dong.

264
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,399
Go get some fruit.

265
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,700
Yes.

266
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,019
Dong,

267
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,779
the signal jammer is installed.

268
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:38,980
Xia, Ye Dong,

269
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:40,539
I need to make a private call.

270
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,200
