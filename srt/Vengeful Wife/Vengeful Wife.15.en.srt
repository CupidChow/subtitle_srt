2
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,680
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,380
Although it's right before my eyes,

4
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,600
I can't nor do I want to

5
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,380
believe it until now

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,020
that my wife, Lin Xia

7
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,460
could do something so cruel.

8
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:05,379
In my eyes,

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,439
she was a perfect person.

10
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,859
At work,

11
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:10,500
she's diligent,

12
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,760
and meticulous;

13
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,099
to others,

14
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:15,659
gentle and kind;

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,879
to elders,

16
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,420
filial and considerate.

17
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,959
To me,

18
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,620
she showed more affection.

19
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,159
She was so nice.

20
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,140
How could she murder?

21
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,299
What's wrong with this world?

22
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,019
Or perhaps

23
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,819
I never truly understood her.

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,859
Please

25
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,439
find her.

26
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,859
I want to ask her why

27
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:50,859
face-to-face.

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,140
Alright.

29
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,060
Let's stop here.

30
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:00,700
Edit it well.

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,020
(Could do something so cruel.)

32
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,180
(In my eyes,)

33
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,860
(she was a perfect person.)

34
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,259
He is too devoted!

35
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,780
He's probably

36
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,419
the perfect dream lover

37
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:22,360
for countless young women.

38
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,419
Or maybe

39
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,599
a perfect

40
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,180
nightmare!

41
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,819
Master,

42
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,659
I've verified with Mr. Zhang.

43
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,400
He's absolutely certain

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,219
about Lin Xia's blindness.

45
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,419
Her regained vision later

46
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:37,680
is considered a miracle.

47
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,039
Silly Qiang,

48
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,340
any news on Cheng Nuo?

49
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:41,819
Not yet.

50
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,639
Probably fled from justice.

51
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:44,759
Otherwise,

52
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,879
why did he abandon

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,620
his hospital?

54
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,680
He isn't related

55
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,039
to Lin Xia's case, right?

56
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,639
Although his wife, Bai Cha

57
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,740
was suspected dead,

58
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,099
that's unconfirmed.

59
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,219
No need for us

60
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,199
to search.

61
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,139
We're short-staffed already.

62
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:59,060
They're unrelated?

63
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,120
This is too brazen!

64
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,419
If this photo gets out,

65
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:15,699
Ye Dong's devoted persona

66
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,620
will collapse.

67
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:18,639
I get it!

68
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,840
Cheng Nuo and Lin Xia

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,900
discovered Ye Dong and Bai Cha's affair

70
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,240
and conspired against Bai Cha.

71
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,099
Master,

72
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,539
investigate in this direction.

73
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:27,460
Can't go wrong.

74
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:29,800
Ye Dong,

75
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,759
as the Lin family's live-in son-in-law,

76
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,879
was at others' mercy.

77
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,520
Now he

78
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,919
is Jiuyao Group's Chairman

79
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,879
and CEO.

80
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:38,860
He even appointed

81
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:40,599
the underqualified Qin Yufei

82
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,900
as CFO.

83
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,800
Thus,

84
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,340
the biggest beneficiary...

85
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,800
is him.

86
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,719
Master,

87
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,039
Cheng Nuo's returned home.

88
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,259
Now apply to Chief

89
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:00,159
for a warrant.

90
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:00,919
Yes!

91
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:13,840
Bai Cha?

92
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:16,519
You're Bai Cha?

93
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,819
Who are you?

94
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,620
Hello.

95
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,180
We're police detectives.

96
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:23,660
Need to verify something

97
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:25,160
with you and Cheng Nuo.

98
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,620
Okay.

99
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:27,579
Please come in.

100
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,500
Thank you.

101
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,439
Thank you.

102
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,279
- Have tea.
- Thanks.

103
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,339
You're

104
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,339
so sensible.

105
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:42,392
Just sit.

106
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,060
Mr. Luo,

107
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,139
why are you here again?

108
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,699
Mr. Cheng,

109
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,600
what's going on?

110
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,000
Why is she here?

111
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:56,699
I've told you many times

112
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,899
she's

113
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,060
perfectly fine,

114
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:00,579
but you refuse to believe it.

115
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,180
In Wangjiang Hospital,

116
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,240
we didn't find her.

117
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,740
Can you explain?

118
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,300
See?

119
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
I knew you'd bother her.

120
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:15,500
That's why

121
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,319
I called her to move

122
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,180
to another one.

123
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,420
Of course,

124
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,040
I didn't want to cause you trouble.

125
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,540
So

126
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,459
just brought her back

127
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,220
and was about to register

128
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,800
at the police station.

129
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,600
I see.

130
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,139
While you were away,

131
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,519
we visited your hospital many times.

132
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,300
My apologies.

133
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:45,060
People tend to get nervous in hospitals.

134
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,560
Bai Cha,

135
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,339
do you visit

136
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:50,339
your husband's hospital often?

137
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:51,540
I...

138
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,459
She's

139
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:57,019
busy buying purses

140
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,720
and shopping.

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,180
Rarely visits my hospital.

142
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,779
Then I suppose

143
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,620
she doesn't know about

144
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,459
the square freezer

145
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,699
in the cold storage.

146
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,379
Honey,

147
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,079
I remember

148
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,959
that freezer

149
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,540
is

150
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,839
a rectangular one.

151
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:19,540
Have you

152
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:20,399
changed it?

153
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,100
Of course not.

154
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,000
Remember?

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,920
We cleaned that cold storage together.

156
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:25,899
Then

157
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:26,720
sir...

158
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:29,220
I got it wrong.

159
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:30,579
You're right.

160
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:31,699
It is

161
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:33,259
a rectangular one.

162
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,300
Rectangular.

163
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,459
You really

164
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:38,300
love each other.

165
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,500
There are

166
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,779
many photos in your office.

167
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:43,699
Wow.

168
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,019
Plenty at home too.

169
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,019
Such star quality.

170
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,379
This pose

171
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,379
is so natural.

172
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:05,339
I used to

173
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:07,060
work at nightclubs.

174
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,620
Hope I didn't embarrass myself.

175
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:12,000
Alright.

176
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:14,259
I'm leaving.

177
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,699
Got stuff to do.

178
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:17,560
Master,

179
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,160
should we...

180
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,040
Should what?

181
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,500
I'll spend time with my daughter.

182
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,139
- I'll see you out.
- Alright.

183
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:24,064
This way.

184
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,980
Well,

185
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,019
officers,

186
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,040
we'll stay here.

187
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,379
Alright.

188
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,420
See you.

189
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,420
Go in.

190
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,240
They seem quite affectionate.

191
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:44,519
But

192
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,819
our assumptions might be wrong.

193
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,100
Master,

194
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,120
why didn't you ask
about Ye Dong and Lin Xia?

195
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,420
When prey feels safest

196
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,779
and most relaxed,

197
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:58,939
they'll show their weakness.

198
00:07:59,279 --> 00:07:59,779
This is

199
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,139
authenticity through relaxation.

200
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:02,519
If you ask him,

201
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,240
it's like sounding an alarm.

202
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,660
They can pull off

203
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,500
a flawless act.

204
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,540
Don't get it.

205
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:12,259
Bai Cha was right before us.

206
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:14,339
What are you suspicious about?

207
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,740
I have this strange feeling.

208
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:21,620
It's like looking

209
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:22,819
at a perfect puzzle,

210
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,000
but the colors don't

211
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,120
seem to match.

212
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,000
What's wrong with it?

213
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:31,040
Haven't figured it out.

214
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,860
And Lin Xia

215
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,100
has vanished

216
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,279
without a trace.

217
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,539
Ye Dong

218
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,000
must be hiding something.

219
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,500
His overly affectionate act

220
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,340
looks fake to me.

221
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:46,700
Something might behind

222
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:48,860
Lin Na's murder.

223
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:51,940
Master,

224
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:53,799
I feel

225
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,820
this case

226
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,000
is like falling into

227
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,299
a foggy swamp.

228
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,539
The more I struggle,

229
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,899
the deeper I sink.

230
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:01,820
Qiao,

231
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:05,100
when deceived by appearances,

232
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,340
trust your instincts.

233
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:09,740
Trust your inner judgment.

234
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,080
Eyes

235
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:12,059
can lie.

236
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:12,980
But your mind

237
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,799
will let you see clearer.

238
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,039
Dong,

239
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,500
Mrs. Ye is here.

240
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:35,620
Mom,

241
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:37,139
like this place?

242
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:42,059
Dong,

243
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,860
well,

244
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,440
all these

245
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,399
treasures belong to us now?

246
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,019
Yes.

247
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:48,100
But

248
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:50,220
stop wearing this outfit.

249
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:51,779
Now we're

250
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,500
a respectable upper-class family.

251
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,179
Stop wearing it.

252
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,179
What's wrong with this?

253
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,299
This is

254
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,899
my specially-made divine robe.

255
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,580
Let me tell you.

256
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,120
If I hadn't stolen

257
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,539
Lin's prosperous fate,

258
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,940
we wouldn't be here today.

259
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,320
Mom,

260
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,279
everything I have today

261
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,019
is earned through my own efforts.

262
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,519
It has nothing to do with you.

263
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,279
Instead, you almost

264
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,059
ruined my plans.

265
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,820
Lin Xia

266
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,299
dared to hit me.

267
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,259
My head still hurts.

268
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,500
Why didn't you bring her corpse back?

269
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,759
I'll make sure

270
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,500
she never reincarnates!

271
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:30,340
Enough, Mom.

272
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,019
Stop talking nonsense,

273
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:33,419
especially at the company.

274
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:36,559
Think you're all grown up now?

275
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,139
Ashamed of me?

276
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:41,379
No.

277
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,100
Kneel.

278
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,659
Mom!

279
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,539
Kneel!

280
00:10:59,019 --> 00:10:59,620
Dong!

281
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,419
Get out!

282
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:02,519
Dong!

283
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,059
Bai Cha has appeared.

284
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,539
Go ahead!

285
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,659
