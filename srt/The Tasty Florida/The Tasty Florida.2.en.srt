That sounds like you. Really.

I think he's perfect.

Do you have experience in this kind of job?

46
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,850
Yes, I used to help my mother when she was running a restaurant.

47
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,040
Ah, you helped with your mother's restaurant?

48
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,120
I don't have to ask about your experience, then.

Can you greet the camera? Say "Okabangga," that's my greeting.

One, two, three. "Okabangga."

- Yes.
