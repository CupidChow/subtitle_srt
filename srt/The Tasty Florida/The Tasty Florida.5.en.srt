00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,850
Hello, I'm Seo Hae Won.

3
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,010
Please take care of me.

4
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,990
Our Hae Won looks very energetic, doesn't he?

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,250
You know how dangerous the kitchen is, don't you? There are knives and fire.

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,440
You'll get hurt if you run like that. Be careful.

8
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,200
Yes, Chef.

9
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,630
It looks good on you.

10
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,080
Let me.

11
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,650
Here.

12
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,990
Like this,

13
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,300
wrap it around the back.

14
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,730
And tie it to the front.

15
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,610
A little harder...

16
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,870
What?

17
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Please tie it a little tighter.

18
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,810
Thank you.

19
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,750
But why did you allow me to work here?

20
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,000
To pay back the favor?

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,310
No. The knife skills you have are enough to be an assistant cook.

22
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,820
You mean I was hired for my skills, right?

23
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,180
You should change your hairstyle.

24

Finish up and come outside.

25
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,160
It's necessary to learn how to serve, in case you need to help during rush hours.

26
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,190
It's a simple job, you just have to take and deliver orders. Simple, right?

27
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,120
Hey! How would he understand with that explanation?

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,280
Hae Won, I'll explain to you our positions here.

29
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,860
Ji Soo takes care of the customers and service in general.

30
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,200
He washes the dishes.

31
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,240
I take and send the orders to Eun Gyu.

32
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,380
I looked cool, didn't I?

33
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,430
It's easy, then.

34
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,970
The job is simple, but there is something difficult.

35
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,590
What is it?

36
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,560
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

37
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,220
Perhaps, can I take a picture with you?

38
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,880
- Yes.
- Thank you.

40

42
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,800
Show me.

43
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,680
Honey, take another picture but a full body shot.

44
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,810
Are you here for dinner or a photo shoot?

45
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,510
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not. Just pose.

46
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,310
- It's obvious you're mad at me.
- I told you I'm not.

47
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,340
Excuse me, I'm still working...

48
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,510
I don't have a good picture yet.

He's new on the job. He will take more pictures with you later when it's less busy.

- Yes, I see.
- Sorry.

Come on, we haven't had a team dinner in so long.

57

Boss. Hyung, can we start work 30 minutes later?

61

That means we can start later tomorrow, right?

62

I eat anything very well.
