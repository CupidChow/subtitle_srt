00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,070
Hey, what should we do now?

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,510
Shouldn't we close for a while?

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,140
It sounds like you enjoy the idea.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,240
No, I don't.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,900
I have been thinking about something.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,180
What can you do alone?

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,610
Hyung,

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,630
I can do well now, even if my hand-pulled noodles are still a bit lacking.

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,990
Wait a minute, stay here.

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
Here.

13
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,770
This is the dish that I casually made: jjajang dive dumplings.

14
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,530
What is this? Didn't you just cook the dough in the jjajang sauce I made?

15
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,920
Correct! But not entirely.

16
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,060
Hey, what is this?

17
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,220
Jjajang boiled dumplings.

18
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,380
Did you graduate from the Berkley School of Jjajang making? It's delicious.

19
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,460
Seo Hae Won, if you're done, hurry and tidy things up. It will be on today's menu.

Hyung,

23
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,420
why is it called "Tasty Florida"?

24
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,270
When I was a kid my father went to work in Florida,

25
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,620
and we lost contact.

26
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,630
If I name the restaurant "Tasty Florida," it feels like we're closer.

27
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,570
So that's why you chose "Florida."

28
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,850
Sometimes, when my dad returned from Florida, we would eat jjajangmyeon together.

29
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,570
I really like that memory.

30
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,110
The day of my father's return was jjajangmyeon day.

31
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:29,550
It is my dream to go there and cook jjajangmyeon for my father one day.

32
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,970

Hae Won, you've moved to Seoul, but are you going to keep living at the guesthouse?

52
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,940
I don't have enough money to move out yet.

53
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,000
I have another idea. Want to break away from the routine instead?

54

Break away?

55

- It's because you keep interfering.

Let's stop it.

63
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,640
Did you start to like him...

64
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,900
because I said I like him?

65
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,620
Or are you toying with him while pretending not to like him?

66
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,470
What did you say, you jerk?

67

- You guys are friends, what's wrong with you?

68

I know you like him, too.

73
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,870
If you can't answer that you like him,

74
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,480
then are you admitting that you are playing with him?

75
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,660
- Or should we go out and talk?
- You bastard.

- Where are you going?
- Wait here. I'll go calm him down and come back.

83
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,550
What the? I was the only one in the dark?
