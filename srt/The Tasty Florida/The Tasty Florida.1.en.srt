There is always a reason why a place has a good view.

There are a lot of jobs here, too.

Ah! You're Korean.

I saw you carrying a big suitcase and thought you were a foreign tourist.

16
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,980
Because there are a lot of tourists here.

17
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,600
You have to be careful of such people. They are bad people.

That's right. I last saw you when you were in kindergarten and then I moved to Seoul.

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,230
Although I don't remember, I heard a lot about you from my mother.

40
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,840
Aigoo... Why does your mom worry so much? It's not like you're coming from the countryside.

41
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,720
I thought she was planning to move to Seoul with you, a full-grown adult.

42
