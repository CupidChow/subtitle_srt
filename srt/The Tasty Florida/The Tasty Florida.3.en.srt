Oppa, I'm here again.

00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,140
Didn't you say you'd come when you become an adult? Hurry up and go to school.

00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,880
Yes.

That's not going to hide you.

7
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,830
Won't they all just come to take pictures today, too?

8
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,910
There's still a lot. At least a hundred profiles were submitted.

00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:58,910
We're basically playing at loss.

 [Tasty Florida is Open]

15
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:19,390
These people... getting recruited in our business was actually none of their business.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
What is that lousy pun for?

17
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,690
Well, taking pictures with them is not a big deal...

18
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,200
But anyway, let's take down the job advert.

19
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,230
It's okay. As you said, taking pictures with them isn't a big deal.

20
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,290
I'm positive there's someone among them that's well suited for the job.

21
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,110
Taking down the advert is like a Seoul mistake: a capital mistake.

22

23

I mean, have you ever...

31
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,150
looked at a boy and found him to be cute?

32
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,550
Is there anything weird about that?

33
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,850
He's also cute, too.

34
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,650
Hey!

35
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,870
I'm scared to death. Maybe not cute...

36
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,390
- but gross.
- Don't talk about me!

37
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,410
- Okay.
- Don't you know I hate to be called "cute"?

He wanted to work out, so I called him over.

Yes.

60
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,560
Do you want a part-time job?

61
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,820

Boss? Why are you just leaving?

64

Don't let that bother you. He's always like that.

65

I should ask you the same. I told you we should interview more people yesterday.

69

If the kitchen isn't suitable, he can be a waiter.

72

We also have to rest.

73
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,170
And I don't get to rest? I'm doing all the kitchen work by myself.

74

I'm just saying we should at least interview him.

75

We concluded that if we can't find anyone, we have to do it my way.
