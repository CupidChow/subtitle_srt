00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,550
Do you want to be my brother?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,020
Brother?

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,720
It might get dangerous because I'm drunk.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,090
What's dangerous?

6
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,050
Something like this.

00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,380

I think the people at that table are staring at me.

Get a grip, please.

11
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,160
I'm going to leave after this drink.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,800
- Where are you going? You should have more.
- Should I?

13

Hae Won will be here soon.

14
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,000
He's not coming. Eun Gyu slept in Hae Won's room the other day.

What?

16
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,460
The guest house owner came by to eat the other day and said something about being okay

51
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,910
What did you two do last night?

52
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,890
One got too drunk and passed out,

53
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,450
and the other said he would call but didn't, and he shows up only now.

I'm sorry, hyung.

It's all right, you're forgiven for everything.

- No.

85

No, it's okay.

But I think Eun Gyu is difficult to figure out.

I can't tell what he's thinking.

93
