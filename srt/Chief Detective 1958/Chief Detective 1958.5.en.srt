00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,020
Chief Detective 1958

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,000
This series is unrelated to any places,
persons, settings or events.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,630
Scenes involving animals were filmed in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,200
"Episode 5"

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,200
Why are you all white as ghosts?

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,490
What's with the makeup?

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,040
These guys threw ash at us
as they ran away.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,540
Why don't you all hit the shower first?

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,750
You all look nasty.

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,720
Well, let me shake this off
before I go shower.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,680
- Let me join in.
- Go away!

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,970
Hey, stop!

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,220
Come on, seriously.

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,020
- I told you to stop!
- Mister.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,690
Geumok.

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,940
Sungchil…

17
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,540
Is it really Sungchil?

18
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,520
Take her with you.

19
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,850
Sungchil…

20
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,110
Any witnesses?

21
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,570
No one claims to have seen anything

22
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,360
before his grandmother
discovered the body.

23
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,620
No one, my foot.

24
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,700
They're just afraid to talk.

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,170
We'll help you if anything happens.

26
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,010
So please trust us

27
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,760
and tell us what you know.

28
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,180
I really wish I could,

29
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,810
but you know how things are.

30
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,810
And I have Geumok to take care of.

31
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,440
Please come out and talk to us.

32
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,560
Sir, please.

33
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,110
Help us catch whoever killed Sungchil.

34
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,740
What on earth happened?

35
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,280
I don't know.
Just have a bowl of noodles and go.

36
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,410
Do you really not know anything?

37
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,290
I don't.

38
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,870
Don't ask me again.

39
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,460
Sungchil is dead!

40
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,000
He was stabbed to death by a random punk!

41
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,880
You need to speak up,

42
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,300
so I can go catch or kill that prick!

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,000
Detective Park.

44
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,850
I'm begging you.

45
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,060
Please stop.

46
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,360
Why won't anyone talk to us?

47
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,030
How could they be like this?

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,870
They're fearing for their lives.

49
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,370
Fearing who, exactly?

50
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,450
Who do you think
the market merchants are most afraid of?

51
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,080
You're right.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,800
I'm sure he did it.

53
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,380
<i>If one of his thugs
hadn't stopped him then,</i>

54
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,470
<i>he would've killed Sungchil
then and there.</i>

55
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,350
Please don't resent
the market merchants too much.

56
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,440
They want to tell you what they know,
but they're just too afraid.

57
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,980
You're right.

58
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,520
It's not their fault.

59
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,460
Episode 5
There's No Criminal That Can't Be Caught!

60
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,920
What was that?

61
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,670
Go out and check.

62
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,430
Move it, move it! Hurry!

63
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,970
What kind of crazy punk
dares to come here?

64
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,680
Come on! Go and get them!

65
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,120
- Go and tell him now!
- Yes, sir.

66
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,340
- The cops from Hwangchun are here.
- Who?

67
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,550
The Hwangchun cops, boss.

68
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,010
Does that Hwangchun prick
have a death wish?

69
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,880
- Let go!
- Damn it!

70
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,840
You're dead to me!

71
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,890
Yeonghan, are you all right?

72
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,980
Yeah.

73
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,120
What's wrong with you?
Why are you even here?

74
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,660
Hey, I have a favor to ask.

75
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,960
Punch me.

76
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,500
Are you out of your mind?

77
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,590
I just want to know
how strong your punch is.

78
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,220
So go ahead.

79
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,680
Why? You think I won't hit you?

80
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,470
Do it then.

81
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,480
You better hit hard.
I don't want you to regret it.

82
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Clench your jaw
if you don't want to lose a tooth.

83
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,570
Happy?

84
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,780
- Look, you punched first, all right?
- What?

85
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,740
Now, this is self-defense.

86
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,790
One.

87
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,710
Two.

88
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,790
Three.

89
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,210
Four.

90
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,860
Where's the knife?

91
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,450
What knife?

92
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,030
The one you guys used to kill Sungchil.

93
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,460
I have no idea what you're talking about.

94
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,510
There's nothing.

95
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,260
Search their pockets.

96
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Yes, sir.

97
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,350
What's this?

98
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,280
Since when do thugs listen
to fortune tellers?

99
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,030
No, I'll suffer bad luck!

100
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,120
I mean…

101
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,920
p-please give it back.

102
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,410
Suffer bad luck?

103
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,790
You're nothing but bad luck, you snake.

104
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,550
- Let's take Viper with us.
- All right.

105
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,630
Get him up.

106
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,940
I apologize, Chairman Lee.

107
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,180
I warned you all
not to cause trouble again.

108
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,930
Tell me straight.

109
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,730
Did Viper do it?

110
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,440
Well…

111
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,990
Now,

112
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,160
who did you say arrested him?

113
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,660
Hey, hey, hey. You should take him
to the hospital, not bring him here.

114
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,160
You mind your own business, Hwang.

115
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,660
What?

116
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,100
Mind your own business, you prick!

117
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,330
That's enough!

118
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,340
What's going on here?

119
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,590
We're investigating.

120
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,090
Go on.

121
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,800
Why did you kill him?

122
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,970
Who?

123
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,890
Why did you kill Sungchil?

124
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,600
Who even is Sungchil?

125
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,940
I can't kill someone I don't know.

126
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,020
Sungchil was a poor kid

127
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,150
who was orphaned in the war.

128
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,410
He just recently learned how to read
and helped his grandma read the papers.

129
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,620
All he wanted was to live his life.

130
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,500
Why would you kill such a kid?

131
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,790
Why? Why?

132
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,670
Who gives a damn about that kid?

133
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,060
- Wait.
- Wait, stop, Detective Park.

134
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,310
Tell me. Why did you kill him?

135
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,060
I know you killed him.

136
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,230
It was you, wasn't it?

137
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,070
I killed him, all right?
Just put the gun down.

138
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,900
So why? Why did you kill him?

139
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,570
Detective Park, put down the gun first.

140
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,120
Tell me, you prick. Why did you kill him?

141
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,240
Tell me, you damn prick. Say it!

142
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,430
You cops can't just take people like this!

143
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,370
Our boss was with us drinking all night!

144
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
This is an abuse of power.

145
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,380
You cops can't just arrest people
like this without evidence.

146
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,300
Boss, you drank with us all night!

147
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,890
You beat up an innocent man
and held a gun to his head.

148
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,640
You guys are all hopeless, aren't you?

149
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,220
An innocent man, sir?

150
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,270
He's the culprit who killed Sungchil.

151
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,560
Do you have proof?

152
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,900
He has 20 witnesses.

153
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,240
I've had it up to here with you all.

154
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,490
Chief Yu, I'm docking your pay
for two months.

155
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,450
The rest of you

156
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,950
are relieved of your duties.

157
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,330
Dismissed.

158
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,910
Sir?

159
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,620
Give us a moment.

160
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,270
What's with all the long faces?

161
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,800
Don't worry. You all aren't fired.

162
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,430
What about the case, sir?

163
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,640
We can investigate,
but just not the Dongdaemun guys.

164
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,680
That means we can't then.

165
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,450
You're not going to listen to him,
are you?

166
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,400
Listen to him? No, I want you
to arrest everyone responsible.

167
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,150
How do we get the damn prick?

168
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,570
We need to find evidence first.

169
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,630
Let's start from the top.

170
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,070
And where's that?

171
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,280
The crime scene.

172
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,100
What is it?

173
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,060
It's caustic soda.

174
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,880
The scene is such a mess.

175
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,570
Would there still be evidence?

176
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,940
Detective.

177
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,900
Thank you so much.

178
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,260
Let's go.

185
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,710
<i>♪ The boat horn of farewell cries out ♪</i>

186
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,310
Isn't that nice!

187
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,920
Come on, stop crying.

188
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,180
I promise you
I'll arrest Viper within three days.

189
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,510
You don't have any evidence.
You don't even have the murder weapon.

190
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,020
Then we'll go find the weapon, right?

191
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,680
It'll be hard to find
if they hid it really well.

192
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,350
Come on, you…

193
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,400
All we have left is Sungchil.

194
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,820
We have to stay on high alert.
At this rate, we'll lose Viper.

195
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,240
But can't Sungchil…

196
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,910
Can't he have an autopsy done on him?

197
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,460
I read about it
in American mystery novels.

198
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,790
We could do it,

199
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,340
but it's not like the books.

200
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,550
It won't directly tell us who killed him.

201
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,840
I observed an autopsy once,
and it wasn't that helpful.

202
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,350
Should we still have it done just in case?

203
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,810
Never mind it.
It'll just hurt his grandmother even more.

204
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,560
Let's convince her

205
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,190
and have it done.

206
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,150
- What?
- Like I said,

207
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,820
all we have left is Sungchil's body.

208
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Ma'am.

209
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,450
There's this thing called an autopsy.

210
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,830
It may help us find out…

211
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,960
It may help find out how Sungchil died.

212
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,420
And to do that,
we'll have to look inside his body.

213
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,180
You don't need to agree if it's too much.

214
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,680
We won't do it if you say no.

215
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,100
You don't have to agree to it
if it upsets you, ma'am.

216
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,770
Get it done.

217
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,150
If it'll help catch his killer,

218
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,990
it must be done.

219
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,240
Thank you.

220
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,290
I promise you I'll catch his murderer.

221
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,500
That's a promise.

222
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,880
Thank you for telling me
that you'll stop at nothing.

223
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,930
I cannot thank you enough.

224
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,870
National Forensic Service

225
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,540
The body reveals the truth

226
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,190
We found a total of eight stab wounds.

227
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,760
The cause of death is likely
excessive bleeding from the wounds.

228
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,220
I must say, I've never seen
a more brutal death in my career.

229
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,890
Whoever stabbed him
must have suffered injuries on their hand.

230
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,650
No, I'll suffer bad luck!

231
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,190
You're nothing but bad luck, you snake.

232
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,860
The width and depth
of the blade are worth noting

233
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,870
as the wounds are very narrow and long.

234
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,330
This suggests
that the weapon wasn't an ordinary knife.

235
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,000
Look here.

236
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,580
And here.

237
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,460
There are also bruises.

238
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,670
Those bruises
can't have been caused by impact.

239
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,350
Those are what you see in wrestling

240
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,890
when the thigh bands are too tight.

241
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,000
- Stand still, Detective Kim.
- All right.

242
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,060
Grab his arm and pull,
Detective Jo.

243
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,150
Okay.

244
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,010
There were at least three.

245
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,160
One guy stabbed him,

246
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,030
and two held him still.

247
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,540
Do you see this reddish part?

248
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,200
It's some sort of rash.

249
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,170
It looks like a burn wound
but not an ordinary one.

250
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,380
Perhaps from chemicals?

251
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,760
Wait, we found caustic soda
in the water at the crime scene.

252
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,210
Caustic soda could cause a burn like this.

253
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,180
We'll end the external examination here

254
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,320
and proceed with the internal examination.

255
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,580
I'll pray for you…

256
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,580
that you be born into…

257
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,540
a good, wealthy family…

258
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,380
in your next life, Sungchil.

259
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,460
Don't even pretend to know me…

260
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,930
all right?

261
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,890
Ma'am…

262
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,770
You won't have to care about spelling
where you are now.

263
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,400
I hope you're free and happy there.

264
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,650
Elementary Korean

265
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,530
I brought you new shoes…

266
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,370
for your journey.

267
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,710
Sungchil!

268
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,680
Sungchil!

269
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,730
Viper.

270
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,440
Rattlesnake.

271
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,610
White Snake.

272
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,740
If there were three,
it's obvious they were the ones.

273
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,660
Can't we just interrogate them?

274
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,290
Since Viper's stuck at the hospital,
let's grill the other two first.

275
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,870
You saw how those thugs
all barged in here to rescue their boss.

276
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,080
We need a foolproof plan.

277
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,250
- Finding the murder weapon is crucial.
- You're right, sir.

278
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,260
It says that without a murder weapon,
the prosecution becomes unlikely

279
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,720
and leads to a lighter sentence.

280
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Did the autopsy reveal
anything about the weapon?

281
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,890
Right.

282
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,770
The depth and width of the wounds

283
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,490
suggest the knife wasn't an ordinary one.

284
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,980
They said the blade
is likely narrow and long.

285
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,820
Then it's Viper.

286
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,410
The knife you described

287
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,320
was Lee Jungjae's gift to him.

288
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,910
<i>When he was divvying up territories,</i>

289
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,250
<i>Lee Jungjae gave his closest men
knives inscribed with the word</i> "hwarang."

290
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,580
Viper always carried that knife with him.

291
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,170
So he used it for the murder and hid it.

292
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,920
He hid it, not got rid of it?

293
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,710
It's not easy to get rid of weapons.

294
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,320
You'd have to go out to the sea
to throw it out there.

295
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,050
If you throw it into a stream,
people will find it in daylight.

296
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,350
Then he just may have buried it somewhere.

297
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,200
I wish we could just lock those snakes up

298
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,850
and beat them to death.

299
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,150
Tsk.

300
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,150
Wait. It's raining.

301
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,990
Wait, Yeonghan!

302
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,700
I'll get you an umbrella.

303
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,250
Let him be.

304
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,340
I just hope…

305
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,050
the rain can wash away
what he's feeling inside.

306
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,520
- What's wrong?
- Shush!

307
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,560
Take a look.

308
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,940
Black, black, black, white, white, white.

309
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,950
May you be moved by Yin and Yang

310
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,450
and bring us all prosperity!

311
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,740
Black, black, black.

312
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,870
White, white, white.

313
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,000
- What's he doing right now?
- May you be moved by Yin and Yang…

314
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,790
And you call yourself a cop?

315
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,290
It's all the rage these days.

316
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,510
The entire neighborhood is offering
their savings and property deeds.

317
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,170
So you're telling me…

318
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,260
The people at the market
and even boarders are offering their money

319
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,120
to the Church of Black and White?

320
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,060
People are out of their minds these days.

321
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,640
So how are you
going to take advantage of that?

322
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,690
It doesn't make any sense to me,

323
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,650
but based on their logic…

324
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,900
they'd retrieve the hidden knife
if their god told them to, no?

325
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,990
Uh…

326
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,780
But how?

327
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,620
You could use the cult leader.

328
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,830
But I have no idea
what kind of person it could be.

329
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,500
I remember
Detective Oh was trying to dig dirt

330
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,750
- on that cult before.
- Really?

331
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,340
Who's Detective Oh?

332
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,310
Is it just me or am I being interrogated?

333
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,100
Detective Oh.

334
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,810
Yes?

335
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,780
What have you found out about this church?

336
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,940
The Church of Black and White?

337
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,740
Let's see, the Church…

338
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,280
I did dig into it,

339
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,030
but I found nothing.

340
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,580
How is that possible?

341
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,700
The thing is…

342
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,710
its leader came from heaven, so…

343
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,080
You're a detective!

344
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,960
It's actually miraculous.

345
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,750
That church can fix anything.

346
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,590
I witnessed it with my own two eyes.

347
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,360
Do your two eyes need some fixing?

348
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,430
What did you just say?

349
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,800
Get out. Move.

350
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,220
- Hey, get out.
- Unbelievable.

351
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,640
Come on, out of my way.

352
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,480
I told you to get out!

353
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,370
I might as well tell you one more thing
if you are going to dig.

354
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,780
- Some say he rose from the ground.
- Are you kidding me?

355
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,070
- You punk.
- That's what I heard.

356
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,570
- The rumors say so.
- This Church of Black and White…

357
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,240
Where is it?

358
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,330
<i>Damn, that's a big one.</i>

359
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,330
I really don't know!

360
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,000
Well…

361
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,550

00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,300
Black, black, black, white, white, white.

363
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,200
Simply believe in me.

364
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,950
- With your firm faith in me…
- May you be moved by Yin and Yang

365
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,730
- and bring us all prosperity!
- …I shall perform miracles upon you!

366
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,730
Black, black, black, black, black, black.

367
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,230
White, white, white.

368
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,110
May you be moved by Yin and Yang

369
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,820
and bring us all prosperity!

370
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,570
Black, black, black, and, and, and

371
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,080
white, white, white.

372
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,620
May you be moved by Yin and Yang

373
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,460
and bring us all prosperity!

374
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,330
Black, black, black, and, and, and

375
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,960
white, white, white.

376
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,840
May you be moved by Yin and Yang

377
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,590
and bring us all prosperity!

378
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,590
Black, black, black, and, and, and

379
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,050
white, white, white.

380
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,850
May you be moved by Yin and Yang

381
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,520
and bring us all prosperity!

382
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,310
Look over there. It's Rattlesnake.

383
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,400
Now, with his power to heal,

384
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,320
our leader shall perform a miracle

385
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,990
upon this man who was born a cripple!

386
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,100
I shall set you free from your suffering.

387
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,640
Ward off, illness.

388
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,310
Ward off, illness.

389
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,730
Ward off, illness.

390
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,030
It worked!

391
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,620
It worked! He has healed!

392
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,460
That's 500.

393
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,210
A 100, and another 100.

394
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
Hey, cripple.

395
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,800
You better work on your acting.
It doesn't feel…

396
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,070
Goodness. You're here, Your Eminence.

397
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,760
Jeez.

398
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,510
That pillow was too hard.

399
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,060
I've got a cramp.
Could you fix this for me? Ow.

400
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,730
Who keeps money in a chamber pot?
That's got to smell.

401
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,570
Last week, this "blind woman" made 30 <i>hwan</i>

402
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:27,200
and the "cripple" made 50 <i>hwan</i> today.

403
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,070
Who are you all?

404
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,330
Who do you think?
We're people seeking miracles.

405
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,410
You're sure
you can actually perform miracles, right?

406
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,710
You of little faith!
How dare you doubt god's messenger?

407
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,290
You will die a sudden death.

408
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,420
No, that's not what I meant.

409
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,130
It's just really odd
how dirty the cripple's feet are

410
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,050
when he can't even stand.

411
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,090
I thought maybe it was a scam.

412
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,220
Your Eminence.

413
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,100
This man has been possessed by a dog.

414
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,900
Do you think
you could exorcize it from him?

415
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,350
He just keeps biting people.

416
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,900
I'll give you five seconds to do it.

417
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,830
I am much too exhausted today
to perform any more miracles.

418
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,680
There is a time for everything.
You can't just barge in here.

419
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,790
What?

420
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,250
- What's going on?
- Don't move.

421
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,630
You talk too much.

422
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,300
Listen.

423
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,300
We're looking for a particular knife.

424
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,350
And I need you to find that for me.

425
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Yes!

426
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,500
Ouch!

427
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,380
Damn it!

428
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,350
Daesong Barbershop

429
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,480
Hey!

430
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,110
Hey, hey!

431
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,240
Hey, hey, stop!

432
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,450
Damn it.

433
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,160
DONGBU JAAE HOSPITAL

434
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,840
Is that you, Great Leader?

435
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,230
You deserve to have your limbs torn off…

436
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,600
…to get hit by lightning…

437
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,930
…and to have all your organs strewn out!

438
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,100
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me!

439
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,940
Beware of water, fire, dogs,

440
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,480
cars, alcohol, knives, guns, horses,

441
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,230
diseases and natural disasters!

442
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,950
Are… Are those the only things
I need to be wary of?

443
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,200
There's one more thing.

444
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,120
Beware of the wrath
of the innocent soul that has passed.

445
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,000
If you fail to obey
the command I've written here,

446
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,920
you will suffer a greater ordeal.

447
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:42,970
"The grudge of an innocent soul
is contained within you."

448
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,140
<i>"Find the source of the grudge…"</i>

449
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,790
Damn it.

450
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,440
- Is this the right spot?
- Yes.

451
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,940
I found it.

452
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,570
- I found it!
- Really?

453
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,780
You punk. Are you blind?

454
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,700
Who's there?

455
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,630
Damn it. All right then.

456
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,300
- Goodness.
- Hey, you.

457
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,710
You little punk.

458
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Keep digging.

459
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,980
You better find the knife.

460
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,170
I found it.

461
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,590
Really?

462
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,350
Hwarang

463
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,320
I hope

464
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,820
I'm not causing any trouble here.

465
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,410
Trouble? Don't say that.
With the election drawing near,

466
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,410
it's best to get rid of any problems.

467
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,660
Of course.

468
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,910
Since issuing warrants is the remit
of the Prosecution Service,

469
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,870
I will keep things in check.

470
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,300
I feel such a sense of relief
hearing you say that.

471
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,260
What do you mean
a warrant won't be issued, sir?

472
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,470
The Prosecution Service won't be issuing
any warrants whatsoever

473
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,600
against the Dongdaemun gang,

474
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,600
so don't waste your energy.

475
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,100
But Viper is a suspect in a murder case!

476
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,770
Listen. If things go wrong,

477
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,860
you and your whole unit
could lose your lives, understand?

478
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:06,620
Dongbu Jaae Hospital
Emergency Room

479
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,910
What? Where on earth are these guys?

480
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,220
- Hey.
- Ouch.

481
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,440
What's with the crutch?
You don't even need it.

482
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,270
Not you bunch again.

483
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,360
Did you think we wouldn't find it?

484
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,870
We have evidence, Chief.

485
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,740
It took us ages to dig it out.

486
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,000
- Chief Yu.
- What?

487
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,060
Where are you going, sir?

488
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,420
As long as you're in this country,

489
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,010
you won't be getting any warrants
against the Dongdaemun gang.

490
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,840
What kind of bullcrap is that?

491
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,990
- What did you say?
- Calm down, Chief.

492
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:13,020
It's all measures to protect Chairman Lee
from slanderers like you two.

493
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,730
No need to say more. Let him go.

494
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,520
No, we're not letting him go.

495
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,980
You do it then, Detective Hwang.

496
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,150
Yes, sir.

497
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,110
Goodness.

498
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,200
I hear Chairman Lee…

499
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,530
recently won a contract
to supply the Armed Forces Command.

500
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,120
Everyone connected to our boss
is going to make a killing now.

501
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,790
What a load of crap.

502
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,130
Sangsun.

503
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Hey.

504
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,720
What kind of a pathetic cop
can't get a warrant, huh?

505
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,640
It's too bad for you…

506
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,230
because I killed him.

507
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,610
- Hey.
- Why?

508
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,070
Are you going to beat me up again?
Go ahead.

509
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,490
Do it. Come on.

510
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,620
I'm telling you

511
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,750
- I'm going to get you no matter what.
- Whatever you say, man.

512
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,250
But do bring a warrant next time.

513
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,460
Let's go.

514
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,540
Yes, boss.

515
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,460
Have a nice day.

516
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,850
Jongnam Bookstore

517
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,920
Why didn't you come in?

518
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,880
I'll bring you warm water.

519
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,260
You should dry yourself.

520
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,680
All I wanted…

521
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,230
was to keep the people closest to me
from dying in vain.

522
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,650
I wanted criminals to be punished,

523
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,530
no matter what.

524
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,240
That's why I joined the police.

525
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,740
And those are rules
I've never broken until now.

526
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,450
But…

527
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,380
a friend I held dear died.

528
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,630
I know who killed him…

529
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,600
…but there's nothing I can do.

530
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,270
I shouldn't have been reckless
when I first arrested him.

531
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,150
I should have…

532
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,940
approached it more rationally.

533
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,780
You couldn't…

534
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,580
because it was Sungchil.

535
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,380
I should've found out
where the knife was hidden first.

536
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,500
I call myself a detective,

537
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,970
and all I did
was dive head first like a fool.

538
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:38,430
You can't account for everything
just because you're a detective.

539
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,560
Maybe I should turn in my badge
and kill all of them.

540
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,110
Or I should just eliminate all of them
without anyone knowing.

541
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,610
That's all I can think about these days.

542
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,660
Have you even eaten today?

543
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,630
Come on, let's head out.

544
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,090
Let's go get some food first.

545
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,430
Even when I spent sleepless nights
trying to catch cow thieves,

546
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,100
I didn't feel this way.

547
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,270
I know I need to catch the killer…

548
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:26,770
but I don't know
where to start or what to do.

549
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,130
Jeez.

550
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,710
Come on in.

551
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,840
We're having a drink.

552
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,970
- Would you like to join?
- No, thanks. Not today.

553
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,970
Please join us, Detective Park.

554
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,510
He failed the exam. Come on.

555
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,770
I offered up
three months' worth of rent to that cult.

556
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,610
I deserve to die.

557
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:16,240
See, you should've told me
you had all that money.

558
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,950
I could've opened a savings account
at the bank for you.

559
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,410
Stop talking about dying, all right?

560
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,710
You can take the exam again next year!

561
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,340
At least you get another chance.

562
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,880
But me?

563
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,630
I can't get a warrant,
so I won't get a chance.

564
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,600
Warrants aren't a big deal.

565
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,100
Why don't you just ask for one?

566
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,560
You see,
this country is rotten to the bone.

567
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,940
No prosecutor is willing to issue
a warrant for the prick.

568
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,820
Well, that's easy.

569
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,900
Then ask another country for a warrant.

570
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,820
They'll want to catch bad guys too.

571
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,830
Gukjin.

572
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,460
What did you just say?

573
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,420
Another country?

574
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,880
What's with the American flag?

575
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,300
I found a way
to catch that damned snake, sir.

576
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,690
We make him commit an international crime.

577
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,470
Lee Jungjae will be helpless
in such a case.

578
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,060
How would we do that?

579
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,350
Viper's turf is no bigger than Jongnam.

580
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,940
There's a way. Gather up.

581
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,530
That's good.

582
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,340
Jongnam Market Merchants' Association
Annex Groundbreaking Ceremony

583
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,330
- Is everything ready?
- You're here, boss.

584
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,120
It looks terrific, boss.

585
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,580
You notice how peaceful it is
without that Park Yeonghan meddling?

586
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,120
- You're right.
- Yes, boss.

587
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,170
Now that those annoying punks
are out of the way,

588
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,920
we just have to focus on the ceremony.

589
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:10,310
Boys, let's go! Head out, move!

590
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,440
Where are you off to, sir?

591
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:14,480
I'm your chief. I can't let you go alone.

592
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,360
Just stay here. You're getting up in age.

593
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,700
Come on, I told you I was
the Steel Hammer of Mapo back in the day.

594
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,450
Will you fight with a hammer today, sir?

595
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:23,950
All right, let's go.

596
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,490
All right. Let's go!

597
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,580
Move out!

598
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,250
Jongnam Police Station

599
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,760
The groundbreaking ceremony
for the annex building

600
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:50,640
of the Jongnam Market
Merchants' Association will begin now.

601
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,100
Please welcome the regional director,
Ou Samryong, on stage.

602
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,190
Give him a big hand!

603
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,360
Clap harder!

604
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,360
That's enough. Enough.

605
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,450
Thank you all for coming here
despite your busy schedules

606
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,410
with the construction of...

607
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,660
I heard
the construction is all screwed up!

608
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

609
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,620
Today's ceremony is over,

610
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,540
- so you may now leave.
- You can go.

611
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,130
Feel free to leave.

612
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,210
Go home now.

613
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,510
Hey, why didn't we get
an invite to the party?

614
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,260
Why are you all here?

615
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,250
You don't even have a warrant.

616
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,650
We're not here as cops today.

617
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,810
All badges off,

618
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,070
- let's just fight this out.
- Sounds good to me.

619
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,240
But give me an hour, will you?
This is an important event.

620
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:47,030
You see, we're a little busy.

621
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:48,820
So I'll just go ahead.

622
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,040
Hey.

623
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:57,210
Stop him. Stop him!

624
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,790
Deal with him! Go!

625
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,560
These damn pricks must have a death wish.

626
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,340
Damn it. Get off me!

627
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,550
- Rescue… Help.
- US Army, please.

628
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,810
- Uh, soldier… attack.
- Yeah.

629
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:55,930
You little leech.

630
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,390
- Let go.
- Stop hanging on to me!

631
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,180
It's the American soldiers, boss!

632
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,990
Why on earth would they be here?

633
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,370
Hands up!
You're attacking American soldiers.

634
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,250
- What did he say?
- The US Army.

635
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:21,580
You attacked an American soldier.

636
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,960
What bullcrap is that?
I see no Americans here.

637
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,920
Here.

638
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,510
I'm an American, you punk.

639
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,800
Who's this prick?

640
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,600
<i>It can't be done.</i>

641
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:40,640
We can't just detain
a South Korean citizen

642
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,020
and discriminate
within the US military police.

643
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,610
This would violate
the South Korea and US agreement

644
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,240
and could lead to diplomatic issues.

645
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,570
He says it violates the Korea-US agreement

646
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,240
and could lead to diplomatic issues.

647
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:58,000
We're not asking the American forces
to punish Viper.

648
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,710
We just need you

649
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:04,750
to buy us a little bit of time
before we can take him away.

650
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,260
We are asking only for some time

651
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,050
until we can bring him.

652
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,640
Just… three hours.

653
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,720
Uh…

654
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,680
Two hours.

655
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,110
Lieutenant.

656
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,230
A soldier who keeps his word

657
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,650
is a truly honorable soldier,

658
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,450
wouldn't you agree?

659
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,090
I was helping my friends

660
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,280
and these gangsters just attacked me.

661
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,240
Understood. We'll contact you later.

662
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:40,790
Okay.

663
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,640
Steve, thank you from the Steel Hammer!

664
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:47,090
We get it, Chief Yu.

665
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,270
You don't have to bring it up so much.

666
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,300
Thank you!

667
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,880
We couldn't have done this
without you, Lieutenant.

668
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,470
Thank you so much.

669
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,100
We couldn't make it
if Lieutenant didn't help us. Thank you.

670
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,310
Korean gangsters…

671
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:04,020
…are no big deal.

672
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,270
Hey, Steve!

673
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,180
Let's do it again another time?

674
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,320
No. Our friendship ends here.

675
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,070
Good luck, okay?

676
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,660
Bye, Steve.

677
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:19,970
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

678
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,250
Battalion Commander's Office

679
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,150
May we enter, Commander?

680
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,010
I understand. All right.

681
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,130
Salute.

682
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:34,300
My apologies.

683
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,640
That was an urgent call.

684
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:42,390
Here I am
with our country's preeminent war hero.

685
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:43,480
It's an honor.

686
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,190
You flatter me too much.
I'm simply just a humble soldier.

687
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:48,360
You are too kind.

688
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,190
Just a humble soldier?

689
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,190
I hear that you are a star on the rise

690
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,070
with your patriotism,
youth, and formidable leadership.

691
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,080
My expectations are high
for you, Commander.

692
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,450
Thank you.

693
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,290
I myself had been searching
for an army contractor.

694
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,750
Meeting you like this, Chairman Lee,

695
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:11,420
I feel a sense of relief in my heart.

696
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,510
Thanks to your cooperation
with the contract,

697
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:17,090
preparations for my nomination
have gone smoothly.

698
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,390
You can trust me to handle
any military affairs.

699
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:23,680
Anything outside of the military,
I'll trust you to handle for me.

700
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,310
I will certainly make sure
to repay my gratitude to you

701
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,400
so you are not disappointed.

702
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:31,650
Thank you, sir.

703
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:33,230
Now, if you'll sign the contract…

704
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,280
Just a moment.

705
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:43,910
Sir,

706
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:45,160
there's been a clash

707
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,290
between an American soldier
and the Dongdaemun gang.

708
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:54,880
Get out.

709
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,960
Yes, sir.

710
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:04,350
I'm sure it's a trivial matter.

711
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:09,310
I'll take good care of it.

712
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,450
Uh…

713
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,830
Do remember.

714
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,120
Please do keep in mind…

715
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:31,000
that both of our fates…

716
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:36,090
hang on this contract.

717
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,340
Understood.

718
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:40,930
Good.

719
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:53,860
Hey, do you even know who I am?

720
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:57,570
I'm Chairman Lee Jungjae's right-hand man!

721
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,740
This is Korea.

722
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,660
I'll be out soon, and when I do,

723
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,240
you pricks are all dead to me.

724
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,000
- I know your faces.
- Shut up!

725
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,720
<i>What do you mean?
How is it impossible to get him out?</i>

726
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:12,670
He was unaware. Perhaps you could explain…

727
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,270
<i>This is no small matter.
Your man assaulted an American soldier.</i>

728
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,230
<i>There's nothing you can do
but wait for their decision.</i>

729
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,460
<i>And that's that.</i>

730
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,350
- Sir.
- What is it?

731
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,810
A Jongnam detective is here to see you.

732
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,560
Your reputation precedes you.

733
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,610
I could say the same for you.

734
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,730
Judging by the look in your eyes…

735
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,320
I can see why my men suffered hardship.

736
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:47,330
Hardship is what one experiences
when life is much too hard.

737
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,580
What you mean is punishment
you thugs deserved for your crimes.

738
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:56,340
Should I call this rashness or bravery?

739
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,840
I'm not here to be rash or brave.

740
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:02,970
Chairman Lee,
ruler of the heavens and the earth,

741
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,470
I'm here to humbly offer you a proposal.

742
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,260
A proposal?

743
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:11,810
What could an ordinary detective
possibly offer me?

744
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:13,190
What if I do?

745
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,060
Then I'll eagerly accept it.

746
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:17,770
But if you don't,

747
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,490
you won't leave this place in one piece.

748
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:24,700
You rule over the heavens and the earth,

749
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,600
but there is one thing
you're not capable of ruling over.

750
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:29,330
The Daechang Daily.

751
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:34,040
I've acquired their draft
for tomorrow's headlines.

752
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,970
You've shut down
any mention of the ceremony,

753
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,560
except for that one.

754
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,000
Right-hand man of Dongdaemun's Lee Jungjae
arrested after assaulting American soldier

755
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,110
What is it that you want?

756
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,280
Does that mean
I leave this place in one piece?

757
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:20,610
I'm going to kill that prick
from Hwangchun for good this time.

758
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:23,750
Will you really?

759
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,880
Ou Samryong.

760
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,720
You're under arrest
for the murder of Kim Sungchil.

761
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:34,100
You know how this works.

762
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,100
Put them on yourself.

763
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,230
You got a warrant?

764
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,690
Show it to him, Hojeong.

765
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,400
Do you see your name?

766
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,080
<i>Ou</i> for "fish,"
<i>Sam</i> for "three," and <i>ryong</i> for "ant."

767
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,830
You're no Viper of Yongmoon Mountain.

768
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,090
You're just a damn ant!

769
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:07,090
It's yours, isn't it?

770
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:09,760
D-Do you have proof?

771
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,550
More than enough.

772
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,940
This wound on your cheek.

773
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:20,980
Hey, you rebel!

774
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,070
It is you. What are you up to?

775
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,780
Why are you here?

776
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,780
Get lost, Triangle Head.

777
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,110
I just missed you too much, kid.

778
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,070
How have you been?

779
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:55,740
What's wrong?

780
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,140
Get him. Go get him!

781
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:59,910
<i>The bruises you left on his body</i>

782
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,560
<i>when your men grabbed Sungchil's arms
to hold him still.</i>

783
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:14,990
<i>And…</i>

784
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,000
this cut on your hand
from when you stabbed him.

785
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,170
It's not that we didn't have proof.

786
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,380
It just took us time
to get a prick like you locked up.

787
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,720
There's something I've learned
while dealing with you.

788
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:43,100
There's no punk in this world
that can't be caught.

789
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:48,610
<i>"The men who murdered Kim
at Jongnam Market have been arrested,</i>

790
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:52,490
<i>namely the Dongdaemun gang's
number two Ou, Bang, and Chu.</i>

791
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:57,280
<i>Investigation revealed that the men used
a lethal weapon for the murder.</i>

792
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,360
<i>An autopsy conducted
by the National Forensic Service,</i>

793
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:03,540
<i>an institute founded in 1955
under the Ministry of Home Affairs,</i>

794
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:07,540
<i>revealed that Mr. Ou was not alone
in committing the crime.</i>

795
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,170
Based on this information,
Unit 1 of the Jongnam Police Station

796
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,140
was finally able to apprehend Mr. Ou."

797
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:21,640
Thank you.

798
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,860
I'm sorry.

799
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,160
Please forgive me.

800
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,660
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

801
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:49,500
Everything is fine now,
now that they've been caught.

802
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,810
Drink up, Sungchil.

803
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,900
Goodness.

804
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,000
<i>Hey, why are you always so happy?</i>

805
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,540
My father was a slave.

806
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,260
Back in the day, I would've been one too,

807
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,510
but that's all history now.

808
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:40,010
I couldn't be happier
making money selling rice cakes.

809
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,470
If the world changes for the better,

810
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,100
who's to say
someone like me can't become rich?

811
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:48,290
I'm going to learn how to read and write,
read a lot of books,

812
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,730
and expand Grandma's rice cake shop.

813
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:56,610
I wish I could live in a world

814
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:01,740
where people like you gain riches
instead of those who steal from others.

815
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,120
But you'll catch all those scumbags,
won't you?

816
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,660
Of course. I'll beat them all up.

817
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,790
Then a simple boy like me
could become rich soon

818
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,960
and let Grandma live comfortably.

819
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:19,470
Life would be so exciting
if only that could happen, wouldn't it?

820
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,810
Yes, I'm sure such a day will come.

821
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:28,310
It will.

822
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:32,270
- I'll pour you a drink.
- All right.

823
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,520
Thank you.

824
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,320
I'll go now.

825
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,540
That military contract wasn't easy to win.

826
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,840
You can't mess this up
like you did with the smuggling.

827
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,880
You may rest easy, sir.

828
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,970
There won't be any problems this time.

829
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,340
Any problems that could arise

830
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:03,510
would get in the way
of Commander Baek's career.

831
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,220
And he's an essential figure
we need on our side.

832
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,560
Understood, sir.

833
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:10,190
I'll handle it without a hitch.

834
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:26,240
Damn, what's this bum doing?

835
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,670
Hey, get out of the way.

836
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:38,380
Out of the way, you bum.

837
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,960
Are you deaf?

838
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,880
- Me?
- Who else is there?

839
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,390
Hey!

840
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:47,760
Let's go!

841
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:51,730
What's going on?

842
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:52,890
Get off, you bums!

843
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,110
Get off me, you punk!

844
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:04,660
There you go.

845
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,280
Get off me!

846
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:12,660
Good job. Let's go.

847
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,260
Let me go, you scumbags!

848
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,720
Step aside.

849
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,800
Get on!

850
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,480
Here we go.

851
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:55,210
Yes?

852
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,290
What? Beggars?

853
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,440
<i>Here is today's headline news.</i>

854
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:05,090
<i>Military supplies
meant for the Armed Forces Command</i>

855
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:07,010
<i>are being secretly traded in Seoul.</i>

856
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,150
<i>The supplies include</i>

857
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:24,280
<i>items such as expensive liquor
and premium nylon socks.</i>

858
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,910
<i>The military authorities
have announced severe measures</i>

859
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:30,030
- <i>against those responsible</i>.
- Get out.

860
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,410
<i>Here is the next news item.</i>

861
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,090
<i>Large amounts have recently been donated</i>

862
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,000
<i>to orphanages in Seoul
under the name Hong Gildong.</i>

863
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:40,840
<i>President Rhee Syngman has promised</i>

864
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,420
<i>to reward the mystery figure when found.</i>

865
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:45,820
- Let's drink.
- Cheers!

866
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,760
Wait, I've brought some more rice wine!

867
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,260
Did you walk the storeowner home?

868
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:54,720
Yes, and Hyeju even bought us
two more kettles.

869
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:02,150
Did you ever take a bullet
for Senior Superintendent Choi, sir?

870
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:05,940
That's what I'm wondering.
You've always been on Dongdaemun's case.

871
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:08,240
How are you still employed?

872
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,490
What's your secret, sir?

873
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,620
Senior Superintendent Choi…

874
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:14,990
has a secret only I know.

875
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,500
What is it?

876
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,500
Have you boys heard of Sinkwang Society?

877
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:22,040
Sinkwang? Is that
a book club or something?

878
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:23,930
Remember the pro-Japanese orphanage

879
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,240
that Audrey Ko used to run
was also once Sinkwang Academy.

880
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:28,680
Well, this society
is also a pro-Japanese group.

881
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,550
The members all help each other
get into high positions.

882
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,140
Senior Superintendent Choi
happens to be one of them.

883
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:38,220
Did you find this out
when you were special police?

884
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:40,600
That man can't ever touch me.

885
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,730
The moment he does,
I'm going to spill everything I know.

886
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,360
Unit 2 might have
Senior Superintendent Choi,

887
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,150
but we have Chief Yu on our side!

888
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,450
Chief Yu is on our side!

889
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:54,200
We'll entrust you, Chief Yu!

890
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,120
- Cheers to that!
- Cheers!

891
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,290
Jongnam Bookstore

892
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:58,620
Jeez.

893
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,420
Are you down for round two, sir?

894
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,670
I've seen enough of your faces.
I'm heading home first.

895
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,380
- See you all.
- Take care, sir.

896
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:07,500
Goodbye, sir.

897
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:09,970
I was hoping he'd buy the second round.

898
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:13,340
Let's go to the rice wine shop
so I can see Soonnam. Woof, woof!

899
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:14,930
Soonnam is so adorable.

900
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:19,890
What's this?

901
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:34,280
Is this the day I die?

902
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,660
I'll give you a choice.

903
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,870
Either die or work for me
and chase fortune and glory.

904
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:45,460
Those are some extreme choices.

905
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:47,670
It's all or nothing for us.

906
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:50,800
Then I choose death.

907
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,640
And you won't regret it?

908
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,930
I could ask you the same question,
Chairman Lee.

909
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,680
The thing about punches is

910
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:01,680
that the stronger you let fly,

911
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:04,900
the more likely you'll hit yourself
with an errant fist.

912
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,820
You'll soon pay with your life

913
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,280
for refusing this opportunity.

914
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,400
We'll see.

915
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:20,950
Ooh.

916
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:23,500
- Those punks.
- Jeez.

917
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,290
Goodness, I was so scared.

918
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:27,590
If you die,

919
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:29,550
who would we get rice wine with?

920
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,920
Will you guys protect me then?

921
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:33,300
- Of course.
- Yes.

922
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,050
Let's go.

923
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:40,970
I wish I could end those Dongdaemun punks.

924
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,470
Damn those guys.

925
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:45,400
Yeonghan.

926
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:49,770
Women always love big and fancy gestures.

927
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,740
That's ridiculous.
You don't know a thing about women.

928
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:54,490
I know more than you.

929
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:57,820
What kind of
big and fancy gestures, exactly?

930
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,870
Propose to her
with a huge bouquet this big

931
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:03,200
or a shiny ring,
and she'll go crazy with joy.

932
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,460
Then ask her to marry you

933
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,670
in a romantic way.

934
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,420
Well…

935
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:11,880
give me an example.

936
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:23,220
"I'd like to swim in your eyes
for the rest of my life."

937
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:27,560
Her eyeballs are going to fall out
if he does that, man!

938
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:30,980
I swear it works.

939
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,440
- Really?
- Yes.

940
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,240
I wonder why you're still single.

941
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:40,450
- What?
- Huh.

942
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:41,830
I wonder so too.

943
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:45,790
What's going on with Hojeong?

944
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,790
Did you eat chili? Yes, you did.

945
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,800
You're making me lose my appetite.

946
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:57,340
Yeonghan, remember to use
the line I taught you.

947
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:58,550
Okay.

948
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,310
"I'd like to swim in your eyes

949
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:04,470
- for the rest of my life."
- Mm.

950
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:23,790
"Hyeju.

951
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:29,540
I'd like to swim in your eyes
for the rest of my life."

952
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Here I go.

953
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:46,970
Welcome.

954
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,600
Detective Park!

955
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:56,320
I guess you're not too busy today.

956
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,740
I was wondering
if I should wait at the rice wine shop.

957
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,530
Your…

958
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,530
- eyes…
- My eyes?

959
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,910
Your eyes…

960
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,040
Is there something I need to see?

961
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:13,420
There's nothing worth seeing outside.

962
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:19,380
By the way, why are your clothes so light?

963
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:20,760
It's freezing out there.

964
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:27,130
It looks good on you.

965
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:29,560
It's warm, isn't it?

966
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:32,190
Wear this from now on, okay?

967
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:36,320
I like you.

968
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:40,950
That was out of the blue.

969
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:43,870
I always want to be with you.

970
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,410
I'm sorry for making you wait
all the time.

971
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:51,370
Making a woman wait is a crime…

972
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:55,590
but I can let you off the hook
since you're a detective.

973
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:58,420
This might sound like an excuse…

974
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:03,050
and it may sound too selfish of me…

975
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:05,680
but in the days to come,

976
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:09,770
I'll have to make you wait for me
all too many times.

977
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:13,020
I may find myself in danger.

978
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:19,690
And I may never return,
without even getting to say goodbye.

979
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:23,700
But if you'll

980
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,820
forgive me then…

981
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,420
And if you could trust me…

982
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,420
let's get married.

983
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:06,740
Just promise me one thing.

984
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,540
You can be late,

985
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,460
but make sure you come back to me.

986
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,300
Okay, I promise.

987
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:49,410
Yeonghan!

988
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:51,330
I'll be good to her!

989
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:08,840
Could the father
of the groom smile a bit more?

990
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:11,470
One, two, three!

991
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,560
Two, three, smile!

992
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,570
<i>On April 19 in the year 1960,</i>

993
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:27,610
<i>incessant protests broke out
denouncing rigged elections</i>

994
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,320
<i>and the autocratic government's crimes</i>

995
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:31,070
<i>against its own people for 12 years.</i>

996
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:35,870
<i>The police opened fire on the protesters,
leading to countless casualties</i>

997
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:38,310
<i>and flooding the streets of Seoul
with the blood of martyrs.</i>

998
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:42,130
Second Half of 1960
Open Recruitment for Policewomen

999
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:51,050
- She's 5 ft 5 in.
- 5 ft 5 in.

1000
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,640
Next.

1001
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:00,270
Ready.

1002
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:14,990
I won't let you down. I'll do my best!

1003
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,490
You got this.

1004
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:20,770
I'll give the job my best!

1005
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,540
What?

1006
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,040
Grab him!

1007
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,520
Who are you punks?

1008
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,240
You little…

1009
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:33,450
Who are you?

1010
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:35,700
Who are you punks?

1011
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,830
Hey!

1012
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:37,090
Chief Detective 1958

1013
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:39,650
<i>Look how much the world has changed,</i>

1014
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,140
<i>but it's like we're stuck.</i>

1015
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,370
<i>Nothing has changed.</i>

1016
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:44,020
<i>We're always the same!</i>

1017
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,560
And we'll do this until we retire.

1018
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,100
Congratulations on your promotion.

1019
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,690
<i>Hey, where's Chief Yu?</i>

1020
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:52,440
<i>Yeonghan, Chief Yu…</i>

1021
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:54,530
<i>What kind of scum would do this?</i>

1022
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:56,690
<i>This has to be
the Dongdaemun gang's doing.</i>

1023
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,040
<i>You're barking up the wrong tree!</i>

1024
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:03,490
<i>We finally have
a new senior superintendent at Jongnam!</i>

1025

<i>He is a former military officer,

1027
