00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,949
Chief Detective 1958

2
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
This series is unrelated to any places,
persons, settings or events.

3
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,953
Scenes involving animals were filmed in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.

4
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,332
Episode 3

5
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,283
Jungil Bank

6
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,208
Closed temporarily

7
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,419
Freeze! Don't move!

8
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,341
Hey, you!

9
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,592
Put the phone down!

10
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,052
Get down on the floor!

11
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,428
Move!

12
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,014
Come on, move!

13
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,099
Move!

14
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,309
Get down.

15
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,435
Get down now!

16
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,187
Who's in charge here?

17
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,776
Who's the manager?

18
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,862
It's… It's me.

19
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,412
Come on, hurry.

20
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,882
Out of the way!

21
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,559
Episode 3
Highwaymen

22
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,644
How'd you get him to join?

23
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,188
Chief Crap allowed it?

24
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,733
He said he was afraid
keeping him would be disastrous,

25
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,735
so he eagerly let us have him.

26
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:39,033
With Zhuge Liang joining our unit,

27
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,785
I feel like I have an army now.

28
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,163
Your parents must be proud of you.

29
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,457
Well, they actually kicked me out, sir.

30
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,794
My father strongly objected
to me becoming a cop.

31
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,546
Get out.

32
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,298
Please don't do this, honey.

33
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,843
How dare you defy me,
just to be some lowly cop?

34
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,805
I will stick to the path I chose, Father.

35
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,682
Why did he object?

36
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,768
He has a negative view of the police.

37
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,026
Let's do our best to change his mind then.

38
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,238
That's right, Detective Seo.
Let your actions change his mind.

39
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,199
Yes, sir.

40
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,492
My goodness, Detective Jo.

41
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,162
It still amazes me how big you are.

42
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,415
I feel such a strong sense of patriotism,

43
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,667
being with you all here.

44
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,128
Well, I've got nothing to worry about.

45
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,379
I trust you all immensely.

46
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,631
You can trust us, sir.

47
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,133
They say trust is the mother of deceit.

48
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,636
Speak of the devil.

49
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,679
Now that Unit 1 is complete,

50
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,058
it's time I give you your first mission.

51
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,143
This is of utmost importance.

52
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,603
Operation Jongnam Market,

53
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,022
"Get rid of all the bums."

54
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,528
Now, move!

55
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,113
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,992
I can't believe
my first mission is getting rid of bums.

57
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,661
My first-ever mission

58
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,248
was fishing an assemblyman's wife's ring
out of a crapper.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,210
Hey, boys.

60
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,045
Does anyone have toothpaste?

61
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,755
What for?

62
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,052
This is such a good idea.
Why didn't I think of it?

63
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,679
What's this even for?

64
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,972
It stings.

65
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,724
You'll find out later.

66
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,893
As cops,

67
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,771
shouldn't we be training
for arrests and shootings?

68
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,357
I'm also excited
to learn how to shoot guns.

69
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,360
You can learn basic stuff like that
on your own time.

70
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:42,240
You can only learn how to be a real cop
by tussling on the streets, all right?

71
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,618
Still, aren't they necessary skills
as cops?

72
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,833
You're right, but…

73
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,379
only one thing should matter
to a detective.

74
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,756
"If I don't solve this case,

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,509
someone's life could be destroyed."

76
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,344
With that in mind,

77
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,264
you could get whooped
and not feel an ounce of pain.

78
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,890
You could stay up for days

79
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,851
and feel as fresh as the morning dew.

80
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,853
That's not all.

81
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,772
Even the heavens above
will be on our side!

82
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,774
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

83
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,569
- Remember this, all right?
- All right.

84
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,696
- Make sure you do!
- Yes, sir.

85
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,989
Let's go then.

86
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,495
There's definitely
something wrong with him.

87
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,294
♪ Hurray, here we all go! ♪

88
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,547
♪ Hurray, here we all go! ♪

89
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,759
♪ The beggar who came last year ♪

90
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,679

♪ The beggar who came last year… ♪

92
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,435
Go away, you bums!

93
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,187
No!

94
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,150
♪ The beggar who came last year ♪

95
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,403

00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,489
♪ Hurray! ♪

97
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,241
Hey, bums. Freeze!

98
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,498
Run!

99
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,625
Come on, run! Move!

100
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,003
I guess we'll have to run too.

101
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,422
Oh, come on.

102
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,262
Hands up!

103
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,142
I get why we have toothpaste
under our noses.

104
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,311
How can they smell so bad?

105
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,562
You punks.

106
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,190
You have to beg fair and square,

107
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,566
not steal from others.

108
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,193
You see,

109
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,071
people are so heartless and cold
these days

110
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,074
that they don't give us anything
even if we sing.

111
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,329
Then you should blame your singing.
You better practice more!

112
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,331
I'm pretty good at it already.

113
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,252
Just because you're a bum

114
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,421
doesn't mean you can't have a conscience.

115
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,047
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,466
Please forgive us.

117
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,180
Hands down.

118
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,687
Since the weather's gloomy and damp today,

119
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,355
I'll let you off the hook.

120
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,982
Do you mean it?

121
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,279
But you need to return
what you stole back to their owners.

122
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,323
And bow down and apologize to them, okay?

123
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,284
Yes, sir.

124
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,202
Thank you!

125
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,871
But don't bow twice.

126
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,917
What are you all doing?
Thank him right now!

127
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,919
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

128
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,254
That's enough. Go.

129
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,844
Aren't we going to arrest them?

130
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,388
Criminals worse than them
don't get arrested.

131
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,514
So why would we take them?

132
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,766
Senior Superintendent Choi
will be furious though.

133
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,187
That's too bad. Let's go.

134
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,653
Selling chocolates!

135
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,947
- Should we go in?
- It looks exciting.

136
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,407
Let's watch a film.

137
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,492
Okay.

138
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,749
I still smell the toothpaste.

139
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,252
You're a saint, Detective.
They're all just poor beggars.

140
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,963
But if they steal again,
you better lock them all up!

141
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,425
I'm sure they'll keep their word
and won't get into trouble.

142
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,721
The thing is,
beggars have no one on their side.

143
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,349
So once people like us stand up for them,

144
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,060
they pledge their absolute loyalty.

145
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,146
You know who helped me catch
all those cow thieves?

146
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,898
Beggars.

147
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,901
Did they act as your informants?

148
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,737
That's right. They were my eyes and ears.

149
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,158
No one is better at noticing
and remembering things than beggars.

150
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,162
As expected,
you had a reason for what you did.

151
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,499
Hey, freeze.

152
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,628
Are you a wild boar or something?
You eat way too much.

153
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,754
What's so good about this?

154
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,552
Wait, there's rice in this?

155
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,220
This tastes delicious.

156
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,056
It does, doesn't it?
Eat to your heart's content.

157
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,140
Wait a minute.

158
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,186
If you were kicked out,
where are you staying now?

159
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,398
My mother had a place
prepared for me just in case.

160
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,569
He'd be homeless by now
if it weren't for his mother.

161
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,778
He's right. Be nice to her.

162
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,615
So, what made you want to be a cop
so badly?

163
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,331
What's that?

164
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,542
Let me see.

165
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,294
Is this a throwing star?

166
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,130
No, it's not.

167
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,590
This is a badge,

168
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,260
just like the one
the legendary sheriff Frank Hamer had.

169
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,803
Is he a big deal or something?

170
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,430
Of course.

171
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,932
There was once
a couple called Bonnie and Clyde,

172
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,018
who were infamous bank robbers in America.

173
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,188
The two were extremely elusive
and no one could catch them.

174
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,860
You see, Frank Hamer is the one
who finally caught them.

175
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,988
Frank Hamer?

176
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:20,828
But… Bonnie and Clark? Who were they?

177
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,582
Here's the thing.

178
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,960
Bonnie and Clyde happened to be lovers.

179
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,129
Why didn't they just get coffee?

180
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,465
What sort of lovers would rob banks?
That's nonsense.

181
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,634
I bet they couldn't break up.

182
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,596
Keep going.

183
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,891
Anyway, they stole cars,

184
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,059
robbed banks,

185
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,810
and even attacked a prison.

186
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,980
What happened next?

187
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,607
Now Showing
The Man Who Never Returned

188
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,122
Thank you for the food, ma'am!

189
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,710
Frank truly sounds like an amazing guy.

190
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,962
So he did all that
after coming back from retirement?

191
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,383
My dream is to serve like he did.

192
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,051
You will.

193
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,054
Bad things need to happen
to do great things, so forget it.

194
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,933
I guarantee the tears will flow.

195
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,185
Watch The Man Who Never Returned.

196
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:30,147
It's about a pathetic scumbag
who betrays an innocent woman.

197
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,440
I hear that one is fun.

198
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,653
Showing now at Dansungsa Theater!

199
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,822
Boys, I need to go.

200
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,966
Now Showing
The Man Who Never Returned

201
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,344
The Man Who Never Returned

202
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:09,979
Goodness.

203
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:11,939
Damn it.

204
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,651
Jongnam Bookstore

205
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,882
Hyeju.

206
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,133
You're here.

207
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,886
Is The Criminal's Shadow in?

208
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,721
Yes, it is.

209
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,850
Here.

210
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,561
- It's finally here.
- It is.

211
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,945
Did something happen today?

212
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,282
No.

213
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,874
You're wearing such a pretty dress,
yet you're feeling down.

214
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,714
You got stood up, didn't you?

215
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,177
How did you know that?

216
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,139
Well, this is what you call
logical inference.

217
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,518
But by who?

218
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,478
Someone who's no good.

219
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,398
- Hey, Nansil.
- Yes?

220
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,192
Does this make any sense to you?

221
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,570
- No.
- He wanted to repay my kindness.

222
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,864
I never asked him to repay me…

223
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,748
Jeez.

224
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,626
Papers! Get your papers!

225
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,253
Another bank was robbed!

226
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,921
Papers!

227
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,923
Get your papers here!

228
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,967
Hey, kid, I'll buy one.

229
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,640
Suwon becomes the fourth target
of the five armed bank robbers

230
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,812
- Here.
- Thank you.

231
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,981
Look at all this.

232
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,483
One last job,
and we're leaving the country.

233
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,818
Are you all ready?

234
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:21,902
- Yes.
- Yes.

235
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,654
Where will be our last target?

236
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,447
At 15:00 tomorrow,

237
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,159
Sergeant Kim will let us know
at the Hwaseong underpass.

238
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,287
Suwon was our last practice run.

239
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,663
It's time for the real operation.

240
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,747
Yes, sir.

241
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,333
Those worthless scumbags.

242
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,294
Why couldn't they just steal money?

243
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,254
Why kill the innocent security guard?

244
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,172
I wonder that too.

245
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,427
Wait, what if they hit Seoul next?

246
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,305
There's no way they'll do that.

247
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,348
But what if they do?

248
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,433
Huh?

249
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,101
Look.

250
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,436
"After the robbery,

251
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,063
they traveled through Daegu,
Daejeon, and Suwon."

252
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,565
What do you think, Detective?

253
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,150
Jeez, seriously.

254
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,987
They can come all they want,
because I'll catch all of them.

255
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,948
Hmm. They actually shoot people.

256
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,533
Would you be okay?

257
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,910
Well, I wouldn't just sit by.

258
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,620
I'd shoot back.

259
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,749
By the way, Detective,

260
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,335
when will you show me your gun?

261
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:20,878
Well…

262
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,091
If the bank robbers come to Seoul,
I'll show you my gun then.

263
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,176
Okay.

264
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,650
Suwon becomes the fourth target
of the five armed bank robbers

265
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,612
Seoul is next.

266
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,197
Exactly.

267
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,617
After Busan, Daegu, Daejeon, and Suwon,

268
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,369
Seoul is likely to be next.

269
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,371
Well, it's obviously not Pyongyang.

270
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,414
So they're coming here for certain,

271
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,958
but where will they target?

272
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,460
Are you thinking it'll be Jongnam?

273
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,629
There's no way.

274
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,090
They wouldn't dare come here.

275
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:10,302
It's easier to escape in the country,
where there's less police presence.

276
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,054
But Jongnam is packed with cars and cops,

277
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,847
so they wouldn't be able
to run away easily.

278
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,351
Take a look at the paper, sir.

279
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,939
The robbers are a five-man group
wearing military boots and field jackets

280
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,273
and they are using carbines.

281
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,400
What does this imply, sir?

282
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,486
It means the perps are former military.

283
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:31,115
All four robberies happened the same way,
with no mistakes.

284
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,576
They also made sure
to kill the guards as a warning.

285
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,745
- Are you one of them?
- What?

286
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,957
How do you know all of this?

287
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,336
I was invested in the case
since their first robbery in Busan.

288
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,091
You're really like that Frank guy.

289
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:54,972
A key detail here is that the robbers
moved around in a four-door Jeep.

290
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,390
How are the four doors important?

291
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,600
Did you not go to the army?

292
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,186
Jeeps are made with two doors.

293
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,940
Four doors mean they modified it
for the five of them.

294
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,192
- I see.
- All right.

295
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,903
So to summarize,

296
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,656
the robbers are trained,
former military men

297
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,826
fully equipped with a car and firearms?

298
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,329
This could be a big problem.

299
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,250
What if they go to another district
that isn't Jongnam?

300
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,044
Then all districts need to be prepared.

301
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,336
Wait a minute.

302
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,382
What's critical for a military operation?

303
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,470
Guts.

304
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,096
Aside from guts.

305
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,390
It's training.

306
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,350
Repeated training.

307
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,685
What if…

308
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,064
all the previous robberies
were all part of their training?

309
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,026
That would mean Seoul is the real thing.

310
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,737
Shouldn't we report this
to Senior Superintendent Choi?

311
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,323
Not him again.

312
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,578
Senior Superintendent Choi
has called an emergency meeting.

313
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,581
Attention, everyone!
I have important news.

314
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,335
Dongdaemun's Lee Jungjae
and Myeong-dong's Lee Hwaryong

315
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:10,672
are having a meeting at Jongnam Hall
next Wednesday at 11:00 a.m.

316
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,760
They'll be discussing accountability
for the Jongno ax case,

317
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,553
so we're expecting a conflict.

318
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,598
Therefore, every single officer
in this station

319
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,309
will be protecting Chairman Lee that day.

320
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,521
- You should all think about ways…
- Chief Yu.

321
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,356
- …to better protect him.
- Chief Yu.

322
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,067
Shouldn't we tell him
about the bank robbery now?

323
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,862
- Senior Superintendent Choi.
- What is it? Got something to say?

324
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,948
It's about the bank robbery in Suwon.

325
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,366
What about it?

326
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,576
As you may all be thinking,

327
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,620
Seoul may be the next target.

328
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,456
The circumstances suggest
that the perps are former military

329
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,542
and will go for a bigger target next.

330
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,169
So, what are you trying to get at?

331
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,006
Districts with large banks like ours,
Jongno-gu and Jung-gu must be prepared.

332
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,593
Are you suggesting those punks
will attack the heart of Seoul,

333
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,886
knowing they'll get caught?

334
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,180
It's obvious they'll target the outskirts.

335
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,765
They wouldn't dare come here.

336
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,394
Well, that would be a relief,
but what if they do?

337
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,606
Why get worried about something
you don't have grounds for?

338
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,275
Even if no cow thief exists,

339
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,152
there's no harm in fixing up the stable.

340
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,195
Will you ever stop talking
about the damn cow thieves?

341
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,157
We don't need a whole lot of men, sir.

342
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,783
Just let my unit handle it.

343
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,076
Shut that mouth of yours!

344
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,287
I know what this is really about.

345
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,748
You guys are just sick to your stomachs
about protecting Chairman Lee.

346
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,500
- That's not true.
- Not true, my foot.

347
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,836
You better not mention
the bank robbers again.

348
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,045
Everyone else,

349
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,590
if you see these guys scheming,
report to me immediately.

350
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,133
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

351
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,259
Dismissed!

352
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:44,474
Armed bank robbers
who targeted Daejeon and other cities

353
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,352
have now even attacked Suwon.

354
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,772
The armed men took over
Jungil Bank in Suwon

355
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:55,277
and escaped with cash and checks
worth 1.8 million won.

356
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,739
In the process,
the security guard at the bank

357
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,324
was shot and killed.

358
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,952
As a result of the robbery,
corporations and merchants in the area

359
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,664
have not been able to pay salaries
and other business costs,

360
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,416
suffering much hardship.

361
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,126
Dongdaemun-gu
Saessak Bank

362
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,253
Jongnam-gu
Goryeo Bank

363
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,006
Lee Jungjae and Lee Hwaryong will meet
on Wednesday at 11:00 a.m.

364
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,468
The heavens must be on our side
for things to be in our favor.

365
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,303
Where will we hit then?

366
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,728
Which of the three banks should we rob?

367
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,106
We can't be caught discussing this,
so be careful for the time being.

368
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,441
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

369
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,736
Detective Seo, gather the case files
for the bank robberies.

370
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,239
I already have, sir.
I'll report them to you soon.

371
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,074
- Very good.
- Detectives Kim and Jo,

372
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,701
scan the banks in Seoul
that might be a target.

373
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,703
- How do we scan banks?
- Lower your voice, man.

374
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,790
We'll see where security is weak
and which ones have a lot of cash--

375
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:53,085
They're coming.

376
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,886
We don't know when they'll attack,
so let's all hurry.

377
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,054
You're right.

378
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,889
Shall we go eat?

379
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,182
- Sounds good.
- Let's go!

380
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,976
Detective Park.

381
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,852
- Go pick up your suit.
- My suit?

382
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,479
Oh, right, my suit!

383
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,817
Hey, what's up with them?

384
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,152
I'm not sure.

385
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,570
What's wrong with them?

386
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,494
My goodness,
you could be an actor.

387
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,498
I bet all the ladies
fall for you instantly.

388
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,088
Are you seeing anyone, by any chance?

389
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,633
No, of course not.

390
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,762
But I guess there is…

391
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,017
someone I need to apologize to.

392
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,601
Is that so?

393
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,813
If you go apologize to her
while looking this sharp,

394
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,523
I'm sure she'll forgive you.

395
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,735
Do you really think so?

396
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,638
I see you bought new clothes.

397
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,474
Is it your payday?

398
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,397
Well, I'm actually here to apologize.

399
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,901
You don't have to.

400
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,445
I enjoyed the film by myself.

401
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,989
The one titled
The Punk Who Never Returned.

402
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,869
Or was it The Prick Who Never Returned?

403
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,329
I'm truly sorry.

404
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,375
It's just that an urgent case
came up that day.

405
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,294
You should get back to work
since you're so busy.

406
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,713
And let's never see each other again.

407
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,049
I sincerely beg for your leniency.

408
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,137
Isn't that something criminals say?

409
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,682
Yes, you're right.

410
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,436
I just feel like I've committed a crime.

411
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,276
Goodness.

412
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,738
This shelf is nearly falling apart.

413
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,199
Could I help you with this?

414
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,742
Just leave it.

415
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,079
Let me see.

416
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,541
Do you have a hammer
and some nails lying around?

417
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,927
I said you didn't have to.

418
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,930
We'll never see each other again anyway.

419
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,351
You don't have to forgive me,
but let me at least fix this.

420
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,397
I've been so worried about you

421
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,191
ever since I stood you up that day.

422
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,487
I'll just fix this quietly and leave.

423
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,698
Why won't this fit?

424
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,533
There.

425
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,078
There we go.

426
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,217
Have some water.

427
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:30,969
Thank you.

428
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,811
Thank you for fixing it.

429
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,189
Don't mention it.

430
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,026
I had to use a stopgap measure today.

431
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:50,030
I'll make sure to come over the weekend
to fix it properly.

432
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,074
You're thinking of coming here again?

433
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,996
What I meant was…

434
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,165
You see…

435
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,127
I mean I'll take responsibility
for fixing the shelf.

436
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,296
I didn't mean anything else.

437
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,218
I shouldn't mean anything else.

438
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,887
All right, then.

439
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,893
What are you going to do
about your ruined shirt?

440
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,481
Getting my shirt dirty
isn't a big deal to me.

441
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,733
What matters is that I hurt you.

442
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,862
After everything you've said,

443
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:35,158
it would be horrible of me
not to forgive you.

444
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,787
Does that mean…

445
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:44,000
that you'll accept my apology?

446
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,930
Did you always want to be a detective?

447
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,266
It all started when I was 11.

448
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,561
I started catching cow thieves then.

449
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,396
How?

450
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:09,192
I could just look into my neighbors' eyes

451
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,695
and tell who was up to no good.

452
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,199
Maybe you should've been a shaman,
not a detective.

453
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,327
But I wouldn't have met you then.

454
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,914
Excuse me?

455
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:29,504
The thing is,
I never run away from anything.

456
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,633
It's just that I ended up
taking a step back while making arrests

457
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,345
and happened to run away
into your bookstore.

458
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,266
It's embarrassing to admit it,
but I'm glad I did.

459
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,648
Right.

460
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,941
What did you want to become?

461
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,651
What did I want to become?

462
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,736
Yes.

463
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,280
I'm embarrassed to say.

464
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,116
That makes me all the more curious.

465
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,327
I'll tell you some other time.

466
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,871
- Can't you tell me now?
- No, I don't want to.

467
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,205
I told you mine.

468
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,875
Please?

469
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,879
An actress.

470
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,547
Really?

471
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,882
I could see you as one.

472
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:18,511
I was the best at playing the role
of a crazy, abandoned woman.

473
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,890
Well, why didn't you become an actress?

474
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,977
My mother threatened to send me
to a temple somewhere far away.

475
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,357
If things had turned out differently,

476
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,777
we could've met as a shaman and a nun.

477
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:45,246
I saw your wound
while you were fixing the shelf.

478
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,208
Did you get hurt in the line of duty?

479
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,292
Oh, well…

480
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:54,631
I got the wound
while I was a student soldier.

481
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,883
You were a student soldier?

482
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,344
Yes.

483
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,012
Hmm.

484
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,392
Just a moment.

485
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,771
- Hello.
- Hello, miss.

486
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,356
I'll take this.

487
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,817
This one, please.

488
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,902
Thank you.

489
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,365
- Give me your hand.
- Sorry?

490
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,830
It's not really made for men,

491
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,374
but it looks good on you.

492
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,921
Do keep it on.

493
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:42,804
Okay.

494
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,641
I'll… make sure to keep it on.

495
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,062
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

496
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,609
The stars are beautiful tonight.

497
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,154
You're right.

498
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,281
Good job.

499
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,124
Goryeo Bank

500
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:17,130
Their modus operandi
has been identical for all banks.

501
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:21,342
First, they use a "closed" sign
to prevent anyone from entering.

502
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,179
Closed temporarily

503
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,231
On average,
they're out within eight minutes.

504
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,944
- Guards, get up.
- Okay.

505
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,947
And they kill the guards before leaving.

506
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,037
What about robbery times?

507
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,914
Changdo Bank in Busan was at 10:00 a.m.,

508
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,540
Chilsung Bank in Daegu was at 1:00 p.m.,

509
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,793
Myungdo Bank in Daejeon was at 1:15 p.m.,

510
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,337
and Jungil Bank in Suwon was at 2:30 p.m.

511
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,757
What about the banks?

512
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,925
Over there.

513
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:03,927
Right.

514
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,472
The banks in Seoul with the most cash
are Korea Bank,

515
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,683
Saessak Bank's main branch,
Gyeorye Bank's main branch,

516
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,687
and the Jongnam Branch of Goryeo Bank.

517
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,566
Why is Goryeo Bank so flush with cash?

518
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,527
Jongnam-gu is full of corporations,

519
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,654
so the bank handles all the salaries.

520
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,156
Wait a minute.

521
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,451
- What day is it?
- It's September 18.

522
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,038
Office workers usually get paid
on the 25th,

523
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,958
so if they were to strike Goryeo Bank…

524
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,545
they'll strike within a week.

525
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,298
I guess the workers in Jongnam-gu
won't be getting paid this month.

526
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,968
Don't you think they'd go for Korea Bank?

527
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,470
No, that would be nearly impossible

528
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,682
with all the heavy security
and soldiers on guard.

529
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,687
Saessak Bank is in front of a station
and wouldn't be an easy target either.

530
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,231
And the mall across from Gyeorye Bank
is always crowded,

531
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,066
so they won't strike there either.

532
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,279
In that case…

533
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,241
…it's Goryeo Bank.

534
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,453
Right here.

535
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,001
Do you think the robbers would have
all of this information?

536
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,502
They're former military.

537
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,005
I'm sure they have
an informant of some sort.

538
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,343
Stop playing with that.

539
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,682
I've… made up my mind.

540
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,185
I'm going to become a legal official
who properly punishes

541
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,104
all the criminals you catch.

542
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:41,190
We get it, so put that down.
What's wrong with him?

543
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,028
There is one rule we must commit to.

544
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,614
We must not let the citizens get hurt.

545
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,993
And we must not let a single penny
get stolen from the bank.

546
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,080
Are we not allowed to use guns then?

547
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,666
Only if absolutely necessary,

548
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,044
but there can't be a shootout in the bank.

549
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:05,131
We'll have to stop the robbers
from even entering the bank.

550
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,216
Won't that be too difficult to do?

551
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,969
Yes, of course.

552
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,513
So we'll have to be all the more prepared.

553
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,144
First, let's get our eyes on the street.

554
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,480
Listen to me carefully.

555
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,108
Eyes? Do you mean the bums?

556
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,735
That's right.

557
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,988
Our pals, who will be our eyes and ears
on the streets.

558
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,866
Alms, please.

559
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,787
Alms, please.

560
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,832
Have each of them
go to every bank in Jongnam-gu tomorrow.

561
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,504
♪ The beggar who came last year ♪

562
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:48,049
♪ Is alive and here again ♪

563
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,802
♪ And he makes a pretty penny ♪

564
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,639
Tell the pals
exactly what to do, Detective Jo.

565
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,517
Jongnam Branch of Goryeo Bank

566
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,935
Alms, please.

567
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,312
Thank you!

568
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,314
There's something
you all need to watch out for.

569
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,275
You all know what this is, right?

570
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,236
What is it?

571
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,280
It's a Jeep. Haven't you seen this before?

572
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,866
- Right.
- Yes.

573
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,577
Jeeps usually only have
a door on each side.

574
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,997
But look here. How many do you see?

575
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,749
One, two. That's two on one side.

576
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,292
- Right.
- Multiply that for two sides.

577
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,711
What's two plus two?

578
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,796
- Five.
- Are you sure it's five?

579
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,383
Two plus two makes…

580
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,343
Just memorize it. It's four.

581
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,678
Two plus two makes four.

582
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,596
If you see a four-door Jeep,

583
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,265
tell me where you saw it immediately.

584
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,684
- Got it?
- Got it.

585
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,770
- And you, Detective Kim.
- Here you go.

586
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,274
Closely observe the inside
of Goryeo Bank with Eundong.

587
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:51,821
Try to figure out what could be done
in the case of a robbery.

588
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,284
Welcome.

589
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,678
So how is the safe opened?

590
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,973
First, you turn the lock
with the correct numbers,

591
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,225
and then a key is needed.

592
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,936
Who knows the numbers?

593
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,356
Only the branch manager knows it.

594
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,194
So only he can open the safe.

595
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,112
That's right.

596
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:48,544
Detective Seo, I need you
to go over the past case files again.

597
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,756
All criminals have
their own quirks and habits.

598
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,549
- So it was 1:00 p.m.…
- By figuring them out,

599
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:57,804
we can guess what patterns are used
in the planning of the crimes.

600
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:01,349
10:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., 1:15 p.m.

601
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,060
And 2:30 p.m. in the afternoon.

602
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,366
"Celebrating the arrival
of USS Franklin in Busan"?

603
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,972
Hold it.

604
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,390
Relax your arm, man.

605
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,016
Keep your shoulder loose.

606
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,310
Keep still like this.

607
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,855
And fire. Got it?

608
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:49,939
Relax your arm.

609
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,023
Relax.

610
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,191
- Relax.
- Fire.

611
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,904
Hey! Who told you to shoot?

612
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,202
♪ Here comes the beggar dancing again ♪

613
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,662
Alms, please.

614
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,172
Jongnam Branch of Goryeo Bank

615
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,398
I saw a car just like this pull over here.

616
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:36,611
It had one, two, three…

617
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,989
F-Five? No, four doors!

618
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,449
Are you sure it had four doors?

619
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,369
- Yes!
- Detective Park, we got them.

620
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,830
You, tell us more.

621
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,041
I saw it earlier in front of Goryeo Bank.

622
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,460
Damn it, Goryeo Bank?

623
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,587
How many were there?

624
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,673
One, two.

625
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,218
Two.

626
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,678
How tall? What did they look like?

627
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,388
They were both…

628
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,600
about this tall.

629
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,936
They had caps on,

630
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,647
so I couldn't see their faces that well.

631
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,277
Good job.

632
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,197
Go share these potatoes with the others.

633
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,615
Thank you.

634
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,785
And here, go buy yourselves some soup.

635
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,869
Thank you.

636
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,837
Play rock, paper, scissors.

637
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,507
Why on earth would we do that?

638
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,716
Rock, paper, scissors!

639
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,844
Damn it.

640
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,680
I have a bad feeling.

641
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,392
You'll go undercover
as a Goryeo Bank guard tomorrow.

642
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,604
But the guard always dies at the end.

643
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,107
Don't worry. You'll have a gun too.

644
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,733
There's a lot more of them.

645
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,528
It's okay. Shoot at them with both hands.

646
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,238
You little punk.

647
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,826
- Should I?
- I trust you.

648
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,745
Is that true?

649
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,289
It's still a speculation,

650
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,833
but we're informing you as a precaution.

651
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,668
This is a great problem,

652
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,170
and yet Senior Superintendent Choi
hasn't even notified me.

653
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,339
I hear that the bank holds cash

654
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,258
for high-ranking officials
and famous actors.

655
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:26,262
As such, the Senior Superintendent
has asked us to operate in secrecy.

656
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,474
He is a very thoughtful man, as expected.

657
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,894
Of course.
No one is more thoughtful than he is.

658
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:39,775
Oh, and this is Detective Kim Sangsun,
who will go undercover as a guard.

659
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:40,860
I'll do my best.

660
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,446
But from what I've read in the papers,

661
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:47,158
it seems those robbers
always kill the guards.

662
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,577
I know. That's why I…

663
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,828
Thank you so much, Detective.

664
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,288
You're risking your life.

665
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,248
I'm making a huge sacrifice.

666
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,129
Yeonghan!

667
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,883
I think I know what time they'll strike.

668
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,343
Goodness, your feet stink.

669
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,928
I'm sorry,
but could you take a bath first?

670
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,848
No, I need to show you all this now.

671
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,558
All right, h-hurry.

672
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,062
- What?
- The light's gone out again.

673
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,772
Jeez. Come on.

674
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,656
- Talk to us.
- All right.

675
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,576
On the day
Changdo Bank in Busan was robbed,

676
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,787
there was a docking ceremony
for the USS Franklin

677
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,039
at the Port of Busan at 10:00 a.m.

678
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,291
On the day
Chilsung Bank in Daegu was robbed,

679
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:41,379
the Liberal Party had a campaign rally
at a nearby square at 1:00 p.m.

680
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,255
On the day
Myeongdo Bank in Daejeon was robbed,

681
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:47,051
there was a protest at the nearby
Jowon University at 1:15 p.m.

682
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,719
And when Jungil Bank in Suwon was robbed,

683
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,890
there was a false espionage report
at 2:30 p.m.

684
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,060
Hey, hey.

685
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,896
What these four days had in common was…

686
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,649
Ah. The police
were all occupied elsewhere.

687
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,150
Yes, that's right.

688
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,235
Wait a minute.

689
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,280
Lee Jungjae and Lee Hwaryong
are meeting at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

690
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,408
That's when they'll strike.

691
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,084
Hey, I told you two
not to dig into the bank robberies!

692
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,336
Sir, the robbers will strike
at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow

693
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,089
when Lee Jungjae and Lee Hwaryong
are scheduled to meet.

694
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,757
We're sure of it.

695
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,426
Our basis for this is…

696
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,844
Damn you.

697
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,314
Please let us at least prepare for it.

698
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,316
I'll accept whatever punishment
you give me later.

699
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,193
All right, fine.

700
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,654
Let's say the robbers will strike.

701
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:53,284
Even still, the meeting at Jongnam Hall
is a bigger deal to us, understand?

702
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,495
Sir, people's possessions are at risk!

703
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,456
- At least let us Unit 1…
- Sir?

704
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,790
Assemblyman Kim is looking for you.

705
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,959
All right, let's go. Go.

706
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,127
Sir, please!

707
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:10,050
If you two bring up
the bank robbers one more time,

708
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,554
I'm locking up your entire unit
in the holding cell, got it?

709
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,222
Now, get lost.

710
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,307
But…

711
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,060
What's such a big deal
about some thugs meeting up?

712
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,354
This is what we expected.

713
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,149
Let's just stick to our plan, sir.

714
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,001
I'll take this.

715
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,169
Here you go.

716
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,378
Herbal medicine

717
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,755
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

718
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,885
- Make the floor shine.
- Yes, sir.

719
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,395
Two hours from now at 11:00 a.m.,

720
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,814
Chairman Lee Jungjae
and Chairman Lee Hwaryong

721
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,399
will be meeting at Jongnam Hall.

722
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,568
All personnel will mobilize.

723
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,820
Bring your guns with you
in case of an emergency.

724
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,449
Most importantly,

725
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,868
only intervene
if Lee Hwaryong's side starts a fight.

726
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,787
If Chairman Lee Jungjae starts one,

727
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,248
stand by and wait for orders.

728
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,124
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

729
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,834
Now, let's move!

730
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,462
- Bring your guns.
- Yes, sir.

731
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,547
Yes, sir.

732
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,817
- Hurry!
- Let's move!

733
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,569
- Let's go.
- Everybody, move out!

734
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,653
Here we go.

735
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,281
Move out now! Hurry!

736
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,412
Wait. Where are your guys?

737
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,289
They'll be out soon.
They must be in the can.

738
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,625
Aren't you going?

739
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,127
Okay. I'll go ahead.

740
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,211
All right.

741
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,978
We stick to the plan.

742
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,104
Got it.

743
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,440
Move out! Let's go!

744
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,383
Where are you all off to?

745
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,053
Are you going to war or something?

746
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,892
What are you doing here, Hwang?

747
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,520
Senior Superintendent Choi had us
make sure you don't cause trouble.

748
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,022
Who says we're causing trouble?

749
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,107
Hey, that's enough.

750
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,817
Just listen to us, okay?

751
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,696
Well, we were just on our way
to protect Chairman Lee too.

752
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,824
- Isn't that right?
- That's right.

753
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,326
- Exactly.
- Yes.

754
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,662
Oh. Wait a minute.

755
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,124
Man, it looks like I forgot something.

756
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,459
You all go ahead.

757
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,752
Freeze.

758
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,802
Senior Superintendent Choi gave us
permission to shoot if you disobey.

759
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,888
He also did tell us not to kill you.

760
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,733
We really don't have time left.

761
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,657
Hey, Officer Kim.

762
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,871
Officer Kim.

763
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,582
Officer Kim!

764
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,503
Come on, Officer Kim.

765
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,590
Senior Superintendent Choi
ordered me not to respond.

766
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,218
Jeez.

767
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,762
But you just responded.

768
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,266
Doesn't that mean you disobeyed orders?

769
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,309
You might as well just let us go too.

770
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,394
I can't do that.

771
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:33,313
Goryeo Bank will get robbed
if we're stuck here.

772
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,815
People will die!

773
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,072
Officer Kim.

774
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,492
The thing about that bank is,

775
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,246
not only does it hold money
for rich people,

776
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:53,959
but it also holds money for old ladies
who sell vegetables every day

777
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:58,547
and for fathers who work to the bone
to educate their children.

778
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,133
Hear me out.

779
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,220
Let's say those rich people
won't really be affected

780
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,847
even if their money gets stolen.

781
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:07,973
But you see,

782
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,018
people who live hand to mouth

783
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,146
will have their dreams and lives
taken from them.

784
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,816
Some kids out there won't be able
to afford education,

785
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,736
and some families will become homeless.

786
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,828
Listen.

787
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,124
We're not trying to protect
the rich people's money.

788
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:40,005
We're trying to do it for all the people
whose lives are at stake.

789
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:44,843
You boys are true policemen.

790
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,346
Yeonghan.

791
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,269
You coldhearted punk.

792
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:58,065
You need to learn how to be human first!

793
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,650
A human, all right?

794
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,698
Mother…

795
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,832
That's what my mother did for me.

796
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:19,378
She earned what she could
working as a seamstress

797
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,255
to help me become a policeman.

798
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,383
Mother.

799
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,677
Officer Kim.

800
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,930
You're a good son. You really are.

801
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,560
Could you let us out now?

802
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,776
Police

803
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,153
Detective Park.

804
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,616
Look who it is. Officer Kim!

805
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,076
I'll lead the way.

806
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,494
- Thank you.
- All right.

807
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,800
Why aren't they here yet?

808
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,010
We'll stand by

809
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,596
and subdue the robbers
as soon as they get out of the car.

810
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,181
In the case that they end up
entering the bank,

811
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,643
we'll lure them outside and grab them.

812
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,479
Stand firm, Sangsun.

813
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,326
Here you go, sir.

814
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,202
Take care.

815
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:35,996
Damn it.

816
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:41,793
I'd like to transfer this amount
to the Kitazawa Bookstore in Tokyo.

817
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,170
Uh, Tokyo?

818
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,465
Is there any chance
you could come in another day?

819
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,091
This might take a while today.

820
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,552
I'm sorry, but I need it sent today.

821
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,766
Goryeo Bank

822
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,826
- Stand watch.
- All right.

823
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,419
Jongnam Branch of Goryeo Bank

824
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,504
Closed temporarily

825
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,588
Thank you.

826
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,256
- Take care.
- Thanks.

827
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,594
Everybody down!

828
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,138
Get out of the way!

829
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,474
Employees come forward and stand down!

830
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,477
Listen to them. Come on!

831
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,734
Hurry! Move it!

832
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,403
Get down!

833
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,906
Try anything and you're dead.

834
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,701
Get down.

835
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,541
Where are you going?

836
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,717
Where's the manager's office?

837
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,760
It's that way!

838
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,724
- Heads down.
- Stay still.

839
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,102
What on earth?

840
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,647
What?

841
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,111
Hey, come on. Wake up.

842
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:32,904
Wake up!

843
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,867
Seoul police

844
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,289
Yeonghan.

845
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,499
They must be inside.

846
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,001
Damn it.

847
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,879
Looks like we don't have a choice.

848
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,756
We start now.

849
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,424
Hey, wake up.

850
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,848
Wake up. Come on.

851
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,309
What is it? Is he dead?

852
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,187
He's still breathing,

853
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,105
but he won't wake up.

854
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,150
Excuse me.

855
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,945
Our manager has a chronic disease.

856
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,282
Once he falls asleep, he can't wake up.

857
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,742
What kind of disease is that?

858
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:21,036
It's true! It's true!

859
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,497
You better wake him up now.

860
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,332
- How am I supposed to--
- Wake him up!

861
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,843
He just needs to fall into a deep sleep
nobody can wake him up from.

862
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,684
Branch Manager

863
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:45,769
What's this?

864
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:48,897
It's premium tea
from my brother back home, sir.

865
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,398
What a surprise.

866
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,400
I wasn't expecting this from you.

867
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:57,823
It tastes lovely.

868
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,961
I'm very sorry, sir.

869
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:13,964
Sir.

870
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,092
Sir!

871
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,096
Excuse me.

872
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,932
- What is it?
- Do you have a light?

873
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,392
I don't smoke. Get lost.

874
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,310
Wait, in that case…

875
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,481
Yeonghan.

876
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,110
Senior Superintendent Choi's radio
is down.

877
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,778
Damn it.

878
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,406
You go tell him in person, Officer Kim.

879
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,490
All right.

880
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,785
Are we going with Plan B then?

881
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,745
Yes. Let's stand by for now.

882
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,039
- All right.
- Yeonghan.

883
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,959
I'm ready.

884
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,590
I'm so sorry, sir!

885
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,968
We're out of time! We need to leave!

886
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,845
Heads down!

887
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,681
Take the money out here.

888
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,766
Okay. Come on, take the money.

889
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,871
Everybody, move out.

890
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,665
- Everybody, move out!
- Hurry, hurry! Let's go!

891
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,001
Let's go.

892
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,631
We're taking the girl.

893
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,800
Please spare me.

894
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,177
- Move out.
- Yes, sir.

895
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,803
Wait, wait! Hold on, stop.

896
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,264
I'm the guard here. Take me instead.

897
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,099
Back off!

898
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,268
Let's go!

899
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,437
Freeze! Stay where you are!

900
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,105
- Huh?
- Stand still!

901
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:55,899
Stay away, or I'll shoot!

902
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,025
Don't do it!

903
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:58,860
Damn it.

904
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,447
No, no, no!

905
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,533
- You prick!
- Freeze!

906
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,328
Move, and I'll shoot.

907
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,414
Don't move! Drop your guns!

908
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,167
Damn it.

909
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,461
Drop your guns!

910
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:17,754
Do you want her dead?

911
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,340
Drop your guns!

912
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,443
- That sounded like a pistol.
- Damn it.

913
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,196
Drop your guns!

914
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,948
- Do we shoot?
- No, don't.

915
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,079
Shoot him if he tries anything.

916
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,956
Okay.

917
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,921
Those pricks.

918
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,173
- Where's the car?
- Right there.

919
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,092
Let's go!

920
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,258
Where are they going?

921
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,635
I know.
It's not the escape route we anticipated.

922
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,430
Anticipated escape route, my foot.
They're heading for the main gates.

923
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,058
- Come on, stealthily close in.
- Yes, sir.

924
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,944
Jeez.

925
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,868
Get closer. Closer!

926
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,551
They're on us.

927
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:30,845
Get rid of them.

928
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,526
-

929
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,331
That little…

930
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,822
- Get out of the way!
- Come on!

931
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,324
- Hurry.
- Come on.

932
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,599
Shouldn't we shoot at them?

933
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,142
They got a hostage! Make a turn here!

934
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,602
Yes, sir!

935
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,859
Pathetic pigs.

936
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,321
Is this the right way?

937
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,157
Wait, why are you keeping so quiet?

938
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,869
What's wrong with you?

939
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:21,289
Are you sure we're going the right way?
It's more crowded here!

940
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,710
Take off your mask.

941
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,213
Take it off now!

942
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,966
- What's wrong?
- What is it?

943
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,885
I can't die like this.

944
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:37,013
I can't die like this.
I can't die like this, I really can't!

945
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,725
Let go!

946
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:45,980
Are you going to kill me?

947
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,066
I know you're going to kill me!
I know you are!

948
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:50,693
What's wrong with her?

949
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,070
Are you out of your mind?

950
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:57,659
If I die,
my widowed mother is going to die too.

951
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:00,662
Then I won't even get a funeral!

952
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:01,871
Hold her down!

953
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,165
- Let go!
- Let's die together.

954
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,000
- Stop it.
- Let's all die

955
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,335
and wander the afterlife.

956
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,629
Where are you taking us?

957
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,340
What on earth?

958
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,591
To jail.

959
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,513
- You prick!
- Shoot!

960
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,265
I'm going to kill you!

961
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,641
Let go!

962
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,560
You crazy prick!

963
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,812
- No!
- Damn you!

964
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,411
- What are those punks doing?
- What?

965
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,413
- Over there.
- Who's that?

966
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,211
Are you all right?

967
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,880
Yeonghan!

968
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,382
- Get him.
- Don't move!

969
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,134
Stop resisting!

970
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,552
Are you okay, Yeonghan?

971
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,971
Chief Yu!

972
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,681
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

973
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,807
Let me go!

974
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,060
Why are you just watching?

975
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,062
What's wrong with Chief Yu?

976
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,188
Get over here!

977
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:52,065
He's calling. Get over there.

978
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,358
Go on!

979
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,817
I'll go, sir.

980
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,319
Hyeju.

981
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,197
Are you all right?

982
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,201
I am.

983
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:07,163
You worthless, thieving punks.
A bunch of good-for-nothings.

984
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,248
- You no-good punks!
- Eyes down!

985
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,417
Lock them up.

986
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,211
Hyeju.

987
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,004
You're bleeding.

988
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,048
Are you really all right?

989
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:19,801
Yes, I'm fine.

990
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,220
You saved me from the worst.

991
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,138
Don't mention it.

992
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,351
By the way, Hyeju.

993
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,689
Are you back to your normal self again?

994
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,653
Did you actually think I went mad?

995
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:42,281
No, what I meant was…

996
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,119
This?

997
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,287
- Exactly.
- How did I do?

998
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,833
Even top actresses would envy
your godlike acting.

999
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,209
- That's a little too…
- Yeonghan.

1000
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:58,005
Please ask the heavens
for some easier cases next time.

1001
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,467
It's not easy to be like Frank Hamer.

1002
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,845
I'm sorry I underestimated you,
Frank Hamer.

1003
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,555
I want to fight with fists, not guns.

1004
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:06,806
I'm better with fists.

1005
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:07,890
Mm.

1006
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,434
Watch out for tomorrow.

1007
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,186
I bet your faces will be
all over the papers.

1008
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,816
It looks like
someone else will make the headlines.

1009
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,985
Hey, get these punks locked up.

1010
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,362
And go tell Chairman Lee what happened.

1011
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:24,449
Gosh, I haven't seen him so excited.

1012
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,077
I'll take you to the hospital
to get your wound treated.

1013
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,288
We don't need to do that,

1014
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:33,124
but I'd like something sweet.

1015
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:36,836
Something sweet?
Don't you need to see a doctor?

1016
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:39,130
I'm low on sugar.

1017
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:41,048
Ah. In that case…

1018
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:45,094
Would you like to get some rice cakes
at an old lady's place?

1019
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,180
Ah. Do you mean Ms. Ho's shop?

1020
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,183
- Yes, that's right.
- I'd love that.

1021
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,061
Are you in a special relationship
with Yeonghan,

1022
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,606
Jongnam Bookstore lady?

1023
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,484
I-Is it true?

1024
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:04,447
Hey, don't put Hyeju in a tight spot.

1025
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,282
I just have a crush on her.

1026
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,624
Let's go.

1027
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:16,459
Shall we?

1028
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,795
I'll leave the rest up to you, sir.

1029
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,004
Sure, Yeonghan.

1030
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,964
Let's go. I don't even want to see them.

1031
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,966
Wait, you need to wrap things up.

1032
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,051
Come on, Chief Yu.

1033
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,095
You take care of that, sir.
That's what chiefs do, right?

1034
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:31,933
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey! Stop right…

1035
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,561
Jongnam Police Station!

1036
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,856
One more time.

1037
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,483
Jongnam Police Station!

1038
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:43,778
Don't pat yourselves on the back
for catching some petty thieves!

1039
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:45,571
You all

1040
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,950
disobeyed your superior's orders
and engaged in mutiny.

1041
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,577
This is grounds for severe punishment.

1042
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,579
- Are you aware of that?
- Yes, sir!

1043
01:03:56,666 --> 01:04:00,211
But I'll let you off the hook
just this once,

1044
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:03,339
and you can thank
my merciful and generous spirit for that.

1045
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,302
- Is it not because of your commendation?
- What?

1046
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:11,305
How could you say that, Detective Kim?

1047
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:15,142
Will you share
the reward you received, sir?

1048
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,395
What reward? Did you see a reward?

1049
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:18,938
That's just a rumor!

1050
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:22,358
Right, I heard you donated the full amount

1051
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,152
- for orphans of the war, sir.
- Orphans?

1052
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,822
- Did he really do that?
- What?

1053
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:30,825
- I learn a lot from you, sir.
- Learn what?

1054
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:33,160
- Get some journalists in here! Applause!
- Wait a minute.

1055
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,704
Senior Superintendent Choi!

1056
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,372
Senior Superintendent Choi!

1057
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:38,124
- Senior Superintendent Choi!
- Get out.

1058
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:41,377
Stop clapping and leave!

1059
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,463
Stop it!

1060
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,466
You're disobeying my orders!

1061
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,385
Goodness.

1062
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:54,599
Those punks can't make me
donate the fat reward I got.

1063
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:57,518
I thought police work would be boring,

1064
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,687
but it's like being in a battlefield.

1065
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:02,690
I had another nightmare today.

1066
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,026
One about Frank Hamer scolding me.

1067
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,070
So, do you regret it?

1068
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:11,574
- Definitely not. I don't regret it.
- No.

1069
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,785
It's just that it's tougher than expected.

1070
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,038
Right, Hojeong?

1071
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,458
No, it's not tough for me at all.

1072
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,337
I did almost wet my pants a few times.

1073
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,923
Was it the same for you too, Yeonghan?

1074
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,471
I'm no exception.

1075
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:37,433
Just wet your pants if you need to.
I'll change your diapers for you,

1076
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,060
with extra starchy ones.

1077
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:47,109
A no-good scumbag
mends his ways in this tear-jerker,

1078
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,903
The Man Who Returned!

1079
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,613
Right.

1080
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:53,950
- What is it?
- No.

1081
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,869
- What's wrong?
- I need to go, boys.

1082
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,080
- You can go home now!
- Take care.

1083
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,791
Damn it.

1084
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,260
No way.

1085
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:26,524
I almost lost my mind waiting for you.

1086
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:30,194
I'm so sorry for being late.

1087
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:31,988
Someone once told me,

1088
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:36,158
"Cops will never come in time for a date."

1089
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,411
Who told you that?

1090
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,788
This girl called Nansil.

1091
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,373
I see.

1092
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:46,752
I'll assume you've forgiven me.

1093
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,922
- Shall we head in?
- Okay.

1094
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:52,133
Wait.

1095
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,143
Someone once told me,

1096
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,645
"If a cop doesn't want to get dumped,

1097
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:07,523
he should hold her hand tightly."

1098
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:09,400
Who told you that?

1099
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,194
Gyeonghwan.

1100
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:16,157
Is he the man that's like a wild boar?

1101
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:18,951
It didn't look like
he'd ever dated anyone.

1102
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,913
I shouldn't have listened to him.

1103
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,665
Let's go.

1104
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:26,333
Okay.

1105
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:30,379
How's your injury?

1106
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,590
I'm all right now.

1107
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:35,843
The Man Who Returned,
now showing in theaters!

1108
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:38,554
The Man Who Returned,
now showing in theaters!

1109
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,141
The Man Who Returned,
now showing in theaters!

1110
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,852
The Man Who Returned

1111
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:51,525
Halt what you're doing and return to base!

1112
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,943
Yes, sir!

1113
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:54,653
Platoon commander!

1114
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:58,574
You need to come see this, sir.

1115
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:07,124
Yes, this is Hoyang Police Station.

1116
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:10,002
At Hoak Mountain?

1117
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:14,590
I apologize
for not keeping the promise to date,

1118
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:16,759
but next time,

1119
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:21,222
I'll make sure
to send a well-screened candidate.

1120
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:26,435
You can deposit the balance
after that happens, okay?

1121
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:29,730
What happened
to the child I was supposed to receive?

1122
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:35,778
Oh, yes, we've already placed him

1123
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,656
in another good home.

1124
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:33,169
Chief Detective 1958

1125
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,713
Please find my dear Jongwoo.

1126
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:38,090
Is there anyone suspicious close to you?

1127
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:41,093
- Who did you just say?
Audrey. Audrey Ko.

1128
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,095


1129
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,222


1130
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:48,893
Isn't this enough evidence
to lock her up, sir?

1131
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:50,978
Let's start over
from when they went missing.

1132
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:54,190
- Move!
I need to ask you a favor.

1133
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,608
You accuse me of such evil?

1134
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,235
- Stop!
What's going on here?

1135
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,321
Senior Superintendent Choi has ordered us

1136
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,531
to beg you for forgiveness, ma'am.

1137
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:03,824
There's no need for an apology.

1138
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,202
Just sack all of them.

1139
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:10,331
