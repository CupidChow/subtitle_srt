1
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,949
Chief Detective 1958

2
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
This series is unrelated to any places,
persons, settings or events.

3
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,953
Scenes involving animals were filmed in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.

4
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,289
Shoot!

5
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,373
Hey, hold on.

6
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,256
Listen.

7
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,135
Why don't we just share the spoils?

8
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,678
What's with all the fuss?

9
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,014
What even is this? Let me see.

10
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,265
What did you knock him out for?

11
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,683
Never mind that.

12
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,686
What's my share of the goods?

13
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,898
Jeez.

14
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,109
What was that for?
He was willing to join us.

15
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,403
I just remembered.

16
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,115
This punk bit off
my brother Black Bear's ear last year.

17
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,659
That doggone prick.

18
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,883
Episode 2

19
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,771


20
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,565
Gosh, it aches.

21
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,569
Hey.

22
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,571
- Get up.

23
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,448
Jeez. Wake up.

24
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,955
Which prick busted my head open?

25
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,457
I got knocked out before that happened.

26
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,377
- Who hit me?
- I did.

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,837
What?

28
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,172
What did you do that for?

29
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,092
You would've seen the afterlife
if it wasn't for me.

30
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,930
- What's he blabbering about?
- Good grief.

31
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,640
If you won't budge,
we can have a shootout and all die.

32
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,724
- Hey.
- Calm down.

33
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,809
- I'll shoot.
- Hey, Sangsun.

34
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,061
One of the American soldiers
was aiming right at your noggin…

35
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,187
I mean, your head.

36
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,313
Shoot me.

37
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,523
Shoot already!

38
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,983
I smacked you in the head

39
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,651
- before it got busted.
- Shoot!

40
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,286
I think I'm what people usually call

41
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,746
a "lifesaver."

42
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,460
You could've at least warned me
before you did it.

43
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,463
I guess in Hwangchun,

44
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,591
it's normal to be so ungrateful.

45
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,762
Well, thanks.

46
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,899
Thank you, my dear lifesaver.

47
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,449
How do we get back at those punks?

48
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,660
Let's report them to the military police.

49
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,711
Lee Jungbum, the slimy prick,
will still find a way to worm his way out.

50
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,046
So what do we do?

51
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,429
Where are you going?
The station's that way.

52
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,890
It was always this color.

53
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,141
- It really was.
- No, it wasn't.

54
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,477
What is this,
a whole party in here?

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,561
You're back.

56
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,397
How are your heads?

57
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,483
Harder than ever.

58
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,151
Who hit me?

59
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,528
Make a guess.

60
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,865
- Get it right, and I'll give you 20 hwan.
- Screw your 20 hwan.

61
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,243
Whoever it was, I'll bite their ear off.

62
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,662
It's a relief you two are back alive.

63
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,582
This is part and parcel
of being a cop around here.

64
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,752
You know what, Chief Byun?

65
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,296
You're as brazen as a Soviet tank.

66
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,757
What did you just say?

67
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,051
My father once told me,

68
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,220
"A shameless man

69
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,139
is the basest scumbag in the world."

70
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,353
Hey, enough of your lecture.

71
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,897
You need to watch your mouth
talking to your superiors.

72
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,066
Don't you remember what I told Viper?

73
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,736
Scum up to no good could be 100 years old

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,363
and still be beneath me.

75
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,948
You better watch yourself!

76
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,785
Just don't do anything, Detective Park.

77
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,996
That's better for all of us.

78
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,706
Not doing anything like this…

79
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,836
makes me feel sick.

80
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,090
Well? What should I do?

81
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,010
Then don't stay still.

82
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,178
That's fine with us.
You're the one who'll suffer.

83
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,098
- Really?
- Yes.

84
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,851
Look at yourself.
It's clear who the loser here is.

85
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,732
We'll see who the real loser is

86
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,941
soon enough.

87
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,610
Detective Kim.

88
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,406
Let's go take a bath.

89
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,785
It's been years
since I've scrubbed myself.

90
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,675
Do you think
they ratted us out to the Americans?

91
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,763
If they did, the Westerners
would've busted through the door already.

92
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,599
That country boy is all bark and no bite.

93
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,477
Jongnam Police Station

94
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,191
- Detective Park.
- You're back, sir.

95
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,567
Did anything happen?

96
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,113
Why are you returning empty-handed
from your trip to Daejeon?

97
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,991
The way you two look,
it's obvious something went down.

98
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,869
We had a huge party.

99
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,955
Chief Byun!

100
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,377
I have bad news, sir.

101
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,586
What is it?

102
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,506
What happened to your face?

103
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,133
- The crap…
- Crap?

104
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,264
Something dirty happened,
but that's not important.

105
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,600
It's about Lee Jungbum's warehouse.

106
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,229
I suggest you head over there, sir.

107
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,573
I love American chocolate.

108
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,743
This thing gets my blood pumping.

109
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,078
What happened here?

110
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,957
Police

111
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,753
What's going on here, sir?

112
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,338
How would I know?

113
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,716
Who's responsible for this?

114
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,432
I bet things are going down by now.

115
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,612
Where are you going?
The station's that way.

116
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,531
Let's throw a big party ourselves.

117
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,158
All right.

118
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,702
I'm going to bite them to pieces.

119
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,786
Mister.

120
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:46,841
American goods

121
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,012
Giveaway

122
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,180
Careful now, careful.

123
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,765
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

124
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,726
American goods!

125
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,644
They're all for free!
Free, I'm telling you!

126
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,272
It's a gift from the Americans!

127
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,815
Hurry!

128
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,150
Go ahead, come take them!

129
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,402
Come and give your kids
some of this canned food!

130
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,283
Men's bathhouse

131
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,993
I feel so refreshed.

132
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,415
Right, I wish I had taken some candy.

133
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,001
Well, I regret not taking more.

134
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,212
I only got two of them.
These are way too big.

135
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,005
Gosh, Detective Kim.

136
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:30,092
I'm so proud of you.

137
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,594
It's not a big deal.

138
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,596
Let's go.

139
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:41,604
Episode 2
Unit 1, The Headstrong Unit of Jongnam

140
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,192
What do I do?

141
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,028
What should I do?

142
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,821
What am I supposed to do?

143
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,240
What… My hand hurts.

144
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,699
What do I do?

145
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,867
You useless pricks.

146
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,496
How am I to see Chairman Lee's face now?

147
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,208
Are neither of you chiefs
controlling your men?

148
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,501
I'm deeply sorry, sir.

149
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,670
They uncovered a warehouse
used for smuggling.

150
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,213
- They didn't do anything wrong.
- Shut up!

151
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,675
Where are those pricks now?

152
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,887
Taking a bath is so refreshing.

153
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,305
Get out.

154
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,560
Park Yeonghan and Kim Sangsun.

155
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,396
- Salute!
- Salute!

156
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,315
Are you two responsible
for ransacking the American warehouse?

157
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,777
Yes, sir. The people loved us for it.

158
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,448
Do you realize the graveness of the crime
you two have committed?

159
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,034
We saved our station,
not committed a crime.

160
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,494
What?

161
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,371
You men should all be thanking us.

162
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,833
We were going to report it to
the American Special Investigation Team,

163
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:48,462
but I couldn't bear to do just that
thinking about all of your families.

164
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,881
- You little--
- If we had reported it,

165
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,592
you, sir, and everyone here

166
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,636
would've been escorted
to the American military prison.

167
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,349
You said usually in times like this,
most people use a certain term.

168
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,226
A life…

169
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,853
- saver.
- Saver.

170
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,315
Why you…

171
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,945
Our losses are immense, boss.

172
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,822
What's worse,

173
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,658
the Americans have cut ties with us.

174
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,952
He used to catch cow thieves in Hwangchun?

175
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,079
Is he the one who let the snakes loose?

176
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,164
Yes, boss.

177
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,416
He should've been taken care of already.

178
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:29,045
Chief Yu seemed to lay low as of late.
Now his underling is causing trouble.

179
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,883
What do you suggest?

180
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,135
I'll take care of him.

181
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,395
Hey, Rice Boy!

182
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,696
Didn't we meet the other day?

183
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,449
I told you I'd come back.

184
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,326
And I told you I'd beat you up.

185
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,578
Come on, man.

186
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,331
The great Viper…

187
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,875
wants to have a meal with you,

188
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,002
with special rice from Icheon.

189
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,172
I don't eat with thugs. Leave.

190
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,261
You won't last long here
if you keep defying our boss.

191
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,767
Goodness!

192
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,976
Are you okay?

193
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,942
My hand! Watch my hand!

194
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,820
Wait.

195
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,656
This is your last warning.

196
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,827
The next time you show up,
I'm ripping all your limbs out.

197
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,579
- Get lost.
- Let's go.

198
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:56,340
Jongnam Bookstore

199
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,124
Are you looking for something?

200
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,711
- Hyeju!
- You're here.

201
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,798
Hello.

202
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,258
Hello.

203
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,142
That boy from Hanju University
seems to come here a lot.

204
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,938
I wonder if he likes you.

205
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,149
- You think so? Yes?
- Yes.

206
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,233
Yes.

207
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,943
It's obvious he does.

208
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,780
It was clearly written on his face.

209
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,326
Right. Did you hear the news?

210
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,410
What news?

211
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,745
Yesterday,

212
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,499
some detective tried to catch gangsters
by letting 100…

213
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,542
Yes, 100 poisonous snakes loose.

214
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,627
- Really?
- Yes.

215
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,629
- Poisonous snakes?
- Yes.

216
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,256
He must be a nutcase, not a detective.

217
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:24,220
Jongnam Police Station

218
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,424
Jeez.

219
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,400
Hey, boys.

220
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,776
Why can't we do this in daylight?

221
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,820
The bad guys always come
when it's dark out.

222
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,323
Back in Hwangchun,

223
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,910
cops and gangsters all took the night off.

224
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,288
You need to rest to be healthy

225
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,956
and help you fight.

226
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,294
So just go, wash up, and get some rest.

227
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,712
Got it? See you all later.

228
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,673
- That arrogant little prick.
- Seriously?

229
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,011
Get him!

230
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,140
Hey, you little prick!

231
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,725
You little…

232
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,105
You're not playing around, are you?

233
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,448
Damn you.

234
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,783
My goodness.

235
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,453
Why bother sending those weaklings?

236
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,753
Jeez.

237
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,966
What's this now?

238
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,765
Don't do anything you'll regret.
I suggest you go home.

239
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,642
Come on, go.

240
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,977
Go!

241
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,521
We're not interested in leaving.

242
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,606
Right.

243
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,150
Then I'll go ahead.

244
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,653
Get him!

245
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,116
Stay away.

246
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,079
Get him!

247
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,338
Stop right there, you prick!

248
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,422
Stop right there!

249
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,507
- Hey!
- Stop!

250
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,550
Damn it.

251
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,552
Split up.

252
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,222
Catch him!

253
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,238
Go after him! Damn it.

254
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,245
I'm finally going to tell her
how I feel today.

255
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,914
"I've felt this way
for a long time, Hyeju."

256
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,542
One.

257
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,668
Two.

258
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,003
On three.

259
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,339
Excuse me, kid.

260
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,468
So many books.

261
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,554
What are all these books?

262
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,222
- I need to…
- What's going on here?

263
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,143
I'm a cop
and there are gangsters after me.

264
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,145
Is there somewhere I can hide?

265
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,814
How do I know
if you're a cop or a gangster?

266
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:04,940
Right.

267
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
Here.

268
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,866
"Jongnam Police."

269
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,702
That's right.
I'm in a bit of a hurry right now.

270
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,330
I see, but I'm afraid I can't help you.

271
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,415
What?

272
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,708
B-But why not?

273
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,711
What if I get in trouble
for helping you hide?

274
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,339
Right, I'll make sure that won't happen

275
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,719
by twisting myself up
like a pretzel somewhere.

276
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,054
If you help me hide,

277
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,805
I promise to repay you.

278
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,432
How will you do that?

279
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,601
Well, I'll…

280
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:45,230
I'll try my very best to repay you.

281
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,691
Where is he?

282
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,859
- He went somewhere here.
- Oh, no.

283
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,861
- I think he's in there.
- Hurry.

284
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,654
- Yes, sir!
- I'm begging you.

285
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,909
Follow me.

286
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,035
Okay.

287
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,504
Get in.

288
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,671
Thank you.

289
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,258
All right.

290
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,891
Shh.

291
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,643
Draw the drapes.

292
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,655
Oh.

293
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,828
Hey, did you see a young man come in?

294
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,831
- No.
- Look at me in the eyes and answer.

295
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,793
- Are you sure you didn't see one?
- I don't think I…

296
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,461
- Well…
- Did you see one or not?

297
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,672
Right, I think…

298
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,881
I found it.

299
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,551
- Is this the book?
- What?

300
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,637
Isn't this what you were looking for?

301
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,639
That's right.

302
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,392
You've paid already, so you can go now.

303
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,643
I have more books I need.

304
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,521
I said, you can go now.

305
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,692
Hey, look for him.

306
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,152
Over there! Quickly, hurry up!

307
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,278
Search every corner!

308
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,612
Hey.

309
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,906
I'm telling you that no one's here.

310
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,662
Wait, I'm a cop, and they're the thugs.

311
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,373
Those punks.

312
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,294
You can't come in here.
The books might fall over!

313
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,968
I told you

314
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,595
they might fall over!

315
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,805
Oh, no.

316
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,599
You've ruined my books!

317
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,226
You need to pay for this.

318
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,729
These are expensive books from Japan!

319
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,938
They're all ruined.

320
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,815
It looks like you can just dust them off.

321
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,942
- Let's go, boys.
- Pay for my books!

322
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,361
Where do you think you're going?
Pay for my books!

323
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,030
You damn thugs!

324
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,159
Oh!

325
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,245
Jongnam Bookstore

326
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,165
That way, go.

327
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,334
Damn it.

328
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,518
Come on out. They're gone.

329
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,946
Ah…

330
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,215
Thank you.

331
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,095
Why were they after you?

332
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,555
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

333
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,016
You're right about that,

334
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,185
but I let some snakes loose

335
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,229
and ransacked their warehouse.

336
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,355
Wait…

337
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,109
You're the detective
who let those snakes loose?

338
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,611
You know about me?

339
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,905
Uh…

340
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,031
Not to toot my own horn,

341
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,908
but yes, that was me.

342
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,994
Word gets around fast here.

343
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,663
I was wondering

344
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,165
who would be insane enough to do that.

345
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,835
Excuse me?

346
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,171
Actually, it wasn't crazy.

347
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,007
- Wait, is that blood?
- It was a very brave…

348
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,471
Huh?

349
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,100
Gosh, let me see.

350
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,693
You need to get better at fighting,
not letting snakes loose.

351
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,864
Well, thank you.

352
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,785
I don't usually get beat up like this,

353
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,747
but I fought 17 to 1 tonight.

354
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,373
I guess they managed to get a hit in.

355
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,500
I see.

356
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,337
I'll pretend that's true.

357
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,340
You don't have to pretend.

358
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,508
I actually am a great fighter,

359
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,802
but things just got out of hand tonight.

360
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,181
All right, I understand.

361
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,266
I'm serious.

362
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,269
You don't seem to understand.

363
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,429
My goodness.

364
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,891
Someone is here to see you,
Detective Park.

365
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:13,975
Yes?

366
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,019
Okay.

367
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,230
Detective Park.

368
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,481
Chief Yu?

369
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,234
Jeez.

370
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,820
Are you okay? Are you not hurt?

371
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,279
Ah…

372
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,031
No, it's just a scratch, sir.

373
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,992
How did you find out?

374
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,370
That damned Viper called me.

375
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,122
He said you got lucky today,

376
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,665
but that your luck will run out.

377
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,627
Man.

378
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,797
What a shameless prick.

379
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,591
I see you're all right,
so I'll get going now.

380
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,676
Wait, Chief Yu.

381
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,595
Are you here
because you were worried about me?

382
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,931
I mean, I just…

383
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,728
Well, I have another question for you.

384
00:23:58,812 --> 00:23:59,855
What is it?

385
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,734
You didn't buy me a suit
with money lying around, did you?

386
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,321
I'm pinching pennies as it is.

387
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,366
Then why did you go out of your way
to do that?

388
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,577
You seem all right,
so I thought you could use a shine.

389
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,581
Use a shine?

390
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,916
I've got all the shine I need within me.

391
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,461
How dazzling.

392
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,673
See you tomorrow. Take care of yourself.

393
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,760
Take care, Chief Yu.

394
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,354
Are you prepared for your study abroad?

395
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,648
And your documents are in order?

396
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,526
Yes, Father.

397
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,029
Hojeong is a meticulous boy.

398
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,572
He's well prepared.

399
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,871
Don't tell me a part of you
still dreams of being a cop.

400
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,665
That's far from true, honey.

401
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,626
He gave that up a long time ago.

402
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,796
Good. Being a lowly cop isn't worth it.

403
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,090
They're just the slaves of authority.

404
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,676
You need to head out
into the greater world and study

405
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,512
to become someone
who controls the authority.

406
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:17,641
Overthrow Rhee Syngman the dictator

407
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,981
Did you see the police recruitment ad
back in that corner?

408
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,233
That's ridiculous.

409
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,735
Why would any student here
want to be some useless cop?

410
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,903
It would suit you.

411
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,988
Don't mess with me.

412
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,792
"Special recruitment for police."

413
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,712
Jongnam Police Station
Special recruitment for police

414
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,633
E-Excuse me.

415
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,594
Yes, would you like to apply?

416
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,936
Are you going to apply?

417
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,732
Application for the police

418
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,944
King of Swords

419
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,155
Is the second King of Swords book
out already?

420
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:15,865
What?

421
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,410
Well, yes.

422
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,497
Do you think I could find it
at a bookstore then?

423
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,624
Yes, you probably could.

424
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,043
Right, have a nice day.

425
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,339
Why did he take the form?

426
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,884
Jongnam Bookstore

427
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,183
Hyeju!

428
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,395
Huh?

429
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,065
Hyeju.

430
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,527
Nansil, the thing is…

431
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,739
The Criminal's Shadow

432
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,991
hasn't arrived yet?

433
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,869
I'm sorry,
but it's been delayed two weeks.

434
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,165
I was so excited to read it.

435
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,001
I didn't even get
a wink of sleep last night.

436
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,379
Why are you so obsessed
with mystery novels?

437
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,715
They're such a thrill,

438
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,926
all that looking for clues
and catching bad guys.

439
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:20,930
Hyeju.

440
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,017
I want to grow up to be a cop.

441
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,685
A cop?

442
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,062
I'm a cop

443
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,897
and there are gangsters after me.

444
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,107
Is there somewhere I can hide?

445
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,069
Isn't it too dangerous

446
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,862
to be a cop?

447
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,740
What's so dangerous about it?

448
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,326
Being a cop is super cool.

449
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,163
And without them,
who would catch the bad guys?

450
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,250
- You're right.
- Yes.

451
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,880
All right, I'll press the publisher
to hurry up with the book.

452
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,633
Really? You're the best.

453
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,717
As for today,

454
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,678
you should take this.

455
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,889
It's a special gift
for my favorite regular.

456
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:05,975
Really?

457
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,978
Between you and me,

458
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,398
it's my bribe to a future cop.

459
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,070
I don't usually accept this kind of stuff,

460
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,156
but I'll make an exception just this once.

461
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,991
Mm.

462
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,289
You look great
with that white thing on your forehead.

463
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,542
- Do I?
- Yes.

464
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,920
Then do you want one
on your forehead too, Hwang?

465
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,171
I-I'm good.

466
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,256
No, thank you.

467
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,509
Anyway, let's all stay safe and healthy.

468
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,804
Stop causing trouble, all right?

469
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,601
Imagine not giving a damn
about your colleague

470
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,811
getting knocked around.

471
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,567
Chief Yu, back in Hwangchun…

472
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,736
Enough about Hwangchun.

473
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,405
I've made up my mind.

474
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:04,451
From now on, we're moving as a team.

475
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,453
Can you even fight, Chief?

476
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,164
Are you kidding me?

477
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,582
Listen, you little brat.

478
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,293
Back in Mapo,
when I was still in my prime,

479
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,503
they called me the Steel Hammer.

480
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,674
Well, you're not nailing the point.

481
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,469
We need more people in our unit.

482
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,346
Units 2 and 3 have a handful of men each,

483
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,892
but it's only me in our unit.
This isn't fair.

484
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,852
I've tried recruiting, all right?

485
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,481
And I barely found you.

486
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,152
Jeez.

487
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,863
Back in Hwangchun,
the moment I put my thumb up,

488
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,448
an entire crowd would follow me.

489
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,576
Then stick your thumb out.

490
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,214
I know just the right one.

491
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,720
What are you doing?

492
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,682
I was looking at the file
on the Yusung Jewelry Store robbery.

493
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,393
Why would you do that in there?
Come on out into the light.

494
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,480
It's bright in here too.

495
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,565
Hey.

496
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,108
Come with me.

497
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,490
Why does he always make me follow him?

498
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,744
Come here.

499
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,584
Join our unit.

500
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,211
Why should I?

501
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,880
- Do you even like your unit?
- What do you think?

502
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,298
So join us.

503
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,842
But why?

504
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,678
It's better than crawling into
that dark cabinet all the time.

505
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,097
Why are you always in there anyway?

506
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,309
Is it strange for a dog
to be in a doghouse?

507
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,980
Come on, be serious.

508
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,273
Tell me the truth.

509
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,401
Jeez.

510
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,738
I hate even looking
at the chief and the others.

511
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,866
At some point,
I just might end up beating them up.

512
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,869
Hey, I feel the same way.

513
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,371
Whenever I see punks like them, I…

514
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:18,960
What I'm trying to say is,
people like us need to stick together.

515
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,881
I know you're going to give me crap
for being crazy.

516
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,841
I promise I won't.

517
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,467
And if you work with me,

518
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,887
you won't ever have to apologize
to the gangsters.

519
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,017
In that case,

520
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,228
can I keep biting the bad guys?

521
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,988
Fine, you can.

522
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,575
Just don't bite their ears off.

523
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,371
I'll try, but I can't promise
that I'll control myself.

524
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,043
All right, from now on,

525
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,295
you can drop the formality
and call me by my name.

526
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:06,090
That goes against the station rules.
The others will tell me off for that.

527
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,343
It's perfectly fine!

528
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,471
Back in Hwangchun,
we all called each other by our names.

529
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,265
Well, Yeonghan,

530
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,643
I'm starting to get sick
of hearing about Hwangchun.

531
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,063
Come on,
it's the home of the six-clove garlic.

532
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,191
Now, let's go get some soup.

533
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,735
What does that have to do with it?

534
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,489
Honestly, I don't think
the two of us are going to be enough.

535
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,992
Don't worry,
I know another one.

536
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,207
Are those rice sacks

537
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,667
full of cotton or what?

538
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,001
How is he doing that?

539
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,003
I'd say he's strong enough

540
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,089
to knock out
about a dozen guys on his own.

541
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,300
Don't you think
he's too big to go around investigating?

542
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,928
He won't even fit through most doors.

543
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,722
Then you do the investigating.

544
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,142
So I do all the work?

545
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,147
Could we speak to you for a moment?

546
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,151
You don't look like the Dongdaemun thugs.

547
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,029
- What is it?
- Dongdaemun? Come on.

548
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,491
Have you ever considered another job?

549
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,742
Are you from a different gang?

550
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,245
Get lost.

551
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,958
Would you like to be a cop?

552
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,002
Yes, a cop.

553
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,086
A cop?

554
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,298
Don't play with me!

555
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,425
W-We're serious.

556
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,926
Serious, my foot.

557
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,013
- You thought I'd fall for this?
- Look…

558
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,223
We're actual policemen.

559
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,059
POLICE IDENTIFICATION
Park Yeonghan

560
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,938
Why'd you have to grab me?

561
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,236
Are you interested?

562
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,656
Not at all.

563
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,618
- I'll go now.
- All right.

564
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,079
He really is a beast.

565
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,040
- My neck hurts.
- Hey, you!

566
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,083
Passing through.

567
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,626
Come on.

568
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,881
Application for the police

569
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,096
Frank Hamer

570
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,514
Sheriff.

571
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,266
It's time for us to part ways now.

572
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,102
Goodbye.

573
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,211
This is a miracle.

574
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,515
I'd like to apply.

575
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,397
Welcome!

576
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,107
You win, we win.

577
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,358
Kill two birds with one stone.

578
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,277
How nice would it be?

579
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,407
Are you going to keep following me?

580
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,535
We just want you to think it over.

581
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,704
It would be nice to serve the country,

582
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,455
but not as a cop.

583
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,582
Wait a minute.

584
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,919
- Why not?
- All cops do is extort money

585
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,504
and side with the gangsters.

586
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,424
We're not like those cops, all right?

587
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,342
We beat up the gangsters!

588
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,427
Cut the crap.

589
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,847
They're few and far between,
but good cops like me exist.

590
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,140
I'm sure they do,

591
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,894
just like that one cop who let
snakes loose on the Dongdaemun gang.

592
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,159
That one cop is me.

593
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,995
I'm the one who let 30 snakes loose
all over Ilsimkwan!

594
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,289
This right here
is the nutcase who did that.

595
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,752
You're that nutcase?

596
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,757
Could I really get to work
with you, Detective?

597
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,967
As long as you put your mind to it.

598
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,636
I'm just wondering.

599
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,180
Can you read and write?

600
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,849
Yes, I graduated from middle school,

601
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,726
and I'm preparing
for the high school qualification exam.

602
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,810
That's great!

603
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,647
I really didn't expect you to be educated
based on your looks.

604
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,524
Do you think all big guys are stupid?

605
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,901
I'm sorry.

606
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,611
The thing is,

607
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,365
can I be a cop just by being strong?

608
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,202
Of course,
that can't be your only qualification.

609
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,162
Then how do I become a cop?

610
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,708
Do you want to know?

611
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,793
Application for the police

612
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,336
You'll have to pass the test.

613
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,506
First, hand in your application
and take the physical examination.

614
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,176
I guarantee you'll pass it
with flying colors.

615
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,013
Then comes the main test.

616
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,099
You have two options.

617
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,392
One test…

618
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,561
evaluates the brain.

619
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,522
President of Hanju University

620
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,982
He went to Hanju University.

621
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,111
- Is this really yours?
- Yes, sir.

622
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,071
The other test evaluates the body.

623
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,115
Let's use your strength to your advantage.

624
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,661
Make it through the three-to-one fight,
and you'll pass.

625
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,426
One down.

626
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,727
Two down.

627
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,729
Transcript

628
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,188
You had straight A's?

629
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,690
Yes, sir.

630
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,485
You passed.

631
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,446
Thank you.

632
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,197
- No problem.
- Thank you so much.

633
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,206
Y-You pass.

634
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,750
Give him a hand!

635
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,044
Applause!

636
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,966
- Buckwheat rice cake.
- Do you want some?

637
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,427
- Sticky rice cake.
- You look just like rice cake.

638
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,970
Buckwheat rice cake.

639
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,181
Sticky rice cake.

640
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,224
I can take that.

641
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,729
You're not alone tonight
for once in your life.

642
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,481
I'm not always alone.

643
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,107
Stop the nonsense and go.

644
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,234
He's a good man at heart.

645
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,237
Please don't abandon him.

646
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,739
Stop the nonsense.

647
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,241
- Let me pour you a drink.
- Thank you.

648
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,286
You too, loner.

649
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,456
I'm not a loner.
I have a friend right here.

650
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,458
Right, little friend?

651
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:41,670
Here's to Jo Gyeonghwan
officially becoming a cop.

652
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,255
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

653
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,427
It's time for introductions.

654
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,679
My name is Park Yeonghan.

655
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,015
I'm 27, and I'm from…

656
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,225
He's from Hwangchun.

657
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:59,438
It's famous
for the six-clove onion or whatever.

658
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:03,734
He also has the most cow thief arrests
in all of Korea.

659
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,406
Hwangchun is home to the six-clove garlic.

660
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,658
I'm sick of hearing that.

661
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,618
I'm Kim Sangsun, age 25.

662
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,120
I'm Korea's…

663
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,377
best biter.

664
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,505
He's a mad dog.

665
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,885
My name is Jo Gyeonghwan.

666
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,595
I'm from Yeoju, Gyeonggi-do.

667
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,848
I'm 24 years old.

668
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,724
You're a year younger than me?

669
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,186
Can I speak casually to you then?

670
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,731
Well, we're only a year apart.

671
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,693
"Well, we're only a year apart"?

672
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,736
Gyeonghwan.

673
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,822
It's just a year,
but he's still older than you.

674
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,407
And he also has a higher rank.

675
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,825
Treat him with respect.

676
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,538
You can speak casually to me.

677
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,375
All right, I'll give it a try.

678
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,379
There are two things we need to remember.

679
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,340
Protect the weak.

680
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,552
And beat the crap out of bad guys.

681
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,557
What if we beat up the weak
and protect the bad guys?

682
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,643
Then you'll turn into Detective Hwang.

683
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,563
Why would you even joke
about turning into him?

684
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,648
Who's Detective Hwang?

685
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,358
Some punk
who always has lettuce up his teeth.

686
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,778
You saw that too?

687
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,702
My goodness.

688
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,746
The oil splattered on your forehead.

689
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,290
Let me take a look.

690
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,377
- Are you okay?
- A little lower.

691
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,172
- Here?
- No, right here.

692
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,595
I wish I was him.

693
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,766
That's ridiculous. Just drink.

694
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,603
"I wish I was him." Seriously?

695
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,278
What's wrong with you?

696
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,405
Oh…

697
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,324
Let's all drink up.

698
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,203
You're a lightweight, Yeonghan.

699
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,763
You startled me.

700
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,350
I'm sorry about that.

701
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,062
How's your wound?

702
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,523
Oh, right.

703
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,649
Y-Yes.

704
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,860
It'll heal soon, thanks to you.

705
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,167
You're not here to buy books, are you?

706
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,004
Well, no.

707
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:11,922
The thing is,

708
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,594
I feel like
I didn't thank you enough that day.

709
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,304
So thank you…

710
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,931
very much.

711
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,684
It really wasn't a big deal.

712
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,561
What do you mean?

713
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:31,650
Not everyone can help others like you did
in such an urgent situation.

714
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,486
I guess you could say I'm pretty fearless.

715
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,281
When my mother had me,

716
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:40,743
she dreamed of a puppy
biting a tiger to death.

717
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,202
A tiger biting…

718
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,288
I mean, a puppy biting a tiger?

719
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,040
Wow.

720
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:51,503
I must say,
that's quite an extraordinary dream.

721
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,009
All right.

722
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,560
If you're done, I'll get going.

723
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,729
Of course.

724
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,689
Good night.

725
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,483
Thank you.

726
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,323
- Just a moment.
- Yes?

727
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,036
In all honesty, I came here

728
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,747
to repay my debt to you.

729
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,333
Right.

730
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,335
Okay.

731
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,004
How will you repay it?

732
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,547
Well…

733
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,259
I'd like to take you out for a film.

734
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,555
I hear there's one
that's quite the craze these days.

735
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,184
Just the two of us?

736
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,522
If you feel uncomfortable,
please feel free to bring friends.

737
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,112
Have you bought the tickets already?

738
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,447
Yes, I have.

739
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,535
I only bought two.

740
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,248
With only two tickets,
I guess it'll just have to be us two.

741
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:15,671
I should've asked you before buying them.

742
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,339
I'm sorry.

743
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,219
Well, what's the film called?

744
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,013
Right.

745
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,433
The film…

746
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,810
is this one.

747
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,311
Have you seen it already?

748
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,399
That's a relief. I hear it's really good.

749
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,859
I'm excited.

750
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,078
Your thumb really worked, Detective Park.

751
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,248
What is this?
Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

752
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,458
You're Liu Bei.

753
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,043
He's Guan Yu.

754
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,379
And he's Zhang Fei.

755
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,965
What are you talking about?

756
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,009
Guan Yu doesn't bite ears off.

757
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,554
So how strong are you, Gyeonghwan?

758
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,055
I could carry you, sir,

759
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,600
like a small pouch.

760
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,019
Amazing.

761
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,729
He was Yeoju's best arm wrestler.

762
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,648
Take care of yourself,
or you'll end up a boar.

763
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,233
This might all turn into fat.

764
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:19,902
That won't happen.

765
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,905
Good.

766
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,490
Attention, everyone!

767
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:32,915
An outstanding talent
has decided to grace our station,

768
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,292
so I'm here to introduce him personally.

769
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,961
For the first time
in Jongnam Station history!

770
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,380
We have here
a graduate of Hanju University!

771
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,053
What was your name again?

772
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,514
- Seo Hojeong, sir.
- Seo Hojeong.

773
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,599
It's Seo Hojeong, not Sergeant.

774
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,605
This is Unit 2
of the Investigation Division,

775
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,689
which you'll be joining.

776
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,066
Hello.

777
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,653
My name is Seo Hojeong, and I passed
the 18th special recruitment test.

778
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:05,155
With your résumé, why choose to be a cop
instead of going to law school?

779
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,282
What do you mean why?

780
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,410
This just shows
how much the police have grown in stature.

781
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,745
You're right, sir.

782
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,331
I'm very sorry to interrupt,

783
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,375
but does anyone here know English?

784
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,543
What's going on?

785
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,670
An American was stopped and searched
on the street,

786
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,506
and it turns out
he had possession of dynamite.

787
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,259
Do you know any English, Hanju University?

788
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,386
Just a little.

789
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,680
Look, look.
Did you all see that?

790
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,265
- He's just different.
- He is.

791
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,891
Hurry up and go. Come on, go.

792
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,601
- Yes, sir.
- Okay!

793
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,273
- Who are you anyway?
- I'm a new recruit.

794
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,440
A rookie?

795
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,733
Why aren't you all going?

796
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,986
- Let's go.
- Go and learn something!

797
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,445
- Yes, sir.
- Go!

798
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,530
Come on.

799
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,906
- Salute.
- My gosh!

800
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,993
You nearly gave me a damn heart attack!

801
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,246
A Hanju University graduate?

802
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,081
Our station just got
a whole lot smarter now.

803
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,545
Smarter? He looks like an eel.

804
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,921
Eel?

805
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,717
His face seems so familiar.

806
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,135
Where have I seen him?

807
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,264
Please don't come over here.

808
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,766
Chief Yu.

809
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,520
I heard you got a bigger unit.

810
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,148
Is this it?

811
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,150
Senior Superintendent Choi!

812
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,154
They're each special in their own way.

813
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,822
So they are, are they?

814
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,657
He lets snakes loose.

815
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,326
He bites.

816
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,537
Is his specialty being a big oaf?

817
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,664
The punks we've destroyed

818
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,334
- know our strengths well.
- Is that so?

819
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,878
I failed to recognize
such eminent talents.

820
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,212
I sincerely apologize.

821
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,132
Right. Talented detectives,

822
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:51,345
why don't you all do some public service
for the people of Seoul?

823
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,221
What do you think?

824
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,600
You should join them, Chief Yu.

825
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,560
- Me too?
- Yes, you.

826
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,313
Enjoy your public service.

827
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,154
What's public service?

828
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,489
I don't know. Don't ask me.

829
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,575
What is it this time?

830
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,535
Something's fishy.

831
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,373
Hey, look at this.

832
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,416
- It's not legal.
- No way.

833
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,502
I-I work at the mine.

834
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,172
I have permits… for everything.

835
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,840
Judging by his face,

836
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,343
I guarantee he's up to no good.

837
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,054
Keep questioning him. Keep going.

838
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:38,725
You are planning to use this illegally.

839
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,729
If you don't tell me the truth right now,

840
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,733
we will send you over to the US military.

841
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,235
Okay.

842
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,196
I'll… I'll talk, but…

843
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,323
let me have a cigarette.

844
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,785
He wants a smoke before he talks.

845
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:59,496
- No chance.
- No.

846
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,956
The dynamite…

847
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,040
Boom!

848
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,667
- No.
- How ridiculous.

849
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,210
I-I promise.

850
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,004
I'll confess.

851
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,007
Just… after I have a cigarette.

852
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,175
I'm… I'm nervous.

853
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,094
He's so nervous

854
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,222
he needs a smoke before confessing.

855
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:20,559
You wimpy little Western prick.

856
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,520
Take the bag somewhere else,

857
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,980
Detective Oh.

858
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,064
All right.

859
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,528
Hey, here you go.

860
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,323
- Thank you.
- Thank you…

861
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,533
…my foot.

862
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,577
Here.

863
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,211
- No!
- Hey!

864
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,881
- Hey!
- No!

865
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,007
I'll do it!

866
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,509
- Move!
- Calm down.

867
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,845
- I'll blow it up!
- So what he's saying is--

868
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:59,347
We understand that much!

869
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,432
Do something!

870
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:04,227
These Westerners are more cowardly
than they look.

871
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,979
He's bluffing. He won't actually do it.

872
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,231
Go ahead!

873
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,192
If you do, you will die too!

874
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,529
Yes, that's right.

875
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:17,240
You're right, rookie. Okay.

876
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,701
- Calm him down.
- Go ahead, blow it up!

877
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,037
- You idiot!
- Hey.

878
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,457
No, no!

879
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,209
- Wait.
- Get out!

880
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,211
Come on!

881
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,296
Wait for me.

882
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,341
Damn it!

883
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,592
Don't do that!

884
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,519
Throw it somewhere,
you idiot!

885
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,981
What's going on? What is it?

886
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,818
- Get down!
- What is it?

887
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,528
Get down!

888
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,904
What?

889
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,906
Get down!

890
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,667
What's that?

891
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,418
Isn't that dynamite?

892
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,842
Go, get rid of it!

893
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,510
Where do you think you're going?

894
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,195
My car!

895
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,639
Detective Park.

896
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,100
What happened here?

897
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,686
It seems we just missed them.

898
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:10,854
I'm boiling with rage.

899
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,982
It was a perfect chance
to send them to hell.

900
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,613
There they are! Get them!

901
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,947
Let's go!

902
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,088
What are we even doing here?

903
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,983
Did you just…

904
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,528
Good job, kid.

905
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,489
Cut!

906
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,583
Hey, are you okay?

907
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,126
You actually hit me.

908
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,212
Don't you feel pain?

909
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:18,880
Not really.

910
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,966
So how is this public service?

911
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,634
Don't ask me.

912
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:29,516
Come on,
why can't you real cops act like one?

913
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:33,561
I even asked Senior Superintendent Choi
for his best actors.

914
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,856
Make it feel real.

915
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,108
One more time!

916
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,276
All right.

917
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,070
What did he just say?

918
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,530
I hate this so much.

919
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,990
Does he want us

920
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,658
to hit for real?

921
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,207
It's a shame we didn't even have a scene
with the Korean Marilyn Monroe.

922
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,377
Any more of this public service,
and we'll end up dead.

923
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,298
Senior Superintendent Choi
really holds a grudge, doesn't he?

924
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,258
That's not all.

925
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:05,427
He loves money and sucks up to authority.

926
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,262
Chief Yu.

927
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,557
- I have another question.
- What is it?

928
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:14,060
You're the only thorn
in his side at the station.

929
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,687
How haven't you been fired yet?

930
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,230
I've wondered that too.

931
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,691
From what I've heard,

932
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:22,736
you used to whoop
the Dongdaemun gang before I came.

933
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,947
Either Lee Jungjae
would've taken care of you

934
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,825
or Senior Superintendent Choi
would've fired you.

935
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,994
You aren't the president's nephew
or anything, are you?

936
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,287
That's ridiculous.

937
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,623
- It's hard to explain.
- I wonder what it is.

938
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,250
- What is it, sir?
- What could it be?

939
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,503
Curiosity kills the cat.
You'll find out soon enough.

940
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,883
- What's going on?
- What is that?

941
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,224
What happened?

942
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:54,851
What on earth?

943
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,189
Did the armed guerrilla stop by or what?

944
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,654
Where is he?

945
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,074
Sir?

946
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,617
The punk that escaped.

947
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:14,037
It seems he left Jongnam-gu already.

948
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,085
Hey, you!

949
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,545
You said the Westerners were cowards.

950
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,215
That prick was afraid of nothing!

951
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,968
What happened? Did we get bombed?

952
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,180
Jongnam Station's best talent

953
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,974
blew up the Senior Superintendent's car.

954
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,143
What happened, Hanju University?

955
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,728
Were you an armed guerrilla?

956
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,065
Get lost. I don't want to see you.

957
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,863
Get lost!

958
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,354
Why do all the lonely ones
show up at my restaurant?

959
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,575
Frank Hamer

960
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:56,014
Come on, why won't you listen?

961
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,767
I told you to pay your dues
by month's end!

962
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,061
I'm sorry,

963
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,897
but I'm hard up.

964
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,358
Then you'll have to pay up with pain.

965
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,570
Hey, you!

966
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,616
Do you bastards never sleep in?

967
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:17,202
Can't you wait until after breakfast
for your tantrum?

968
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,579
I could ask you bunch the same question.

969
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,663
"You bunch"?

970
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,458
Show some respect, you rotten punk.

971
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,460
The Rice Boy is a cop now?

972
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,586
I don't know.

973
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,506
Why are you all up so early,

974
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,424
detectives?

975
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:34,302
We'll be having breakfast here
every morning.

976
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,554
You know,
to exchange greetings with you all.

977
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,435
Let's leave.

978
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,904
You worthless,
no-good scumbags!

979
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,782
Thank goodness
we won't have to see them do that again.

980
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,534
That was refreshing to watch.

981
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,619
Are you all right, sir?

982
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,997
Don't you worry anymore.

983
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,291
- Oh, that's hot!
- We'll protect you from now on.

984
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,420
Where should we go for lunch?

985
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,797
How about near Jongnam Theater?

986
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,341
I bet the Dongdaemun thugs
are all gathered over there.

987
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,176
The Haksoo Intersection
is full of them too.

988
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,637
- I'll lead the way there.
- All right. Let's go!

989
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,605
You smell that, gentlemen?

990
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:32,652
That is the smell of garlic and wet feet,

991
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,405
also known as… kimchi eaters!

992
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:36,990
Sit down.

993
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,158
Hey, Second Lieutenant,
watch your behavior.

994
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,328
Oh. Did I make the first lieutenant angry?

995
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:47,875
It ain't my fault you were born
smelling like a pair of wet shoes.

996
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:51,087
If you keep making trouble,
I'll report you to the military police.

997
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,006
Ooh!

998
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,258
Okay.

999
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,136
Do it, First Lieutenant.

1000
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,680
I dare you.

1001
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,853
Do it, Kimchi Eater.

1002
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,273
Oh!

1003
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,317
Present yourself. That's an order.

1004
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,526
Whoa!

1005
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,278
Calm down.

1006
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,488
Calm down. It's okay.

1007
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,282
Just having a little fun, all right?

1008
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,075
It's cool.

1009
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,410
Nothing's up.

1010
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:34,547
Don't move,

1011
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,175
you racist jerk.

1012
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,263
Sit still, will you?

1013
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,434
Who are these guys?

1014
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,895
They dined and dashed, sir.

1015
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,649
Pay for your damn food, you broke punks.

1016
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:53,983
What are you looking at?

1017
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,652
What did they have again?

1018
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,904
They had pancakes.
Vegetable pancakes.

1019
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,324
Huh? Isn't that Hanju University?

1020
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,576
I thought he was a shoe shiner.

1021
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,455
Come on.

1022
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,666
You call this polished?

1023
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,460
I'm sorry, sir.
I've never done this before.

1024
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:16,047
You're only to practice
polishing shoes from now on, got it?

1025
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,799
Yes, sir.

1026
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:20,176
A report was called in
from Grand Restaurant

1027
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,261
about American soldiers
involved in a fight with each other.

1028
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,098
Not those Western punks again.

1029
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,349
Do they have guns?

1030
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,851
According to the officer on the scene,
no guns are present.

1031
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:29,977
All right.

1032
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,939
Lock the thugs up and head over there.

1033
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,607
We're busy right now.

1034
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,734
Have Unit 2 do it.

1035
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:42,907
They don't deal with Americans
saying there's nothing in it for them.

1036
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:43,991
Come on, go.

1037
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,785
He's right.

1038
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:50,331
We'll go, since we don't need to benefit
from doing what's right.

1039
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:55,670
But how are we going to break up the fight
when none of us speak English?

1040
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,100
Hey, Hanju University.

1041
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,147
Come speak some English for us.

1042
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:15,815
That's not happening.

1043
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,109
He's too busy shining our shoes.

1044
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:19,610
You're staying here.

1045
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,696
Shoes?

1046
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,783
This one's shining clean.
Take a look at it.

1047
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,871
How could you miss the catch?

1048
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,042
A cop should do what cops do.
Come on, let's go.

1049
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,419
- That little…
- Come on.

1050
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,545
- Hey.
- Let's go.

1051
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,130
That little…

1052
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,966
- You okay?
- Yes, sir.

1053
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:44,343
Hey, wipe your face.

1054
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,971
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.

1055
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,600
- Let's go.
- Get up, you punks.

1056
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:51,684
You better not…

1057
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:07,158
Police

1058
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,703
Salute.

1059
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,289
- Where's the military police?
- It'll take them a while to come.

1060
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,666
Why can't you enter?
Are they still fighting?

1061
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,127
No, but they're in a standoff
with their guns at each other.

1062
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,423
Guns? We were told
no guns were on the scene.

1063
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:25,343
If we had known,
we would've brought our guns too.

1064
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,811
Western cuisine restaurant

1065
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,529
Isn't that white guy
and the others behind him

1066
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:46,280
the smugglers from the warehouse?

1067
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:50,493
Why are they always causing trouble?

1068
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,787
We'll get shot if we go right in.

1069
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,960
Yeonghan, since we're dealing
with American soldiers,

1070
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,545
let's wait for the military police.

1071
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,421
What if someone dies?

1072
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,798
That's their problem.

1073
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,299
No one told them to use guns here.

1074
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,427
The thing is,

1075
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,680
I don't care
if they're American or Korean.

1076
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:13,140
I'm not going to let
innocent people die on my watch.

1077
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,351
That's why I became a cop.

1078
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,272
Look, we're not the UN.

1079
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,692
Let's at least wear iron plates
on our stomachs when we go in.

1080
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,903
Should I try talking
to the American soldiers?

1081
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,739
Did you forget that talking to them
is what got you polishing shoes?

1082
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,449
It'll be different this time.

1083
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,577
I once read a case about a standoff
just like this.

1084
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,745
Real life isn't like the books, young man.

1085
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:36,831
Tell us what you know.

1086
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:39,834
Is there a back entrance
that leads to the kitchen?

1087
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,004
Put the gun down.

1088
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:45,590
If you don't cause any trouble,
I'll let it slide.

1089
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,887
What makes you think
I would trust someone like you?

1090
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,764
- Who are you?
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot.

1091
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:56,350
I'm the chef here.

1092
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,854
And this is my assistant.

1093
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,940
Get out. Now!

1094
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,650
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot.
- Hold on.

1095
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,402
- Don't shoot.
- Hold on.

1096
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,029
B-Before we go,

1097
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,197
I have a favor to ask.

1098
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,700
Jesus Christ, what?

1099
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,535
First, I'll change the subject

1100
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:16,579
- to an entirely irrelevant one.
- I have a test

1101
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:18,289
for the US Army cook.

1102
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,667
So I practiced cooking earlier.

1103
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,128
Could you try just once?

1104
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,340
What the hell is going on?

1105
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:30,676
Speak…

1106
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,845
English.

1107
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,097
I totally respect

1108
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,558
white people's tastes and standards.

1109
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,311
Then we'll give them
a sense of superiority…

1110
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,729
A-America,

1111
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:43,022
number one!

1112
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:44,398
Nice!

1113
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,484
…so they let their guard down.

1114
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,577
Okay.

1115
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,288
Why not?

1116
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:00,539
Thank you.

1117
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,459
Come on.

1118
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,798
Please go ahead. Eat.

1119
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,472
What the hell is this?

1120
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,017
- Gaebap.
- What?

1121
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,061
Dog food!

1122
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,437
Son of a…

1123
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:47,920
Hey!

1124
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:00,850
Let go.

1125
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,977
Yeonghan!

1126
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,900
Yeonghan!

1127
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,238
Stop, stop, stop!

1128
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,656
Don't move.

1129
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,875
Freeze.

1130
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,473
Man, you're done.

1131
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,106
Gosh.

1132
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:31,107
I'm Lieutenant Steve Jackson.

1133
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,316
Thank you for rescuing me.

1134
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:36,529
If you need any testimony
about today's incident,

1135
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:39,448
feel free to contact us.

1136
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:45,496
And my colleagues can also testify
about the smuggling crimes.

1137
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,833
That's great.
Let me know whenever you need help.

1138
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:52,711
Okay.

1139
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,552
Take care, Steve.

1140
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:08,686
I thought I was going to die.

1141
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,980
Hey, what did you talk about?

1142
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,065
You didn't understand them?

1143
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,984
They said nice things.

1144
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:18,988
Kid, haven't we met before?

1145
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,615
Yes. When you came into Jongnam Bookstore

1146
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,701
to escape the gangsters after you.

1147
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,328
You told us you never run away.

1148
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:31,000
Believe half of what he says.

1149
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,169
Folks from the country love to exaggerate.

1150
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,670
Right.

1151
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,755
You talked about a case just earlier.

1152
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,090
What book was it from?

1153
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,593
It doesn't exist.

1154
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,470
- What?
- Did you lie to us?

1155
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,681
No, I came up with a strategy.

1156
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:46,765
Look.

1157
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:50,895
So your greatest strength isn't English,
but lying?

1158
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,939
I'm sorry, sir.
Please forgive me.

1159
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,150
Forgive what?

1160
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:00,738
You did well.

1161
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,952
Do you want to join our unit?

1162
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,037
Pardon?

1163
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,331
Let's work together.

1164
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,459
Me?

1165
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,543
Yes.

1166
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,426
What use is he going to be?

1167
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:23,594
What if he messes up?

1168
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:26,847
We need a brain like Zhuge Liang
from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

1169
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:29,808
I thought you hated that reference.

1170
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,271
Do you know how to drive?

1171
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:36,607
No.

1172
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:39,777
Why would you…

1173
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:51,747
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

1174
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:44,550
GRAND
Western cuisine restaurant

1175
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:52,725
Chief Detective 1958

1176
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,477
- Nobody moves!
We're done training.

1177
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:56,603
It's time for the real operation.

1178
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:57,896
Seoul is next.

1179
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:01,358
So the robbers are trained,
former military men?

1180
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:03,736
They actually shoot people.
Will you be okay?

1181
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:04,903
I won't just sit by.

1182
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:08,240
This is Detective Kim Sangsun,
who will go undercover as a guard.

1183
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,950
Stand firm, Sangsun.

1184
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,201
Freeze.

1185
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,619


1186
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:13,871
permission to shoot if you disobey.

1187
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:16,040


1188
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:17,916
- We're taking the girl.
- Take me instead.

1189
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,626
His radio is down.

1190
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,462
- Don't do it!
- Do you regret becoming a cop?

1191
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:23,714
If we don't solve this case…

1192
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:26,175
…someone's life could be destroyed.
