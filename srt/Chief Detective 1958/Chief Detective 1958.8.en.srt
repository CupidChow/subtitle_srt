1
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,949
Chief Detective 1958

2
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
This series is unrelated to any places,
persons, settings or events.

3
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,953
Scenes involving animals were filmed in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.

4
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,123
Looking into our nation's
five-year plan to produce steel…

5
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,624
Self-Reliance Pioneer Corps

6
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,752
300 children and unemployed persons

7
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,879
who lived their lives in dishonor

8
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,339
will plow the land
and find a new lease on life.

9
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:52,677
The land, stretching 240 jungbo,
is annually scheduled to produce

10
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,804
about 1,000 seoms of rice
and 1,500 seoms of barley.

11
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,475
Episode 8
Regarding Guilt

12
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,205
Let's go!

13
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,439
Did you go to the temple to pray
early this morning?

14
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,735
Well, yes.

15
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,779
You really don't have to worry.

16
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,156
If the heavens give us a child, then good.

17
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,034
If not, then it'll just be us two
living happily.

18
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,954
You don't mind not having a child?

19
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,997
Of course I don't mind.

20
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,793
Passing on my family name
doesn't matter to me at all.

21
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,462
What matters to me is us two.

22
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,007
Are you saying that just to comfort me?

23
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,760
No, I mean it.

24
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,847
Let's eat.

25
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,352
The soup is unbelievably good today.

26
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,985
Episode 8

27
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,653
My goodness. Hey.

28
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,280
You'll blow the window open.

29
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,367
I'll make sure
I don't blow toward you.

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,619
What's weighing you down?

31
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,622
Nothing. Life is amazing.

32
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,666
Come on, tell me.

33
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:57,051
How did you feel
when Eunyoung was born, Chief?

34
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,720
I just felt dazed.

35
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:02,807
It hit me like a truck
that I was actually a dad.

36
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,309
That's just how it was.

37
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,853
The world is a scary place,

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,147
and it'll only get worse.

39
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,525
Would it be right for me

40
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,069
to bring a child into this world?

41
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,531
Hmm…

42
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,491
I'm afraid…

43
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,246
…of passing on such a cruel world
to my child.

44
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,873
Am I making sense?

45
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,626
We're used to seeing
how dark the world is,

46
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,419
so it makes sense
for you to feel that way.

47
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,671
I'm able to bear the brunt of it…

48
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,800
but my child may not be like me.

49
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,097
It's the parents' job
to give their children the world,

50
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,266
but it's on the children
to accept that world.

51
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,895
No parent worth their salt
is full of fear.

52
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,023
It takes a lot of guts
to be a parent, you know.

53
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,654
Chief Yu!

54
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,365
It's an emergency, sir.

55
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,492
Three in one night?

56
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,328
Yes, and at 30-minute intervals.

57
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,496
And the location?

58
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,623
The second street
of Sangbeon in Jongnam, sir.

59
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,126
They were all assaulted
with a blunt weapon

60
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,419
and robbed in a drunken state.

61
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,715
All three of the victims
were also middle-aged men.

62
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,551
They picked seemingly well-off victims
unable to put up a fight.

63
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,011
How hurt are the victims?

64
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,138
Two are seriously injured but conscious,

65
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,308
and one hasn't yet regained consciousness.

66
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,810
What kind of a bold prick

67
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,020
commits a serial snatching
in the middle of Seoul?

68
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,399
Considering the crime,
the victims were assaulted very heavily.

69
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,652
Crimes against the drunk
have a strong chance of repeating.

70
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,112
We need to catch the perp at once.

71
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,196
All right.

72
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,073
Hey, snatchers are as quick as lightning.

73
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,033
It's like trying to catch a rabbit.

74
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,743
Pardon me, Chief Yu.

75
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,538
Here's a fast rabbit. What is it?

76
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,000
A woman in her thirties
was murdered in Hwasin-dong.

77
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,919
But we need to go catch a snatcher.

78
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,173
The other units are all working security
for a National Police event.

79
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,760
Do those National Police punks think
they're the president?

80
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,805
Detective Seo and I will take a look
at the murder case.

81
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,265
All right.

82
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,726
Let's go catch that rabbit, Gyeonghwan.

83
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,353
I hope the snatcher has big bunny ears
so I can bite them right off.

84
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,983
Goodness, there's never
a peaceful day in this city.

85
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,402
Look for any witnesses first.

86
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,738
Question the victims too.

87
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,949
Would they even remember anything
if they were drunk?

88
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,785
They just might remember
the moment they got hit.

89
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,496
One time I was drunk,
I hit my foot on the door sill.

90
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,831
That sobered me up right away.

91
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,542
If you're plastered,
you could get beat by 10 guys

92
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,169
and not remember a thing.

93
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,254
They're taking a lot today.

94
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,714
One at a time.

95
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,257
- Come on, get on.
- Where are we going?

96
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,800
Gosan Pioneer Corps?

97
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,761
What in the world is that?

98
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,971
Kwangyoung and Gosan
are running a land reclamation project.

99
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,556
Those kids are heading over to work.

100
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,434
It used to be called
the Self-Reliance Pioneer Corps.

101
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:55,521
They give you money and land
and let you settle down there.

102
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,231
Maybe I should join them then.

103
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,193
Come on, are you strong enough
to even lift a shovel?

104
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:04,113
All I need to do
is bite the shovel, Yeonghan!

105
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,785
You'll end up in a circus
showing off your feat of strength.

106
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,621
Oh, no. Never mind.

107
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,832
Do you know anything
about the snatchings from last night?

108
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,751
- No.
- Is that so?

109
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,002
Well, thank you.

110
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,715
Did you hear about the snatchings
or know anyone who did?

111
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,966
- Hello.
- No.

112
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,259
No? Thank you.

113
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,596
It's the same story in that back alley,
the front of the theater,

114
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,515
and this place right here.

115
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,060
Even right before curfew,
these places aren't so empty.

116
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,437
And yet we can't find any witnesses

117
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,106
whether they be merchants or residents.

118
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,067
But I mean,
we're not even on the outskirts.

119
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,527
This is the heart of the city.

120
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,779
The culprit is one lucky guy.

121
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,072
Either he's lucky

122
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,990
- or there's more of them.
- What?

123
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,909
Someone acted as a lookout,

124
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,245
and the other struck
while no one was looking.

125
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,665
Why would they put so much effort
into robbing people here?

126
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,710
Do you know where the richest neighborhood
in Korea is?

127
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,546
Well…

128
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,718
Right, it's this neighborhood.

129
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,156
- Greetings, sir.
- Yes.

130
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,119
Who's that?

131
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,121
He's the victim's son.

132
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,082
He discovered the body
and reported the murder.

133
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,005
- Let's go.
- All right.

134
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,798
Hello, sir.

135
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,966
Hello.

136
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,596
This is the bloodiest murder
I've seen recently.

137
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,598
What can you tell us?

138
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,725
The stab wounds
are concentrated on her chest.

139
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,561
I can roughly count
about 10 to 12 punctures.

140
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,815
The cause of death is hypovolemic shock
due to multiple punctures.

141
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,859
Roughly estimating

142
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,944
based on the state of rigor mortis,

143
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,780
the time of death
is between 4 to 5 a.m. this morning.

144
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,283
That's right after curfew was lifted.

145
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,788
Was that the murder weapon?

146
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,375
Yes. According to the son,
it's a fruit knife they use at home.

147
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,047
I barely see any signs of resistance.

148
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,634
Yeonghan, it seems
she was murdered in her sleep.

149
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,472
Is there anything else we should know?

150
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,057
Well,

151
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,060
she has a cut on her left forefinger,

152
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,646
which was probably
from four or five days ago.

153
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,400
I'll let you know any other details
after the autopsy.

154
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,988
What's your name?

155
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,491
It's Kim Mansoo.

156
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,368
Okay, Mansoo.

157
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,289
Did you hear anything
out of the ordinary last night?

158
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,379
So you found your mother like that
as soon as you woke up?

159
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,798
Yes.

160
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,008
Usually,

161
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,844
she wakes me up in the mornings.

162
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,846
But she didn't come this morning,

163
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,766
so I went to her room and…

164
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,689
I assume
your gate is always closed at night.

165
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,482
Was it open this morning?

166
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:31,529
Yes, it was open when I checked.

167
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,448
And your father?

168
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,331
He passed away last year.

169
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,545
He drowned while fishing.

170
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:54,302
You go to school, don't you?
Are you on vacation?

171
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,762
Yes, but…

172
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,391
I can't go to school even if it starts.

173
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,976
Why not?

174
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,644
I have…

175
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,896
lung problems.

176
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,776
I've taken time off of school
since last year.

177
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,280
Detective Park.

178
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,033
I think you should step outside
for a moment.

179
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,117
All right.

180
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,873
Just a moment, Mansoo.

181
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,127
Right here.

182
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,714
It seems the perpetrator came through here

183
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,175
and entered over this wall.

184
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,511
Then after the murder,

185
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,388
they escaped through the gate.

186
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,432
Were there any signs of robbery?

187
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,268
No, her wallet was untouched
and the house was clean.

188
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,896
The motive must be a grudge then.

189
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,691
In that case,

190
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,611
it's likely the victim was killed
by an acquaintance.

191
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,037
It all happened in the blink of an eye.

192
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,830
I felt a flash of pain

193
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,916
and immediately blacked out.

194
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,418
So you couldn't see any faces?

195
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,339
Not at all. I was struck from behind.

196
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,049
Where did you drink?

197
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,093
At the Royal Beer
on the second street of Sangbeon.

198
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,887
Jeez, that's one luxurious pub.

199
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,224
I was plastered.

200
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,518
I only remember something hitting my head.

201
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:29,897
Rack your brain and try to recall
even an ounce of detail,

202
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,693
perhaps the perp's clothes
or what weapon they used on you.

203
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,654
Just an ounce of detail?

204
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,325
This is all a bit blurry,

205
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,120
but I think they beat me with a club,

206
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,082
one of those short bats you see in films
that old prison guards used.

207
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,291
It felt like one of those.

208
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,669
Do those even exist nowadays?

209
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,839
I guess there are some nasty prison guards
that are out and about.

210
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,384
- Thank you.
- No problem.

211
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,220
It was an ordinary, peaceful family.

212
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,597
I know that Mansoo is a good kid.

213
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,600
Was there any bad blood that you know of?

214
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,270
Goodness, not at all.

215
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,732
Mansoo's father was also a gentle soul,

216
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,108
not to mention rich.

217
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,279
Do you happen to know

218
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,407
anything more about the family's wealth?

219
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,409
Rumors say

220
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:27,663
Mansoo's father owns
a large plot of land in Chungcheong-do.

221
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,291
- Land?
- They found a hot spring on it

222
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,835
and now it's worth its weight in gold.

223
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,463
I've heard that rumor too.

224
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:40,092
But I don't know if I should say this.

225
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,846
Wouldn't it be better to tell them?

226
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,559
You're killing me right now.
Please just tell me.

227
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,689
You see, Mansoo's mother…

228
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,358
She had another man.

229
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,362
Was this while her husband was alive?

230
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,573
No, of course not!

231
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,117
They started seeing each other
shortly after he died,

232
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,203
- so you can't call that an affair.
- That's right.

233
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,497
He was something like a boyfriend to her.

234
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,126
He used to meet her secretly.

235
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,712
But lately, he would frequent it
like it was his house.

236
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,594
Goodness, look at that.

237
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,555
Do you know who the man is?

238
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,309
He manages the Chungtap Grill
in front of Jongnam Hall.

239
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,443
What?

240
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,071
How could this happen?

241
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,281
When did you last see her?

242
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,491
Yesterday afternoon.

243
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,410
We had lunch nearby.

244
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,497
- And after that?
- We said goodbye around 2 p.m.

245
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,374
I didn't see her after.

246
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,917
We had promised to meet tonight.

247
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,752
Where were you last night?

248
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,046
I went home and slept after work.

249
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,842
Is there anyone who can vouch for you?

250
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:06,136
Yes, my boarding house lady can.

251
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,972
You can ask her.

252
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,683
How long had you been together?

253
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,560
A little less than a year.

254
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,980
She was a customer at the restaurant
when I first saw her.

255
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,773
How was your relationship?

256
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,359
Did you often fight at all?

257
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,319
We had small quarrels now and then.

258
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,948
But otherwise, we were on great terms.

259
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,244
How was your relationship
with her son, Mansoo?

260
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,537
Mansoo?

261
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,543
Naturally, he wasn't too happy
about me at first,

262
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,504
but we were slowly growing closer.

263
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,673
He would even visit my place,

264
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,217
and we've gone on trips together.

265
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,225
Do you normally wear those shoes?

266
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,643
Excuse me?

267
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,312
No.

268
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,898
I only wear them at work.

269
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,902
- Could you write down your address?
- Yes, sir.

270
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,536
To what do I owe the pleasure, sir?

271
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,040
Listen, I have
a very important job for you.

272
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,208
A very important job, sir?

273
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,419
Your wish is my command.

274
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,591
This weekend, the Supreme Council
and the ladies of the KCIA…

275
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,675
Yes?

276
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,887
…will be visiting the Jongnam
Department Store for some shopping.

277
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,180
Shopping, sir?

278
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,598
Yes, shopping.

279
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:36,352
As they are the wives of important men,
we need capable security guards.

280
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,563
A few ladies of the Sinkwang Society
will also be joining.

281
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,148
I see.

282
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,526
How many men would be required?

283
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,820
I'd say about 20.

284
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,781
- Sir.
- Yes?

285
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,952
I ask that you don't take this

286
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,828
- the wrong way, sir.
- Go on.

287
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,249
You see, 20 bodyguards

288
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,794
make up quite a number of men.

289
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,338
And we have a backlog of cases

290
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,632
- that we need to--
- Wait a minute.

291
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,053
Since when did you talk back?

292
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,473
My apologies, sir.

293
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,599
Some might think

294
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,478
that you actually dedicate yourself
to the safety of Jongnam.

295
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,275
- Forgive me, sir.
- No buts about it.

296
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,152
Protect the ladies.

297
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,071
That's your job.

298
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,155
Yes, sir.

299
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,908
- I'm off.
- Yes, sir.

300
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,868
Right, you don't have to come out.

301
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,036
- No, I should--
- Hey.

302
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,247
- Yes, sir?
- Do a good job.

303
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,582
Yes, sir.

304
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,544
- Take care, sir.
- Take care, sir.

305
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,134
Hey, Chief Hwang.

306
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,760
Yes, sir?

307
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:58,934
Didn't you tell me once about a problem
at Jongnam Department Store?

308
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,644
Right, yes.

309
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,771
I discovered

310
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,441
that some of the imported goods
were smuggled, sir.

311
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,237
Go and find all the smuggled goods
and round up the culprits immediately.

312
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,616
Also, make sure to suspend
their operation for two months.

313
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,868
Sir?

314
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,204
But make sure you do it quietly.

315
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,248
Right. Understood, sir.

316
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,210
May I ask why the sudden ambush
on Jongnam Department Store, sir?

317
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,298
It's Deputy Director Choi's orders.

318
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,632
I see.

319
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,843
- Understood, sir.
- Okay.

320
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,970
All of you, come with me.

321
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,515
Follow me. Let's get ready to roll.

322
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,316
- Hey.
- Yes, sir?

323
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,862
Make sure they keep things quiet.

324
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,906
Yes, sir.

325
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,493
Take care, sir.

326
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,413
If you keep this up,
Deputy Director,

327
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,833
we must go our separate ways.

328
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,463
He returned at about 10 p.m.,

329
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,466
and he seemed utterly exhausted.

330
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,219
Did you see him leave
once the curfew was lifted?

331
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,430
I wouldn't know
since I'm not awake at that time.

332
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,058
I'm usually up by 6 a.m.

333
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,104
How far is Mansoo's house
from here on foot?

334
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,273
From the entrance to Honghwajang
to the entrance to Jongnam Bakery,

335
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,568
it should take about 20 minutes at most.

336
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,195
Round trip, it's 40 minutes.

337
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,322
That's still within 5 a.m.

338
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,869
- I'm here.
- Do you have it, Officer Bong?

339
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,997
Yes, I took great pains
to trace the marks.

340
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,041
- Good job. Let's compare them.
- Okay.

341
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,793
Just a moment.

342
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,378
Pardon me.

343
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,260
Take a look at this.

344
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,561
Look for any other bloodstains.

345
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,645
All right.

346
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,693
Detective Park.

347
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,616
Go arrest her boyfriend.

348
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,326
I need to stop by at Mansoo's first.

349
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,142
Legal profession

350
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,435
The basics of law

351
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,728
Pure law

352
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,402
Wait.

353
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,862
How do I read this again?

354
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,906
I know how to read this.

355
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,158
It's "Boys, be ambitious."

356
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,745
Right. That's the famous quote, right?

357
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,913
Yes.

358
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,915
It's a nice quote to have on your wall.

359
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,005
Hey, are you all right?
Do you need some water?

360
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,340
No, I'm all right.

361
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,549
Okay.

362
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,138
Look, I'm just wondering.

363
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,349
Will you be all right alone?

364
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,685
My aunts will be here later tonight.

365
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,937
I see.

366
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,065
Make sure to do your duty
as the chief mourner.

367
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,401
I'm used to it, being it's my second time.

368
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,197
Right, I see.

369
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,452
What grade are you in this year?

370
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,955
I'm 15, so eighth grade.

371
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,874
You're still so young.

372
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,461
By the way…

373
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,005
…why did you drop by?

374
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,634
Here's the thing.

375
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,011
It's about Dukyong.

376
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,389
Yes?

377
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,100
We'll have to investigate further,

378
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,018
but as of now,

379
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,230
he's a suspect
in the murder of your mother.

380
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,148
There's no way.

381
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,442
He wouldn't hurt a single fly.

382
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,529
I know it's hard to believe,

383
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,825
but he's the prime suspect for now.

384
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:28,578
He's a good man.
I've even gone over to his place a lot.

385
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:29,997
I understand.

386
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,917
And according to him,

387
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,921
he and your mother barely quarreled.
Is that true?

388
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,674
Yes, they were on good terms.

389
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,845
Actually,

390
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,430
that one day,

391
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,225
- they did have a big fight.
- That one day?

392
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,893
Let's just sell a fourth of it.

393
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,438
How many times do I have to say no?

394
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:58,400
The land has to stay intact
until Mansoo becomes an adult.

395
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,943
It's not like I'm asking for it!

396
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,404
I'm just asking you to lend it to me.

397
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,824
All right, but later.
Once Mansoo becomes an adult--

398
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,908
Wait.

399
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,162
Are you using Mansoo as an excuse
to refuse to lend it to me?

400
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,874
What did you just say?
Why do you have to put it like that?

401
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,417
And when was this?

402
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,169
It was last week.

403
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,675
How have we gotten no information all day?

404
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,677
I'm starving.

405
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,721
The perps just vanished into thin air.

406
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,639
We can't even find a trace.

407
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,228
Aren't those the Gosan Pioneer guys?

408
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,314
- I think so.
- Are you serious?

409
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,194
Hey! Where's my apology?

410
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,779
You little…

411
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,573
Okay, I'm very sorry.

412
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,200
I didn't mean to run into you.

413
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,035
It's my bad. Just go on your way.

414
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,537
What if I don't want to?

415
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,791
My shoulder!

416
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,751
My shoulder's injured,

417
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,003
so you better pay for my treatment.

418
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,798
Your bones aren't made of styrofoam,
are they?

419
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,967
It's too much to ask for medical fees
for something like this.

420
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,177
Hey, look.

421
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,805
I need treatment, okay?

422
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,100
Give me 40,000 hwan.

423
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,726
- I need to go to the hospital.
- Yes, we'll take you.

424
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,852
You want 40,000 hwan?

425
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,105
All right, fine.

426
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,525
But first, I'll give you a beating
worth 40,000 hwan!

427
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,320
- Hey!
- Hey!

428
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,614
That little prick.

429
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,908
You're both dead tonight.

430
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,160
- Come at me.
- Bring it on.

431
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,788
Come on.
I'll sober you all right up!

432
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,456
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

433
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,208
All right. Just calm down a minute.

434
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,543
We're cops.

435
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,840
You should've told us sooner!

436
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,924
Sooner when?

437
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,009
I couldn't even get a word in.

438
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,011
Anyway, just go home.

439
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,805
- Thank you!
- Go on.

440
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,390
- Thank you!
- Just go.

441
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,058
- Come on.
- Let's go.

442
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,144
What's with those clubs?

443
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,396
Do they think
they're some old-timey prison guards?

444
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:03,942
Freeze!

445
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,746
So you killed her

446
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,583
in a fit of rage
when she refused to lend you money, no?

447
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,543
T-That's not true.

448
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,462
Didn't you two fight over land?

449
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,380
Mansoo told me what he heard.

450
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,300
It's true that we had a quarrel,

451
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,636
but I apologized the next day,
and we made up.

452
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,889
Then how do you explain
your footprints by the wall

453
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,516
and this blood-stained shirt?

454
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,642
Well…

455
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,563
I truly have no idea
how my footprints got there.

456
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,565
And this shirt…

457
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,360
I really don't know
how the blood got on it either.

458
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,113
Please believe me.
I-I swear it wasn't me.

459
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,493
Put this shirt on.

460
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,286
Sorry?

461
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:57,954
Now.

462
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,373
It was you guys, wasn't it?

463
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,876
You beat drunk men
and robbed them with this club.

464
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,211
That wasn't us.

465
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,254
Why on earth would we do that?

466
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,798
You punks asked for hospital money
just for a slight hit.

467
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,258
You would definitely do this!

468
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,344
I was just too drunk
to think straight earlier.

469
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,513
We're recruiters
for the Gosan Pioneer Corps.

470
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,682
Right, so why would the recruiters
for the Gosan Pioneer Corps

471
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,559
carry something so menacing?

472
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,520
Do you recruit people by beating them up?

473
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,272
We need that to keep order.

474
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,733
And it's not just us who carry these.

475
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,277
The recruiters in Gosan and Kwangyoung
also carry them around.

476
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,321
You little punks.

477
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,615
Why would you need a club to keep order?

478
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,076
You see, in order to keep order--

479
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,661
Excuse me.

480
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:53,426
This shirt is mine, it's true.

481
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:58,390
But I had put on some weight,
and it got too small for me.

482
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,558
I haven't worn it…

483
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,143
since last year.

484
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,443
The boarder in the room
next to Lee Dukyong is here.

485
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,156
Park!

486
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,994
What brings you here, sir?

487
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,872
I wanted to tell you
that he was in his room until morning.

488
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,251
Dukyong! Dukyong!

489
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,588
I really need to move out of this place.

490
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,266
And what time was that?

491
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:45,353
It was two in the morning,
and he snored until seven.

492
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,525
These three men

493
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,612
were with us all of last night.

494
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,991
We drank the night away at Jongnam Hall
to foster unity as a group.

495
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,453
All our members can vouch for them.

496
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,998
What are these for?

497
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,791
At times,

498
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,420
the hot-blooded youth we recruit
tend to cause trouble.

499
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:14,341
We don't hit them,
as they're just enough to scare them.

500
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,260
We'll ask around at Jongnam Hall and--

501
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,262
Stop barking up the wrong tree

502
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,682
and investigate the real culprits.

503
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,434
What do you mean?

504
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,103
Recently, some of our members
have come under attack.

505
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,022
Who attacked them?

506
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,858
If we knew,
we wouldn't ask you to find out.

507
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,234
How many were there then?

508
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,402
How many was it?

509
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,570
Three, sir.

510
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,197
Right.

511
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,908
Those guys took our members' clubs too.

512
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,619
So the assailants have their clubs.

513
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:43,703
That's right.

514
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,833
This night is a bust.

515
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,919
You got nothing, and we got nothing.

516
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,505
Jeez, I feel busted.

517
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,299
So the snatchers could be the same guys
who stole the clubs?

518
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,259
It looks like it so far.

519
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,763
How do we catch those damned rabbits?

520
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,641
About the murder.

521
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,977
If the victim's boyfriend
isn't the killer,

522
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,814
then someone tried to frame him.

523
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,524
They may have tried

524
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,401
but made a foolish mistake.

525
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,779
I don't think they imagined
the shirt would be small on him.

526
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,532
Seeing they had easy access
to his shoes and shirt,

527
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,826
they must have
freely hung around his place.

528
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,995
That's why they say
friends are worse than enemies.

529
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,665
If you want to live a long life,
you've got to be a hermit.

530
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,043
These snatchers have had
a taste of money here

531
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,503
and most likely won't leave soon.

532
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,213
- We'll go on a stakeout.
- Mm.

533
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,809
Naturally, he wasn't too happy
about me at first,

534
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,520
but we were slowly growing closer.

535
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,772
He would even visit my place,

536
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,233
and we've gone on trips together.

537
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,779
There's no way.

538
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,908
He's a good man.
I've even gone over to his place a lot.

539
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,760
We don't know if they'll be here.

540
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,636
Should I go to a different pub?

541
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,430
Just stay.

542
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,557
How do you expect me to catch them alone?

543
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,893
We can't catch them
if they've left Jongnam already.

544
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:33,104
You can't be on a stakeout
with all those doubts in your head.

545
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,398
Just hope that you'll catch them,

546
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,525
waiting for ages and ages.

547
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,987
Eventually, you get them.

548
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,531
"Ages and ages"?

549
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,159
All right.

550
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,745
In period of mourning

551
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,375
Don't wake her up. Just let her sleep.

552
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,420
- Is she your aunt?
- Yes.

553
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,423
I was worried you might be alone.

554
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,592
I'd like to pay my respects
while I'm here.

555
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,679
Thank you.

556
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,912
No.

557
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,081
There's no way.

558
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,251
There's nothing wrong with him smiling.

559
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,796
Detective Park.

560
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,633
I contacted Pajung Police Station,
which was in charge of the case then.

561
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,137
Kim Mansoo's father was Kim Geunseok.

562
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,474
He drowned last March
in Jungnam Reservoir while fishing.

563
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,270
Kim Mansoo, his son,
was with him at that time.

564
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,064
- What about Mansoo's mother?
- She wasn't with them.

565
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,568
And I also learned something strange.

566
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,322
Kim Geunseok used to be
a professional swimmer in Gangwon-do.

567
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,575
So a former swimmer
somehow drowned to death?

568
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,868
Yes.

569
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,050
Goodness.

570
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,012
Detective Jo.

571
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,805
Detective Jo.

572
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,391
Detective Jo!

573
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,559
Jeez.

574
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,062
Detective Jo!

575
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,356
What's going on?

576
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,733
Did the snatchers appear?

577
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,194
The third victim of the snatchers

578
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,862
has regained consciousness.

579
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,238
All right, let's go.

580
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,531
- Come on.
- Where is he?

581
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,575
- Come with me.
- Okay.

582
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,577
Let's go. Go.

583
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,456
Sir.

584
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,041
Greetings.

585
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,377
You little prick!

586
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,099
What could be the matter, sir?

587
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,225
Don't you know?

588
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,560
The Jongnam Department Store!

589
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,273
I don't seem to understand, sir.

590
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,234
You shut the place down

591
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,778
to get out of guard duty, didn't you?

592
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,490
Deputy Director Choi,

593
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,660
- there seems to be a--
- I should have known.

594
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,955
It's never wise to take up
baseless morons like you.

595
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,083
Hey, you.

596
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,378
You should be extremely worried
about the days to come.

597
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,465
Just wait and see
where your damned pride takes you.

598
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,188
Isn't the procession tomorrow?

599
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,357
Don't get up, Mansoo.

600
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,778
My aunts…

601
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,115
wanted to keep the funeral short.

602
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,743
Goodness, I didn't even
get to pay my respects.

603
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,952
You did good, Mansoo.

604
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:04,834
I heard you were with your father
when he passed away too.

605
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,253
Why would you bring that up?

606
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,213
I was.

607
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,507
We heard he used to be a swimmer.

608
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,426
How unfortunate for him.

609
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,636
I'm sorry for bringing it up abruptly.

610
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,013
That day…

611
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,186
he had one too many drinks of liquor.

612
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,148
I was asleep on the fishing platform.

613
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,027
If only I hadn't fallen asleep…

614
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,530
he wouldn't have died.

615
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,413
Are you okay? Should I get you water?

616
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,082
It's all right.

617
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,666
I can get it.

618
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,134
Hojeong.

619
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,970
Head over to Seo Jongtaek Clinic
where Mansoo used to go

620
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,472
and check his medical record.

621
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,058
I'll stop by his school.

622
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,310
All right. Got it.

623
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,232
DONGSAN TEXTILE CO., LTD.
JONGNAM MILL

624
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,111
Better productivity, reduce defects,
and improve work environment

625
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:23,079
I wonder where Yangja is.

626
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,874
Nansil!

627
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,295
It's been so long!

628
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,756
I missed you.

629
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,508
Ta-da.

630
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,512
- What is it?
- Your favorite red bean bread.

631
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,681
Really?

632
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:42,890
I can't wait to eat it.

633
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,394
- Thank you, middle school best friend.
- No problem.

634
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,272
This looks so good.

635
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,524
Mmm!

636
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,401
- It tastes amazing.
- Eat up.

637
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,531
By the way…

638
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:03,411
have you heard anything about our mill

639
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,205
at the police station?

640
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,040
Like what?

641
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,960
The mill called in a report

642
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,673
that a worker has been disappearing
every month.

643
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,550
That's news to me.

644
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,302
How do they disappear?

645
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:24,182
At the start of each month,
someone vanishes into thin air

646
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,600
without any signs of quitting.

647
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,478
Come on, I'm sure they just quit.

648
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,440
Well, that's a possibility,

649
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,692
but they disappear suddenly,

650
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,360
leaving behind all their stuff at home.

651
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,946
Normally,

652
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,158
they'd pack their stuff
or mention that they're quitting.

653
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,035
Who reported it?

654
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,162
Me.

655
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,081
But I was scared,
so I didn't leave my name.

656
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,501
Okay.

657
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,630
I'll try to look into what's going on.

658
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,632
Thanks.

659
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,722
He was a model student,
one of the top five at school.

660
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,807
He dreamed of becoming
a legal official too.

661
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,517
How was his behavior?

662
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,979
He was quiet and reserved,

663
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,190
but a warmhearted boy nonetheless.

664
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,902
Once, I saw him
holding a cat in the schoolyard

665
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,528
which turned out to be dead.

666
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,114
Why was he holding it?

667
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,243
Apparently, he found it
frozen to death on the way to school

668
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,203
and was hugging it out of sadness.

669
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,209
And this might be slightly trivial,

670
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,461
but there's something he doesn't know.

671
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,797
There is?

672
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,257
Yes.

673
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,259
Dongsan Textile Co.
Missing Female Workers Report

674
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,722
Missing workers were confirmed
to have returned home.

675
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,474
Thus, the investigation into the case
has been closed.

676
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,226
"Unit 2."

677
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,523
As soon as possible.

678
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,237
We questioned everyone
but found no one with a grudge.

679
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,613
It's ridiculous.

680
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,243
Perhaps we should start over
from the beginning.

681
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,997
Listen.

682
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,957
What if…

683
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,460
What if the culprit is someone…

684
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,046
we least suspect?

685
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,008
Mansoo, the son?

686
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,801
There's no way.

687
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,927
That can't be.

688
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,179
It's a bit harsh
to name her son a suspect.

689
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,099
I hate to even entertain the thought.

690
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,855
But who had the chance to weave
the murder and the fake suspect

691
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,524
while manipulating
an alibi for themselves?

692
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,193
The same goes for sleeping pills.

693
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,904
They were prescribed in January

694
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,614
and his father died in March.

695
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,868
A weak teenager would need such pills

696
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,078
to mask his father's murder…

697
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,249
as an unfortunate accident.

698
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,459
Sleeping pill prescription

699
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:01,922
All right.

700
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,509
I get how he could
easily access the shoes.

701
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,011
But what about the blood?

702
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,598
If he stained the shirt
with his mother's blood,

703
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,893
he had to take it back
to the boyfriend's house.

704
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,811
Did he have the time to do that?

705
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,856
What's more,
at the estimated time of death,

706
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,484
the boyfriend was asleep in his room.

707
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,861
Perhaps he stained it
with some random blood?

708
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,950
No. Mansoo is smarter than we think.

709
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:35,206
He knows that simple blood analysis
is somewhat possible now.

710
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,875
He could have obtained
his mother's blood beforehand

711
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,419
and left the shirt prior to the crime.

712
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,256
But how would he have obtained
his mother's blood?

713
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,347
She has a cut on her left forefinger,

714
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,599
which was probably
from four or five days ago.

715
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:02,983
Hojeong.

716
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:04,985
Let's go.

717
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,529
- We'll be back, sir.
- What?

718
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,824
I'll be back, sir.

719
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,171
Is the paper that funny?

720
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,935
Dukyong told us that you caused the cut

721
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,146
on your mother's finger.

722
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:47,319
Goodness, the apples we had last time
were too soft and tasteless,

723
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,321
but they were still so expensive.

724
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,199
Fruits these days
are worth their weight in gold.

725
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,909
- Mom, let me try.
- What?

726
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,120
No, let go. You'll get hurt!

727
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,538
Oh, my!

728
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:03,043
He said she got cut
when you insisted on peeling the apple.

729
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,045
Well, yes.

730
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,840
I acted like a child.

731
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,259
When you wiped her blood on a shirt…

732
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,304
were you also acting like a child?

733
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,513
I'm not sure…

734
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,391
I understand what you mean.

735
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,185
You know best…

736
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,730
what we mean.

737
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,989
This is Senior Superintendent Baek.

738
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,491
Yes?

739
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,119
I've been well, but who are you?

740
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,955
What?

741
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,208
Yes, sir.

742
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,667
I see.

743
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,628
My apologies, sir.

744
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,838
Yes, please speak freely.

745
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,509
Pardon? Me, sir?

746
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,806
- Where?
- It's here.

747
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,891
Here?

748
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,393
Go ahead.

749
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,817
I rushed over as quickly as I could.

750
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,361
Forgive me for being late.

751
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,779
Have a seat.

752
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,155
You all can step out for a moment.

753
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:29,964
Sangsun.

754
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,802
I'm getting tired of waiting
for ages and ages

755
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,887
on this stakeout.

756
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,392
How many days have we done this,
Detective Jo?

757
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,811
This is our second night.

758
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:49,858
So those rabbits only target people
with heavy pockets.

759
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:54,488
- That's right.
- I guess we're left with no choice.

760
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,657
Detective Jo,

761
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,869
we'll have to approach this case
from a new direction.

762
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,746
A new direction?

763
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,045
Sangsun.

764
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,922
Where was I?

765
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,757
A new direction.

766
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,175
Right.

767
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,178
Let's go.

768
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,847
Let me ask one more time.

769
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,099
Why did you kill your parents?

770
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,892
I swear…

771
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,979
I didn't do it.

772
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,856
Detectives.

773
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,191
Why are you doing this to me?

774
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,568
Even without your confession,

775
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,487
we have enough circumstantial evidence
and physical proof.

776
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,616
This is simply a chance
for you to explain yourself.

777
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,908
We don't need a confession.

778
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,703
I-It wasn't me.

779
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,913
I swear it wasn't me.

780
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,082
I bet on my life that it wasn't.

781
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,505
Refute our reasoning.

782
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,760
Case Notes

783
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,433
Take it.

784
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,271
When you knew my father was a swimmer…

785
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,776
I knew I'd been found out.

786
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,869
I've been here for three hours…

787
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,290
and I still can't come up with an excuse.

788
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,129
You won, Detectives.

789
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,801
You little prick.

790
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,636
Why did I kill them?

791
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,471
Well,

792
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,973
I hated my father for saying

793
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,267
that he wouldn't pass on his land
to an ill son like me.

794
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,020
And I hated my mother

795
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,606
for dating another man
less than a year after he died.

796
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,651
Did you also hate the cat
for crying every day?

797
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,319
Wait.

798
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,409
How did you know I killed the cat?

799
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,497
Jeez.

800
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,375
You really got me dead to rights.

801
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,131
What's wrong with you?

802
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,258
You call yourself a human?

803
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:27,015
I've actually given that question
some deep thought.

804
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,648
I am a human.

805
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,235
It's just that…

806
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,821
I'm a little different from the others.

807
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,783
Being different
doesn't justify your crimes.

808
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,368
Come on.

809
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:50,539
I wasn't born this way
because I wanted to, you know?

810
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,499
It's not my fault.

811
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:56,420
Look, would you ask a left-handed kid

812
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,173
why they eat with their left hand?

813
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,301
Or would you ask a curly-haired kid

814
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:05,137
why their hair is so frizzy?

815
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,723
Of course you wouldn't.

816
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,642
Why can't you just accept
that I'm different?

817
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,188
I try to consider
the circumstances whenever I can,

818
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,981
but you're too far gone.

819
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,859
Go to the juvenile detention center

820
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:22,154
and let the older boys there
teach you a painful lesson.

821
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,698
We're done here.

822
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,451
Let's go.

823
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,245
Ah!

824
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,916
Why would I go to a detention center?

825
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,960
In the worst-case scenario,

826
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:42,716
I'd be taken into youth custody
and reformed or whatever.

827
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,220
What on earth do you mean?

828
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,806
I'm saying

829
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:50,891
that I'd be a juvenile offender.

830
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:55,020
I haven't turned 14 yet, you know?

831
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,232
I'll turn 14…

832
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,400
in six months.

833
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,695
This means that through the end

834
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,532
of my trial and sentencing…

835
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,827
I'll still be a juvenile.

836
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,665
Is that how you were bold enough
to kill your parents?

837
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,959
I wouldn't say I was bold.

838
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,963
I just did my research.

839
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,298
Come on.

840
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,635
You're looking at
a prospective legal official here.

841
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,471
Oh, right.

842
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,224
Once they consider…

843
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,353
…my lung disease…

844
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,899
…and if I pretend I'm crazy,

845
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,070
I'll barely get a slap on the wrist,
won't I?

846
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,827
You can run away from the law,

847
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,204
but not from the heavens' wrath.

848
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:56,999
Remember that.

849
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,211
Sure, sure.

850
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,881
I might as well test

851
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:08,051
whether justice really prevails.

852
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,678
Instead of testing that,

853
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,807
why don't you see whether you're putting
your own head into the noose?

854
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,352
Thank you for the great time!

855
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,854
Wait a minute.

856
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,274
I almost forgot to pay my bill. Jeez.

857
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,152
And I'm someone who's drowning in money.

858
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,070
Thank you so much!

859
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,114
- Goodbye now.
- Take care.

860
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,866
- I'll be back again.
- Thank you, sir.

861
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,702
My goodness.

862
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,455
- Take this.
- Thank you!

863
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,748
I wish you luck.

864
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,084
Sorry about that.

865
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,754
I'm drunk out of my mind.

866
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:48,467
Where am I even?
I feel sick to my stomach.

867
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,416
Jeez.

868
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,127
That hurt like crap.

869
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:29,424
I would've died
if it wasn't for this thing.

870
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,385
You little punks.

871
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,974
You all look younger than I expected.

872
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,101
Put the clubs down and come with us.

873
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,897
Stay down, stay down.

874
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,657
Hey, hey!

875
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,576
You little punk!

876
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,122
Nice, I got him.

877
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,666
Kneel and put your hands up.

878
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:11,216
You can't keep a juvenile in lockup
for this long without a guardian.

879
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,802
Sure. We'll keep things legal.

880
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,179
Let him go.

881
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:17,848
Hurray.

882
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,947
We'll start with you.
How old are you?

883
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,241
I'm 17.

884
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,202
I'm 17.

885
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,621
I'm 16.

886
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,584
How could you harass people for money?

887
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:49,546
It was you three who attacked
the Gosan Pioneer Corps members, no?

888
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,716
Is that when you stole these clubs?

889
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,635
Spill it!

890
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:59,014
Bashing people's heads with these things

891
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,308
isn't something a human should do.

892
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,351
Well, we're not human.

893
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,978
W-What did you say?

894
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,730
We don't get treated like humans,

895
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,440
so we're not humans.

896
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,609
Just send us to jail.

897
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,027
At least we can eat there.

898
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,612
You shameless punks.

899
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,406
Fine. Let's say you aren't humans.

900
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,284
Who is it that treated you like subhumans?

901
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,787
No one cares about us.

902
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,705
We're all orphans.

903
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:28,085
Not all orphans go around
committing crimes, okay?

904
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,212
We're not asking you
to cut us slack for being orphans.

905
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,591
What's that?

906
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,259
What?

907
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,889
- Take a look at his wrist.
- Okay.

908
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,099
Give me your arm.

909
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,737
Are you walking me home?

910
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,490
You really don't have to.

911
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,492
It gets boring walking alone.

912
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,370
We'll take you home. Let's go together.

913
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:09,459
So those are your number tags
in the Gosan Pioneer Corps?

914
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,254
Why would they brand you like cattle?

915
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,756
Stop acting like you don't know.

916
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,926
You cops and soldiers are all in on this
with the Pioneer Corps!

917
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,762
We don't work with them, all right?

918
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,014
Just tell us what happened.

919
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,642
We ran away from Gosan…

920
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,604
because they treated us worse than cattle.

921
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,691
Don't they give out land
and help you settle down?

922
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,651
Those are all lies.

923
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,486
First, the recruiters beat us.

924
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,988
Then, the soldiers beat us.

925
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,074
All for no reason.

926
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,618
We even saw nine-year-old kids…

927
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,913
beaten mercilessly too.

928
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:50,834
Go on.

929
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,879
We had to shovel all day in our underwear

930
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,798
and only got
three balls of old rice to eat daily.

931
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,967
If anyone got sick,

932
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,469
they waited for them to die
and just buried them.

933
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,891
I should've just gone
to an orphanage instead.

934
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,227
So…

935
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,023
this was all revenge against Jang Sechul,
the leader of the Corps?

936
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,609
Yes.

937
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,111
We all suffered…

938
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,822
because of his lies.

939
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,163
Detective.

940
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,375
When the government cheats us…

941
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,046
who do we turn to for compensation?

942
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:57,317
Mansoo. Stand right there, will you?

943
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,534
Ta-da.

944
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,453
Whoa. Whoa.

945
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,539
What are you doing?

946
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:16,378
I'm thinking of directing a play
just like you did.

947
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:21,508
"A cop walks home
a juvenile offender who committed murder.

948
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,595
It just so happened
that the juvenile had a knife hidden

949
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,430
and attacked the detective."

950
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,977
I have the prop right here.

951
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,563
"Feeling threatened,

952
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,358
the detective aimed
at the juvenile's head…

953
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,153
and shot him."

954
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,073
Can a detective do this?

955
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,075
You can't do that!

956
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,410
I can…

957
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,578
to a scum like you.

958
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,984
Though your mother
had just died an unnatural death,

959
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,405
you were giggling your socks off
reading the funny papers.

960
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,660
You weren't being childish.
You were just out of your mind.

961
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,954
Little pricks like you

962
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:36,249
should be eliminated early on
for everyone's sake.

963
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,417
Spare me.

964
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,003
Please don't do it.

965
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,297
I heard you dream of becoming
a legal official.

966
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,049
Personally,

967
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:48,094
I don't want my descendants
to live in a world

968
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,305
where scum like you
get to be the wielders of the law.

969
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,432
So you need to die.

970
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,683
If you spare me,

971
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:57,020
I'll give you half of my father's land
when I inherit it.

972
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:59,272
Look at you
trying to strike a deal with adults.

973
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,357
Half?

974
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,860
No, I'll give you all of it!

975
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,821
I don't want your land.

976
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,615
I just want

977
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:12,118
to put a bullet through your head.

978
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,916
Please forgive me!

979
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,959
I know I deserve to die for my sins.

980
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,669
But please forgive me.

981
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:25,507
Are you sincerely repenting for your sins?

982
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,343
Yes, I'm genuinely sorry.

983
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:30,136
Please don't kill me.

984
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,478
It's too late now.

985
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,360
Hmm?

986
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,362
- What?
- Come on, Yeonghan.

987
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,656
Darn, I forgot to load my gun.

988
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,246
Damn it! I knew you were lying.

989
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,082
Detectives can't just shoot people.
I'm going home.

990
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,379
What more do you want?

991
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,549
I told you I'm a juvenile.

992
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,676
Let me go now!

993
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,137
You're not a juvenile.

994
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,348
But there's something he doesn't know.

995
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,392
- There is?
- Yes.

996
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:20,437
It's a secret only his mother and I knew.

997
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,441
Due to his illness,
Mansoo started elementary school late.

998
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,861
His mother worried that he'd get bullied
by the kids at school,

999
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,614
so she told him he was younger by a year.

1000
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,659
He's a year older in the family registry.

1001
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,754
As such,
you're currently over the age of 14.

1002
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,841
And you destroyed

1003
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,552
any hope I had
that you would sincerely repent

1004
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,971
when faced with death.

1005
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:57,765
Now,

1006
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:01,352
you can proudly go
to the juvenile detention center.

1007
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,688
"Boys, be ambitious"?

1008
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:08,026
More like, "Boys…"

1009
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:12,113
How do you put it in English?

1010
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,240
"Boys,

1011
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,160
feel guilty."

1012
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,414
"Boys, feel guilty."

1013
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,668
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1014
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,806
Was it Mansoo?

1015
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,850
What will happen to him?

1016
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,937
He's not a juvenile offender,

1017
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,563
so he'll go to a correctional institute.

1018
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,857
He would've been executed
if he was an adult.

1019
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:48,942
He killed his parents.

1020
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,985
His sentence won't be that heavy.

1021
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,613
They'll consider his age
and give him about 15 years in prison.

1022
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,782
I know the Juvenile Act was passed

1023
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,618
to give young criminals a second chance,

1024
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,119
but Mansoo is an exception.

1025
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:03,039
He matured too terribly.

1026
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,375
When bad kids get smarter,

1027
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,377
they'll manipulate the law

1028
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,587
with absolutely no shame.

1029
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:14,050
I'd say the Juvenile Act
was meant for kids like the snatchers.

1030
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:17,178
That's right. It was the abusive adults
that made them turn to crime.

1031
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,596
That should be considered.

1032
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:21,516
Let's all turn in a petition
for those kids.

1033
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,644
- All right.
- We give it to the judge, right?

1034
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,647
Yes, our petition should be enough
to lighten the sentence.

1035
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,732
Should they still be punished at all?

1036
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:33,152
Of course. Do the crime, do the time.

1037
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,364
I couldn't answer
that one kid when he asked,

1038
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,367
"Who do we turn to
when the government cheats us?"

1039
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:42,370
The government should compensate them,

1040
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:46,082
but they're all too busy
looking out for themselves

1041
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:47,750
to give a damn.

1042
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,586
If the government won't compensate…

1043
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:57,218
then I guess we need to take matters
into our own hands.

1044
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,304
Gosan Pioneer Corps

1045
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,598
Knees up, higher!

1046
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,100
You punk.

1047
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,021
You punk.

1048
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,148
Get up. Get up!

1049
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,862
Stop beating them up,
you pricks.

1050
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,034
Hey!

1051
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,538
We're police.

1052
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,628
We received a report that you're luring,
assaulting, and abusing

1053
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,296
teenagers and vagrants.

1054
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,548
We're the Gosan Pioneer Corps.

1055
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,134
This is a national project
pursued by the chairman!

1056
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,803
What national project
involves beating kids, you scum?

1057
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,389
All you do in Gosan is beat them

1058
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,391
and abuse the girls and the kids!

1059
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,226
Those are all wild rumors.

1060
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,688
The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs
and the chairman can vouch for us.

1061
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,941
So you're saying
they're all accomplices in your crimes?

1062
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,151
What?

1063
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,655
How dare some cop like you
insult the chairman?

1064
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,699
If he's done something worth insulting,

1065
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,993
then even the chairman
deserves a healthy mouthful.

1066
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,411
Why discriminate?

1067
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,746
You know what?

1068
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:11,084
Detectives or not,
you all deserve a beating.

1069
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,210
Get them!

1070
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,419
- Beat them!
- Hey!

1071
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,548
Freeze, or I'll put a hole
through your heads.

1072
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:23,388
Why do I keep having to pull my gun out,
Detective Seo?

1073
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:27,225
It seems too many people
are lacking guilt and shame.

1074
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:30,269
I'll give you one more chance
since this is a national project.

1075
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,437
But listen carefully.

1076
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,149
If we ever find out
that you're doing this again,

1077
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,903
you're all going to jail,
and this national project be damned.

1078
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,948
- Got it?
- Yes.

1079
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,701
Don't let the position get to your head,
you fraud.

1080
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,579
Get up, boys.

1081
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,999
- Don't be afraid.
- Let's go, boys.

1082
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,376
It's all right.

1083
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,211
Take it easy.

1084
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,262
That little…

1085
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,609
Sorry for startling you, boys.

1086
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:20,945
You guys will be fine now. Get going.

1087
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:23,740
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1088
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:24,907
Thank you.

1089
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,537
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1090
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:40,506
Jongnam Police Station

1091
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:47,054
How dare that cocky prick Doseok
tell me to come to him?

1092
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,432
- Mr. Choi Dalsik?
- What?

1093
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,434
What are you doing?

1094
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:52,935
We're from
the Special Prosecutor's Office.

1095
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,146
The Special Prosecutor's…

1096
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:56,272
What for?

1097
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:58,691
You are under arrest for violating…

1098
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,027
…the Illegal Wealth Act
and the Special Crimes Act.

1099
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,946
That's ridiculous! Take these off me now.

1100
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,907
Do you know who I am?

1101
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,201
I'm the Deputy Director
of the National Police!

1102
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,869
Let me go!

1103
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,496
Baek Doseok!

1104
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,916
- Honey.
- Yes?

1105
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,794
I learned something
while dealing with the last case.

1106
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,295
What is it?

1107
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:22,173
It might not come as a surprise…

1108
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:27,261
but there are people who are born evil

1109
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:32,141
as there are people who are born good.

1110
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,435
Those good people

1111
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:38,981
are the ones who help make
this hellish world a bit more like heaven.

1112
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,107
Mm.

1113
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:46,197
Our baby would grow up
to be a good person, don't you think?

1114
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,032
Of course. I'm sure…

1115
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:54,455
Honey.

1116
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,250
What did you just say?

1117
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,585
I'm pregnant.

1118
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,173
What? I…

1119
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:05,883
R-Really?

1120
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,052
My goodness. Wait.

1121
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:09,595
When did you find out?

1122
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,224
I went to the hospital this morning.

1123
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:17,019
Why didn't you tell me?

1124
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:20,606
You were busy beating up
the Gosan Pioneer Corps.

1125
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,775
You're right.

1126
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:27,613
I knew the heavens would bless us
right about this time.

1127
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,073
Honey.

1128
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:30,908
Is our baby really…

1129
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:34,161
Yes, our baby is right here.

1130
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:37,206
I can't believe this, honey.

1131
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,250
Thank you so much.

1132
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,836
I can't express how happy I am.

1133
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:45,798
- Are you sure you're happy?
- Of course.

1134
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:49,260
I'm the happiest man
in the world right now.

1135
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,138
I'm as happy as when I first met you.

1136
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,222
Hmm.

1137
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,932
I'll take good care of our baby.

1138
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,976
I hope our child grows up to be like you.

1139
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,477
We'll do it together.

1140
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,148
We'll help our child
make it through this dangerous world.

1141
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,650
- Of course.
- Honey.

1142
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:07,111
I love you so much.

1143
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:10,197
I love you too.

1144
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,992
Do you think it'll be a boy or a girl?

1145
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,076
Hmm…

1146
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,244
Maybe twins?

1147
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,830
- Twins?
- What should we name them?

1148
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,999
The Juvenile Act of Korea
was legislated on June 22, 1953

1149
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,250
and enforced beginning on January 1, 1954.

1150
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,252
Initially, juvenile offenders
were classified as those aged 12 to 14

1151
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,004
but was revised to ages 10 to 14 in 2008,
as it remains now.

1152
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,547
Juvenile offenders do not receive
criminal punishment

1153
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,049
and are instead placed
under protective disposition.

1154
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,523
How strange.

1155
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,819
Those things
have been circling like that for days.

1156
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:16,806
Dongsan Textile Co., Ltd.
Jongnam Mill

1157
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:04,854
Chief Detective 1958

1158
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:07,982
A girl named Kim Soonjung
has gone missing.

1159
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:10,484


1160
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:12,278
How did you get this picture?

1161
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,238


1162
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,282


1163
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,034
- Let's get them right now.
Are you sure?

1164
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:19,493
You're a killer.

1165
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,662


1166
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:22,788
Could you get rid of him?

1167
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,916
In what world
does a cop help out a suspect?

1168
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,127
- How do you never change?

1169
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,336
Are you all right?

1170
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,504
Bring me a stretcher!

1171
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:33,674
We're going to arrest
those punks today, no matter what.

1172
