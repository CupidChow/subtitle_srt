1
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,949
Chief Detective 1958

2
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
This series is unrelated to any places,
persons, settings or events.

3
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,953
Scenes involving animals were filmed in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.

4
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,125
Jung Hochul, the suspect in
the serial murders of his family members,

5
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,586
has broken through
the police siege and escaped.

6
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,254
This is already his second time doing so.

7
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,756
Kim Hyunki has the report.

8
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,634
Jung Hochul finally surfaced
after four months in hiding.

9
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,180
The police received a tip that he was
at an internet cafe in Naksun-dong,

10
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,767
but failed once again to arrest him
when he fled before they arrived.

11
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,644
Last August,
a man who killed his wife and daughter

12
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,480
at his home in Jongnam-gu--

13
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,358
Jongnam Supermarket

14
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,238
Welcome.

15
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,283
- Grandpa.
- My goodness! Look who it is!

16
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,327
What brings you here?

17
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,204
I brought you your favorite rice cake.

18
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,248
You really didn't have to.

19
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,917
Well, it's your favorite.

20
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,586
Baeknyeonhwapyeon rice cakes

21
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,922
I guess you had a slow day today.

22
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,467
Honorary retirement
of Senior Superintendent Park Yeonghan

23
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,136
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,474
Did you see the news?

25
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,310
Grandpa.

26
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,729
I don't know what to do.

27
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,982
We almost had him.

28
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,610
We were so close, but we lost him again.

29
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,154
You'll get another chance.

30
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,658
Who knows when he'll show up again?

31
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,867
He will.

32
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,120
He's human too, you know?

33
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,746
He'll want to come out.

34
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,666
That scum isn't human.

35
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,044
The prick killed his wife, child,
and even his parents.

36
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,047
Ah…

37
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,591
I'll watch my language.

38
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,640
Let's say we manage to lock him up.

39
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,017
Would that make him human?

40
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,314
Both the world and the people

41
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,526
have all changed so much.

42
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,279
You see,

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,907
it drives me crazy
just thinking about him all day.

44
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,744
I think of him when I eat.

45
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,539
I think of him when I'm on the toilet.

46
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,750
I even chase him so hard in my dreams

47
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,170
that it makes me want to throw up.

48
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,674
Grandpa,

49
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,594
have you ever felt this way?

50
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,387
Me?

51
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,016
You could fill four trucks
with people who were like that to me.

52
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,644
Come on.

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,982
You're making things up
because it's all in the past, aren't you?

54
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,110
I wasn't a chief for nothing.

55
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,657
Then tell me,

56
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,661
how did you catch all those guys?

57
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,289
Like my life depended on it.

58
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,127
Junseo.

59
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,508
The only person
who can beat someone tenacious…

60
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,138
is someone even more tenacious.

61
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,853
Don't forget that.

62
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,022
Yes, Grandpa.

63
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,483
Thank you.

64
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,111
I feel like
I'm just making your life harder.

65
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,738
Don't say that.

66
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,699
I joined the police because of you.

67
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,619
My goodness.

68
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,916
The first trial
of the 26 political gangsters

69
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,836
who infringed on the citizens' rights
through violence,

70
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,048
including Kwak Youngju, Shin Dohwan,
Lee Jungjae, Im Hwasoo and Yoo Jikwang,

71
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,634
was held on July 6
at the Seoul District Court.

72
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,718
I quote,

73
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,347
"Who told you to lock up these gangsters?"

74
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,601
December, 1961

75
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,399
Episode 6

76
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,906


77
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,033

78
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,328

82
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,217
You could be a singer, Yeonghan.

83
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,147
Goodness.

84
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,900
The weather is amazing today.

85
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,694
Hello.

86
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,195
Hey, stop right there.

87
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,697
Come on.

88
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,449
I'm not your ex-wife.

89
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,826
Don't be so sour to see me.

90
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,453
We brought the goods.

91
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,872
Who on earth are you, you punk?

92
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,791
You could be more polite, you know?

93
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,919
We live in a different world now!

94
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,422
Let's treat each other
with a little respect, all right?

95
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,176
Kim sent me here, okay?
Go check the goods.

96
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,489
Look at him nod his head.

97
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,865
That's more like it.

98
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,035
Cornmeal

99
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,835
Open the gate.

100
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,173
Good work, everybody…

101
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,929
How is there so much?

102
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,515
This is enough to feed the whole country.

103
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,600
Who's this punk?

104
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,561
Punk? Again?

105
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,816
Is it policy here
to insult someone you've just met?

106
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,360
I'm here in place of Kim with the sawdust!

107
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,528
Where's Kim?

108
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,197
Don't get me started.
He got into a fight at the gambling den

109
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,907
and had his head smashed in.

110
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,368
It looked like he had kimchi juice
running down his head.

111
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,163
He was washing his face with it
and swinging on everybody there.

112
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,498
Kim doesn't gamble.

113
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,294
His entire family went bankrupt
due to his father's gambling,

114
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,964
so he absolutely hates it.

115
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,885
The same blood runs in him.

116
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,179
Blood is thicker than water, you know?

117
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,181
Plus, gambling isn't something
you can quit.

118
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,686
Anyway, what's the ratio here?
Is it six to four?

119
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,480
Don't try to steal our golden ratio.

120
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,358
Stop blabbering nonsense

121
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,402
and just bring in the sawdust, all right?

122
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,990
No problem. I'll get right on it.

123
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,618
Boys! Deliver the goods!

124
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,203
What a weird punk.

125
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,849
I'm here with your sawdust,
you dusty punks!

126
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,767
What do you think you're doing?

127
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,353
You wanted the sawdust in here fast.

128
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,355
How much faster can I get?

129
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,027
Wait, that's…

130
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,987
I couldn't breathe in here.

131
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,489
You can breathe now, Gyeonghwan!

132
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,952
Why do we have to be like this?
We're always the same!

133
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,663
And we'll do this until we retire.

134
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,916
What? Are you guys cops?

135
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,293
Hey, you, shut up and come with us.

136
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,505
All right, fine.

137
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,509
I'll tell you what the golden ratio is.

138
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,512
Stop bothering us! Get lost!

139
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,607
Look at you.

140
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,360
Gyeonghwan.

141
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,569
All right.

142
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,880
- What?
- Going somewhere?

143
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,093
I caught a big one!

144
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,146
I just got this outfit, man.

145
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,818
Where do you think you're going?

146
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,611
Don't move!

147
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,989
Now, where are you going?

148
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,615
Look at you.

149
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,410
Come on, get up.

150
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:47,962
Hey!

151
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,756
Leave me alone!

152
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,551
Damn it.

153
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,892
Here's a gift.

154
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,815
You punks. How dare you mess with food?

155
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,276
You guys are baseless scum.

156
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,531
Do you feed your own family
cornmeal mixed with sawdust?

157
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,866
Why would I do that?

158
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,619
What a great dad you are!

159
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,038
You sick, rotten pricks.

160
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,374
How could you sell
cornmeal mixed with sawdust

161
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,834
to people who barely make a living?

162
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,420
These people live hand to mouth!

163
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,840
And you call yourselves humans?

164
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,010
It's not worth my energy
even pointing at you all.

165
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,305
You all better starve to death in prison,
you pricks!

166
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,640
Go starve, you pricks!

167
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,935
If you can't be a good person,

168
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,772
at least don't be an animal.

169
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,862
Great work today, Big Bug.

170
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,448
- You did good.
- Don't mention it, Detective.

171
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,033
We're your eyes on the streets.

172
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,785
Call us anytime.

173
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,953
You should go and feed the boys.

174
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,246
They need meat on their bones.

175
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,915
Yes, Detective. Thank you.

176
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,376
- Good job.
- Hey! Thank him right now!

177
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,003
- Thank you!
- I heard you.

178
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,255
- Thank you so much!
- Okay, that's enough!

179
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,257
Keep talking, and you'll get hungrier.
Get going.

180
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,678
Another anonymous letter
came in yesterday.

181
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,222
Why hasn't the problem
been dealt with yet?

182
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,557
Whoever is sending these

183
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,851
is besmirching
the Sinkwang Society's reputation.

184
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,812
My apologies.

185
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,272
I feared rash action could cause problems.

186
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,067
I've been trying to come up
with a solution.

187
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,778
Whatever you do, handle the problem now.

188
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,446
If you fail to do so,

189
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,783
I may reconsider your promotion
to deputy director.

190
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,993
You may also find yourself

191
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,954
expelled from the Sinkwang Society.

192
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,793
Please forgive my complacency.

193
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,379
I will do everything I can
to fix this problem

194
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,090
as swiftly and conclusively as possible.
I apologize for the delay.

195
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,093
The first policy
of the revolution is to make

196
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:03,097
- anti-communism the national…
- Goodness, I'm tired of hearing that.

197
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,890
Look how much the world has changed,

198
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,893
but it's like we're stuck.
Nothing has changed.

199
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,104
What are you talking about?
We've all changed.

200
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:13,691
Detective Jo's chest is bigger than ever.

201
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,401
And look at Hojeong.

202
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,487
He's a dandy gentleman.
He's a real man now.

203
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,408
And you, Detective Kim…

204
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,871
Your nose has grown bigger.

205
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,498
I bet you can smell better now!

206
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,209
A bigger nose?
Man, I'm a fool for asking you.

207
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,837
Detective Park.

208
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,965
Slow down, Jongnam.

209
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,050
- Are you done patrolling, Officer Nam?
- Good job, Jongnam.

210
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,053
Are you Napoleon or something?

211
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,930
I'm on my way back to end my shift.

212
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,056
Let's head over together.

213
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,059
I'll escort you all there then.
Please follow me.

214
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,853
- Sure, all right.
- Let's go, Jongnam.

215
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,481
Wait, Jongnam!

216
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,066
- What's going on?
- Why are you…

217
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,028
- My goodness.
- The station is that way.

218
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,279
I know, sir.

219
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,239
Please go ahead. I'll follow!

220
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,657
- Take your time.
- Jongnam!

221
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,326
That horse is just horsing around.

222
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,244
Let's go.

223
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,581
- Come on.
Come with us!

224
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,458
Episode 6
The Beginning of Winter

225
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,794
What did I do wrong, exactly?

226
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,837
I followed your orders, Detective.

227
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,715
I found the files
and classified the evidence.

228
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,259
And thanks to the files I organized,

229
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,386
you caught the jewelry store thief.

230
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,765
That's not the issue here, Officer Bong.

231
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,350
Why on earth…

232
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,019
won't you shine my shoes?

233
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,356
I'm not some shoe shiner.

234
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:39,068
Rookies at Jongnam all start out
as shoe shiners, all right?

235
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,694
Is that an official policy?

236
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,321
Well…

237
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:48,202
it's not, okay?
But it's part of our tradition here.

238
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:53,040
What if I miss an important call
while following that tradition?

239
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,917
Will you take responsibility,
Detective Oh?

240
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,502
No.

241
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,756
All right, fine.

242
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,425
You don't have to shine shoes.

243
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,803
Just empty my wastebasket.

244
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,016
Empty your own wastebasket, Detective Oh.

245
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,437
Well, I'm usually quite busy.

246
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,107
Do you have time to poop, pee, and eat?

247
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,233
That I do.

248
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,443
Then you have the time
to empty your own trash.

249
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,820
That makes sense.

250
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,072
I guess I'll do that. Thank you.

251
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,741
- Officer Bong.
- Yes?

252
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,660
- Take it easy.
- All right.

253
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,079
- You must take it easy.
- Understood.

254
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,831
Hojeong worked really hard when he first--

255
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,040
- Just go!
- Okay.

256
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,710
- Goodbye, sir.
- Okay.

257
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,005
Thank you.

258
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,215
Let me know if he does that again.

259
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,009
I will, thank you.

260
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,136
Just a moment.

261
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,806
Things don't look good inside the room.

262
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,683
Really?

263
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,855
I told you to hurry up!

264
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,774
What's going on?

265
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,652
Hey, where's Chief Yu?

266
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,821
Is he not here?

267
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,823
Where on earth has he gone again?

268
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,075
Where have you all been?

269
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,453
We caught the guys
who mixed sawdust into cornmeal.

270
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,621
Cornmeal?

271
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,915
How is that important?

272
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,918
- It's very important, sir.
- You little punk.

273
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,253
Every single police officer in Seoul

274
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,423
is hunting down rebels
fighting against the revolution.

275
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,967
Yet you guys have time
to catch punks like these?

276
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,553
If we had time,
we'd go relax at a coffee shop,

277
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,680
not bother catching some con men!

278
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:36,560
Do you realize how dangerous
their fake cornmeal could be, sir?

279
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:41,273
What's truly dangerous are these punks
who refuse to live in a new world!

280
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,859
You all better hunt down some rebels,
all right?

281
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,320
What about these crooks?

282
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,741
The holding cell is bursting at the seams.

283
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,077
Just put them in a corner somewhere, okay?

284
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,079
Seriously, you fools.

285
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,580
Damn it.

286
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,040
Bring them over, Officer Bong.

287
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,416
Yes, sir.

288
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,046
What's up with him?

289
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,048
Becoming the senior inspector
must've gotten to his head.

290
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,301
So when do we get
a new senior superintendent?

291
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,387
The position has been empty for two weeks.

292
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,598
I guess the higher-ups
need more time finding a suck-up.

293
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,559
Now that Senior Superintendent Choi
is at the headquarters,

294
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,103
I heard he could be
the next deputy director.

295
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,938
He's still waiting, apparently.

296
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,607
I just hope
his career burns down in flames.

297
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,484
I've only spoken the truth.

298
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,611
Please sit down.

299
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,572
Used even once,
weapons become a familiar tool.

300
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,866
The weapons used to vanquish the enemy

301
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,787
will one day be pointed
toward us powerless citizens.

302
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,456
That is the nature of power

303
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,583
achieved through violence.

304
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,836
You've gone too far, professor.

305
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,714
Lock him up, Detective Oh.

306
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,716
All right. You stay here.

307
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,925
Get over here, you brat.

308
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,137
Get your hands off me! I'll go on my own.

309
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,141
Here we go again.

310
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,225
Detective Park.

311
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,686
Where were you, sir?

312
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,523
At Seodaemun Prison.

313
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,733
For what?

314
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,779
Kwak Youngju, Choi Inkyu, and Im Hwasoo…

315
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,449
have been executed.

316
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,045
Congratulations on your promotion

317
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,337
to deputy director of the National Police.

318
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,339
You are too kind.

319
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,592
It hasn't been made official yet.

320
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,844
According to rumors I've heard,

321
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,013
you're the strongest
leading candidate, sir.

322
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,639
That's what I thought as well,

323
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,642
but it seems
the higher-ups need more time.

324
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,353
Well, enough about me.

325
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:48,484
A man of ability such as yourself
deserves to be in a high position.

326
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,235
You flatter me, sir.

327
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,781
Quite honestly,
I am a man with many flaws.

328
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,408
The military did you wrong.

329
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,702
How could they kick out
a war hero and excellent officer

330
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,329
over a little corruption?

331
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,790
Well, I'm solely to blame.

332
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:06,001
I'm just grateful to you
for taking care of me.

333
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,670
I should have been
a low-ranking government official,

334
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,297
but here I am on the police's dime.

335
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,842
It's not every day I get to share
a meal with someone like you, sir.

336
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,928
I may have put in a good word,

337
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:19,139
but you deserve the credit for becoming
senior inspector this quickly.

338
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,351
You proved yourself
by discreetly eliminating

339
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,645
President Rhee Syngman's enemies.

340
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:28,732
I simply did
what I had to do for the president.

341
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,110
I still feel the same to this day.

342
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,487
I would say you're qualified

343
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,489
to be a senior superintendent.

344
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,826
I'm quite satisfied
with my current position, sir.

345
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,997
The senior superintendent position
at Jongnam Police Station is empty.

346
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,791
In keeping with the times,

347
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:50,879
Jongnam Police Station needs a leader
who has the heart of a soldier.

348
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,589
Someone like you.

349
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,216
No, I wouldn't dare dream it.

350
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,844
Your offer is much too generous for me.

351
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,596
Once I become the deputy director,

352
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,474
appointing the senior superintendent
would be an effortless task.

353
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,393
What do you say?

354
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,520
Will you give it a shot?

355
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,150
Would you say I'm qualified, sir?

356
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,193
You're more than good enough.

357
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,112
Someone like you

358
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,074
could rise much higher
than a senior superintendent.

359
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,493
Jeez, but the thing is…

360
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,203
What is it, sir?

361
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,290
Have you heard of the Sinkwang Society,
by any chance?

362
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,250
Yes, I have.

363
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,212
I heard you're a member,
Senior Superintendent Choi.

364
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:36,633
The elders of Sinkwang and I
all share a common nuisance.

365
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,721
What would you like me to do?

366
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,186
Goodness.

367
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,190
Those bastards ruled the world…

368
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,941
…and that's how they die.

369
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,277
Well,

370
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,114
I doubt they imagined
it would all end like that.

371
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,784
Considering all the evil they did,

372
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,287
I think they deserved it.

373
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,957
Think about what we went through.

374
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,542
We would catch them,

375
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,169
only to free them.

376
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,423
Other evil bastards
who live plush, comfortable lives

377
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,467
need to be punished too!

378
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,387
Just you wait.
Those thugs' lives will never end well.

379
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,099
- They'll pay for their sins.
- You're right, sir.

380
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,646
It's a fact that those who do evil
will pay for what they've done.

381
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,400
By the way, when will
the new senior superintendent be arriving?

382
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,404
I heard Choi would appoint one
when he's the deputy director.

383
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,739
What?

384
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,784
Senior Superintendent Choi chooses
the next senior superintendent?

385
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,953
Then nothing will change.

386
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,162
Jeez.

387
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,041
Damn, I should've destroyed his career.

388
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,209
Come on, Chief Yu.

389
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,629
The country's greatest suck-up
wouldn't ever be destroyed by anything.

390
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,257
I told you I can do it.

391
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,093
Actually, even if he becomes
the deputy director,

392
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,845
I promise you I'll bring him down!

393
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,097
Of course, sir.

394
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,557
We can't have a pro-Japanese traitor
in that position.

395
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,684
- That's right.
- Definitely.

396
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,185
I'll help you, sir.

397
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,771
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers!

398
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,106
Cheers!

399
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,194
Come on, Chief.
You don't have to pay tonight!

400
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,280
I've already paid.
It's fine. Let's go.

401
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,350
- Were you sewing?
- Yes.

402
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,271
Did you drink a lot?

403
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,232
No, I couldn't really drink tonight.

404
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,029
Were you bothered
by the news of the execution?

405
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,034
It's not that I feel bad for them.

406
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,871
They had it coming, and justice prevailed.

407
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,749
I just feel frustrated, that's all.

408
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,085
Why? Frustrated about what?

409
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,339
Those gangsters…

410
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,635
Why do they only listen
when the tanks roll in

411
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,220
and guns are pointed at them?

412
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,016
If they obeyed the police
and paid for their crimes,

413
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,769
they wouldn't have died so pathetically.

414
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,690
I don't know why they ignore the police
and see us as pushovers.

415
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,902
Those gangsters

416
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,863
may have regarded the police as pushovers,

417
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,949
but definitely not you.

418
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,659
That I'm sure of.

419
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,286
I disagree.

420
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,705
I was never a tough man.

421
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,960
I need to be stronger
and more ruthless to be tough.

422
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,631
What makes someone tough?

423
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,595
Being even worse than the bad guys?

424
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,971
Hmm…

425
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,517
My idea of a tough man is someone…

426
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,852
who is excessively kind.

427
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,063
Kindness equals weakness.

428
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,648
It doesn't.

429
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,359
You see,
my father told me this once before.

430
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,070
"A good person filled with indignation

431
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,489
is the scariest person in the world."

432
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,369
A good person who's indignant?

433
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:36,540
Yes. A kind person doesn't know
what evil looks like.

434
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,250
So when they get indignant,

435
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,838
they stop at absolutely nothing
with no tolerance.

436
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,174
People like that don't exist.

437
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,968
I know one such person.

438
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,595
He let snakes loose on gangsters,

439
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,348
pushed his subordinate's face
into the crapper,

440
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,351
crashed a car with bank robbers in it,

441
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,438
and turned a cow thief infertile.

442
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,566
That last one wasn't intentional.

443
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,775
He was yelling and--

444
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,612
You are more than strong
and intimidating enough.

445
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,824
You don't have to change.

446
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,414
Okay. I'll keep doing as I've done.

447
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,419
Yeonghan! It's me, Hojeong!

448
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,920
Come on out quick!

449
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,174
Hojeong.

450
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,093
What's wrong?

451
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,804
Yeonghan, Chief Yu…

452
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,991
Jongnam Jeil Hospital

453
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,288
Yeonghan!

454
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,127
Where's Chief Yu?

455
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,587
He's being treated inside.

456
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,383
You can't enter!

457
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,011
Chief Yu. Chief Yu. Chief Yu.

458
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,513
Chief.

459
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:19,059
He'll be all right, won't he?

460
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,977
His life isn't in danger, is it?

461
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,648
The doctor is currently treating him
and will explain later.

462
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,149
Please wait out here.

463
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,776
But…

464
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,280
What…

465
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,157
What happened to him?

466
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,368
A passerby found him in the alley

467
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,745
next to the Jongnam Snack Store
and called in.

468
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,288
I think it happened

469
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,832
not long after he left us.

470
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,586
Was he already in that state
when he was discovered?

471
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,921
Yes.

472
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,258
He was assaulted severely

473
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,926
and even stabbed,

474
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,219
three times in the knee

475
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,513
and once deeply in the heel.

476
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,393
What kind of scum would do this?

477
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,355
This has to be
the Dongdaemun gang's doing.

478
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,692
I'm sure they took their anger
out on Chief Yu

479
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,902
after all their bosses got executed!

480
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,784
Doctor.

481
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,995
How is he?

482
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,664
The patient is in critical condition
due to heavy bleeding.

483
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,919
There's still hope, right?

484
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,588
He's still breathing,

485
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,090
but we'll have to wait and see
if he regains consciousness.

486
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,009
What about his stab wounds?

487
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,680
The wounds have been stitched,
but the punctures are very deep.

488
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:42,475
His Achilles tendon, in particular,
had been severed completely,

489
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,519
meaning he'd never be able
to walk properly again.

490
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,895
Instead of giving up,

491
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,480
why don't you go and fix him?

492
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,316
We'll have to observe how he recovers.

493
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:53,028
I'm begging you, Doctor.

494
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,112
Please.

495
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,948
- Please save him. Please.
- I will do my best.

496
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,826
Please, I'm begging you.

497
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,911
Doctor.

498
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,164
Please, Doctor.

499
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,385
Chief Yu.

500
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,565
You don't think
he'll leave us like this, do you?

501
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,360
Of course not.

502
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,654
You know what he's like.

503
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,199
Even the Grim Reaper would give up on him.

504
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,661
That poor old man…

505
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,498
Why did he have to be alone out there?

506
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,585
Did he say his daughter Eunyoung

507
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,171
is with her grandmother in Seosan?

508
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,758
Yes, she goes to school there.

509
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,970
Don't contact her until Chief Yu wakes up.

510
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,848
It's barely been three years
since she lost her mother.

511
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,685
If she finds out about this,

512
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,978
she'll be devastated.

513
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,063
Okay.

514
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,442
We'll find out who did this tomorrow.

515
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,453
Keep your cool.

516
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,415
Keep your cool.

517
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,133
Our first suspects are Lee Jungjae's men,
who are in hiding.

518
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,886
Search every nook and cranny
they could be in,

519
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,222
but don't use force in the process.

520
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,268
However, if they try to escape
or you see them escaping,

521
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,145
then do what's necessary.

522
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,271
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

523
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,316
Whoever dared to stab
a chief of Jongnam Police Station…

524
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,944
will be found no matter what.

525
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,411
Hey, Unit 1. Where…

526
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,038
Where are you all off to again?

527
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,582
Brief us on Chief Yu's stabbing!

528
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,000
Just leave them be, sir.

529
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,504
Are you all right?

530
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,881
Wait.

531
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,924
Have you heard the good news?

532
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,217
What good news?

533
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,887
I just returned from running an errand
at the National Police.

534
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,639
Senior Superintendent Choi
has finally been appointed

535
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,683
as the deputy director
of Department 2 of the National Police!

536
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,144
- So what?
- So…

537
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,104
we're all happy, right?

538
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,690
Go on and tell them your good news.

539
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,484
All right.

540
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,661
Freeze!

541
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,123
Freeze. Don't move.

542
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,921
Why would you punks lock the door
for no good reason?

543
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,881
Everybody get up.

544
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,760
You better answer me straight.

545
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,637
If I catch you lying,

546
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,264
I'll kill you. Got it?

547
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,682
Okay.

548
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,392
Where were you last night?

549
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,728
You will answer my questions.

550
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,021
If you don't comply…

551
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,773
I'll lift you all like a barbell

552
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,943
and make you kiss the ground.

553
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,905
If we really wanted to,
we'd mess up somebody else,

554
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,698
not your chief.

555
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,117
None of you really use knives?

556
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,619
You know how we are.

557
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,621
We use fists, not knives.

558
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,125
How did you hurt your hand?

559
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,794
Did you stab someone?

560
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:41,297
No, I hurt myself peeling a chestnut.

561
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,091
Chestnut, my foot!

562
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,260
I was in Incheon until yesterday.

563
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,346
You caught me
right as I got off here at Jongnam.

564
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,768
Listen. I didn't even say anything.

565
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,565
You don't have to be so scared.

566
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,149
Relax.

567
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,028
I'm telling the truth.

568
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,782
You can ask my friend Dosik in Incheon.

569
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,950
I get it.

570
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,829
But of all the Dongdaemun scums left,

571
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,873
you're the best with a knife, no?

572
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,960
You're barking up the wrong tree!

573
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,380
I've left the Dongdaemun gang behind me.
I live a quiet life now.

574
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,674
When I snitched on Viper last time,

575
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,969
I even lost an eye, okay?

576
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,054
Then who else is handy with a knife?

577
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:34,267
All the best stabbers in town
have run off to their hometowns.

578
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,603
Viper was pretty decent with knives…

579
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,855
but he's in jail now.

580
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,984
How is your eye, anyway?

581
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,403
That must've really hurt.

582
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,241
If you're ever in trouble or need,
let me know.

583
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,286
Now let's think about this again.

584
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,164
Who do you know is good with a knife?

585
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,834
Jeez, how handy was this guy
with the blade?

586
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,672
He stabbed the victim
just enough to keep him alive

587
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,050
while severing his Achilles tendon.

588
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,010
Come on.

589
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,180
Gangsters just stab without thinking.

590
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,974
Who would be so delicate with a knife?

591
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,309
Besides special forces, that is.

592
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,438
And Detective Park…

593
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,523
I mean, Yeonghan.

594
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,736
The Dongdaemun gang's worst enemy

595
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,488
isn't Chief Yu.

596
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,326
It's Im Hwasoo,
who snitched and betrayed Chairman Lee.

597
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,581
All right, thanks for your help.
You can go.

598
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,666
Can I?

599
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,168
- Be a good person.
- I'll be a good person!

600
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,294
- Go.
- Okay.

601
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,465
What Rattlesnake said makes sense.

602
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,968
None of those gangsters
had a grudge against Chief Yu.

603
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,929
The motive for the crime is unclear,

604
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,514
and the knife too.

605
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,808
Gangsters don't stab people
in that manner.

606
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,811
Could the perp really be
a special forces soldier?

607
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:02,313
So it might not be an ordinary stabber?

608
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,358
Where do we even start?

609
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,905
Let's leave Dongdaemun gang alone for now

610
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,949
and trace Chief Yu's whereabouts,

611
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,451
any secrets he might've kept from us.

612
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,621
What if he was on a case behind our backs?

613
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,960
- Yes?
- Everyone, assemble.

614
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,796
- Damn it.
- We finally have

615
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:30,508
a new senior superintendent at Jongnam!

616
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,968
Who is it, sir?

617
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:35,221
He is a former military officer,
in keeping up with the times.

618
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,849
Do you think
Senior Superintendent Choi picked him?

619
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,768
If the rumors are true,
he'll have picked someone just like him.

620
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,437
A former commissioned officer,

621
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,648
he's also a war hero
whose exploits need no introduction.

622
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,525
At 10 a.m. tomorrow,

623
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:52,739
we'll welcome him with a party
on his first day at work.

624
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,323
I expect you all to be there.

625
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,325
Yes, sir!

626
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,120
So, a new senior superintendent
is a cause to celebrate,

627
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,207
but Chief Yu's critical condition
means nothing to you?

628
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,502
It's not that it means nothing.

629
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,880
- We--
- You should all be ashamed.

630
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,340
How could no one care?

631
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,343
Not a single one of you pricks
even visited him.

632
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,387
"Pricks"?

633
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,432
You know what?

634
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,225
Just stick to your dirty game.

635
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,312
Don't even try to pretend to care.

636
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,190
We, Unit 1,

637
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,858
will handle it on our own.

638
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,946
- You little…
- Hey, Detective Park!

639
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,573
Mind your business,

640
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,701
unless you want me to bite you to pieces.

641
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,623
Got it?

642
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,749
What?

643
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,169
Honey.

644
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,712
You're here.

645
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,464
You're still here?

646
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,550
Yes. He started breaking out
in a cold sweat.

647
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,428
Has he shown any improvement?

648
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,640
Not yet.

649
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,935
Chief Yu.

650
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,689
Wake up so we can get
some rice wine together.

651
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,652
I'm sure he's continuing his battle inside

652
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,320
to overcome his injuries.

653
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,406
Uh…

654
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,659
I'm sorry for troubling you.

655
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:24,539
No, I'm happy to help.
He's like an older brother to you.

656
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,042
Thank you.

657
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,337
Have you found a suspect?

658
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,424
No, not yet.

659
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,636
You'll get them eventually,

660
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,013
as you always have.

661
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,978
I'm sure
your chief is going to wake up soon.

662
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,772
I just have a feeling.

663
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,403
Hey, move a bit to the side.

664
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,779
That's good.

665
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,991
Who could be worth all this fuss?

666
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,202
It's not like the president's visiting.

667
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,787
Why is he overreacting?

668
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,706
It feels more like
we're welcoming some general,

669
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,082
even more so than the president.

670
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,377
I guess he wants a promotion too.

671
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,546
Just leave him be.

672
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,466
He just wants to show off
his fancy new title.

673
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,926
He's here.

674
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,179
Attention, everyone!

675
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,070
Look at those clowns.

676
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,422
- Sir.
- Oh, hey.

677
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,342
He's the senior superintendent?

678
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,094
No way, he looks nothing like…

679
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,347
This is Chief Hwang of Unit 2.

680
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,766
I'm Hwang Sooman, sir!

681
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,434
- What a voice.
- Thank you, sir!

682
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,312
I love how loud your voice is.

683
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,897
This is Chief Song of Unit 3.

684
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,315
I'm Song Jaeduk, sir!

685
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,025
I look forward to working with you, sir.

686
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,985
All right.
You're a good-looking man.

687
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,780
- Thank you, sir!
- Thank you.

688
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,283
- I'm Senior Inspector Byun Daesik, sir!
- What a nice name.

689
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,993
- Thank you, sir!
- You're welcome.

690
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,995
- Could you stop the music?
- Yes, sir!

691
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,845
Attention, everyone!

692
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,776
Salute to the new senior superintendent!

693
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,278
Salute!

694
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,155
Salute!

695
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,535
At ease.

696
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,619
At ease!

697
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,751
How nice.

698
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:23,926
Aim!

699
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,178
Fire!

700
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,350
Hey! Why aren't you firing?

701
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:35,896
Don't look at me.
Look forward, aim, and fire.

702
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,273
What's wrong with you?

703
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,108
Just aim and fire. Like this.

704
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,318
Aim.

705
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,944
Fire. Fire!

706
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,529
I'm carrying a child.

707
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,364
Fire, you little prick!

708
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,616
This is how you shoot.

709
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,495
You dumb prick.

710
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,237
Let me keep this brief.

711
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,948
Our duty as the police

712
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,617
is crystal clear.

713
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,243
What is our duty?

714
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:35,498
Stamp out past wrongs
and maintain law and order.

715
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,583
To achieve that,

716
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,671
each of you must take part
in the rebirth of the police.

717
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,716
You must be the advance guard

718
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,511
of the honorable revolutionary government.

719
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,471
From now on,

720
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,100
Jongnam Police Station
will stop at nothing

721
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,687
to round up all rebellious forces
who dare to defy

722
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,065
the revolutionary government

723
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,692
and eliminate them all.

724
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,654
Why?

725
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,700
Because…

726
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,621
we must keep pace with the new world

727
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:19,458
and fight our enemies together.

728
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,961
- Yes, sir.
- A round of applause!

729
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,092
Revolutionary Policy

730
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,770
Senior Superintendent Baek Doseok

731
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,867
If something
could be done about him,

732
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,161
Sinkwang Society and I
would enjoy a bright future.

733
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,081
What would you like me to do?

734
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,920
The target is Chief Yu Daecheon
of Unit 1 at Jongnam Police Station.

735
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,047
Shall I kill him?

736
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,552
But don't you want to know
why he's a nuisance first?

737
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,513
If you say he's a nuisance,
then he's a nuisance.

738
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,098
I don't need a reason, sir.

739
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,933
I knew it.

740
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,561
I knew I could rely on you.

741
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,315
Don't go as far as killing him.

742
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,609
If you would consider…

743
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,153
the aftermath,

744
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,655
it might be better
to get rid of him permanently, sir.

745
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,117
No, make sure he's still intact.

746
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,370
I have a plan in mind.

747
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,498
In that case,

748
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,001
I'll look for some capable men and…

749
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,714
I want you to do it personally.

750
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,258
- Me, sir?
- I happen to be

751
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,594
a very meticulous person, you see.

752
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,723
Understood, sir.
I will pledge my allegiance

753
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:01,227
to you and the chairman, sir.

754
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,812
What?

755
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,224
You didn't need to come out, sir.

756
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,308
How did it go?

757
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,436
It went well, sir.

758
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:45,938
You didn't kill him, did you?

759
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,606
No.

760
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,359
He'll just be crippled.

761
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,777
- Good job.
- Yes, sir.

762
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,487
Congratulations,

763
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,947
Senior Superintendent Baek.

764
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,700
Thank you, sir.

765
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,869
You must keep rising higher

766
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,538
until you're by the chairman's side.

767
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,623
I'll pave the way for you.

768
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,293
How high is he planning on taking me?

769
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,547
Come in.

770
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,308
Ah.

771
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,602
Long time no see,

772
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,187
student soldier.

773
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,481
I'm Sergeant Park Yeonghan, sir.

774
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,733
Park Yeonghan?

775
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,945
Park Yeonghan?
I finally know your name after 10 years.

776
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,488
Hey.

777
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,492
I have a keen eye, don't you think?

778
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,078
I recognized you at once.

779
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,581
Or did you recognize me first?

780
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,125
How could I not, sir?

781
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,086
Exactly.

782
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:56,967
I mean, you and I are old comrades
who fought together.

783
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,303
"Fought"?

784
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,264
I don't remember fighting.

785
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,059
Really? Then what do you remember?

786
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,727
The only thing I remember…

787
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,772
is a heavily pregnant woman,

788
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,858
dying with a bullet through her head.

789
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,781
I thought you looked like
you'd turned into a decent detective,

790
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,658
but in your little noggin…

791
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,910
you're still a student soldier.

792
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,622
And to me,
you're still Captain Baek Doseok.

793
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,916
You little prick!

794
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:31,794
Student soldier,

795
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,380
the world has changed.

796
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:36,840
Got it?

797
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,511
The damned colonial rule, the war!

798
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,888
Forget about all that, you moron!

799
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,057
You need to keep up with the times…

800
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,019
to grow as a man.

801
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,356
The times may change easily,

802
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,359
but people don't, sir.

803
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,610
Ah.

804
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,321
I was going to treat you well
for old time's sake,

805
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,739
but you don't seem to want that.

806
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,366
It's not that I don't want it.

807
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,244
I just don't feel the need for it.

808
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:09,790
Is that so?

809
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,377
Then I guess we'll have to be
as distant as we once were.

810
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,755
I'll show myself out if you're done.

811
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:23,303
I heard your chief got stabbed
by the Dongdaemun thugs.

812
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,352
Listen, student soldier.

813
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,106
If you obsess over the past

814
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,984
like your chief did…

815
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,863
then old grudges don't go away,

816
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,532
and that'll cause suffering and pain.

817
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:46,869
Hey.

818
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,330
Think it through.

819
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,470
Looking at you,
I guess people really don't change.

820
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:15,522
So, the savage beast who left you
with bitterness your whole life

821
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,232
is our new boss?

822
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,234
Yes.

823
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,361
How does someone like him
end up in that position?

824
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,863
Senior Superintendent Choi…

825
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,157
I mean, Deputy Director Choi
picked him himself.

826
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,034
Basically, crap chose crap.

827
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,913
Will you be all right
after what you said, Yeonghan?

828
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,123
I think I was polite enough.

829
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:37,294
If I had my way,
I would've punched him in the face.

830
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,172
If you ever want that to happen,
just let me know.

831
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,467
I'll tear his ears to shreds
with every bite.

832
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,304
Deputy Director Choi
and Senior Superintendent Baek

833
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,181
are pretty much the same person.

834
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,935
So it's business as usual for us.

835
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,269
- All right.
- Got it.

836
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,521
By the way…

837
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,733
have you all found anything
on what Chief Yu has been up to?

838
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,527
He's a total loner.

839
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,403
He doesn't have friends or relatives.

840
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,614
I couldn't find anything either.

841
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,950
Same with me.

842
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,708
N-Nansil.

843
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,295
Why are you in there?

844
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:24,007
I just want to be alone sometimes.

845
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,219
That's my spot, Officer Bong.

846
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,265
Well, it's mine now.

847
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,808
It must be nice in there.

848
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,434
I should try it out sometime.

849
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,937
You better not, Gyeonghwan.

850
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,897
You'll break the whole thing.

851
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,859
- You're right.
- So, I guess none of you

852
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:47,447
have found out whether Chief Yu
was involved in anything else.

853
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,993
Wait, how do you know that?

854
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:54,538
I was in here during your last meeting.

855
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,166
I guess nothing is private.

856
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,752
Even the walls have ears now.

857
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,674
I've thought about it a lot,

858
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,343
and I've noticed something strange.

859
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,512
What is it?

860
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,766
There are too many ears in here.

861
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,311
We should talk outside.

862
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,023
I didn't think much of it at first,

863
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:24,151
but it was strange
that it happened so often.

864
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,194
Whenever you all were out,

865
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,323
he would write letters
and hurriedly leave with them.

866
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,159
Did he say where he was going?

867
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,328
No, not at all.

868
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,748
What seemed strange to me
was that every time he left,

869
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,500
Chief Song would follow after him.

870
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,628
Every time?

871
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,921
Yes, every time.

872
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,381
He only wrote letters
when we weren't there?

873
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,175
What could the letters be about?

874
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,764
I say we politely ask Chief Song
for an explanation first.

875
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:54,848
All right.

876
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,310
Officer Bong and Gyeonghwan, come with me.

877
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,728
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

878
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,858
I have something to tell you, sir.

879
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,193
What's going on?

880
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:09,446
- Good job, Officer Bong. You can go now.
- Yes, sir.

881
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,531
- Come on.
- We have some questions.

882
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,284
- Just a few questions.
- What's the meaning of this?

883
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,577
Just stay, sir.

884
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,996
Why did you follow Chief Yu?

885
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,123
Who followed him?

886
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,377
You followed him out
whenever he left with his letters.

887
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,837
What are you talking about?

888
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,966
Keep feigning ignorance,
and we won't treat you like a superior.

889
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,052
Since when have you treated me like one?

890
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:36,181
Then again, even Chief Yu hated your guts
for all the bribes you took.

891
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,433
Shut up! The kid's listening.

892
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,977
I'm not a kid!

893
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:44,648
I know nothing about this, all right?
Don't bark up the wrong tree.

894
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,277
And you won't regret this?

895
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,779
Regret what?

896
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,865
- I'm back.
- Did you bring it?

897
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,076
Yes. This is a ledger of all the bribes

898
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,996
given to Chief Song
at the Flower Dance Hall.

899
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,372
You little--

900
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,167
I'm sure the new senior superintendent
would love to take a look.

901
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,336
Hey.

902
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:07,754
Jeez, Gyeonghwan.

903
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,674
What would you do if you saw this?

904
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,134
No question about it.

905
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,803
Six months of docked pay
and getting flogged 30…

906
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,972
No, 50 times.

907
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,269
Hey, you.

908
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,521
We live in a new world now.

909
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,943
Flogging is a thing of the past.

910
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,281
All right, fine.

911
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:35,949
I'll tell you.

912
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,869
But not here.

913
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,455
Let's meet somewhere later at night.

914
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,874
Is everyone here?

915
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,376
- Yes, they have arrived.
- This way, sir.

916
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,627
Go ahead.

917
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,046
Here they all are.

918
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,134
He's the head
of the merchants' association.

919
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,845
- I see.
- It is a great honor to meet you.

920
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,972
It's very nice to meet you.

921
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,016
- We should see each other often.
- Of course.

922
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,894
This is the president of Goryeo Bank.

923
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:08,023
So you are the man
who holds Jongnam's wealth in your hands.

924
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,192
- That's right, sir.
- You flatter me.

925
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,985
I look forward
to your kind cooperation, sir.

926
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,071
Yes, likewise.

927
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:17,157
Is she also a public figure in Jongnam?

928
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,494
I am the owner of this place, sir.

929
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,661
It is an honor.

930
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,998
Considering how beautiful the owner is,

931
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,833
I can't imagine how insecure

932
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,668
these other ladies would be.

933
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,796
That's not true.

934
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,173
Please, this way.

935
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,716
- All right.
- This way, sir.

936
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,970
Are you all aware that Chief Yu used to be
part of the special police?

937
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,390
Yes, he was with the Special Investigation
Committee of Anti-National Activities.

938
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:45,310
He investigated
countless pro-Japanese figures back then,

939
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,020
which included Senior Superintendent Choi.

940
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,939
We're also aware of that.

941
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:52,692
That's why Senior Superintendent Choi
can't lay a single finger on Chief Yu.

942
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,195
Well, it's an open secret.

943
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,947
But that's not all.

944
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,242
A group called Sinkwang Society
is embedded within the National Police.

945
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,911
It's a private club for the higher-ups,

946
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,830
of which Senior Superintendent Choi
is a member.

947
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,832
Is Sinkwang Society also…

948
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,709
Yes, it's a private group
founded by pro-Japanese figures.

949
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,462
Those guys banded together
to avoid the inevitable backlash

950
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,422
and live comfortable lives.

951
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,176
Pro-Japanese scumbags
are so hard to weed out.

952
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,971
Anyway, Chief Yu couldn't bear to see
Senior Superintendent Choi

953
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,890
get promoted to deputy director
of the National Police.

954
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,935
He could stomach him being
the senior superintendent of Jongnam,

955
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,063
but not the deputy director
of the National Police?

956
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,523
So he would rather die

957
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:35,152
than see pro-Japanese punks
succeed in this new world.

958
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,361
That's exactly right.

959
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,530
And the opportunity arrived.

960
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,657
The May 16 coup
turned the world upside down.

961
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,742
Thus, he wrote daily anonymous letters

962
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,453
to the Supreme Council
for National Reconstruction.

963
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:49,291
So he tried to blow the whistle
on both Choi and Sinkwang Society.

964
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,001
That's most likely what he did.

965
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,504
He submitted the letters every single day

966
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,881
until they would listen to him.

967
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,634
I only heard this through the grapevine…

968
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,014
but apparently,
the leaders of the Sinkwang Society

969
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:07,350
were summoned by the military
and suffered a great affront.

970
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,563
This means Deputy Director Choi
is behind the crime then.

971
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:15,275
He roughed up Chief Yu
for a smoother path to promotion.

972
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,362
I never heard you say that, all right?

973
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,781
Anyway, I've done my part.

974
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,034
Where are you going?

975
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:29,372
Thank you for the cinnamon punch, Ms. Lee.

976
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:35,212
And please destroy the ledger, guys.

977
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,008
You can't leave. We're not done yet!

978
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,053
That little rat. Tsk.

979
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,307
We need to arrest
Deputy Director Choi right now.

980
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,226
I'll interrogate him.

981
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,853
Are you out of your mind?
There's no way we can do that.

982
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,563
They'll shoot us dead the moment we try.

983
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,153
What do we do, Yeonghan?

984
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,619
We'll stand by for now.

985
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,913
No one does anything
without my permission.

986
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,415
- Got it.
- All right.

987
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,504
Let's all eat.

988
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,424
- Here we go.
- Cheers.

989
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,222
- Could you sing--
- Senior Superintendent Baek.

990
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,308
The children
of high-ranking officials are here, sir.

991
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,936
Is that so?

992
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,692
- I'll head over.
- Yes, sir.

993
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,906
Someone's here. Who is it?

994
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,326
Hey, someone's here.

995
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,579
I'm Senior Superintendent Baek
of Jongnam Police Station.

996
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,664
Greetings to you all.

997
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,375
- Have a seat. Come on over.
- Yes, sir.

998
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:58,962
Over there is Jung Heesung,

999
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:02,090
the son of the deputy minister
of Chairman Jung of the Supreme Council.

1000
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,717
It's an honor, sir!

1001
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,302
Nice to meet you.

1002
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,554
This is Nam Junggil,
who is the son of Nam Chulwoo,

1003
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,848
the head of
the Korean Central Intelligence Agency.

1004
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,892
- I'm Junggil. Work hard.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

1005
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,936
Yes, sir. I'll do my best!

1006
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,813
This is Kwon Hyunggeun,

1007
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:20,025
the son of President Kwon
of Kwangho Corporation.

1008
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,651
It's an honor, sir.

1009
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,237
Lastly, that is No Yoonhak,

1010
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:27,490
son of Brigadier General No Kitak
of the Army Headquarters.

1011
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,743
- Salute!
- Salute!

1012
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,288
Aren't you a former officer?

1013
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,539
Yes, sir.

1014
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,708
Seeing you're not part
of the revolutionary government,

1015
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,502
you must've been a crummy officer.

1016
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,212
- A crummy officer.
- Crummy!

1017
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,422
Here's some crummy food!

1018
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,798
Here you go!

1019
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,677
Yes, I was a crummy officer
who only rounded up rebels!

1020
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:51,306
Tell us some fun stories
about killing armed guerrillas sometime.

1021
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,726
With all due respect,

1022
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:58,938
if I may be so bold to say this…

1023
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,940
- No, don't talk.
- Then I will not, sir.

1024
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,693
- Hey, come on.
- Talk to us.

1025
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:06,696
Well, if by any chance,

1026
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,032
I could be of service…

1027
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,492
- Service?
- Yes, sir.

1028
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,160
Hey. Give him a drink.

1029
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,745
Yes, have a drink.

1030
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:16,414
I don't think
we'll ever need you, but all right.

1031
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,540
Yes, sir.

1032
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,292
Drink up.

1033
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,503
- Drink it.
- Come on.

1034
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,879
- I will, sir.
- Hurry up!

1035
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,631
- Yes, sir.
- Drink it now!

1036
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,345
Oh, my goodness.

1037
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,640
- He emptied it!
- Yes, I drank it all.

1038
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,016
- What a guy!
- Thank you!

1039
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,523
Chief Yu.

1040
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,984
I know very well
why you fought the battle alone

1041
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,904
without telling any of us.

1042
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,116
You feared we would get hurt, didn't you?

1043
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,952
They say people behave
the way they've been taught.

1044
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,164
Well, I've been taught

1045
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,999
to protect my subordinates
from getting hurt.

1046
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:04,129
If I have to risk my life,
then I'll die alone.

1047
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,096
Where's Yeonghan, Detective Seo?

1048
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,849
I'm not sure.
He wasn't here when I clocked in.

1049
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,350
Where on earth is he?

1050
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,601
You arrogant little brat.

1051
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,937
You're nothing but a rookie,
so shut up and shine my shoes.

1052
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,148
I didn't become a police officer
to shine shoes, sir.

1053
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,067
I have my own duties.

1054
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,445
What duties would a girl like you have?

1055
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,697
You're just a maid around here.

1056
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,869
I would shine every shoe in this building…

1057
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,621
except for yours, Detective.

1058
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,375
How dare you?

1059
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,507
Sucking up to the senior superintendent
must've really got to your head.

1060
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,301
You punks!

1061
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:54,137
Come on, we're all one family here!

1062
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,599
Move. A dumb prick like him
needs to get his head screwed on.

1063
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,935
Hey!

1064
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,063
You little punk.

1065
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,991
Are you all right?

1066
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,869
Don't get cocky with me, you little prick.

1067
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,331
Hey, errand boy.

1068
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,041
I'll teach you a lesson.

1069
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,339
Hey!

1070
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,424
Was that a massage?

1071
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,935
Let go of him, Detective Jo.

1072
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,311
Help me, Detective Oh.

1073
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,524
What's going on here?

1074
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,734
Hey, Big Guy!

1075
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,529
Hey, you won the fight! Now stop!

1076
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:05,583
Big Guy, if you ever aim your gun
at a comrade again,

1077
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,169
I'll shoot you dead myself.

1078
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:11,214
He was going to hit
that female officer first.

1079
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,674
Shut up, you punk!

1080
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,513
Why did you try to hit her? Tell me.

1081
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,847
She disobeyed orders, sir.

1082
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,600
Why on earth
would you interrupt his punishment

1083
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:23,977
for her disobedience, you moron?

1084
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,938
Never intervene again, got it?

1085
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:34,529
Get ready to go out.

1086
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:35,613
Yes, sir.

1087
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,952
I'll see you later, Detective Kang.

1088
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,165
Are you okay, Officer Bong?

1089
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,419
That scummy prick.

1090
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,379
You sound okay.

1091
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,134
"Deputy Director Choi Dalsik."

1092
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,849
Oh.

1093
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,939
Whiskey, whiskey.

1094
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,735
Come in.

1095
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:23,870
Gosh. You don't greet me like you used to.

1096
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,664
My day is full of meetings,

1097
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,126
but I let you in here for old time's sake.

1098
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:31,919
Thank you.

1099
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,588
It's good you're grateful.

1100
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:35,757
What brings you here?

1101
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,176
Please come with me to the station.

1102
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,927
What?

1103
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,596
I need to investigate you

1104
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,473
for the conspiracy to murder
Chief Yu Daecheon.

1105
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:44,682
You should come with me.

1106
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,560
Conspiracy of committing what,
you punk?

1107
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,399
If necessary, I will take you in by force.

1108
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,485
Y-You little punk.

1109
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,820
Hey, there!

1110
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,530
Is anybody out there?

1111
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,951
Will you put them on yourself…

1112
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:07,747
or shall I do it for you?

1113
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,000
You're going to pay for this!

1114
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,253
I'm going to make you rot in jail!

1115
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,048
- Suit yourself.
- What did you just say, you punk?

1116
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,633
- Take him in.
- What?

1117
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,843
- Wait, wait. One minute.
- Stop him!

1118
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,388
Good idea. Shoot him. Shoot him.

1119
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,056
Shoot him now!

1120
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:29,310
This is an obstruction of justice.
Please step aside.

1121
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,568
This is such a pity.

1122
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,195
I hope he wakes up soon.

1123
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:42,365
Goodness. It's very kind of you
to come visit him like this.

1124
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,618
It's only natural
I care about my subordinates.

1125
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,413
Tell everyone I stopped by,
will you?

1126
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,957
Of course, sir. I'll spread the word.

1127
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,668
Goodness.

1128
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:58,881
Is there anything to drink?

1129
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,550
Yes, I'll get some water.

1130
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,644
Maybe I should've just ended you.

1131
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,148
Look how much pain you're in.

1132
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:19,694
But thanks to you,
I got to be the senior superintendent.

1133
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,738
I'll make sure

1134
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,073
to contribute to your funeral.

1135
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,118
Who are you?

1136
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:29,871
Ah,

1137
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:33,708
I'm Senior Superintendent Baek Doseok

1138
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,668
of Jongnam Police Station.
Who might you be?

1139
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,420
I see.

1140
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,090
I'm Detective Park Yeonghan's wife.

1141
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:45,178
Detective Park is blessed
to have you as his wife.

1142
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:50,057
My goodness. I didn't realize
his wife was this stunning.

1143
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:51,726
Crazy punk.

1144
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,145
Excuse me? Did you call me a crazy punk?

1145
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:58,149
No, I meant
that he was crazy in love with me,

1146
01:02:58,232 --> 01:02:59,859
Detective Park was.

1147
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,403
I see.

1148
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,490
- Sir.
- What is it?

1149
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,908
You must hurry, sir.

1150
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,201
What's going on?

1151
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,078
Well, we have a problem, sir.

1152
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,540
What problem?

1153
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,917
Detective Park Yeonghan…

1154
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,084
What did he do?

1155
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,631
Step aside.

1156
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,925
How is this allowed?

1157
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:26,010
He's not a criminal! You can't tie him up!

1158
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:28,179
Can't you guys think straight?

1159
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:31,516
This punk threatened me
and tried to abduct me!

1160
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,518
I didn't threaten and abduct you, sir.

1161
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:35,520
I simply arrested a suspect.

1162
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:38,356
Oh, yes? On what charges?

1163
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,359
For conspiracy to murder
Chief Yu Daecheon.

1164
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,157
Hey. Shut it with the nonsense.

1165
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:51,577
You held a grudge
against Chief Yu for his letters

1166
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,871
- revealing your pro-Japanese--
- Hey, you.

1167
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,958
The victim
is in a hospital bed, unconscious.

1168
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,794
What gives you the right
to pick out a suspect

1169
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,171
and give him a motive?

1170
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:05,383
We don't need
Chief Yu's testimony to investigate!

1171
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,551
Shut up!

1172
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:10,721
Are you using Chief Yu
as an excuse to destroy me?

1173
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,765
Hey, student soldier.

1174
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:17,144
What you're doing right now
is a serious act of mutiny.

1175
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:19,355
It's not an act of mutiny,

1176
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,148
Captain Baek Doseok.

1177
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,568
Do you need my testimony?

1178
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,027
Chief Yu!

1179
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,362
Chief Yu!

1180
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:30,408
Jeez, my joints are aching.
Perhaps it's going to rain soon.

1181
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:35,288
Deputy Director Choi.

1182
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,040
Congratulations on your promotion.

1183
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,627
How did you wake up so soon?
Is this a miracle?

1184
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,963
- Miracles aren't real, sir.
- I know that!

1185
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,258
Detective Park.

1186
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,345
You must have been a bad guy
to get tied up like that.

1187
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,143
I'm not a bad guy, sir.

1188
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,687
I'm a good guy…

1189
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:03,190
full of indignation.

1190
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,153
That's who I am.

1191
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,958
Chief Detective 1958

1192
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,876
Minato Tanaka.

1193
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,087


1194
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,255
- What do you really want?

1195
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,465
His name is Hong Inho.

1196
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,425
He works at the securities firm
on the fourth floor.

1197
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,010
I found something, Yeonghan.

1198
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,971
That's how cow thieves dress.

1199
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,682
Effective immediately,
the KCIA is taking over.

1200
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,684
Yeonghan, let's just go.

1201
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,228
Did you fight all this time
just to end it like this, sir?

1202
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,146
You must nip them in the bud, sir.

1203
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,816
I'm sure Chief Yu has it…

1204
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:30,277
How could you make a deal
with pro-Japanese traitors, sir?

1205
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,363
I'll stop at nothing to carry out justice.

1206
