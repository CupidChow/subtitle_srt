1
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,949
Chief Detective 1958

2
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
This series is unrelated to any places,
persons, settings or events.

3
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,953
Scenes involving animals were filmed in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.

4
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,211
How strange.

5
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,132
Those things
have been circling like that for days.

6
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:56,931
Episode 9
The Vanished Female Factory Workers

7
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,863
Goodness, it's good to see
a fellow sailor on dry land.

8
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,243
Who are you with, ensign?

9
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,619
Salute!

10
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,790
I am Ensign Park Jinsoo
with the Naval Operations Staff Command.

11
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,459
Which Command?

12
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,670
The Fourth Combat Group
of the Fourth Fleet, sir!

13
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,048
The Fourth Fleet?
I know all the ensigns there.

14
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,511
However!

15
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,473
I have been transferred to
the First Combat Group of the Fifth Fleet!

16
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,058
Salute.

17
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,145
I am Ensign Seo Hojeong
of the same First Combat Group.

18
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,647
Who are you?

19
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,524
Sir?

20
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,442
You're not an officer, are you?

21
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,488
Park Jinsoo, you're a deserter
of the Fourth Combat Group.

22
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,785
Where's the property deed
you stole from Yang Sunhee?

23
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,955
Right, Sunhee's deed?

24
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,832
Well, you see…

25
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,126
Darn it.

26
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,306
Hey, you scum.

27
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,392
How could you steal her property deed
after promising to marry her?

28
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,562
Do you know how many women in Jongnam
claim you've stolen from them?

29
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,940
I didn't do anything wrong!

30
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,359
They were drawn to me first, okay?

31
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,487
It's not a crime to be loved, is it?

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,406
Oh!

33
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,078
You hurt all those women!

34
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,457
He must have been hurt.

35
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,085
That was a bit much, Gyeonghwan.

36
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,879
He's an evil punk though!

37
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,714
What you just did to him is worse.

38
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,051
That's your deed, right, Ms. Yang?

39
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,428
Thank you, Detective.

40
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,972
I wouldn't be able
to send my sibling to college

41
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,474
without this document.

42
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,644
Next time,
don't trust strangers to help you.

43
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,103
The world is dangerous.

44
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,772
All right.

45
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,191
Stay strong and be shrewd.

46
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,776
Take care then.

47
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,403
Wait, Detective.

48
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,991
I would like to welcome you all
for a meal.

49
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,285
Please come in.

50
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,955
I was getting hungry anyway.

51
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,581
We'll accept your hospitality.

52
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,708
Thank you, but we'll consider it accepted.

53
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,793
Bye then.

54
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,670
What?

55
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,588
Goodbye.

56
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,966
Come on, Yeonghan.

57
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,634
It's not like she's bribing us.

58
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,135
A meal can't hurt, can it?

59
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,888
One meal is the stepping stone to bribes.

60
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,265
You should know that.

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,690
Were you really
that desperately hungry to eat?

62
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,276
You're a shame to all detectives.

63
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,652
Never do that again.

64
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,030
And you still can't make contact?

65
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,115
Yes.

66
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,369
Welcome back.

67
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,537
Hey, Officer Bong.

68
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,705
Just a moment.

69
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,831
Come here.

70
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,376
And who might this be?

71
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,502
Hello.

72
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,256
I'm Officer Bong's friend, Lee Yangja.

73
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,590
- I see.
- Okay.

74
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,634
Is it a bring-your-friend-to-work day?

75
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,221
Actually, at the factory where she works,

76
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,391
a girl named Kim Soonjung
has gone missing.

77
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,810
Disappeared? When?

78
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,603
About two weeks ago.

79
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,856
Maybe she returned home
without telling anyone?

80
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,108
Then she would've packed her things.

81
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,236
But her belongings are all intact,
except for her.

82
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,988
Why only report this now?

83
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,906
She had reported it before,

84
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,494
but Unit 2 investigated
and closed the case.

85
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,622
It's been at 27
for about two or three days now.

86
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,750
Are you enjoying that, Detective Oh?

87
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,045
- Would you like one?
- No, have it all!

88
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,465
Never mind him. This is so good.

89
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,181
Damn it.

90
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,141
What is it now?

91
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,769
Let's see. It's right here.

92
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,938
Let's see.

93
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,151
Right, now I remember.

94
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,319
The female worker.

95
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,447
Who says she's missing?

96
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,157
She probably ran off home.

97
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,117
She didn't even pack…

98
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,079
before disappearing.

99
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,790
She must've really hated her job then.

100
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,334
It's obvious she just ran off.

101
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,836
Obvious my foot.
Can you bet your life on that?

102
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,004
Be quiet!

103
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,465
We're drowning in serious cases.

104
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,009
Who cares about some runaway?
Stop wasting time!

105
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,106
Damn it, seriously.

106
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,319
If you really think
the case is so serious,

107
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,613
then take it off my hands.

108
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,158
We're taking it now.

109
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,369
What a hothead.

110
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,540
If anything happened
to the missing factory worker,

111
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,417
then Chief Hwang,

112
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,043
I'm punching you in the face.

113
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,379
That little punk.

114
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,215
- Make that two punches.
- What?

115
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,175
- Three.
- You little…

116
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,805
What are you looking at, you punk?

117
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:15,143
Where can I get some damned respect?

118
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,354
There are more missing?

119
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,107
Soonjung is the fifth one.

120
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,233
Five went missing?

121
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,026
Since when?

122
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,945
Last October.

123
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,614
I think one went missing
nearly every month.

124
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,785
Do the missing people
have anything in common?

125
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,080
All five were pretty and kind,

126
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,000
so we've been worried sick.

127
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,043
Anything else?

128
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,213
Well, once a month,

129
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,841
we have a morning meeting at our factory.

130
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,301
The girls all disappeared

131
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,013
a day or two days after every meeting.

132
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,265
When do the meetings occur?

133
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,517
On the first of every month.

134
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,439
Dongsan Textile Co.

135
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:05,485
Is it true that five workers
have gone missing, including Kim Soonjung?

136
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,821
No, dozens have disappeared.

137
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,575
Dozens?

138
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,578
Some hated their jobs, some eloped,

139
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,371
and some just felt annoyed.

140
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,959
A handful disappear
for all kinds of reasons, you know?

141
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,588
Girls like Soonjung
who don't look half bad

142
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,049
always live up to their looks.

143
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,178
Try managing this factory for a month.

144
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,721
You'll see what I mean.

145
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,015
Have you kept
any records of the missing workers?

146
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,018
No, we got rid of them.

147
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,686
You got rid of them? Why?

148
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,397
Those girls all left
because they hated working here.

149
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,191
There's no reason to keep a record.

150
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,694
Sir, could we take a look inside?

151
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,404
What for?

152
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,325
I'm thinking of starting a factory
if I ever quit being a cop.

153
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,577
I want to know
how all those machines work.

154
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,914
Those things
are really expensive, you know?

155
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,624
All right, off you go.

156
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,085
Excuse me, ma'am.

157
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,879
I'm with the police.

158
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,674
Could I talk to you for a moment?

159
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,761
Well, sure.

160
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,845
How can I help you?

161
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,224
Could you look at me properly?

162
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,773
What happened to your face?

163
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:30,111
I slipped and fell at night.

164
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,197
I can tell apart whether a bruise

165
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,032
is from a fall

166
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,826
or from a hit.

167
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,539
Please be honest with me.

168
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,166
I'll get whoever did this to you.

169
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,839
You can't tell anyone I said this.

170
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,924
All right?

171
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,803
The plant manager did it.

172
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,600
Why did the plant manager
hit you, Boksoon?

173
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,687
He made us all pitch in
for night school fees for the girls

174
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,397
and took all the money for himself,

175
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,357
like taking candy from a child.

176
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,151
When I asked for my money back,

177
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,529
he suddenly hurled an ashtray at me.

178
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,408
Goodness, that prick is barely human.

179
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,204
Do you know if the plant manager ever hit

180
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,873
the girls who went missing?

181
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,836
That I don't really know about.

182
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,008
Then are you familiar with Kim Soonjung,
one of the missing workers?

183
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,094
Yes.

184
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,180
In fact…

185
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,142
we were close friends.

186
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,855
Did you stand around earlier

187
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,859
because you had something to tell us?

188
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,656
Soonjung and the other girls
who disappeared

189
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,618
were your colleagues and friends,
weren't they?

190
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,122
We should at least know if they're alive.

191
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,134
All right then.

192
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,139
She disappeared after that night.

193
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:27,061
On the first morning of every month,
our boss holds monthly meetings.

194
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,105
You ladies are neither field workers

195
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,898
nor maids for other families.

196
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,276
You are all proud industrial workers
of our nation.

197
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,905
Devote yourselves day and night
to our nation

198
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,490
and to his excellency, the chairman.

199
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,451
After the meeting…

200
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,954
- Hello, there.
- …he would go to the plant manager

201
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:50,292
and point out a girl
as he told him, "That one."

202
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,753
You mean after every monthly meeting?

203
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,004
Yes.

204
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,215
And then she disappeared after that night.

205
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,178
Like the other girls who were picked out
at the morning meeting.

206
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,932
What on earth did you do to your workers?

207
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,016
Damn you.

208
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,893
Was stealing their money not enough?

209
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,771
Did your boss do unspeakable things
to the girls he picked?

210
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,608
No, nothing of the sort happened.
You seem to be mistaken.

211
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,776
Shut up, you scum!

212
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,906
How dare you treat your workers
like hostesses, you filthy scum?

213
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,908
Please just don't go to my boss.

214
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,578
You detectives will regret it!

215
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,580
I'd love to find out…

216
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,583
how much I'll regret it.

217
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,084
Damn it.

218
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,502
Hold on, wait.

219
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,799
What on earth?

220
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,719
- We're from Jongnam Police Station.
- Jongnam Station?

221
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,263
Did you forget to bribe them?

222
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,934
Hey, did you leave your manners at home?
You little prick.

223
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,519
Answer me this.

224
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,482
Did you pick out a worker
at every monthly morning meeting?

225
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,611
Sir! They didn't hear that from me!

226
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,323
That's news to me.

227
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,074
Where are the girls you picked?

228
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,410
Why did they disappear the next day?

229
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,580
Who was your senior superintendent again?

230
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,374
He obviously failed
to educate his subordinates.

231
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,377
I'm going to ask one more time.

232
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,713
What did you do with the workers?

233
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,175
I told you I don't know, you moron!

234
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,885
You punk!

235
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,348
- Damn it!
- Detective Seo?

236
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,933
Let go, you prick!

237
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,435
You're all dead!

238
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,605
You're under arrest for abducting
the missing female workers

239
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,524
plus assaulting officers.

240
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,152
Do you know who I am?

241
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,656
- Are you sure about this?
- Let's go.

242
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,915
- Right now?
- Yes, sir.

243
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,919
- Wait for me downstairs.
- Yes, sir.

244
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,885
It's time.

245
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,061
Do you remember…

246
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,940
what you told us last time?

247
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,526
Yes, I remember that I offered to help

248
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,902
- if you ever need--
- Well…

249
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,530
we need you now.

250
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,699
- Senior Superintendent.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,743
We made a little mess.

252
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,497
More accurately,
it wasn't us that made the mess.

253
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,833
This little boy here did.

254
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,421
If the mess is a serious one,

255
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,464
would it be hard to cover up?

256
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,135
No, sir! Whatever it is,
I'll bury it with absolute secrecy.

257
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,138
You don't even know what the mess is.

258
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,724
It could be any mess in the world.

259
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,351
My only priority
is all of your well-being.

260
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,062
- Please speak freely.
- Senior Superintendent.

261
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,148
- Yes?
- I'm someone…

262
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,234
who always repays my debts.

263
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,654
Tell me if there's anything you want.

264
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,783
I have absolutely no personal desires.

265
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,493
Come on.

266
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,578
However…

267
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,540
there is a corrupt official

268
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,377
at the National Police

269
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,673
who treats Jongnam Police Station
like his personal servant.

270
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,134
You're a true patriot, aren't you?

271
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,178
Very much so, sir.

272
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,388
Corrupt National Police officials?

273
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,725
My father despises people like them.

274
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,936
Could you get rid of him?

275
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,897
Who is it?

276
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,024
It's Deputy Director Choi Dalsik…

277
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,319
of Department 2 of the National Police.

278
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,322
Let's do this.

279
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,915
The youngest of the Kwangho Corporation?

280
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,584
"Learning management
at subsidiary Dongsan Textiles."

281
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,462
Yes. He has something to do
with the missing workers, sir.

282
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,506
Hey! Where's Park Yeonghan?

283
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,300
Come here, you punk.

284
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,427
- You worthless prick!
- Sir!

285
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,471
- Senior Superintendent Baek!
- Please stop, sir!

286
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,931
- Let go!
- Sir!

287
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,432
- Let me go!
- Talk it out, sir.

288
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,186
How dare you go sniffing around
a valuable business with no proof?

289
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,939
If it's Dongsan you're referring to,

290
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,316
I wouldn't call it valuable, sir.

291
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,736
Dongsan's parent company
is Kwangho Corporation,

292
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,698
a patriotic company
aiding the revolutionary reconstruction!

293
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,200
How dare you blabber
when you don't even know its value?

294
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,286
In what world
does a cop help out a suspect?

295
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,579
You punk!

296
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,624
- Come here!
- Sir, please use your words.

297
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,626
- Don't touch me.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,711
Where is he?

299
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,256
My apologies. I'm sorry, sir.

300
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,841
Chief Hwang.

301
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,093
- Yes, sir?
- Get these cuffs off him right now.

302
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,387
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, hurry.

303
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,305
Here. Here's the key.

304
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,183
This is just how it was four years ago.

305
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,519
Wouldn't you say, Chief Hwang?

306
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,647
- What?
- Don't you remember

307
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,733
when Senior Superintendent Choi
got paid off by Lee Jungjae

308
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,568
and had you free
all of his little minions?

309
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,652
Have you forgotten?

310
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,030
Actually, I do remember.

311
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,573
- Hurry, you punk.
- Yes, sir.

312
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,034
Be gentle with his wrists, will you?

313
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,036
I hope you head home safely.

314
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,748
- Yeonghan.
- It's fine, Detective Kim.

315
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,585
If this is a repeat of four years ago,

316
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,921
we'll end up catching the bad guy again,
don't you think?

317
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,427
We'll get the bad guy for sure.

318
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,182
If you punks ever cause trouble
with this case again,

319
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,226
I'm going to get you all fired.
Do you understand?

320
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,394
Yes, sir!

321
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,774
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

322
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,109
- No need to thank me. My apologies.
- No, I'm sorry.

323
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,403
- Please come this way.
- Open the door for them.

324
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,405
This way, please.

325
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,077
- Are you okay, Yeonghan?
- I'm fine.

326
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,538
Isn't it enough proof
that he's covering for the suspect?

327
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,540
- That has to mean something.
- Exactly.

328
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,043
Do we continue our investigation?

329
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,754
Yes, it's business as usual for us.

330
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,839
Chief Yu.

331
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,301
A body was found at the bottom of a cliff
at Ogeum Mountain.

332
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,886
- What?
- But the victim

333
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,347
has a Dongsan Textiles uniform on.

334
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,859
Kim Soonjung

335
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,196
It's Kim Soonjung.

336
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,826
I hoped she'd be alive.

337
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,079
Her uniform is still on her,

338
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,664
which means she couldn't even go home.

339
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,749
That prick Kwon Hyunggeun did this!

340
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,793
- That damned--
- Let's keep our cool.

341
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,796
We gather evidence first.

342
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,841
Sir.

343
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,093
How did you find the body?

344
00:18:56,718 --> 00:19:01,265
I come here
to gather medicinal herbs every day.

345
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,768
For 15 days straight,

346
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,980
I noticed crows circling above.

347
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,775
How strange.

348
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:16,071
Those things
have been circling like that for days.

349
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,408
I thought it was bizarre,

350
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,078
so I looked down to see
if there was anything there.

351
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,331
Fortunately,
the body is in good condition,

352
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,709
considering all the wild animals
around here.

353
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,961
I found that quite strange too.

354
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,299
A deer alone would be completely ravaged
by wild animals and crows

355
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,051
within two short days.

356
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,028
What in the world is with her makeup?

357
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,988
It doesn't seem ordinary,

358
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,615
almost like a geisha look.

359
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,618
How could that crazy scumbag
do this to her face?

360
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,793
The cold temperatures
have prevented almost any decomposition.

361
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,088
I estimate her day of death
to be about 15 days ago.

362
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,675
That's about
when their morning meeting was held.

363
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,762
It lines up
with when she was reported missing.

364
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,389
I also see signs of sexual violence.

365
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,517
And she has choke marks,

366
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,811
but it doesn't seem like
she was choked severely.

367
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,565
Also, do you see the bits of flesh
under her fingernails?

368
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,734
Are those from her resisting?

369
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,486
Yes, that's right.

370
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,822
We can assume her attacker
would have deep cuts on his body.

371
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,492
Furthermore,

372
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,827
she was dead
long before falling off the cliff.

373
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,249
Right, and take a look here.

374
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,293
Do you see
the two lacerations on her head here?

375
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,547
Normally, wounds that are caused by a fall

376
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,300
are not regular
in terms of shape and direction like this.

377
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:05,347
It's very likely that these wounds
are the cause of her death.

378
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,433
Namely, head trauma due to external force.

379
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,646
So she was beaten to death?

380
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,731
Yes.

381
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,113
After assaulting and murdering her…

382
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,825
she was…

383
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,454
…thrown off the cliff.

384
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,625
Also, there are

385
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,585
signs of vomiting.

386
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,631
Wait, there's something in her mouth.

387
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,224
It looks like a piece of pineapple.

388
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,478
It's not that she didn't chew.

389
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,897
She may not have been able to chew.

390
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,948
I also see injection marks on her arm.

391
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,536
I doubt these are ordinary shots.

392
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,872
Opium?

393
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,876
According to the medical examiner,
they were typical opium injection marks.

394
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,586
Why would a young girl do opium?

395
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,339
They must have forced it on her
just like the pineapple.

396
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,091
Pineapples and opium
are the rich man's vices.

397
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,010
Therefore, Kwon Hyunggeun
has to be the culprit.

398
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,470
To tie him down,

399
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,972
we'll need to find his opium dealer first.

400
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,475
Do you know any dealers?

401
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,519
I'll ask some detectives
in charge of drug crimes.

402
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,064
For now, take a look at this.

403
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,525
It's Kwon Hyunggeun's schedule
early this month.

404
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,861
He is referred to
as one of the four scions of Jongnam.

405
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,907
Kwangho Corporation owns a tennis court,
and the four scions meet there often.

406
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,742
They played tennis there
early this month too.

407
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,995
"Tennis Boys Club."
Are they Kwon Hyunggeun's friends?

408
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,706
Yes, their fathers
are all men in high places.

409
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,708
President of Kwangho Corporation.

410
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,293
Brigadier General
of the Army Headquarters.

411
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,212
Head of the Korean Central
Intelligence Agency.

412
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,756
Deputy minister
of the chairman of the Supreme Council.

413
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,550
So that's why he left his manners at home,
that little prick.

414
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,428
There's a chance they were together
during the crime early this month.

415
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,097
Surely, since they're best friends.

416
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,724
But isn't the deputy minister
the right-hand man of the chairman?

417
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,893
The head of the KCIA
is also a notable seat.

418
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,937
Why does any of that matter?

419
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,022
We just need to catch the criminals.

420
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,400
Who on earth are they?

421
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,859
The Jongnam Police Station scum.

422
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,195
Ah.

423
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,698
You're right.
We're the scum of Jongnam Police Station.

424
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,575
We kindly ask for your cooperation.

425
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,411
Kindly, we refuse.

426
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,915
A Dongsan Textiles worker
who went missing early this month

427
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,084
was found dead
with signs of sexual violence.

428
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,253
Our prime suspect…

429
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,505
is you, Kwon Hyunggeun.

430
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,466
And the rest of you were with him
on the day of the crime…

431
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,761
as can be seen in this news article.

432
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,473
Now, once I say, "Ready, set, go,"

433
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,725
you answer our questions.

434
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,810
Ready, set, go.

435
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,647
What did you all do that night
after playing tennis?

436
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,524
We drank that night

437
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,985
as we always do after matches.

438
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,445
Where did you drink?

439
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,155
At Mokryeongak. Why?

440
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,158
I hardly doubt
you punks even know where that is.

441
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,826
We've been there.

442
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,663
It's where corrupt officials and soldiers,
pro-Japanese traitors,

443
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:21,084
and spoiled kids with powerful dads
all gather.

444
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,463
- You little--
- Stop whining and pull up your sleeve.

445
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,547
What?

446
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,133
You better watch your place, you prick.

447
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,719
Hey, hey. Calm down, man.

448
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,681
Pull up your sleeve now, Kwon Hyunggeun.

449
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,435
Well, I don't want my friend to do it.

450
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,188
I'll be nice to you.

451
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,064
If you all leave now,

452
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,359
I'll let you boys keep your jobs.

453
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,529
If I get fired,
I'll learn how to sing for money.

454
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,906
By the way,

455
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,658
I see wounds on your neck.

456
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,912
Did you tussle with someone?

457
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,080
Well…

458
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:03,293
…I have a cat that's just
as hot-headed as you back home.

459
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,545
That little thing just…

460
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,341
Goodness, what a scary cat.

461
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,760
Here's the thing.

462
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,305
Your wounds are quite deep,

463
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,140
almost as if a person cut you.

464
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,226
If you bother us again,

465
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,978
getting fired won't be
the worst of the consequences.

466
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,940
It's time for us to leave. Goodbye.

467
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,415
There may just be two culprits,
not just one.

468
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,502
Maybe even all four.

469
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,671
The wounds on No Yoonhak's neck

470
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,839
explain the flesh
under Kim Soonjung's fingernails.

471
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,426
Kwon Hyunggeun wasn't alone.
I'm certain all four did it together.

472
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,428
Have you talked
to the drug crime detectives?

473
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,766
Once they heard the names of those boys,
they begged me not to involve them.

474
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,268
That's ridiculous, sir.

475
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,812
Those pricks are nothing!

476
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,898
If the other missing female workers
experienced the same fate…

477
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,151
then they may have all died already.

478
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,612
That's highly likely.

479
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,199
Let's arrest them for questioning

480
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,534
and get their confession too.

481
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,078
Arresting them won't be enough.

482
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,539
We need solid evidence.

483
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,544
Welcome.

484
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:29,671
Please come in.

485
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,506
We're from Jongnam Police Station.

486
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,883
What's the matter?

487
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,221
I'm the owner here.

488
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,515
Welcome, Detectives.

489
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,517
Please come this way.

490
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,110
Please have a seat.

491
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,820
All right.

492
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,156
We're not here to drink.

493
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,700
That's what they all say at first.

494
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,285
Once drunk,

495
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,537
they tend to be more honest
about what they want.

496
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,873
Then let's pretend I'm already drunk.

497
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,708
What I want now…

498
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,045
is your testimony
about a suspect in a murder.

499
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,217
Yes. Early this month,

500
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,179
all four of them came here
after their tennis match.

501
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,139
Do they only visit early every month?

502
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,809
No, they come here often at all times.

503
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,062
How long did they drink that night?

504
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,605
If my memory serves right,

505
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,691
all four arrived early in the evening

506
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,401
and left early the next morning.

507
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,321
Goodness. Those young punks
have a lot of life in them.

508
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,490
Are you sure?

509
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,408
Yes.

510
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:45,747
But may I ask who was murdered
and who the suspect is?

511
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,375
A female worker
at Kwon Hyunggeun's factory

512
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,960
was discovered murdered.

513
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:56,132
The victim had only just turned 20.

514
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,679
Do you know if Kwon Hyunggeun

515
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,222
ever took opium here

516
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,516
or physically abused your employees?

517
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,685
No, never.

518
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,395
Can you guarantee it?

519
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,898
Yes, I can.

520
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,026
What did I tell you, Yeonghan?

521
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,487
I knew she'd feign ignorance.

522
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,491
I have told you the truth
and only the truth.

523
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,577
I had low expectations coming here anyway.

524
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,954
After all, this place

525
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,581
is the notorious Mokryeongak,

526
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:33,336
where conscience and truth
are checked at the door.

527
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,840
I do have a conscience.

528
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,552
It's how I know
how to live like a decent human being.

529
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,721
Well, having a conscience…

530
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,807
is not only about being kind.

531
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,226
Conscience, at times,

532
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:52,605
is equivalent to the testimonies
of thousands and millions of people.

533
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,026
Thank you for your cooperation.

534
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,822
- Let's go.
- All right.

535
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,667
Detectives!

536
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,838
You're the stolen property deed victim.

537
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,047
What brings you here?

538
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,884
Why else would we be here
but to investigate?

539
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,136
Is your sibling's preparation for college
going well?

540
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,973
I guess,
but it seems to be very difficult.

541
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,141
I see.

542
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,477
In that case,

543
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,854
drop by the Jongnam Bookstore sometime

544
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,731
and look for
an entrance examination guide.

545
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,815
It should help.

546
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,025
I see.

547
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,279
Detective Park's wife runs that bookstore.

548
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,240
Really? Is that so?

549
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,284
I'll make sure to relay your message.

550
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,119
Right.

551
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,371
Please stay for dinner tonight.

552
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,957
Thank you, but we'll have to refuse again.

553
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,042
Goodbye then.

554
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,299
One meal is the stepping stone to bribes.

555
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,134
You should know that.

556
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,348
So he's already taken.

557
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,893
I'd get hitched in an instant
to a man like that.

558
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,853
Do you know them?

559
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,480
Yes, ma'am.

560
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,483
Those detectives helped me
get my property deed back.

561
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,529
They're not like the other detectives.

562
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,535
It makes sense that
Mokryeongak's owner would keep silent.

563
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,370
Or else, she'd have to close the shop.

564
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,040
Couldn't we question the girls
who work for her separately?

565
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,084
They'll be less willing to talk.

566
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,753
Imagine how scared they are
of those scions.

567
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,879
Jeez.

568
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,299
It's complete crap
that the world has changed completely.

569
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,301
There's absolutely nothing that's changed!

570
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,720
Chief Yu.

571
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,015
Yes?

572
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,351
Who are they?

573
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,190
This is Kim Soonjung's mother
and her siblings.

574
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:13,454
I heard I could find out here
where my daughter is.

575
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,167
Could you tell me where she might be?

576
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,156
My dear Soonjung was an angel.

577
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,827
Even as a little girl,
she would help me plow the fields

578
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,829
and sew for money.

579
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,665
She helped me raise her siblings.

580
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:03,129
She also sent us
every penny she earned at the factory.

581
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,887
She died because of me.

582
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,139
If only…

583
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,435
I had never sent her to Seoul to work.

584
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,773
Soonjung.

585
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,401
It's not your fault, ma'am.

586
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,821
If only I hadn't been sick…

587
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,159
If only I'd been a better mother…

588
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,286
I promise you this, ma'am.

589
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,164
I will catch the culprits…

590
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,710
so that your daughter may rest in peace.

591
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,013
All right!

592
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,766
The score is 30 to 15.

593
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,850
Good move.

594
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,440
Mine, mine!

595
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,152
Oh!

596
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,530
That's mine! It's mine!

597
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:11,948
Mine!

598
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,491
Damn it.

599
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,576
That's hilarious.

600
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,453
Are you okay, sir?

601
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,247
Jeez.

602
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,753
Come here.

603
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,756
- Hey, you prick.
- I'm so sorry.

604
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,882
Was that on purpose?

605
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:30,967
No, sir. Not at all.

606
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,219
- You made me trip on purpose.
- I'm sorry, sir.

607
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,096
- Calm down.
- Come here, you prick.

608
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,140
- He messed with me!
- Come on.

609
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,766
- No, he didn't.
- Hey!

610
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,435
- You little prick.
- Jeez.

611
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,520
- Let go of me!
- Are you okay?

612
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:48,401
Were you trying
to trip him up on purpose, Kim?

613
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,319
- No, I--
- I'm sorry.

614
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,822
- He's not used to such intense matches.
- Yes?

615
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,241
- I see.
- I'm sorry.

616
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,660
Is that so? Is that so?

617
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,829
I asked him, not you.

618
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,333
I'm sorry I didn't play fair.
It's all my fault.

619
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,801
Sorry about that.

620
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,470
I had to do it to calm him down.

621
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,972
I'm sorry. Yoonhak, come here.

622
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,808
- Was that enough?
- Enough, my foot.

623
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,188
Good match, guys.

624
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,984
Go on, take it.

625
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,697
Let's forget about today.

626
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,699
Got it?

627
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,619
- Yes.
- Yes.

628
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,500
I'm still so pissed off.

629
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,752
Damn it.

630
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,671
Screw this.

631
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,175
The more I think about it,
the more I'm ticked off.

632
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,968
What was that punk's name?

633
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,929
Kim Sunghoon, I think.

634
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,847
I want that prick dead.

635
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,932
Yoonhak.

636
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,683
You need to tone it down.

637
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,060
Tone what down?

638
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,646
If you don't,
people will start talking about you.

639
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,524
So? Are you embarrassed of me?

640
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,819
That's not it.

641
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,530
I'm worried you'll damage
your father's reputation.

642
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,157
My father's reputation?

643
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,248
The real damage…

644
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,167
is what you're inflicting on us.

645
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,169
I get what you mean…

646
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,505
but you all won't be affected.

647
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,798
You can't guarantee that.

648
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,801
- You can't--
- Come on.

649
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:37,885
- That's enough.
- Cut it out.

650
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,804
Don't tell me what to do. Hey.

651
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,848
You brought the cops to us.

652
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,516
It's because of you

653
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,102
they asked about the wounds on my neck.

654
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,311
Wouldn't you say

655
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,856
you're causing a lot of damage?

656
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:50,940
I'm sorry.

657
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,609
My life's been a pain lately
because of you.

658
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,653
The cops keep sniffing around.

659
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:57,947
Listen.

660
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,408
From now on,

661
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,744
don't you ever whine or get cocky with us.

662
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,288
If you do…

663
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,918
I'm telling the whole world

664
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,337
how much of a nutcase you are.

665
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,422
Whatever.

666
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,465
Let's all go drink, okay?

667
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,176
- Sounds good.
- Let's go.

668
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,260
Let it go, man.

669
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,306
I'm sorry, Yoonhak.

670
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,434
I hope this can make up for what I did.

671
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,852
Isn't this Mezcal?

672
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,645
How did you get your hands on this?

673
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,816
All right. Let's all pop that bottle then.

674
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,861
I actually have to head back home.

675
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,448
Come on, just come with us.

676
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,783
Whatever, don't try to convince him.

677
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,662
- Let's go.
- All right, see you.

678
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,249
Okay.

679
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,460
We'll drink together next time.

680
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,836
Yeah? Sounds good?

681
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,088
I'll head out then.

682
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,466
The cops haven't come for me yet,
so don't worry.

683
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,051
See you later.

684
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:03,387
Could you calm Yoonhak down for me?

685
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,057
I got you, man. Take care.

686
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,527
Thank you.

687
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,112
See you next time.

688
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,032
Welcome…

689
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,789
How may I help you?

690
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,628
Are you Detective Park Yeonghan's wife?

691
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,880
Yes, and?

692
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,549
I need to speak to him

693
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,678
regarding a case he's investigating.

694
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,514
Could you have him come here?

695
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,600
It's been a while
since I've been to a bookstore.

696
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,937
I doubt you're here to buy a book.

697
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,190
I would like to be
just as honest as the books

698
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,235
that fill up these shelves,
at least for today.

699
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,070
Have you changed your mind?

700
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,656
Yes, I tend to blow hot and cold.

701
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,950
What would you like to know?

702
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,538
Have Kwon Hyunggeun, Nam Junggil,
No Yoonhak and Jung Heesung

703
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,084
ever taken opium or assaulted anyone
at Mokryeongak?

704
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,921
Yes, they've taken part
in both opium and violence.

705
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,968
To be specific,
only Nam Junggil took opium.

706
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,763
But the worst out of the whole bunch…

707
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,974
was Jung Heesung.

708
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,310
Excuse my language,

709
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,020
but he was a rotten scumbag.

710
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,439
Come on, let's show them.

711
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,940
- Let's show them.
- Come on.

712
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,358
- Please, that's enough.
- Damn you.

713
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,986
My girls were victims…

714
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,070
That's enough?

715
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,573
…of his unspeakable acts.

716
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,785
Don't tell me what to do.

717
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,829
He beat them frequently

718
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,831
and even choked one girl.

719
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,042
- Was it just Jung Heesung?
- Yes.

720
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,211
Youngwol. Youngwol!

721
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,088
- He didn't look like it…
- Look at me.

722
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,424
- …but he was nothing more than a beast.
- Come on, look.

723
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,842
Your makeup is running!

724
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,263
Yet the other three
deserve no credit for watching

725
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,514
and enjoying his antics.

726
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,351
Come on, your makeup's ruined.

727
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,685
Look at me.

728
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,020
You little…

729
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,107
Look here!

730
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,444
One day, the violence subsided,

731
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,279
and they started leaving earlier.

732
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,448
When did that start?

733
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,158
About four or five months ago.

734
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,079
Early this month,
they didn't call my girls, simply drank,

735
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,705
and left early.

736
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,832
What counts as early?

737
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,501
About eight at night.

738
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,754
Where they went drunk after

739
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,714
could be the scene of the crime.

740
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,928
Would you like to see
how much my girls have suffered…

741
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,680
until now?

742
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,194
This picture…

743
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,698
This is the same makeup
Kim Soonjung had on when she died.

744
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,872
How did you get this picture?

745
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,916
Hey!

746
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,835
Hey, look at this!

747
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,086
Give me one!

748
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,463
This is a work of art, man.

749
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,758
After putting my girls through abuse,

750
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,969
they took pictures as mementos.

751
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,846
- These are nice.
- You keep this one.

752
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,306
They seemed so proud of them,

753
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,392
so I snuck one to keep.

754
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,770
Why did you sneak one for yourself?

755
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,689
I was hoping for a chance

756
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,608
to screw over those rotten scum,

757
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,694
like today.

758
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,071
What's this makeup?

759
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,490
I heard it's an ancient Japanese makeup.

760
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:55,494
It's said to symbolize obedience
and loyalty to one's husband.

761
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,913
Those punks are unbelievable.

762
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,082
This is all the evidence we need.

763
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,208
Let's get them right now.

764
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,668
Once the culprits are arrested,

765
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,753
you and Mokryeongak…

766
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,465
may suffer greatly.

767
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,800
Don't worry about me.

768
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,970
I'll find a way to evade harm.

769
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,763
Just promise…

770
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,016
to bring them to justice.

771
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,979
We're going to arrest those punks today,
no matter what.

772
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:25,983
If they resist,
use any and all force necessary.

773
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,651
Yes, sir.

774
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,195
What does he think we are?

775
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,696
A bottle isn't going to make us
feel better.

776
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,073
You did well, Yoonhak.

777
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,451
That punk thinks he can walk over us
because of his father.

778
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,495
We need to step on him early on.

779
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,788
Who knows what that nutcase might do?

780
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,791
Next time,
we need to use violence, not words.

781
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,876
We'll show him.

782
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,336
That sounds good.

783
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,171
Arrogant little punk.

784
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:50,758
I'm telling you,
that scum needs to be put in his place.

785
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,447
First, go straight ahead
to Godong Intersection.

786
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,366
We'll take a squad of officers

787
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,701
to the scions' houses
and arrest them immediately.

788
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,286
Understood.

789
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,458
Wait, there seems to have been
an accident.

790
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,254
That's one heck of an accident.

791
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,422
Pull up next to it, will you?

792
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,973
- Salute!
- Officer Nam.

793
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,017
How are the victims?

794
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,020
It seems they were killed instantly, sir.

795
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,981
Damn.

796
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,919
Come over here, boys!

797
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,886
Aren't they Kwon Hyunggeun,
No Yoonhak and Nam Junggil?

798
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,186
Seoul Resident Identification Card

799
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,480
Kwon Hyunggeun

800
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,898
It's Kwon Hyunggeun.

801
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,109
Why are these punks here like this?

802
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,361
Who hit them?

803
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,406
They were gone by the time we arrived.

804
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,659
A classic hit-and-run.

805
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:42,995
Wait a minute.

806
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,789
Why just the three of them?

807
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,042
They were the only victims at the scene.

808
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,253
Jung Heesung is missing.

809
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,130
Damn it.

810
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,888
Wait, Nam Junggil is conscious!

811
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,181
Bring me a stretcher!

812
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,474
Take him to the hospital!

813
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,571
It reeks of booze in here.

814
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,996
I'll go and arrest Jung Heesung.

815
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,164
No, not yet.

816
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,166
Why not? We should take him in now.

817
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,210
We need more definite evidence.

818
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,053
Yeonghan.

819
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,138
I found this.

820
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,061
It's opium.

821
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,855
Were there any syringes inside?

822
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,066
No, I couldn't find any.

823
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,489
So they only had opium in the car.

824
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,244
They even did opium?

825
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,288
Which ones had injection marks?

826
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,249
Only Nam Junggil had them, sir.

827
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,126
Kwon Hyunggeun and No Yoonhak were clean.

828
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,337
- And we need to look into Jung Heesung?
- That's right.

829
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,923
Nam Junggil injected Kim Soonjung
with opium,

830
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,425
causing her to lose consciousness.

831
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,343
Then those four violated her.

832
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,012
Goodness, those rotten scum.

833
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,849
The heavens must've punished them
with that car accident.

834
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,934
I shouldn't say this as a cop,

835
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,145
but all of them deserve to die.

836
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,941
But how come Jung Heesung
wasn't punished with the accident?

837
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,317
Why wasn't he

838
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,403
in the car with the rest?

839
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,321
What if

840
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:45,492
he tried to get rid of the other three

841
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,370
to save his own neck?

842
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,874
Eliminating his accomplices
to save himself?

843
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,376
What's your basis for that?

844
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,755
Firstly, Jung Heesung's background
makes it easy for him to do such a thing.

845
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,047
That's right.

846
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,050
His dad is the deputy minister
of the Supreme Council's chairman.

847
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,636
Secondly, the truck's tire tracks.

848
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,763
The tire tracks?

849
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,265
There weren't any signs of braking
at the scene.

850
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,144
If the driver had braked,
there would have been tire tracks.

851
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,313
What if the driver of the truck

852
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,441
had accidentally slammed on the gas?

853
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,027
That's plausible.

854
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,571
But my third point
is the direction of the crash.

855
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,991
It's human instinct

856
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,869
to turn the steering wheel
when they hit something.

857
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,372
But the driver
never once turned the wheel.

858
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,166
Assuming you're right…

859
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,629
do you really think
he'd go this far to save himself?

860
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,506
He has too much to lose,

861
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,424
both himself and his father.

862
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,176
They'd lose everything.

863
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,762
But didn't Nam Junggil survive the crash?

864
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,223
Yes, he's at Jongnam Hospital.

865
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,892
Wait a minute.

866
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:57,022
He's the lone survivor
of an attempt to kill all three.

867
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,442
This is dangerous.

868
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,319
Something bad is about to happen.

869
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,655
- What do you mean?
- Detective Park.

870
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,114
Let's go. Hurry up!

871
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,699
Detective Seo.

872
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,784
We'll be back.

873
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,621
Be careful out there, boys.

874
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:22,214
It's me, Father.

875
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,132
Come in.

876
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,938
I'll go visit Junggil at the hospital.

877
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,817
Come and have a seat.

878
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,286
Send my regards
to Junggil's father and his family.

879
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,371
They must be heartbroken.

880
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,039
Of course, Father.

881
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,711
Let me ask you something.

882
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,715
Were you truly just fortunate?

883
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,387
Two dead in a car accident
at Jongnam Intersection

884
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,057
It's not that I was fortunate.

885
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,271
I simply decided to distance myself
from my immature friends.

886
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,739
Look who it is!

887
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,284
We meet again, Jung Heesung.

888
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:34,995
Who are they?

889
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,292
I'll handle this, Mother.

890
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,044
Please go ahead and eat.

891
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,973
What are you doing here?

892
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,810
Are cops allowed
to cause scenes like this at hospitals?

893
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,855
Of course cops can't do that.

894
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,315
Think of all the patients.

895
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,442
That's why we were waiting,

896
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,569
quietly and politely.

897
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,076
We need to see Nam Junggil, the victim.

898
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,163
I was shocked upon arriving at the scene.

899
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,501
It's unfortunate he suffered this fate
after he was named a suspect.

900
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,252
Don't push your luck.

901
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,256
I'll answer your questions
once Junggil wakes up.

902
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,384
You know what's strange?

903
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:34,596
Weren't you with them
up until the car accident?

904
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,807
And yet you weren't in the car.

905
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,891
That's right.

906
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,061
They invited me to come for a drink…

907
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,816
…but I was tired and went home.

908
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,734
What time did you part ways?

909
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,987
It was almost seven.

910
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,571
Are you sure you went straight home?

911
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,990
Do you have anyone to vouch for you?

912
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,996
What exactly are you inferring?

913
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,831
Are you suspecting I did this?

914
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,624
There's no reason not to.

915
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:07,504
Three out of four suspects
and witnesses to a murder are dead

916
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:08,714
except for you.

917
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,549
Though to be accurate,

918
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,218
one still has his breath on him.

919
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,012
Are you out of your mind?

920
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,805
Are you accusing me

921
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,307
of running over them with a car?

922
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:23,061
All four of you treated women like trash.

923
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,566
But you were the worst of the lot,
so you ended up killing Kim Soonjung

924
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,570
and got rid of the other three
in case they stabbed you in the back.

925
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,698
Would you like to prove me wrong?

926
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,367
Accusing someone of murder with no proof
sounds natural to you.

927
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,454
What's next, torture?

928
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,081
Wait a minute.

929
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,959
Could this count as torture?

930
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,638
How do you like it?

931
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,477
You recognize this, don't you?

932
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,270
That's enough. Get out.

933
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:07,481
What's scaring you so much?

934
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:12,444
Why are you staying in this room
like a dog that has to take a crap?

935
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,697
I told you to get lost.

936
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,619
Why? Are you worried
Nam Junggil is going to wake up…

937
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,998
and tell everyone that you're the killer?

938
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,084
I said, get out!

939
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,712
Are you all right, sir?

940
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,381
Whoa, we were on our way out.

941
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,884
We'll see you next time then.

942
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,847
We're leaving.

943
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,562
You have to stay still.

944
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,564
We'll make you pretty.

945
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,654
Eat it.

946
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,489
Look, look at me.

947
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,783
Go easy on her, man.

948
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,203
What's wrong?
Come on, look at me.

949
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,123
I said, look at me.

950
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,214
- Hey, man!
- Hey, stop!

951
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,632
Stop it, you crazy punk!

952
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,160
Jongnam Hospital

953
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,244
Did you notice?

954
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,873
He was shocked to see the cigarette case.

955
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,749
Let's get a warrant for his arrest.

956
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,669
Would we be able to? He's Jung Heesung.

957
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,380
You're right.
Getting a warrant won't be easy.

958
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,132
Can we just leave him there like that?

959
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,554
We'll have someone keep watch.

960
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,097
Someone sharp.

961
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,766
VIP Room

962
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,201
Hey, put this away.

963
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,475
What happened?

964
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,810
I thought you'd handle it.

965
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,314
It's being handled, sir.

966
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,149
- There won't be--
- Damn it!

967
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,153
Please calm down.

968
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,947
They found the opium.

969
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,242
How could there be no problem?

970
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,411
I have to say,

971
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,624
drug possession is making it
a little harder for me.

972
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,835
Are you saying I'm at fault here?

973
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,506
Definitely not, sir.

974
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,926
But I have Park Yeonghan under control…

975
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,971
so you may rest easy.

976
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,348
You better make sure…

977
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,060
I never see those pricks again.

978
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,645
Yes, sir.

979
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,523
As you wish.

980
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,280
Sorry for blowing up at you.

981
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,326
It's quite all right.

982
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,054
- Senior Superintendent Baek.
- Yes, sir?

983
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,569
Throw this out for me, will you?

984
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,031
Surely, I will.

985
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,703
- Look, you punk.
- You…

986
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:34,581
How do you never change?

987
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:35,790
You little prick.

988
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,376
I'm cleaning up your damned mess.

989
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,755
You should be grateful, you punk.
Try saying, "Thank you."

990
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,175
- Let go, you prick!
- Heesung.

991
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:47,010
Aren't you excited to see what happens…

992
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,138
when Junggil finally wakes up?

993
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,723
Aren't you?

994
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,059
Listen to me, you punk.

995
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:58,313
You and your father's lives
are under my thumb now.

996
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,649
Don't ever tell me what to do, all right?

997
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,821
You better kiss my feet from now on.

998
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:11,242
After the accident
at the Jongnam Intersection,

999
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,578
two victims died on the spot

1000
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:18,166
and the remaining victim
is currently in critical condition.

1001
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,834
Who hit the victims?

1002
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:23,755
It was a truck driver
with a similar previous conviction.

1003
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,678
Just do as you're told.

1004
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,305
Yes, sir.

1005
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:37,560
He committed the hit-and-run while drunk
and turned himself in two days later.

1006
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,646
Currently, he's in a remorseful state

1007
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:43,858
and has apologized sincerely
to the victims' families.

1008
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,819
What are the families' thoughts?

1009
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,405
- The families--
- Is it true

1010
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,907
that drugs were found in the victims' car?

1011
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,910
- They found drugs?
- Really?

1012
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,495
Who do you work for?

1013
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,249
Rumors say it was salt, not drugs.
Can you confirm that?

1014
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,793
Apparently, the victims
had a taste for salty food.

1015
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,420
Yes, you're correct.

1016
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:06,047
Not a single ounce of drugs was found.

1017
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,425
It was just quality salt!

1018
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:13,138
Allegations that the victims
of the accident at Jongnam Intersection

1019
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:17,058
were in possession of opium have been
proven wrong after it was revealed

1020
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:20,562
that the items in question
were not opium but salt.

1021
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:24,107
The victims, known to be mindful
of their health habits,

1022
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:27,819
- would carry salt with them at all times…
- Salt? Bring me that damned radio!

1023
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,071
Please calm down.
The messenger isn't at fault.

1024
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,075
Do they seriously take us for fools?

1025
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,661
Salt? Closed case? Jeez!

1026
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:39,873
What do they mean,
the truck driver confessed?

1027
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,708
It isn't Jung Heesung, is it?

1028
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:46,588
We'll need to get not only Jung Heesung
but also his accomplice now.

1029
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,673
Who do you mean by that?

1030
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,633
Senior Superintendent Baek.

1031
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,181
He got the press together
and announced it was salt

1032
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,433
and somehow got the driver to confess.

1033
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,394
It's clear
he's thought this whole thing out.

1034
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:07,150
It's common knowledge
he's protecting the four scions.

1035
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:11,529
But this isn't simply him
sucking up to the powerful.

1036
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,366
He's deliberately burying the crime
and fabricating lies.

1037
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,871
That punk is truly the worst
out of all of them.

1038
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,664
Chief Yu.

1039
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,001
Innocent people will die
if we leave him to his devices,

1040
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,794
just as it did in the past.

1041
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,261
Gather up.

1042
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,933
Effective immediately,
Baek Doseok is a suspect and accomplice.

1043
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:43,186
But we'll keep this to ourselves.

1044
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,270
All right.

1045
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,231
Let's get him locked up
for good this time.

1046
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,315
Yes, sir.

1047
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,318
- Hey, you.
- Yes?

1048
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,945
You better watch out.

1049
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,821
- For who?
- Me, you punk.

1050
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:54,906
Got it.

1051
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,325
- Let's go.
- All right.

1052
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:01,454
Where do we start?

1053
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,791
We go to the hospital first.

1054
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:05,875
All right.

1055
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,169
- You may not pass.
- Why not?

1056
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,462
- Take another path.
- I can't pass by?

1057
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,130
- No.
- Are you serious?

1058
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,215
What's going on?

1059
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,435
May I ask what you're here for?

1060
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:28,606
What else would a doctor be here for
but to see his patient?

1061
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,777
- The attending physician just left.
- I see.

1062
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,656
Well, he's a doctor of internal medicine.

1063
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,032
And I'm a surgeon.

1064
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,668
Please tell me, Doctor.

1065
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,589
Why is my son still not awake?

1066
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,465
I wonder that too.

1067
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,051
He must wake up.

1068
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:03,725
Have you seen any signs
that he's regaining consciousness,

1069
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,477
such as his fingers moving or…

1070
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,273
They just moved.

1071
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,406
J-Junggil!

1072
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,950
- Junggil!
- Just a moment!

1073
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,536
Wait here.
Where's the doctor of internal medicine?

1074
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,548
- Nam Junggil is awake!
- Where's Jung Heesung?

1075
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,008
He hasn't shown up yet.

1076
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:39,135
Junggil is only with his mother.

1077
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,637
That's Jung Heesung's car!

1078
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,650
He can't do anything
while Junggil's mother is there.

1079
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,234
He'll kill him as soon as she leaves.

1080
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,029
He'll kill him secretly
and make Baek take care of the rest.

1081
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:00,531
Still, shouldn't we go arrest him?

1082
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:04,077
But Junggil's father has replaced
the security with his own men

1083
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,120
and increased their number.

1084
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,622
Damn it.

1085
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,835
Gather up, boys.

1086
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:15,797
All right.

1087
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,300
Junggil.

1088
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,932
I'm so relieved.

1089
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,101
I thought…

1090
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,313
you might never wake up again.

1091
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,650
While you were unconscious,

1092
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:38,486
Heesung devoted himself
to taking care of you.

1093
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,156
Thank you.

1094
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,995
If only…

1095
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,457
If only the others…

1096
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,711
…had survived too.

1097
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,714
But still…

1098
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,175
I'm so glad you're alive.

1099
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:07,181
It's such a relief, ma'am.

1100
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,145
Ma'am.

1101
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:16,399
You should go and rest.
You must be exhausted.

1102
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,860
No, I'm all right.

1103
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:22,238
I know how hard it's been for you, ma'am.

1104
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:25,575
You don't need to worry anymore.
I'll stay by his side.

1105
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,036
You should go rest.

1106
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:37,837
Escort her to the car.

1107
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,529
Isn't that Junggil's mother?

1108
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,284
- Let's go!
- All right.

1109
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,919
It's only you and me left now.

1110
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,672
The fact that you're still alive

1111
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,467
is a major stroke of luck.

1112
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,093
Luck?

1113
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,056
I guess it is.

1114
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,058
Do you…

1115
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:36,020
also consider it luck?

1116
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,313
Yes, of course.

1117
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,565
There's no doubt about it.

1118
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,650
Are you sure

1119
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,610
you didn't want me…

1120
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,364
to die like this?

1121
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,578
What do you mean?

1122
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:57,416
Why would I want you to die?

1123
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,085
Right?

1124
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:04,090
I knew you wouldn't.

1125
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,399
Come on, Doctor.
It'll only be five minutes.

1126
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:23,317
I already told you no.

1127
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,736
Could you stop these reporters
from entering?

1128
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:29,574
They keep pestering me
to let them into Nam Junggil's room.

1129
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:30,867
- Doctor.
- Please keep them out.

1130
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,159
- Doctor!
- Come on, Doctor.

1131
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,078
We're reporters, not thugs!

1132
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,789
We only need three words from him.

1133
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,333
It'll only take five minutes.
Thanks for letting us in.

1134
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,668
- No.
- No reporters allowed.

1135
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:41,752
- Please leave.
- Jeez.

1136
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:45,172
All right then.
Just let us get two words from him.

1137
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,966
It'll take two or three minutes at most.

1138
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,301
Come on.

1139
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,802
Please work with us.

1140
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,554
We'll be quick. Thank you.

1141
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,431
- You can't enter.
- Leave!

1142
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,224
Please let us in.

1143
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,643
I'm going to get fired
if I don't get this story.

1144
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,605
We just need a few words from Nam Junggil.

1145
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,148
One minute is all we need!

1146
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,441
- You can't enter!
- No!

1147
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:05,151
- Step back!
- Stop them!

1148
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,402
Come on!

1149
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,573
It's ready, Yeonghan.

1150
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:28,299
- Hold on tight, all right?
- Please be careful.

1151
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,885
Don't even joke about such a thing.

1152
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,305
I was worried sick about you.

1153
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:38,893
I'm sorry.

1154
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:47,193
Jeez.

1155
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,659
Is that how you thought of me?

1156
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:57,745
Is it?

1157
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:12,176
How on earth did you figure out
what I was thinking?

1158
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:13,803
You annoying prick.

1159
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:50,107
Chief Detective 1958

1160
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,652
Special thanks to Kim Junghwa
for her special appearance
