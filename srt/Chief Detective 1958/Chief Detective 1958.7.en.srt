1
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,949
Chief Detective 1958

2
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
This series is unrelated to any places,
persons, settings or events.

3
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,953
Scenes involving animals were filmed in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.

4
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,538
Chief Yu!

5
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,457
Episode 7

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,833
Are you all right, sir?

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,251
Are you really okay?

8
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,545
I was so afraid you wouldn't wake up.

9
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,172
I'm the Steel Hammer of Mapo, remember?

10
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,424
It's going to take more to kill me.

11
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,801
Out of the way.

12
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,929
Goodness.

13
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,016
It's such a relief you're awake, Chief Yu.

14
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,477
I'm Senior Superintendent Baek Doseok.

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,022
My goodness.
Nice to meet you for the first time, sir.

16
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,735
Actually, haven't we met before?

17
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,404
No, we haven't.

18
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,658
I must have mistaken you for someone else.

19
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,037
Get this punk jailed first.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,830
You're going to face severe punishment.

21
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,541
Who deserves to punish who?

22
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,126
How dare you glare at me?

23
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,464
Isn't there something
you'd like to discuss with Chief Yu, sir?

24
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,095
Thank you for keeping me alive.

25
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,347
Actually,

26
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,225
should I be thanking
the senior superintendent?

27
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,272
Has your brain not recovered yet?

28
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,359
- What's with the nonsense?
- You're right, sir.

29
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,445
My mind is not all there yet
from being hospitalized.

30
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,033
- Detective Park.
- The suspect, Choi Dalsik,

31
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,744
ordered someone
to severely assault Chief Yu

32
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,623
as he was bitter about his letters
exposing his pro-Japanese actions.

33
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,751
That nonsense again, you punk?

34
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,796
That someone confessed his crimes
to me in a way.

35
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,465
Maybe I should've just ended you.

36
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,845
But thanks to you,
I got to be the senior superintendent.

37
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,183
You punks.

38
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,060
Is this some joke?

39
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,563
No, it's a justified investigation.

40
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,317
I mean, I wonder
why he was ordered to keep me alive.

41
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,489
He could've ended me there if he wanted.

42
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,200
This is why.

43
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:46,416
So you and Yeonghan knew
that Chief Yu had already awoken?

44
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,584
Yes.

45
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,086
Honestly, it was a miracle.

46
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,299
Mr. Yu,

47
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,384
are you awake?

48
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,223
Do you recognize me?

49
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,954
I delivered his request to Detective Park

50
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,623
to find it and keep it safe.

51
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,917
Still, how could you
keep it a secret from us?

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,043
It's not like we're spies.

53
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,545
You should've at least told me.

54
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,089
We would've stormed the National Police
if we'd known.

55
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:39,719
I'm sorry, but it's what Chief Yu
and Detective Park wanted.

56
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,389
Anyway, he's done for
as the deputy director, isn't he?

57
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,475
Minato Tanaka.

58
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,187
Korean name, Choi Dalsik.

59
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,150
This is a pledge to the Japanese emperor
you wrote with your blood

60
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,569
and a picture of you then.

61
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,740
Jeez.

62
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,368
How much blood did you shed
to write this pledge?

63
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,037
The writing is still clear as day.

64
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,665
Did you not feel dizzy afterward?

65
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,877
You left no stone unturned
to find this record of your ugly secret,

66
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,880
even messing up Chief Yu's house.

67
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,174
But how unfortunate for you.

68
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,970
The original copy was hidden
somewhere you couldn't expect.

69
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,097
"Minato Tanaka."

70
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,726
This is why you left Chief Yu alive,

71
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,647
to find the decisive clue
proving your pro-Japanese roots.

72
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,651
You've heard that I have dirt on you,
haven't you?

73
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,487
Well, I leaked that information.

74
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,158
This is what Chief Yu and I imagined
went through the suspect's head.

75
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,537
"I'm sure Chief Yu has it,

76
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,831
but will killing him be enough?"

77
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,249
"No.

78
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,710
If he left it with someone else,

79
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,004
Chief Yu could die,
and I would still be exposed."

80
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,550
"I should keep him alive for now
and see what happens.

81
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,593
If no one exposes me,

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,762
then I'll have him killed."

83
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,766
By the way,
why did you have to cut my heel?

84
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,601
You could've just stabbed randomly.

85
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,145
That's right.

86
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,648
A special forces officer
would do something like that.

87
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,608
It's what you were trained to do.

88
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,571
Not only are you good with guns,
but you're also handy with a knife,

89
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,406
Captain Baek Doseok.

90
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,577
Why didn't you send it
to the authorities?

91
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,038
Then it would be over for me.

92
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,332
The fact that you didn't…

93
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,836
tells me you have a plot in mind.

94
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,673
You could call it a plot.

95
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,092
We want all the information…

96
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,263
about the Sinkwang Society members.

97
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,473
This isn't enough.

98
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,893
Fine. Let's say
everything you said is true.

99
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,603
So?

100
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,980
What is it that you really want?

101
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,442
What do we want?

102
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,693
Yes.

103
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,422
Chief Yu.

104
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,258
The pledge and the picture are now gone.

105
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,763
I can even let it slide
that you made me a cripple.

106
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,725
In return, leave Unit 1 alone.

107
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,769
How do you want me
to leave your unit alone?

108
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,104
Leave us be,

109
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,981
no matter what we investigate
or what mess we make.

110
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,566
Chief.

111
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,069
But still,
you can't just destroy the evidence…

112
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,904
What are you hesitating for?

113
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,781
The evidence is gone.

114
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,826
You better respect
the chain of command, Chief Yu!

115
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,369
Shut your damn mouth!

116
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,379
Episode 7
The Great Thief's Onslaught

117
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,758
We had enough to get him
removed as the deputy director, Chief.

118
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,386
It's not right
that such a scummy traitor to the nation

119
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,304
is staying on as a police official.

120
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,223
I thought you wanted him gone!

121
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,558
Goodness, my ankle.

122
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,476
Let's rest a bit.

123
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,610
Did you fight all this time
just to end it like this, sir?

124
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,908
What on earth just happened?

125
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,618
This is unacceptable!

126
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,455
Yeonghan.

127
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,875
Let's just go.

128
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,086
Sir!

129
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,895
I'm sorry, sir.

130
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,023
Let's go.

131
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,364
Are you just going to leave them be?

132
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,742
To make sure
we face no future difficulties,

133
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,785
you must nip them in the bud, sir.

134
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,829
No. Just follow my decision.

135
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,539
But Deputy Director Choi…

136
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,790
It isn't over yet.

137
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,918
They must have
a different card up their sleeve.

138
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,336
That's why they tore those up.

139
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,547
Be that as it may,
we can't allow them to drag us around!

140
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,591
Why do you keep talking back?

141
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,135
Just stand by and observe for now.

142
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,555
You are not to do anything
without my permission, understood?

143
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,812
Jeez.

144
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,940
I don't get it.

145
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,400
Why would you tear the evidence apart?

146
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,737
How could you make a deal
with pro-Japanese traitors, sir?

147
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,246
Why are you laughing, sir?

148
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,043
Wait a minute.

149
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,045
You have another card up your sleeve.

150
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,216
You naive little punks.

151
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,553
I wasn't born yesterday, boys.

152
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,306
Come on, you could've told us earlier.

153
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,350
My head was about to explode.

154
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,980
- Goodness.
- Chief Yu.

155
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,606
What's your secret card?

156
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,691
Come on.

157
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,818
The better the hand,

158
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,362
the more exciting it is to wait.

159
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,030
I'll let you know in time.

160
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,950
Coming soon.

161
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:40,037
Wouldn't it have been better
to drag Deputy Director Choi down, sir?

162
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,625
There's something more important
than my secret card.

163
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:49,297
People like Choi
are all over the military and the police.

164
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,508
Then who would suffer the most?

165
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,261
The powerless.

166
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,179
Who's going to protect them?

167
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,098
The police? Soldiers?

168
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,600
Judges and prosecutors?

169
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,101
No.

170
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,730
All of those punks
will suck up to the powerful.

171
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,817
That's why people like us
need to take the side of the powerless.

172
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,361
I'm all for taking their side,

173
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,530
but what's the point if it's just us?

174
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,785
When everyone else was busy
licking Lee Jungjae's boots,

175
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,329
why did you all refuse then?

176
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:26,500
I didn't think it would hurt
for a cop like me to exist in this world.

177
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,420
That sounds strangely familiar.

178
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,340
Detective Jo.

179
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,050
Detective Seo.

180
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,218
Didn't you two also feel the same way?

181
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,262
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

182
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,847
That's right.

183
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,851
What we need to do
is to keep the faith and push through.

184
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,395
We never cared that we were a small group.

185
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,898
You're right.

186
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,442
We might not make enough
to pass on land to our descendants,

187
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,362
but we'll pass on our integrity,
our greatest asset.

188
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,743
Well, I'd rather pass on some land.

189
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,287
Yeonghan.

190
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,666
It still hurts that you didn't tell us.

191
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,084
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,753
It was all for your sake.

193
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,713
But it really wasn't.

194
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,217
If something had gone wrong,
we would've never lived it down.

195
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,636
All right, fine.

196
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,640
From now on,
there won't be any secrets between us.

197
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,644
I was going to bite everybody
if Chief Yu didn't wake up.

198
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,648
You're not some tiger, Sangsun.
You can't do that.

199
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,733
If something tragic does ever happen,

200
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,111
you'll have to be
our chief detective then, Yeonghan.

201
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,821
Don't even say that.

202
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,950
I'm fine with basically being
the vice chief.

203
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,868
Then I'll be the class chief.

204
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,287
I'll be the chief of sports.

205
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,290
Well, I can be the chief of cleaning.

206
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,210
Crazy punks.

207
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,675
They must be striking
the bell at Bosingak.

208
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,677
The bell?

209
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,514
I hope the bell doesn't toll
for anything bad in the new year.

210
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,890
I hope so too.

211
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,476
Let's go.

212
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,314
Seoul welcomed in the new year
with the blaring sound of construction,

213
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,067
which is promised to modernize
the landscape of the capital city.

214
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,277
Year 1962

215
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,405
With the old stone walls
now replaced with shiny iron fences,

216
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,700
the roads surrounding the Seoul City Hall
have been widened by 20 feet…

217
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,412
Honey.

218
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,330
- You're here.
- Did you wait long?

219
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,874
No, I just got here.

220
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,543
Now, why don't we go make a wish?

221
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,211
Okay.

222
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,174
Jeez. Are you out of your minds?

223
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,467
Get lost, you scumbags!

224
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,343
Who let you lepers out on the streets?

225
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,679
Are you trying to get us all killed?

226
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,682
These patients have healed completely.

227
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,434
They're not contagious anymore.

228
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,643
Leprosy isn't the only issue.

229
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,146
I heard those things eat babies!

230
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,398
Cursed scum.

231
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,442
Get lost now!

232
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,778
Leave Jongnam, you scum.

233
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,280
What do you think you're doing?

234
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,240
- Are you all right?
- Who are you?

235
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,366
Are you okay?

236
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,912
Police identification
Park Yeonghan

237
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,210
Didn't you hear the nun say
they've healed completely?

238
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,836
So what's the problem here?

239
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,254
Well, I mean…

240
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,256
Those scum eat babies and--

241
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,425
In my three years
at Jongnam Police Station,

242
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,427
no such case ever came up.

243
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,806
You shouldn't hurt innocent people
based on some wild rumors.

244
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,475
If you ever threaten those people again,

245
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,436
I'm afraid
you'll be arrested for intimidation.

246
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,480
Everybody disperse.

247
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,106
Leave.

248
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,901
Sorry about that. You can go now.

249
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,946
Wait, I…

250
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,239
Sorry, please leave.

251
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,327
Thank you.

252
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,138
What was your wish for the new year?

253
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,267
It's the same as always for me.

254
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,436
Good health for you and our families,

255
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,148
a safe year for Unit 1,

256
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,608
and of course…

257
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,988
jail time for all the bad guys.

258
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,197
Those were my wishes.

259
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,326
The Buddha always seems
to grant you your wishes.

260
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,537
- Is that so?
- Yes.

261
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,999
What did you wish for, honey?

262
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,211
I wished for our good health,

263
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,549
safety for all the officers at Jongnam,

264
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:47,011
and peace for those patients
who recovered from leprosy.

265
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,264
And…

266
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,267
And?

267
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,564
Did you wish for it again?

268
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,692
I don't just wish for it
at the start of the year.

269
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,528
I always do.

270
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,198
Goodness. You really don't need
to wish so hard.

271
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,327
The stork will make its delivery soon.

272
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,582
Well, I haven't seen
any stork on its way for two years.

273
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,335
Honey.

274
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,422
Happiness isn't about
filling an emptiness.

275
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,424
Happiness…

276
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,052
requires nothing.

277
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:32,139
Every moment we spend together

278
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,351
is true happiness.

279
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,519
Wouldn't you agree?

280
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,273
Yes, honey.

281
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,570
What a lovely day.

282
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,576
Thank you for being with me.

283
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,246
Thank you even more.

284
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,207
What's this now?

285
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,292
Share Prices

286
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,711
What are you looking at?

287
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,922
It's sort of like gambling,

288
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,173
but I'm not sure.

289
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,009
That's not gambling.
It's a list of stocks.

290
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,303
You had me for a second.

291
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,638
That's not gambling.

292
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,598
How is this not gambling?

293
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,059
You're still betting
on who you think will hit it big.

294
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,560
It's like beetle racing.

295
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,187
Either you win or you lose.

296
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,024
Sangsun, your stereotype about stocks
is the problem.

297
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,486
Gambling is about betting on uncertainty.

298
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,739
Buying stocks is about analyzing firms

299
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,118
and legally investing
in the ones that have promise.

300
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,913
So it's basically gambling.
You're supposed to guess.

301
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,000
None of it would make sense to me.

302
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,584
- I'd just gamble on it like you.
- Right?

303
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,587
No, listen to me. Sangsun.

304
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,508
Why don't you try to understand
how investors feel?

305
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,677
What investor? Who's an investor?

306
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,137
Did you invest?

307
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,808
Whatever! Think whatever you want!

308
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,893
Why is he so upset?

309
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,395
- I wonder that too.
- Hey.

310
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,565
I'm telling you, it's a gamble.

311
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,195
Myungil Securities, Jongnam Office

312
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,615
Closed temporarily today
Visit the main office for urgent matters

313
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,660
Damn it.

314
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,704
Why isn't he here yet?

315
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,710
Welcome…

316
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,886
I'm sorry,

317
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,346
but only the main office is open today.

318
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,035
Help me!

319
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,661
Help!

320
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,423
I hope I didn't take you out of work
for too long to go to the temple.

321
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,300
Of course not.

322
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,302
I used my lunch break to be with you.

323
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,428
That's a relief.

324
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:22,768
By the way, where do you think
the leprosy recoverers live?

325
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,354
I wonder that too.

326
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,023
I'm sure they live somewhere here.
I'll try to find out.

327
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,572
Don't look.

328
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,534
Sir.

329
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,198
I received a message
from the KCIA recently.

330
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,283
Oh.

331
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,911
It said
that if any stock-related crimes happen

332
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,581
in the districts of Jongnam,
Gudam, and Heungchun,

333
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,624
to not let the station handle it.

334
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,501
We're to transfer the cases
to the National Police

335
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,044
and then report it to the KCIA.

336
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,131
Understood, sir.

337
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,966
But may I ask why?

338
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,759
Well,

339
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,805
the economy is just as crucial
as national security these days.

340
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,973
You're right.

341
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,310
Yes, sir.

342
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,147
We're living in the golden age
of the powerful KCIA.

343
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,359
In a time when darkness
is being transformed into light,

344
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,237
we need to swim with the tide.

345
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,114
Noted, sir.

346
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,786
Detective Park.

347
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,165
I brought the witness.

348
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,750
Hello.

349
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,960
Why did you run into the building earlier?

350
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,296
I thought maybe someone had pushed him.

351
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,173
- Did you see anything?
- No.

352
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,634
I even went up to the rooftop,
but I didn't see anyone.

353
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,886
And you don't happen to know the deceased?

354
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,846
No, not at all.

355
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,515
Thank you for your help.

356
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,643
Please leave your contact details
and address with us.

357
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,727
Will do.

358
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,188
Please come this way.

359
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,273
That's one nosy man.

360
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,277
Maybe this really is a suicide.

361
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,779
We'll have to see.

362
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,989
Anything to report?

363
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,783
Not really.

364
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,494
No one saw him struggle with anyone?

365
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,496
No one in the crowd saw anything.

366
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,748
Have you identified him yet?

367
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,668
I found his citizen card in his wallet.

368
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,003
His name is Hong Inho.

369
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,297
He works at the securities firm
on the fourth floor.

370
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,467
The Bank of Korea
FIVE

371
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,014
Take a look at this.

372
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,642
You're working on the scene now?

373
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,603
Yes. I've decided to do
initial examinations on the scene.

374
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,855
We appreciate that.

375
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,565
Did you notice anything?

376
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,859
An autopsy needs to be done
for more details,

377
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,695
but the cause of death

378
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,447
is a head injury
due to the impact of the fall.

379
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,408
But take a look at his wrist.

380
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,494
This bruise is only on his right hand.

381
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,454
He seems to have been grabbed forcefully.

382
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,916
Did he get in a fight?
His clothes are in tatters.

383
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,836
Maybe he was thrown out with a judo move.

384
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,588
Myungil Securities, Jongnam Office

385
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,845
Closed temporarily?
More like out of business.

386
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,680
This place is so empty.

387
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,391
If it was closed temporarily,

388
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,435
why did he come to work?

389
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,574
What do you think this is?

390
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,120
It looks like something was dragged.

391
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,713
Wait, that looks very similar.

392
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,758
Officer Nam!

393
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,344
Bring me the deceased's shoes.

394
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,678
Yes, sir!

395
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,517
Why are these so worn out?

396
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,269
They're basically junk.

397
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,937
Look closely.

398
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,608
These aren't worn out from use.

399
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,526
The rubber's still raw here.

400
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,778
That's right.

401
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,488
It's like they were scraped.

402
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,285
These marks were made
as he resisted being dragged.

403
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,205
So somebody dragged him across the floor

404
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,332
and flung him straight out of the window.

405
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,711
Yeonghan, Detective Seo and I
will check for any other exits.

406
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,589
Then Detective Jo and I
will search the office here.

407
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,673
Yes, sir.

408
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,968
- Right, Officer Nam.
- Yes, Detective Park?

409
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,805
I saw some leprosy recoverers nearby here.

410
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,266
Yes, people sometimes
cause a scene because of them.

411
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,853
Could you find out where they live?

412
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,438
Yes, sir.

413
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,609
I knew it.
There's always another exit.

414
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,820
The young witness

415
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,489
must have missed the killer
when he escaped through here.

416
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,076
Where does this lead to?

417
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,454
Not even a single rat in sight.

418
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,956
This is the perfect escape route.

419
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,086
Detective Jo.

420
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,713
Could you open the safe?

421
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,006
Of course.

422
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,470
It's unlocked.

423
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,224
Hmm?

424
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,477
It's completely empty.

425
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,312
Open that cabinet too.

426
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,190
Let's also check for any ledgers
or documents in the desks.

427
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,663
Where does this even go?

428
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,957
I doubt there are any witnesses.

429
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,625
This place is abandoned.

430
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,552
The heavens aren't helping us today.

431
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,017
Hong Inho

432
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,226
"Hong Inho."

433
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,355
This must be the victim's desk.

434
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,661
Aren't these abacus beads?

435
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,669
All these beads,

436
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,630
but no abacus in sight.

437
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,621
Will and testament

438
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,541
I found something, Yeonghan.

439
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,877
"I offer my humble apology
to Myungil Securities

440
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,754
and all of its customers

441
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,633
for the damages I have caused
by the embezzlement of the firm's funds.

442
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,053
I intend to pay for my sins with my life."

443
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,517
What do you all think?

444
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,853
Are we all thinking the same?

445
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,523
Does the killer think we're idiots?

446
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,442
It's hard for a death
to be so obviously a murder.

447
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,236
Tattered clothes,

448
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,154
bruised wrists,

449
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,739
plus the skid marks.

450
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,659
You can add
this broken abacus to that list.

451
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,787
Do you think the killer was oblivious
that he'd be this obvious?

452
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,872
I'm sure he had no choice.

453
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,125
He was in too much of a hurry.

454
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,712
Think about it.
Say someone jumps off and dies.

455
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:33,133
Then at least one person on the scene
would go check the building.

456
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,137
He had to be in a hurry
to escape before they did.

457
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,224
This is the conclusive evidence
that the killer was in a hurry.

458
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:45,228
He had to throw the clues
out of the office

459
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,563
but had no time.

460
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:50,400
The fact that he was in such a hurry
suggests he's not an experienced killer.

461
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,485
His plan was shoddy at best too.

462
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,946
The killer must have left this will then.

463
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,282
To pivot to a homicide case,

464
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,534
we'll need the handwriting analyzed first.

465
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,703
I contacted the National Forensic Service,

466
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,623
but no handwriting experts
are currently available.

467
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,250
- Where are they?
- They're away on a work trip to Busan.

468
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,252
What happened in Busan?

469
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,256
Apparently, some shipping firm got caught

470
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,468
forging major financial documents.

471
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,012
Jeez, that's just great timing.

472
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,058
I'll have to bring in a friendly face.

473
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,518
Do you know someone, sir?

474
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,063
Yes, and he's a leading authority.

475
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,278
Hong Inho's wife

476
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,489
and the people
from Myungil Securities are here.

477
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,328
Has the victim's wife seen the body?

478
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,913
Yes.

479
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,248
But the thing is…

480
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,877
she's looking a little…

481
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,350
Here you go, ma'am.

482
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,774
My husband was the most hardworking

483
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,277
and honest person I've known.

484
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,280
But an embezzlement?

485
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,492
I remember how happy he was

486
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,495
knowing our child would be born soon.

487
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,082
He even made a vow

488
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,794
that he would live
an upstanding life for our child.

489
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,673
Do you know if he was on bad terms
with anyone at work,

490
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,633
or possibly any enemies?

491
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,678
He had none of the kind.

492
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,890
And he didn't tell you
anything out of the ordinary?

493
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,730
Ah.

494
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,108
Please take your time, ma'am.

495
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,651
We won't force you to speak.

496
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,697
Why was Hong Inho at work
if the office was closed temporarily?

497
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:05,452
Well, he was making up time
for a previous sick leave.

498
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,705
I never imagined
he would commit suicide there.

499
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,790
How are you so sure it was suicide?

500
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,835
There was an internal investigation
being carried out against him.

501
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,420
What was the investigation for?

502
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,088
For embezzlement, of course.

503
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,590
We had received a tip

504
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,676
that he was misusing
our customers' trust funds.

505
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,969
And who tipped you off?

506
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,640
Did you have conclusive proof?

507
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,018
Yes, I saw him do it.

508
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,147
Once or twice a day,

509
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,316
he pocketed our customers' money.

510
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,818
I talked to him personally,

511
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,987
so things wouldn't get out of hand.

512
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,989
But he never listened.

513
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,908
You need to stop, all right?

514
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,576
Stop what?

515
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,453
I saw everything.

516
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,663
You'll get in big trouble.

517
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,124
I'll handle it.

518
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,542
It's not something you can handle.

519
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,628
I said I'll handle it.

520
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,714
I had no choice but to report the matter

521
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,842
to my director here.

522
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,694
There isn't a hint of a lie.

523
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,575
Two weeks ago,

524
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,037
he told me something was going wrong.

525
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,331
What was it?

526
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,958
He didn't specify what,

527
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,002
only telling me that serious trouble
could be down the road.

528
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,921
He said people had to know.

529
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,715
Did he mention any details?

530
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,175
He didn't.

531
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,469
He just said he'd explain…

532
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,806
once he decided what to do.

533
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:55,103
That was just yesterday.

534
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,230
It's unclear what,

535
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,440
but he was about to do something.

536
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,406
Detective.

537
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,909
Is there any chance I could see

538
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,161
the will that he left behind?

539
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,665
I'm sorry, but we can't show you
any evidence at this…

540
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,083
Let's show it to her.

541
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,463
My husband didn't write this.

542
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,468
It's similar, but the writing isn't his.

543
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,012
I can tell immediately.

544
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:34,142
Do you have any writings of his
we could compare this to?

545
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,565
When I heard that a will was found,

546
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,026
I brought this just in case.

547
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,909
They're love letters he sent me
when we were dating.

548
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,827
Thank you.

549
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,624
I beg you…

550
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,709
to clear my husband's name.

551
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,046
We will, ma'am.

552
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,344
It should be somewhere here.

553
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,947
There's one thing
that just doesn't make sense.

554
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,575
The employee and the director said
that they were in business,

555
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,244
- but the office was so empty.
- Exactly.

556
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,080
Even the safe was empty.

557
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,499
Were there at least
any documents pinned on walls?

558
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,793
No, the office was spotless.

559
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,129
Scammers usually have
squeaky-clean offices like that.

560
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:50,259
I think what matters the most
is what Hong Inho was planning to do.

561
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,679
It's clear it wasn't something personal.

562
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,056
I'm sure it was related to the firm.

563
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,101
We'll search
Myungil Securities' Jongnam office again.

564
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,811
And we'll take another look…

565
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,855
…at the escape route.

566
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,982
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

567
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,233
Please come in.

568
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,155
Is this where you work?

569
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,701
That's right, sir.
Please go ahead, and I'll be with you.

570
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,120
- Officer Bong, please escort him.
- Yes, sir.

571
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,706
I'm a busy man.

572
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,207
This way, please.

573
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,253
Who…

574
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,338
He's the handwriting expert I mentioned.

575
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,506
I thought

576
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,758
he walked straight out of
a Joseon Dynasty painting.

577
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,886
Pen name, Gondae. Real name, Lee Dohak.

578
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,514
He's Joseon's premier calligrapher
and handwriting expert.

579
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,143
Deputy Director Choi's blood pledge
was confirmed by him.

580
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,025
"A possible suicide of an employee
of Myungil Securities' Jongnam office."

581
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:51,404
Yes, sir. It has since been changed
to a possible homicide, not suicide.

582
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,613
- Hey.
- Yes, sir?

583
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,075
Didn't I tell you to report
any stock-related crimes immediately?

584
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,037
I thought it was a personal crime
unrelated to stocks

585
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,580
and didn't want to bother you, so--

586
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,664
Hey.

587
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,042
If a case happened at a securities firm,

588
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,253
then you should've reported it
to me right away, you moron!

589
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,963
Forgive me, sir.
I didn't think it through.

590
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,091
You and your idiot brain
don't even know how to think!

591
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,301
I'm sorry, sir.

592
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,555
Is Unit 1 in charge of this case?

593
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,639
Yes, sir.

594
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:22,351
It just so happened that Detective Park
discovered the scene, sir.

595
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,691
Hmm…

596
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,693
Look here.

597
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,906
This character, meaning "upcoming",
and the same character here

598
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,617
are written visibly differently.

599
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,452
And the pen pressure, sir?

600
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,662
Overall, the will was written
with heavy pressure,

601
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,791
but the love letter was composed
with various degrees of pressure.

602
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,753
Then is there a strong chance
the will was forged, sir?

603
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,255
In my opinion, yes.

604
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,425
So you're saying
they look identical but actually aren't?

605
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,053
Don't butt in when the adults are talking,
you brat.

606
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,513
I'm an adult too.

607
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,056
You're a boy to me.

608
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,351
It's as we expected. The will was forged.

609
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:13,319
Senior Superintendent Baek
wants Chief Yu and Detective Park…

610
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,783
…in his office now.

611
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,910
A possible suicide of an employee
of Myungil Securities' Jongnam office

612
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,331
You're off the Myungil Securities case.

613
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,291
Hand this to the National Police.

614
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,627
Why the National Police, sir?

615
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,255
The KCIA is handling
all stock-related crimes.

616
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,464
That's all you need to know.

617
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,925
The evidence doesn't suggest
this is stock-related, sir.

618
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,302
New evidence can always come up.

619
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,555
Just hand the files over to them.

620
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,890
With all due respect, sir,

621
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,351
this is our case to solve.

622
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,438
Are you disobeying me to my face?

623
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,482
We're not disobeying you, sir.

624
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,026
We're simply asking you
to keep your promise.

625
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,239
I suggest you ask Deputy Director Choi
whether you can break it, sir.

626
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,373
Your cute tricks won't always fly.

627
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,127
Take it too far…

628
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,257
and you'll lose your lives.

629
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,552
Do you understand?

630
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,847
Understood, sir.

631
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,018
Get out.

632
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,739
I also have a feeling it's not a suicide.

633
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,994
How I feel shouldn't matter,

634
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,079
but the victim Hong Inho…

635
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,917
had a lean wallet.

636
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,253
His wife was dressed very plainly as well,

637
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,173
with signs of mending.

638
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,468
Embezzlers usually make it obvious,
don't they?

639
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,930
They seem to live luxuriously
or dress impeccably.

640
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,974
Not to generalize,

641
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,769
but the thieves I've caught
normally show such signs.

642
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,898
Money easily stolen is money easily spent.

643
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,651
It's always very obvious.

644
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,363
I can't imagine
what the victim's wife is going through

645
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,908
with her baby about to be born soon.

646
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,201
Exactly.

647
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,412
Right.

648
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,624
Speaking of which,

649
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,543
could you…

650
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,005
Yes, I can.

651
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,341
I'll visit her often and look after her.

652
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,177
Can you really?

653
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,930
I feel bad asking
since you must be busy with the bookstore.

654
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,016
What can I do? It's part of my job.

655
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,602
Give me her address tomorrow.

656
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,771
Wait.

657
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,149
Her address is…

658
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,359
You have it already.

659
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,406
- You can find her here.
- I see.

660
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,243
You should be glad I didn't refuse.

661
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,912
I really should.

662
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,205
Thank you.

663
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,333
Don't mention it.

664
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,918
Myungil Securities, Jongnam Office

665
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:22,049
Everyone and their mothers
are talking about stocks these days,

666
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,175
and so I went in there.

667
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,302
Myungil Securities, Jongnam Office

668
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,845
Excuse me.

669
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,639
How do I buy stocks?

670
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,310
I'm afraid individual investors
need to go to the main office.

671
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,020
Then what do you do here?

672
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,980
We do other work here.

673
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,315
Did they say what kind of work?

674
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,401
I didn't ask. They were being so cheap.

675
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,863
Have you seen anyone else walk in
besides the director and the employees?

676
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,906
I remember one person.

677
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,827
How could I forget
when he rode in such a nice car?

678
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,704
It was an American-made Plymouth.

679
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,248
The director always went out to greet him.

680
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,709
How old did he look?
What about his face and physique?

681
00:38:56,792 --> 00:39:01,047
He looked about 30
and had a build about this size.

682
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,507
He's your typical fancy gentleman.

683
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,551
His hair was drenched in pomade,

684
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,970
and he had white shoes
and a white suit on.

685
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,348
White shoes and a white suit?

686
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,018
That's how cow thieves dress.

687
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,022
- Thank you for helping us out.
- Thank you.

688
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,523
- Detective Jo.
- Yes?

689
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,736
We're going to need a little help
from a friendly ally.

690
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,072
What? Who do you mean?

691
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,204
Hey, there's no one around.

692
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,539
It's hard to see from here,

693
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,627
but there are people
under that straw mat over there.

694
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,795
Let's take a look.

695
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,765
Ma'am.

696
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,434
Please talk to us.

697
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,895
You saw someone yesterday, right?

698
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,733
Bring Yeonghan here, Officer Nam.

699
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,152
Yes, sir.

700
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,366
We're the police.

701
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,742
You can talk to us, ma'am.

702
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,370
- Did you see anyone?
- At that time,

703
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,164
did you see anyone walking by the window

704
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,500
or peering through it?

705
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,419
Anything of the sort?

706
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,212
- I'm not really sure.
- Detective Park!

707
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,174
What's the matter?

708
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,218
Please come with me for a second.

709
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,348
Hey, Sangsun.

710
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,644
Wait…

711
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,775
They were all out here in the cold.

712
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,821
She seems to know something
but won't say it.

713
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,034
Excuse me, ma'am.

714
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,245
Could we speak with you briefly?

715
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,210
Hello.

716
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,548
Did you see anyone
pass by here yesterday afternoon?

717
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,884
He came out from there.

718
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,307
If you've seen someone, please tell us.

719
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,061
You shouldn't hurt innocent people
based on some wild rumors.

720
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,818
We should go.

721
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,320
She won't talk to us.

722
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,246
He had long hair.

723
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,338
He had long hair
and was wearing a black jacket.

724
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,133
I couldn't really see his face.

725
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,885
Anything else?

726
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,471
His right hand was bandaged.

727
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,723
Do you remember anything else?

728
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,725
No.

729
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,352
Thank you so much.

730
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,272
We'll be able to catch the suspect
thanks to you.

731
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,066
You really did us a solid, ma'am.

732
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,194
Were you able to get a meal at the church?

733
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,404
The church soup kitchen is closed today.

734
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,699
Here, ma'am.

735
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,246
Please, take it.

736
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,332
You should get something hot
on such a cold day.

737
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,376
If you're not comfortable
going to a place to eat,

738
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,504
feel free to ask the officer here
to buy some rice soup for you.

739
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,714
Yes. I'm here to help, ma'am.

740
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,842
Thank you. Thank you so much.

741
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,511
No problem.

742
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,598
Thank you.

743
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,683
Thank you.

744
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,730
This is so good.

745
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:52,152
That pomade-drenched, fancy guy
sounds suspicious to me.

746
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,906
Punks who look like that
always cause problems.

747
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,450
Look who it is.

748
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,079
It's been so long, Hodong.

749
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,665
This is why we need to hang out more.

750
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,750
It's Eundong, not Hodong.

751
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,044
I can't believe
you forgot my name, goodness.

752
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,964
How have you been?

753
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,632
Good, thanks to you.

754
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,175
Thank you for coming.

755
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,595
No problem.
I'm glad to help in any way I can.

756
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,476
This place looks like
it's closed permanently, not temporarily.

757
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,397
No ledgers, no deposit slips,
no status boards, nothing.

758
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,609
All I can see
are just sheets of blank paper, jeez.

759
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,532
This isn't an above-board securities firm.

760
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,744
It's the secret headquarters
for a nefarious scheme.

761
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,120
What scheme?

762
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,580
Market manipulation.

763
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,583
To put it simply,
it's when you mess with stocks.

764
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,877
The deceased took part in it.

765
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,254
How exactly do you mess with stocks?

766
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,380
First,

767
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:57,051
buy a load of shares
in a single company for dirt cheap.

768
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,803
Then get the price to go up
by spreading rumors.

769
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,098
Inevitably, people will flock
to buy shares in that firm.

770
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,184
The punk who inflated the share's price…

771
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,353
…can then sell everything and jump ship.

772
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,730
That's the whole scheme.

773
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:13,067
Damn it! That's how I lost money
on the stock market.

774
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,693
That's why I lost it all!

775
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,986
Good grief.

776
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,697
So that's why you were fuming at us.

777
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:24,203
Just so you know, there's a rumor
going around in our industry.

778
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,414
Make sure this stays in this room, okay?

779
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,833
Don't worry. Just tell us.

780
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,752
There's this man called Yoon Sangtae

781
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,005
who founded three securities firms,

782
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:39,093
namely Namsan Securities,
Taeheung Securities, and this place,

783
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,303
Myungil Securities.

784
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,222
With these three firms,

785
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:46,892
it would be child's play for him
to control the stock market.

786
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,270
How does this Yoon Sangtae
get to do what he wants?

787
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,605
From what I've heard,

788
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,274
he's a former military man
and an economics expert.

789
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,444
But more importantly,

790
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,114
being an expert in economics isn't enough.

791
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:04,743
There's no way he's manipulating
the stock market all on his own.

792
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,750
January 3, 1:20 p.m.,
Lee Ildo: death from falling

793
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,259
1:30 p.m., Hong Inho:
homicide, under investigation

794
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:37,943
Ten-minute difference in times of death

795
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,111
If he's not acting alone,

796
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,072
is a government official
in charge of stocks helping him?

797
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,867
Not an individual,
but something much larger.

798
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,411
You know what I'm talking about.

799
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,246
The body that holds…

800
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,372
…all information about this country.

801
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,416
Are you talking about…

802
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,584
The Korean Central Intelligence Agency?

803
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,754
Don't say that out loud!

804
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,591
All that talk about national security,
and this is what they do.

805
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,635
If Hong Inho was planning
on exposing this…

806
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,264
Goodness. I wouldn't dare dream
of doing that.

807
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:10,142
You'd be risking your life.

808
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,686
What happens
if the stock market is left as it is?

809
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,397
If this trend
of intense speculation continues,

810
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:19,193
the system will fail in three months.

811
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,527
And who will suffer?

812
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,946
People like him.

813
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,907
Ordinary investors who keep the law.

814
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,075
All the officials and securities firms

815
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,453
won't be affected a single bit.

816
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,580
Damn it!

817
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,875
These punks are worse than cow thieves.

818
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,961
- Hey, he hit the roof again.
- He really did.

819
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,048
This is going to ruin
the lives of not one, not hundreds,

820
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,008
- but thousands of people.
- Yes.

821
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,718
Those demented punks!

822
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,429
Is this the new world they promised us?

823
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,848
We need to catch that pomade-drenched guy.

824
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,391
I just know he's in on this.

825
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,894
I'll put a wanted alert out
for the black Plymouth.

826
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:54,978
Do it!

827
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,188
Just a minute.

828
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,273
A black Plymouth?

829
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,234
Pomade?

830
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,402
Does he wear white shoes

831
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,864
- and a white suit?
- Yes, that fancy punk.

832
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:10,244
That slimy punk meets our bank president
every Wednesday.

833
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,620
Busted!

834
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,122
- Let's get him.
- What day is it tomorrow?

835
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,167
It's Wednesday! Tomorrow is a Wednesday!

836
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,794
He'll be there tomorrow!

837
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,380
Let's hurry! We need to get him!

838
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,841
Damn it.

839
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,309
Jongnam Branch of Goryeo Bank

840
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:35,936
He's out.

841
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,442
- Let's go.
- All right.

842
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,376
All right.

843
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,337
This is definitely a gambling den.

844
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:05,424
It's been so long.
I feel like I'm back home.

845
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,600
They're arm wrestling.

846
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,478
- This is your specialty, Gyeonghwan.
- It is.

847
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,486
Gong Jabok wins!

848
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,779
All right, all right.

849
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,239
Hey, do you see him?

850
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,241
That punk with the glasses
looks like the boss.

851
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,243
That's one ugly mug.

852
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,539
Mr. Pomade
doesn't look like he's gambling.

853
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,958
Now, this next match will see

854
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,753
today's ultimate winner Gong Jabok

855
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,254
and the forearm of steel

856
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,841
Ko Doopal battle it out!

857
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,384
Forearm of steel?

858
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,677
That sounds like me.

859
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,970
- You're right.
- Now, everyone.

860
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,847
Blue is for Gong Jabok.

861
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,642
- Red is for Ko Doopal.
- That's him, isn't it?

862
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,437
He had long hair
and was wearing a black jacket.

863
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,023
His right hand was bandaged.

864
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,275
Yes. I think that's him.

865
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,652
Let's arrest him right now.

866
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,736
Not yet.

867
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,614
We're always outnumbered
at a gambling den.

868
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,532
It won't be a fair fight.

869
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,868
And once
they start running off like crazy,

870
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:15,953
we'll lose everyone.

871
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,914
Is that Ko Doopal
with a bandage on his hand?

872
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,166
- I guess he's hurt.
- I guess so.

873
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,918
I'm betting on Gong Jabok then.

874
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,753
Same here, man! I'm betting on him too!

875
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,756
Ready, start!

876
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,600
Oof.

877
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,855
The winner is Ko Doopal!

878
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,318
Glass eye, horn-rimmed glasses,
and yellow teeth?

879
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,738
That's Jang Geochi,

880
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,199
a well-known figure around these parts.

881
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:58,453
He owns countless gambling dens
on the outskirts of northern Seoul.

882
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,872
How has he not been arrested, sir?

883
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,710
Obviously, he rubs elbows
with the police and government officials.

884
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,003
That's right.

885
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,672
You'd be hard-pressed
to find an official not under his payroll.

886
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,676
So why does a securities guy
hang out with a gambling tycoon

887
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,219
when he doesn't even gamble?

888
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:18,432
He's flooding his securities firms
with gambling money

889
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,017
to obtain seed capital.

890
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,978
Securities, my foot.

891
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,313
He's a loan shark.

892
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,816
With all this illegal gambling money
funneling in,

893
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,276
he's upping the stakes.

894
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,945
I know a lot of people
who are obsessed with stocks these days.

895
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,197
They say
it's the "age of the stock market."

896
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,701
If fools rush in
where angels fear to tread,

897
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,536
it'll be the age of bankrupt families.

898
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,455
Please warn your friends.

899
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:45,125
By the way,
why hasn't Mr. Pomade been arrested?

900
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,627
Let's wait until tomorrow, Geumdong.

901
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,837
He might contact a higher-up.

902
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,381
- Thank goodness.
- Nansil.

903
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,466
You're still here.

904
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,468
Have a seat. So?

905
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,553
What's the matter?

906
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:59,097
I hesitated to tell you at the station

907
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,975
because it might not be anything.

908
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,061
But here it is, just in case.

909
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,273
Ten minutes before Hong Inho's death,

910
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,650
a Seoul District Court prosecutor died.

911
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,612
He fell from a building behind the court.

912
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,655
- And?
- First of all,

913
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:19,284
the courthouse and where Hong Inho died
are ten minutes apart by foot.

914
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:23,246
I did some research
on the deceased prosecutor

915
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,333
and found out
he was in charge of stock-related crimes.

916
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,667
Stock-related crimes?

917
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,879
- Yes.
- I see the big picture.

918
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,924
The securities firm employee
about to blow the whistle

919
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,426
and the prosecutor
in charge of stock-related crimes.

920
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,345
And the two died only ten minutes apart.

921
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,640
Were there any witnesses
to the prosecutor's death?

922
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,058
No, there weren't any.

923
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,893
He was dead when discovered.

924
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,525
1:20 p.m., Lee Ildo: death from falling
1:30 p.m., Hong Inho: homicide…

925
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,362
Nansil.

926
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,532
- Officer Bong!
- Yes?

927
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:02,744
You might have just solved
a difficult riddle for us.

928
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,541
- What?
- Now,

929
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,085
Nansil did us all a huge favor.

930
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,879
It's time for us to go
and get the bad guys!

931
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:15,924
Let's do it.

932
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,426
All right, you two.

933
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,303
Prepare yourselves.

934
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,305
Let's go!

935
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:24,599
Get ready!

936
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,935
Set, go!

937
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,944
Ko Doopal wins!

938
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,239
Everyone who bet on Ko Doopal,

939
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,949
- collect your bets!
- Sangsun.

940
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,200
How much did you bet?

941
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,372
All right. Who's our next challenger?

942
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,333
Here!

943
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,883
Let's do this, you long-haired punk!

944
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,010
Are you out of your mind?

945
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,511
Let's switch up the terms.

946
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,555
If I beat you,

947
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:07,726
give away the wager to everyone here!

948
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,404
And if you lose?

949
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:20,947
Hmm…

950
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,241
I don't have money,

951
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,202
so just cut off my arm.

952
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,455
Jeez, this punk is out of his mind.

953
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,459
That's fine by me. Come on up.

954
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,503
Idiots like you challenge me every day.

955
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,880
They're just all bark, no bite.

956
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,798
You talk too much, you punk.

957
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,731
Relax, you two.

958
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,733
Ready, start!

959
00:53:58,443 --> 00:53:59,444
Come on!

960
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,826
Now is the time, Gyeonghwan!

961
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,377
That's it!

962
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,461
He wins.

963
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,588
Damn it, that little…

964
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,551
That's it, Gyeonghwan!
You did so well. Great job!

965
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,264
All right.

966
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:32,269
Just as promised,
all of this money is ours now.

967
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,562
Let's go get our money!

968
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,855
Let's go!

969
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,190
Yes!

970
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,359
What a load of crap.

971
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:40,986
Get them out of here!

972
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,664
Why don't you keep your word,
you dirty pricks?

973
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,585
Damn it.

974
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,884
You're under arrest
for the murder of Hong Inho, baldy.

975
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,055
- Did you hear that?
- You pricks are cops.

976
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,058
Yes, we're cops but don't fret.

977
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,935
We won't arrest you,

978
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,228
so just go on home.

979
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:16,688
Damn it!

980
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,958
Put these on.

981
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,752
Get up, you punk.

982
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,882
What's with the gloves?

983
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:46,009
My hands hurt too much.
You should put them on too.

984
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,886
- My hands are killing me.
- Exactly.

985
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:51,097
All I did was get people together
for some light gambling.

986
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,100
That's not a crime, is it?

987
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:56,936
Ko Doopal.

988
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,272
You're not getting away
no matter what you say.

989
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,690
We have a witness.

990
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:02,984
Before killing Hong Inho,

991
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,653
did you push the judge
down the stairs too?

992
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,281
He was a prosecutor, not a judge.

993
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,076
Exactly. So you admit
to killing a prosecutor.

994
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,371
You couldn't have left
a more obvious crime scene, you idiot.

995
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,164
As far as I can tell,

996
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,083
you're getting executed.

997
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,167
Jeez.

998
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,628
Spill everything you know
if you feel hard done by.

999
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,089
I'll let you avoid execution.

1000
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:25,840
Do you mean it?

1001
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,592
Of course.

1002
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,719
All you have to do is split the crime…

1003
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,680
with whoever gave you orders.

1004
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,558
In that case,
I just followed my boss's orders.

1005
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,648
Right away? Tomorrow?

1006
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,734
Yes. The situation has become urgent.

1007
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,570
I'm used to packing a punch,

1008
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,282
but I've never killed anyone before.

1009
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:54,869
Doopal.

1010
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,081
Just do it.

1011
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,042
Get rid of the two targets,

1012
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,752
and you could afford a whole house.

1013
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:07,424
I guess Ko Doopal will be sharing
his murder charge with you.

1014
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:12,595
Running a gambling den could be excused,
but abetting a murder is something else.

1015
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:17,308
Do you have anyone
to share your crime with, Jang Geochi?

1016
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,146
Well, if you don't feel like it,

1017
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,440
you two can share all the blame.

1018
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,776
This man… made me do it.

1019
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,736
What are you saying?

1020
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,034
Come on, we can't kill a prosecutor!

1021
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,119
Just get it done.

1022
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,204
I'll deal with the aftermath.

1023
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,625
The securities firm employee
asked to meet me tomorrow.

1024
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:46,546
He wants the prosecutor
to secretly see me in that office

1025
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,630
to prove my involvement.

1026
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,091
But I won't actually be there.

1027
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,719
That's when you strike.

1028
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:55,889
What about the prosecutor?

1029
00:57:55,972 --> 00:58:00,768
Get rid of him while he's out on his way
to meet the employee.

1030
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,270
Do you actually believe

1031
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,773
what this gambling boss
and his minion are saying?

1032
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,360
I was only there to gamble for fun, okay?

1033
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,237
Just some light, fun gambling.

1034
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,907
If that's my crime,
I'll eagerly accept my punishment.

1035
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,534
I can tell you're lying
when your lips are moving.

1036
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,037
Should I pull your tongue out?

1037
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,122
Na Gunsoo.

1038
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,792
Don't you have… anything to say?

1039
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,961
Well, I can tell the truth.

1040
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,757
How did you know the prosecutor
was going to meet Hong Inho?

1041
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,134
How did they even know each other?

1042
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,472
- Spit it out.
- Come on.

1043
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,726
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1044
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:44,354
Look at this little punk.
So that's how you're going to play this?

1045
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,732
Hey.

1046
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:49,901
What's going on here?

1047
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,529
As you can see,
we're questioning suspects.

1048
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:53,780
Is that so?

1049
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,450
I told you the National Police
is handling all stock-related crimes.

1050
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,035
Well, we'll investigate first and--

1051
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,495
Shut up, you punk!

1052
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:05,083
Effective immediately,
the KCIA is taking over.

1053
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,167
Understood?

1054
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:07,877
Come on in.

1055
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:10,588
What?

1056
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,215
Come with us.

1057
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:14,801
Wait…

1058
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,178
- You can't do this.
- Wait.

1059
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,059
Identification card
KCIA

1060
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,145
We'll be taking them.

1061
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,274
- Follow us.
- Okay.

1062
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,733
Damn it.

1063
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,702
Sir, this is ridiculous.

1064
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:43,913
The culprits behind market manipulation
are investigating themselves.

1065
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,416
This isn't a wolf guarding the sheep.

1066
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:48,501
It's the wolf guarding the entire farm!

1067
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:52,422
While you all were out,
I did some digging into Na Gunsoo.

1068
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,299
He's Yoon Sangtae's nephew.

1069
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,259
Yoon Sangtae?

1070
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,428
The man who owns three securities firms?

1071
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,517
Na Gunsoo.

1072
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:08,062
He seems to be the guy
carrying out his uncle's orders.

1073
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:10,690
Damn it, those scumbags.

1074
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,904
Detective Park!

1075
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,285
Ko Doopal! Jang Geochi!

1076
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,499
We're taking these two into our custody.

1077
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,002
Hey.

1078
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,421
What are you doing?

1079
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:36,716
These two punks are suspects
in murders that happened in Jongnam.

1080
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,511
So you can take that punk only
for stock-related crimes.

1081
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,680
These are orders from upstairs.

1082
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,975
If you disobey them,
you'll be punished severely.

1083
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,436
We're obeying the rules, sir!

1084
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:49,937
I told you to shut up, you brat!

1085
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:53,274
The hierarchy here is a mess,
Senior Superintendent Baek.

1086
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,860
My apologies.
We'll hand the suspects over.

1087
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,570
Hand them over. End of story.

1088
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,781
Keep them here, boys!

1089
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:00,865
Yes, sir.

1090
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,159
You punk!

1091
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:08,331
Tell Deputy Director Choi.

1092
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:12,085
I'll stop at nothing
to carry out justice against Na Gunsoo.

1093
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,130
I need to pee bad. Let's get out of here.

1094
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:20,426
Next time we meet,
I'm going to bite your ears off, you punk.

1095
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,141
Detective Jo and Detective Seo,
take them back inside.

1096
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,351
Yes, sir.

1097
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,621
Oh Chulkyu,

1098
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,124
you're under arrest
for forging Hong Inho's will.

1099
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,542
Arrest Warrant

1100
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:56,045
Kim Hakpil, you're under arrest
for abetting in the forgery.

1101
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,214
Unfortunately for you,

1102
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,384
you left a blank sheet of paper behind.

1103
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:02,635
Another thing.

1104
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,097
Normally,

1105
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,975
forgers write forcefully
as they try to replicate the writing.

1106
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,436
If this forger wrote this
on top of something…

1107
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,896
he may have left marks behind.

1108
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,274
I see. Marks…

1109
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,277
The paper you left on your desk

1110
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,612
had a strange texture to it.

1111
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,740
So I colored it in with a pencil.

1112
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,500
Hands out.

1113
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:37,837
Jongnam Bookstore

1114
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,839
Thank you, Detective.

1115
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,799
I'm sure he's grateful too.

1116
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:45,094
I truly hope he can rest in peace now.

1117
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:49,140
I was only able to deliver my baby safely
thanks to you, ma'am.

1118
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,558
I couldn't thank you enough.

1119
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:54,395
Don't mention it.
I'm just happy your baby is healthy.

1120
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,733
By the way, have you named your baby?

1121
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,445
Hong Yuchan,
meaning to enlighten and assist.

1122
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:06,699
Hong Yuchan? That's such a nice name.

1123
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,786
What do you hope he grows up to be?

1124
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:13,456
As long as he helps
the voiceless and the powerless,

1125
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,208
he can be anything he wants.

1126
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:16,793
Yuchan.

1127
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,086
I hope you work hard

1128
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,756
and spread your wings someday.

1129
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,926
Looking closely,
he looks just like his father.

1130
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,677
I'm sure he'll be
a righteous man like him.

1131
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,054
Thank you.

1132
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,895
Come on, Jaeduk.

1133
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,855
Listen to me.

1134
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:40,650
- Lend me some money.
- Go away.

1135
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,944
I'll give you a tip then.

1136
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:47,073
Put your money in Wangho Foods.
It'll skyrocket soon.

1137
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,033
I'm broke, okay?

1138
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:51,911
I dumped this month's pay
on Sungra Pharmaceuticals shares.

1139
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,412
Come on, I'm trying to help…

1140
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,165
Hey, Detective Oh.

1141
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,584
Where are you off to?

1142
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,419
To the bathhouse.

1143
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,172
- But it's a Tuesday.
- See you.

1144
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,636
I just know that punk
is trying to get rich all on his own.

1145
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,972
Don't be so obsessed with stocks.
You might go bankrupt.

1146
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,684
Look, Detective Kim.

1147
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,979
Worry about your own life, man.

1148
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:20,773
Life only gets sunny for people like me

1149
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,943
who get ahead of the pack.

1150
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:27,196
Keep trying to make your life sunny.

1151
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:31,325
Just know that you can go blind
in too much sun.

1152
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,495
Do you have to be so negative?

1153
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:38,124
I hope your life gets so sunny,

1154
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,709
you get lit up with debt!

1155
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,086
I hope so too!

1156
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,297
Hey!

1157
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,594
It doesn't feel like
we actually solved the case.

1158
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,181
Na Gunsoo fled to America
as soon as he was released.

1159
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:56,517
Jang Geochi disappeared immediately
upon release.

1160
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,811
Ko Doopal hung himself in jail.

1161
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,479
It's a complete mess.

1162
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:05,359
I'm not sure we were able
to fully clear Hong Inho's name.

1163
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,861
Well, we caught his killer

1164
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,821
and freed him
from embezzlement accusations.

1165
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:12,700
And yet, we couldn't solve
the very problem he wanted to solve.

1166
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:16,621
That's not easy for us to do
when the stench is coming from up there.

1167
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,167
They say the world has changed,

1168
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,587
but the powerless are the only ones
who still suffer.

1169
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,965
The world may have changed,

1170
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,551
but the real thieves
keep growing in number.

1171
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:33,179
You're right.

1172
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:36,432
In this age,
great men have become great thieves.

1173
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:39,977
My goodness.

1174
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:45,399
The buildings' shadows lie long.

1175
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,530
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1176
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:02,041
In May of 1962, the stock market crashed
due to a manipulation of stock prices.

1177
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,627
About 5,000 private investors
suffered immense financial losses.

1178
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,170
However, in June of 1963,

1179
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:09,090
those responsible for the crisis
were all acquitted.

1180
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:01,142
Chief Detective 1958

1181
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,519
This is the bloodiest murder
I've seen recently.

1182
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:04,603
Three in one night?

1183
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,024
What if the culprit
is someone we least suspect? 

1184
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,442
She had another man.

1185
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,485
Do you know who the man is?

1186
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:12,820


1187
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:13,946
Go arrest her boyfriend.

1188
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,032
We can't catch them
if they've left Jongnam already.

1189
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,366
But make sure you do it quietly.

1190
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,576
What's wrong with you?

1191
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:19,702
You call yourself a human?

1192
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:22,913
I'm thinking of
directing a play just like you did.

1193
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,582
I really don't know.

1194
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:25,708
I just want to put a bullet

1195
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,168
- through your head.
