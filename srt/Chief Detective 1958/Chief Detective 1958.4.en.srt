00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:32,949
Chief Detective 1958

2
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
This series is unrelated to any places,
persons, settings or events.

3
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,953
Scenes involving animals were filmed in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.

4
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:47,047
I apologize
for not keeping the promise to date,

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,299
but next time,

6
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,679
I'll make sure
to send a well-screened candidate.

7
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,642
You can deposit the balance
after that happens, okay?

8
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,691
Episode 4
Yellow Turtle

9
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,988
Baeknyeonhwapyeon rice cakes

10
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,868
Episode 4

11
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,329
Mmm!

12
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,747
This tastes amazing.

13
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,250
The mugwort and nuts go so well together.

14
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,002
Yes? You like it?

15
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,338
How do I put it? I feel healthier already.

16
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,215
- Right.
You should start selling it tomorrow.

17
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,008
-
What should you call this?

18
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,553
Call it "Bride's Rice Cake,"
since you're as beautiful as a bride.

19
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,557
- Oh, come on.

20
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,561
Beautiful like a bride?
You flatter me too much.

21
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,150
By the way, what's he up to?

22
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,112
He's teaching himself
how to read and write,

23
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,614
but he's struggling to do it alone.

24
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:58,284
He should've told me
if he was trying to learn.

25
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,788
I want to help him however I can,

26
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,792
but I've got nothing to my name,
and I'm uneducated too.

27
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,008
Please find my missing child.

28
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,513
I filed a report more than a week ago,

29
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,390
but I haven't heard back ever since.

30
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,895
Ma'am, we're short of manpower here.

31
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,525
I'll point you to a different agency
that could help instead.

32
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,985
- You should try asking them.
- Wait.

33
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,695
You're the police.

34
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,073
Can't you find my child?
Why are you giving me another…

35
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,159
Look, ma'am. We're very busy.

36
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,078
Our station deals with major crimes,

37
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,830
not some missing persons cases.

38
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,456
But my baby…

39
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,793
What if he gets sold off somewhere
and has to beg on the street?

40
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,796
My dear Jongwoo…

41
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,509
My dear Jongwoo…

42
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,096
He'll have to live as an orphan
his whole life.

43
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,185
Ma'am.

44
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,811
I'll help you over here.

45
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,937
Hey, you.

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,607
How dare you?

47
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,941
You're not even doing anything.

48
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,735
You were about to send her elsewhere.

49
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,321
Come on, come over here.

50
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,781
Have a seat here.

51
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,035
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

52
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,413
So, what's the name of your child?

53
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,457
It's Kim Jongwoo.

54
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,417
"Kim Jongwoo."

55
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:36,132
Name, Kim Jongwoo.
A five-month-old baby boy.

56
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,009
On October 6 at about 3:00 p.m.,

57
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,095
when you and the swaddled child
were napping at home,

58
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,680
he disappeared.

59
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,739
Is there anyone suspicious close to you?

60
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,324
No.

61
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,827
What about the child's father?

62
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,497
He passed away from tuberculosis.

63
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,798
You said he was swaddled
when he disappeared.

64
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:20,093
Was there anything special
about the swaddle?

65
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,512
It has a yellow turtle on it.

66
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,889
I embroidered it myself.

67
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,851
Does the child have
any particular physical traits?

68
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,272
My baby boy

69
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,148
has two left thumbs.

70
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,278
So he has six fingers on his left hand?

71
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,696
Yes.

72
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,075
It's all my fault.

73
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,245
Ah… Don't say that, ma'am.

74
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,913
It's not your fault.

75
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,042
Please find my dear Jongwoo.

76
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,839
He matters to me more than my own life.

77
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,763
Jongnam Bookstore

78
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,523
Why did you want to see me?

79
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,402
Well, the thing is…

80
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,531
…I've been thinking,

81
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,410
and I feel like you'd be a great teacher

82
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,787
considering how smart you are.

83
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,290
Definitely.

84
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,251
Nansil is such a bright and sharp girl.

85
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,753
Yes, of course.

86
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,380
But I want to be a detective,
not a teacher.

87
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,676
You can do that,
but only after you graduate high school.

88
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,222
Who would I even teach?

89
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:50,808
Well…

90
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,896
have you seen the boy
who works at Ms. Ho's rice cake place

91
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,065
in Jongnam Market?

92
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,733
Hmm…

93
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,318
Yes, I think I've seen him.

94
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,403
Is it the guy who always sounds angry?

95
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,738
Yes, him.

96
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,033
Would you mind teaching him

97
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,077
how to read and write?

98
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,123
If I do, what will I get in return
from you two?

99
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,043
Hmm…

100
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,213
As for me,

101
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,424
I'll reserve
all the new mystery novels just for you.

102
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,134
And I'll teach you

103
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,720
how to catch cow thieves.

104
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,142
Like there are any cows to catch in Seoul.
I'll get going now.

105
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,727
Wait, Nansil.

106
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,690
Catching cow thieves involves every skill
a detective needs to be good at.

107
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,945
Tsk. Well, I guess I have nothing to lose.

108
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,155
All right, then.

109
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,825
I can't believe
what we discovered in training.

110
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,452
They were only babies too.

111
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,163
They had to be murdered and buried, right?

112
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,417
I've seen the remains
of war victims in mass graves,

113
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,836
but something like this is a first.

114
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,426
One thing that bothers me
is that these babies all have--

115
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,224
- What's going on?
- We're from Hoyang Police Station.

116
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,478
We'll be taking
the corpses of all the babies here.

117
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,605
Hand over the camera.

118
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,816
The camera and its contents
are owned by the military.

119
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,359
You'll need a warrant for them.

120
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,445
Never mind a warrant.

121
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,366
You'll have to make sure
that none of this leaks.

122
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,035
- Take the bodies.
- Yes, sir.

123
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,370
- What are you doing?
- Hurry.

124
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,456
- Out of the way.
- Step aside.

125
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,375
"Ten lifeless infants were found
during military training.

126
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,752
The infants were orphans.
The cause of death is unknown.

127
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,631
One of the infants discovered
was found to be polydactyly."

128
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,342
Does that mean it had six fingers?

129
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,428
Yes, that's right.

130
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,596
In that case…

131
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,847
Don't jump to conclusions.

132
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,516
There are plenty of kids out there
who are polydactyly.

133
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,812
Detectives.

134
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,899
Did you read the papers?

135
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,610
Please calm down.
We can't be sure it's your son.

136
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,445
- We'll investigate further.
- Detective Kim.

137
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,864
Let me get you some water.

138
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,620
Who has jurisdiction
over this mass grave case?

139
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,747
It's Hoyang Police Station.

140
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,499
What are they like, sir?

141
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,709
They're just like us over here.

142
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,004
I'll pay them a visit and investigate.

143
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,840
You allowed them to be buried?

144
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,802
Those orphans all died from measles.

145
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,223
Their cause of death
was confirmed by a doctor,

146
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,100
so we allowed the orphanage
to bury them at Hoak Mountain.

147
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,187
- Who gave you that right?
- Listen.

148
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,272
As long as the cause of death
is confirmed,

149
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,691
we're authorized to permit burials.

150
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,861
What about the babies' corpses then?

151
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,530
Did you return them to the orphanage?

152
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,866
Of course.
What else would we do with them?

153
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,535
Was there a funeral?

154
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,373
Dead orphans don't need funeral.

155
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,917
Cremating them is the way to go.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,170
Are orphans some bundles of hay to you?

157
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,922
You can't just cremate them!

158
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,715
You little prick! What's your damn rank?

159
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,841
- Come here!
- You damn prick!

160
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,431
They're just orphans!

161
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,267
- Hey!
- Stop!

162
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,269
Investigation Division

163
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,690
I bet the orphanage abducted the babies

164
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,608
and cremated them once things went south.

165
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,611
And these Hoyang pricks were bribed
to turn a blind eye.

166
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,740
Why would the orphanage
abduct those babies?

167
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,117
I know, right?

168
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,952
Aren't orphanages
already full of kids anyway?

169
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,455
Sangsun and I
will pay the orphanage a visit.

170
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,000
You two meet with the military surgeon
who was in charge of the babies.

171
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,251
Armed Forces Capital Hospital

172
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,044
What? Transferred?

173
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,880
Where to?
Why was he transferred?

174
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,091
I'm not authorized to tell you that.

175
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,137
Could you just tell us?
We really need to know.

176
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,098
I'm sorry, but you'll have to ask
my superiors for that information.

177
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,809
Wait…

178
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,353
Angel House

179
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,944
I see you're involved
in many different projects.

180
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,863
It's only natural,

181
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,325
since experts in my field
are rare in the country.

182
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,037
That means I have
an endless list of ventures to make.

183
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,790
How did such an expert like yourself
let those babies be buried like that?

184
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:29,295
It was a necessary measure
to prevent the disease from spreading.

185
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,173
Is it normal procedure here

186
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,550
to bury and cremate
sick children like that?

187
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,971
Well, you certainly have manners.

188
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,807
Please have a seat.

189
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,357
As you already know…

190
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,944
everything done here is legal.

191
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,574
How do the babies end up coming here?

192
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,494
I'm sure you're already aware.

193
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,667
Countless children are abandoned
these days.

194
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,795
I understand
that was common during wartime,

195
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,338
but who does that nowadays?

196
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:21,222
You couldn't be more ignorant
of the state of child welfare.

197
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,433
Child… What?

198
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,728
Ah. I'm referring
to the well-being of children.

199
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:32,525
It's quite a developed field
over in America.

200
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,820
It seems many children are adopted
from this orphanage.

201
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,904
That's right.

202
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:43,077
Thankfully, many people all over the world
take pity on our children.

203
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,622
When you adopt kids,
do you receive any compensation?

204
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,918
We do receive a small fee
as outlined in the law.

205
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,294
I'm not talking about that.

206
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,964
I'm referring to any premiums
or extra charges for rush adoptions.

207
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,300
What did you just say?

208
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,928
What game are you playing here?

209
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,304
Are you…

210
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,975
accusing me of trafficking orphans?

211
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,185
That was not our intention, ma'am.

212
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,729
I'm very offended.

213
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,356
Please leave immediately.

214
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,358
I was just asking out of curiosity.

215
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,527
I didn't want to have to say this,

216
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,114
but I'm also the secretary
of the Liberal Party's Women's Society.

217
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,867
The Society consists of the wives
of Liberal Party officials

218
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,453
and figures from the Gyeongmudae,
the president's office.

219
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,705
I regularly rub elbows with the elite,

220
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,749
and you accuse me of such evil?

221
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,500
We're not accusing you of anything.

222
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,088
Which station are you two from?

223
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,884
I'll speak with your superior…

224
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,012
to lodge an official complaint.

225
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,099
I'm Kim Sangsun
from Jongnam Police Station.

226
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,726
Kim Samsoon of Jongnam?

227
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,644
It's Sangsun, not Samsoon.

228
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,857
And I'm Park Yeonghan.

229
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,026
"Park Yeonghan."

230
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,072
I'm telling you I'm right.

231
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,867
She abducts children
to sell for a premium,

232
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,245
kills the ones that no one wants
and buries them here.

233
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,124
Apparently, she and her friends
are too elite to do such a thing.

234
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,335
You saw the photos, right?

235
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,754
All the kids looked miserable and starved.

236
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,881
I bet you, she's starving them.

237
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,300
That orphanage director
has to be a horrible witch.

238
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,220
How can you be so sure?

239
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,932
I grew up an orphan too.

240
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,896
Why look so surprised?
Never seen an orphan before?

241
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,107
No… No, it's not that.

242
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,402
You should've told me earlier.

243
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,322
You just had me shocked over nothing.

244
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,241
Well, it's nothing to brag about.

245
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,162
One minute.

246
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,211
Did someone hit you?

247
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,553
Tell me what happened.
I'll teach them a lesson.

248
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,306
Thank you, but nobody hit me.

249
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,142
Are you feeling ill?

250
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,228
No, sir.

251
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,777
Take this and get some bread
with your friends.

252
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,238
No, thank you.

253
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,825
Hey…

254
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,287
Why does he cry with so much sorrow?

255
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,040
It's funny how such a small kid
can be too proud for handouts.

256
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,170
Even the smallest kids
can be too proud to beg.

257
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,840
Hey, come here! Hey!

258
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,636
What?

259
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,971
He got in an accident?

260
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,600
He was hit by a car on his way to work.

261
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,184
Huh?

262
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,901
When did this happen?

263
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,445
Just this morning.

264
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,739
Another morning incident?

265
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,367
First, the military surgeon
was transferred and disappeared,

266
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,329
and now the journalist is unconscious
after an accident.

267
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,998
I'm telling you,
the orphanage director is behind all this.

268
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,250
How would she orchestrate this?

269
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,878
She's the secretary
of the Liberal Party's Women's Society,

270
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,254
that Audio or Audrey or whatever.

271
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,340
Who did you just say?

272
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,175
Audrey. Audrey Ko.

273
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,095
Audrey is the director of Angel House?

274
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,181
Yes. Do you know her, sir?

275
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,390
Goodness.

276
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,061
I knew she had been lying too low.

277
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,146
How are you acquainted with her?

278
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,691
When I was with the Special Investigation
Committee of Anti-National Activities.

279
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,902
Oh. You were a former special police, sir?

280
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,029
Well, back in the day.

281
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,240
Audrey, my foot.

282
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,992
Her real name is Ko Geumja.

283
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,536
Tell us more, Chief.

284
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,957
Well, there was a pro-Japanese group
called the New Joseon Patriots

285
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,458
during the colonial period.

286
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,960
Ko Geumja was a member there.

287
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,044
My gosh.

288
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,089
I could just tell
she had the face of a traitor.

289
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,133
She used to run Sinkwang Academy,

290
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,802
which was basically an orphanage.

291
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:14,848
As subjects of the grand Empire of Japan,

292
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:21,438
we must pledge our bodies and souls
to our dear Emperor!

293
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,565
That is our duty!

294
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,943
She even took kids who weren't orphans.

295
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,655
Then she brainwashed them completely
and sent them off to war.

296
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,700
By fulfilling our duties,

297
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:36,161
we will taste eternal glory

298
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,623
as subjects of the one true Empire!

299
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,754
All the while, she was paid immensely
by the Japanese government.

300
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,592
So she's been selling kids off
for a while now.

301
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,802
That's right.

302
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,888
She still may not have fixed
her old habits.

303
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,142
Where did she even get the name Audrey?

304
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,145
Once the committee was dissolved,
Ko Geumja fled to America.

305
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,314
Then she came back
with some sort of degree

306
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,733
and changed her name then.

307
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,069
I guess she took over
Angel House after that.

308
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,323
Even if Audrey had abducted those babies,

309
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,825
she wouldn't have done it herself.

310
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,870
Perhaps she had
her employees do it for her?

311
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,123
No, Ko Geumja is a very thorough woman.

312
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,584
I'm sure she hired someone
who doesn't know her.

313
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,131
Let's start over
from when the babies went missing.

314
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,550
Sangsun and I will start with Jongwoo.

315
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,719
You two ask around the other stations
and find out

316
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,805
- if there are any more missing kids.
- Yes, sir.

317
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,265
Chief, could you find out

318
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,392
where the military surgeon
got transferred to?

319
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,312
- All right.
- We already found that out.

320
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,273
- I thought they wouldn't say.
- But we found out.

321
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,985
I was about to tell you all,
but Chief Yu's story got to me.

322
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,238
- Where did he go?
- Morang Island, sir.

323
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,449
What? Morang Island?

324
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,659
We were told
it's a small island near Haenam.

325
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,244
He was sent to a clinic there.

326
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,497
They really sent him
to the end of the earth.

327
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,666
How did you find that out though?

328
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,253
Well, you see…

329
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,799
We convinced him earnestly

330
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,634
as a fellow public servant.

331
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,137
We poured our hearts into it.

332
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,349
- You still won't tell us?
- Please.

333
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,642
Pipe down.

334
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,685
Please stop! Stop!

335
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,731
Keep it down.

336
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,693
Are you sure
you poured your heart into it?

337
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,529
Yes, my whole heart.

338
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,322
Not your muscles?

339
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,533
Of course not.

340
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,701
You can't do that these days.

341
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,538
- Hojeong.
- Yes, Chief.

342
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,332
You go to Morang Island.

343
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,708
Sir?

344
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,753
Well, I have horrible seasickness.

345
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,922
Recite the times table. It does the trick.

346
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,341
2 times 1 is 2,
2 times 2 is 4.

347
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,759
- Then 2 times 6 is?
- 12.

348
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,053
- Then 6 times 8 is?
- 48.

349
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,471
Good. Just do that on the boat.

350
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,223
Park Yeonghan and Kim Sangsun!

351
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,808
Where did they go?

352
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,976
Scatter up! Move!

353
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,894
- I'll handle this. Go, hurry.
- Damn it.

354
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,646
Hurry, hurry!

355
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,439
Hurry up.

356
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,066
Come on, where did they…

357
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,569
What? What's that? Hey!

358
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,322
"Isn't there a big cat over there?"

359
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,200
- "Isn't there…
- It's asking if something's there.

360
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,036
…over tere."

361
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,083
Look.

362
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,918
"There" is spelled with an "h."

363
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,754
You need an "h" between the "t" and "e."

364
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,506
Can't I just spell it this way?

365
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,800
Proper spelling
is a fundamental part of writing.

366
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,137
Well, I want to wring spelling's neck.

367
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,806
You're being nasty again.

368
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,351
I told you not to do that.

369
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,105
Sungchil.

370
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,274
Hey, Sungchil.

371
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,567
How's it going?

372
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,404
I don't know how I could repay you.

373
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,657
Don't repay me.
Repay your teacher in there.

374
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,867
I will, Detective.

375
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,287
Study hard and become
the great man you want to be.

376
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,496
Then treat your grandma well.

377
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,083
I'm going to be
a brave and great man like you.

378
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,293
Come on.

379
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,128
Right. Here.

380
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,631
- What is it?
- Just take it.

381
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,854
You should wear nicer shoes for work.

382
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,524
You can't work at the market
with your feet looking like that.

383
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,572
- Detective Park.
- Go and study. I'll go now.

384
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,077
Detective.

385
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,249
Thank you so much.

386
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,632
Go and study.

387
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,641
Flip them over.

388
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,769
No!

389
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,938
Please. I'm begging you.

390
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,274
Then pay your damn dues.

391
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,651
You thieving punk.
How many times did I tell you?

392
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,819
Mate!

393
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,031
"Mate"? Are you a rebel or something?

394
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,992
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

395
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,994
You can't even fight alone.

396
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,496
You're always running around
with your little friends.

397
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,207
Are you out of your mind? Say that again.

398
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,835
You aren't the Viper
because you're fierce.

399
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,295
It's because of your triangular head.

400
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,843
- Oh, no.
- Please stop it.

401
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,721
One more word, and I'll kill you.

402
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,683
Hey, Triangle Head.

403
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,727
You want me to stab you in the face?

404
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,563
- Come here.
- No!

405
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,064
- What did you say?
- Calm down.

406
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,567
Chairman Lee won't be happy
if he finds out.

407
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,360
Let's just go, sir.

408
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,863
Hey, Sungchil.

409
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,991
Move!

410
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,161
Pay your dues or end up like him!

411
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,079
Pay what you owe!

412
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,124
6 times 5 is…

413
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,964
6 times 4 is 24. 6 times 5 is…

414
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,009
3 times 9 is…

415
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,844
Yeonghan!

416
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,263
Reciting the times table doesn't work!

417
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,185
Did anyone come here that day?

418
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,438
No, no one did.

419
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,316
It was just us two.

420
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,318
I see.

421
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,530
I don't think
the kidnapper was a complete stranger.

422
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,534
If they walked right into the house,
I doubt they were.

423
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,331
They must've had to walk this narrow alley
with the baby for five minutes.

424
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,919
It had to be someone
familiar with that house and this alley.

425
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:02,506
And someone should've seen them
carrying the baby along this alley,

426
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,632
but no one did.

427
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,302
That means they hid the baby in something

428
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,512
when they took him away.

429
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,349
Who did she say visits regularly?

430
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,810
The coal deliveryman and the paperboy.

431
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,437
What about on other days?

432
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,189
On other days,

433
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,484
the coal deliveryman and…

434
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,611
Sir, please try to jog your memory.

435
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,823
Have you seen anyone suspicious
when you came to this area?

436
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,283
- Any information would help.
- I swear I haven't.

437
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,785
I'm busy, so scram.

438
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,995
…the junk scavenger.

439
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,747
- Sir.
- Yes?

440
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,874
You know that house with the blue gate?

441
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,418
Their baby Jongwoo disappeared.

442
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,294
I know nothing about that.

443
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,964
Have you noticed
any suspicious people around?

444
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,716
Anyone carrying bundles or whatever?

445
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,843
I told you I haven't.

446
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,264
The lady who sells American cosmetics
drops by sometimes.

447
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:56,059
Have you noticed any suspicious people
around the neighborhood?

448
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,437
It could be someone carrying a large bag.

449
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,314
I haven't.

450
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,316
Hmm…

451
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,777
In times like these,

452
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,281
it's best to interrogate
whoever seems the most suspicious.

453
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,992
The most suspicious?
Oh, you mean Audio?

454
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,620
What is the meaning of this?

455
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,540
Senior Superintendent Choi has ordered us…

456
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,377
to beg you…

457
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,588
for forgiveness, ma'am.

458
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,676
He gave us orders to devote ourselves
to the orphanage today.

459
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,514
We're deeply sorry
for failing to recognize your eminence

460
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,224
and for our rash behavior.

461
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,101
Kill us if you'd like, ma'am!

462
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,607
We can't imagine how enraged
you must have been with us.

463
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,442
We are truly sorry.

464
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,030
Until you forgive us,

465
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,365
we will spend hours…

466
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,994
No, days, bowing to you in repentance.

467
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,331
You should've acted this way
from the start.

468
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,082
In fact,

469
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,294
please flog us…

470
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,630
with your cane of love.

471
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,843
I will gladly be flogged, ma'am!

472
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,221
Director Audrey Ko

473
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,806
We will accept any punishment you give us.

474
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,560
You may both stand.

475
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:36,284
God commands us to forgive
those who have sinned the most.

476
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,787
As your way of repentance…

477
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,832
I expect you to devote yourself
to volunteer work today.

478
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,336
Thank you.

479
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,796
- Thank you.
- We won't let you down.

480
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,381
- Follow me.
- Yes.

481
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,636
Hey, we did a great job.

482
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,221
I can't believe we made it in.

483
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,391
I absolutely hated the kneeling part.

484
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,852
And I was so scared
she'd actually flog… Oh?

485
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,781
Hey, where are you going?

486
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,783
To get vaccinated.

487
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,537
- At the nurse's office?
- No, at Daejin Clinic.

488
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,048
That little one from last time
looks just like me as a kid.

489
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:40,432
Damn it.
Why can't we find anything?

490
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,726
Well, we're finding trash.

491
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,314
You go look over there.

492
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,361
What did they burn?

493
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,506
Is it what I think it is?

494
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,765
I'm very sorry.

495
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:05,975
We should have got to him…

496
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,687
before this happened.

497
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,357
Jongwoo.

498
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,993
Jongwoo!

499
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,257
Jongwoo!

500
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,847
Isn't this enough evidence
to lock her up, sir?

501
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,223
Definitely not.

502
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,225
What if she claims they embroidered it?

503
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,270
And Senior Superintendent Choi will burn
all the evidence before then.

504
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,063
Whatever we try to do,

505
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,399
she'll use her Liberal Party connections
to evade the law.

506
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,110
Did you meet with the other parents?

507
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,822
I met with the parents
of the two other missing kids.

508
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,950
I noticed two strange things.

509
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,791
One kid went missing
while the mother was out

510
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,126
giving her husband his lunch.

511
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,211
The other kid's mother runs a restaurant.

512
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,880
Her kid disappeared
while she was at the bank

513
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,048
getting change before she headed to work.

514
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,969
So the kidnapper knew their routines?

515
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:24,971
Right.

516
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,515
They also knew when Jongwoo's mother
had to take her medicine.

517
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,641
You're right.

518
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,103
So Ko Geumja hired a professional,
someone like a cow thief.

519
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,981
What's the other strange thing?

520
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,065
Right.

521
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,944
This doesn't seem that important,

522
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,739
but their houses had
the same type of cosmetics.

523
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,283
I went to give my husband
his lunch like always,

524
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,869
and that's when…

525
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,997
Goodness.

526
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,584
Ravlon Cosmetics

527
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,836
And what type is that?

528
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,672
It's an American cosmetics brand
that's smuggled here, sir.

529
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,132
It's called Ravlon.

530
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,218
They're sold with labels
just like the domestic ones.

531
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,763
Ravlon Cosmetics?

532
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,934
The lady who sells American cosmetics
drops by sometimes.

533
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,270
Ravlon Cosmetics

534
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,689
If it was the cosmetics lady
who took the kids,

535
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,192
how do you think
she would've carried them?

536
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:23,446
Ladies who sell cosmetics
carry large bags around with them.

537
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,617
Have I seen anyone suspicious?

538
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,370
It could be someone carrying a large bag.

539
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,539
You're right.

540
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,906
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

541
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:23,882
- Let's go.
- Okay.

542
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,227
Hey, you're late. Go on in.

543
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,691
Did you print it right?

544
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:42,817
I'll pay you back soon.

545
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,028
Come on, give me a bit more.

546
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,158
- Damn it.
- All right.

547
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,788
- How lucky.
- You're out of luck today.

548
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,083
Darn it.

549
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,418
Just one more round.

550
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,086
- What?
- I've had enough.

551
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,421
Let's wrap it up now.

552
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,757
Go and bring Yeonghan here.

553
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,258
Got it.

554
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,679
Let me take this cash.

555
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,640
You're taking it back?

556
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,809
- You don't have enough money.
- Just deal the cards.

557
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,811
Move!

558
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,399
Nothing is going on here.
Just keep playing.

559
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,276
Who's in charge here?

560
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,236
We need to talk.

561
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,906
Calm down, everyone.

562
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,035
Who are you to barge in here?

563
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,286
Are you the boss here?

564
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,455
Jeez.

565
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,041
This is who we are.

566
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,962
Hey, man.

567
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,547
You slipped right out of my hands.

568
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,595
My gosh.

569
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,808
Why did you take off?

570
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,559
We just wanted to talk.

571
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,187
I thought you were shutting down
my gambling den.

572
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,023
You know the cosmetics lady
who was sitting here?

573
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,149
She's a regular, isn't she?

574
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,443
That's right, sir.

575
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,237
How much does she owe you?

576
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:13,366
I'd say… about 200,000 hwan.

577
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,332
I need to ask you a favor.

578
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,048
Let go of me!

579
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,843
How could you come to my house?

580
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,679
Shut up and pay me back
my 200,000 hwan by tomorrow.

581
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,055
What are you talking about?

582
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,890
You gave me until next month.

583
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,560
The cops barged in and shut my place down!

584
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,937
I can't come up
with that money by tomorrow!

585
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,940
If you don't,
I'll tell your husband everything.

586
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,234
- Wait.
- Let go!

587
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,488
What do I do?

588
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,376
Did somebody send him off to starve?

589
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,545
Well, it wasn't me.

590
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,386
I recited the times table and threw up.

591
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,472
I recited the quadratic formula
and still threw up.

592
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,102
So? Did you manage to meet
the military surgeon?

593
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,981
I did.

594
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,566
To be accurate,

595
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,194
they hadn't died of measles.

596
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,237
There were signs of vomiting,

597
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,281
but no signs of rash at all.

598
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,075
In the papers,

599
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,495
they said one child was polydactyly.

600
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,746
That's right.

601
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,623
But not only was one polydactyly,

602
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:48,086
but two other children also had
external disabilities.

603
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,463
What about the other seven?

604
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,549
Based on the signs of their development,

605
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,676
it's likely they were disabled.

606
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,555
In addition, all of the children

607
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,433
had signs of vaccination.

608
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,019
Does the orphanage vaccinate the kids?

609
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,105
The kid said they go to a clinic.

610
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,981
What was it called?

611
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,525
Daejin Clinic.

612
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,735
Hey, where are you going?

613
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,487
To get vaccinated.

614
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,322
At the nurse's office?

615
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,950
No, at Daejin Clinic.

616
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,868
To summarize,

617
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,705
some of the abducted children
were disabled,

618
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:29,836
and they were discarded
because no one would adopt them.

619
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,172
All right.

620
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,174
Let's get the cosmetics lady first.

621
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,094
We've already set the stage for her, sir.

622
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,472
She'll fall for the trap
as she's way too deep in debt.

623
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,248
Seungmok's mom.

624
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,376
Seungmok's mom.

625
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,255
Is no one home?

626
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,674
I guess she went somewhere.

627
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,303
So you're not home, Seungmok's mom?

628
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,824
Seungmok! My goodness!

629
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,910
Where are you, Seungmok?

630
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,077
Ma'am.

631
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,621
Who are you?

632
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,872
I'm with the police.

633
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,625
We know where your child is,
so you can rest assured.

634
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,831
Get her.

635
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,087
- Hey, get her!
- Yes, sir!

636
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,631
Go after her!

637
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,174
Damn it.

638
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,389
Jeez!

639
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,307
Are you all right? I'm sorry.

640
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,901
I'm a cop.

641
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,158
Hey!

642
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,202
- Yeonghan, damn it.
- Hey.

643
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,663
Stop the car. Stop!

644
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,625
Yeonghan!

645
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,714
Wait. Did you get the plate number?

646
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,300
No. It didn't have a license plate.

647
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,676
Damn it.

648
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,221
I have no idea who they are.

649
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,724
And yet you abduct kids for them?

650
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,183
Well,

651
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,228
someone at the gambling den
offered to pay me

652
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,105
if I did what they said.

653
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,606
Who?

654
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,817
A young man who sometimes comes.

655
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,486
Bring as many children as you can,

656
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,863
preferably infants.

657
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,991
You meet lots of mothers
selling cosmetics, don't you?

658
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,202
Target mothers
who are alone with their children.

659
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,705
Grab the kids
as soon as the mothers are distracted.

660
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:56,083
Do a good job and paying off
your gambling debt won't be a problem.

661
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,128
Don't worry.
You won't be doing anything bad.

662
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,590
How did you two make contact?

663
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,343
We left and exchanged messages
at the coffee shop by the intersection.

664
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,720
That's how we communicated.

665
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,389
What are the names and jobs
of the man and the woman in the scarf?

666
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,016
I don't know.

667
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:18,105
If you lie to us,
you'll rot in jail for 30 years.

668
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,565
I really don't know.

669
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,817
I swear I don't know! I'm serious!

670
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,778
Please believe me, Detectives.

671
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,449
Daejin Clinic

672
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,825
Take care.

673
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,248
- Come in.
- Excuse me.

674
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,419
- We're the police.
- I see.

675
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,755
What might bring you here?

676
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,132
We have some questions
about the vaccines you administer

677
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,675
to the Angel House kids.

678
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,344
I see.

679
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,098
Why don't you come this way?

680
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,063
Damn it.

681
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,110
Are you okay?

682
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,495
It isn't just vaccines, is it?

683
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:18,040
It's your job to take a look
at the abducted kids

684
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,168
and determine
which ones are disabled, isn't it?

685
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,340
Answer us now.

686
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,931
Guys. Hey, tie up this prick.

687
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,101
- You better not play with me.
- Yes, I sorted out the disabled kids

688
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,602
and gave them vaccines.

689
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,022
Who brought the abducted kids
to your clinic?

690
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,275
An Angel House employee.

691
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,651
Which employee?

692
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,278
I don't know the specifics.

693
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,613
I just know they work at Angel House.

694
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,701
But you know their face, right?

695
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:56,912
Yes.

696
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,666
We're bringing in
every single Angel House employee.

697
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,334
Then we'll search the whole place.

698
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,340
Angel House

699
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,638
- Arrest them all!
- Yes, sir!

700
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,448
Where's Director Audrey?

701
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,534
Apparently, she's at the Liberal Party's
Women's Society meeting.

702
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,161
Damn it.

703
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,330
I was hoping to arrest her right away.

704
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,502
Hey, kids.

705
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,631
This won't take too long,
so sit tight, all right?

706
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,300
I'll give you guys some chocolate, okay?

707
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,261
Why are you taking away our teachers?

708
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,848
We just need to ask them some questions,
so don't worry.

709
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,185
Does this have to do…

710
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,813
with the ten babies, by any chance?

711
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,275
You know about them?

712
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:10,986
No.

713
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,287
Yeonghan.

714
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,414
Something was found in the basement.

715
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,263
They look like diapers.

716
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,058
So this was where the babies were.

717
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,061
How could they lock the babies up in here?

718
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,814
Wait, take a look at this.

719
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,149
Why? What is it?

720
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,237
The joint on this furnace pipe
is severely damaged.

721
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,906
It couldn't have been done by accident.

722
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,075
It's as if someone tore it open
on purpose.

723
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,455
The furnace is full of coal.

724
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,332
So the gas is what killed the babies.

725
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:06,917
No.

726
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,503
Whoever broke the pipe…

727
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,214
is who killed the babies.

728
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,988
Hey, Ms. Yoon.

729
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,781
Anything to say?

730
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,328
Who drove the car
when you abducted the children?

731
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,331
Director Ko's secretary.

732
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,669
Did Ko Geumja order you
to abduct babies and kill them?

733
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,547
No.

734
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,300
Director Ko knows nothing about this.

735
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,385
Only Secretary Kim and I were involved.

736
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,012
How does that make sense?

737
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,138
It's true.

738
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,390
I also broke the furnace pipe open.

739
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,142
My gosh.

740
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,479
You're making this
harder for all of us, damn it.

741
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,077
How was your meeting
about the state of our country?

742
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,163
I knew this car looked familiar.

743
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,123
You're a good driver, by the way.

744
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,754
What's this about today?

745
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:35,631
Ms. Ko Geumja,

746
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,966
you're under arrest for illegal adoption…

747
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,093
What are you doing?

748
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,344
You little…

749
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,556
Move, and I'll kill you.

750
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,438
…conspiracy to commit murder…

751
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,191
…and child abduction.

752
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,820
You think you can handle the backlash?

753
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,990
Let's talk at the station.

754
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,160
We've collected the full set.

755
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,787
The person who gave orders,

756
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,249
the person who abducted the children…

757
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,544
and the one who killed them.

758
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,131
And this lists the people
who paid illegal premiums

759
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,801
on top of the legal adoption fees
and the exact amounts.

760
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,430
It's all here, in this ledger.

761
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,515
Look here.

762
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,228
I had no idea any of this was happening.

763
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,897
It seems to me

764
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,109
that these two abducted children

765
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,237
and had them adopted
for a premium behind my back.

766
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,616
And fearing they'd get caught, they…

767
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,701
My God.

768
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:50,038
They must have killed
those poor, innocent babies.

769
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,666
How could I have not known?

770
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,629
How did you even think of creating
such a ledger

771
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,840
and putting it in my desk drawer?

772
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,760
Were you trying to slander me?

773
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,722
Yes, she's right.

774
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,017
I secretly sold off the kids for adoption.

775
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,603
I conspired with Ms. Yoon
out of sheer greed and--

776
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:13,687
I had always…

777
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,814
hated Director Ko.

778
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,941
I wanted to put a dent in her career.

779
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,443
Dear God!

780
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:27,326
I should have listened to my father
when he told me to never trust others.

781
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:31,622
It's my fault that I couldn't see
what was under my nose.

782
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,752
You all have such great chemistry.

783
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,172
Did you rehearse this story beforehand?

784
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,133
You could all act this out on stage.

785
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,015
Instead of trying to frame
an innocent person,

786
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,975
why don't you offer some evidence,

787
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,937
you incompetent pigs?

788
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,522
"Incompetent"?

789
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,273
How dare you, old woman?

790
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,192
"Old woman"? What's your name?

791
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,321
Jeez.

792
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:05,989
Come with me.

793
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,543
Something was fishy,
so I did some digging.

794
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,505
Ms. Yoon and Secretary Kim
used to work at Sinkwang Academy.

795
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,757
What?

796
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,759
- Damn it.
- You mean they're from

797
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,262
the pro-Japanese orphanage
Ko Geumja used to operate?

798
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,766
No wonder
they were so eager to take the fall.

799
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,102
Getting a confession out of them

800
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,228
won't be easy.

801
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,897
I'm sure they'll just try
to take the fall even more.

802
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:39,982
Damn it!

803
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,359
Hey, where are you off to?

804
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,778
I'm getting heated.

805
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,905
I need to cool off with a smoke.

806
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:06,300
Do you two realize
that you're also victims of Ko Geumja?

807
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,510
She's using you!

808
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,555
Ms. Yoon.

809
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,974
If you don't talk to us,
you'll be sentenced to death.

810
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,143
But it'll get commuted
if you confess to Ko's crimes.

811
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,689
I will gladly accept my punishment.

812
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:23,358
You don't have to be glad about it.

813
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,235
You were just following orders.

814
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,030
I will also gladly accept my punishment.

815
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,037
What's going on here?

816
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,040
Everybody, out!

817
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,419
I apologize for my negligence.

818
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,255
It's not your fault.

819
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:50,302
You can blame
your incompetent subordinates.

820
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,013
Hey! Apologize to her right now!

821
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,348
There's no need for an apology.

822
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,226
Just sack all of them.

823
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,104
I see. As you wish, ma'am.

824
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,065
The chairwoman is here to see you.

825
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,858
- Oh, my. Chairwoman!
- You all…

826
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,903
- I'll deal with you later.
- I'm deeply sorry.

827
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,947
Now, who's that?

828
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,990
The chairwoman of the Women's Society.

829
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,701
Just apologize.

830
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,537
Otherwise, you'll get arrested
by the special police tomorrow.

831
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,789
Please use my office to chat.

832
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,499
- All right.
- This way, ma'am.

833
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,625
Stop right there.

834
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,335
You startled me.

835
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,424
Going somewhere?

836
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,015
Ma'am, I'm deeply sorry
for taking up your precious time

837
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,477
over such a trivial matter
this late at night.

838
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:46,692
My heart still pounds so frightfully
when I think of what my employees did.

839
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,444
Youngnam, tell us what you know.

840
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,751
While playing outside,

841
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,088
I came across the place.

842
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,007
What place?

843
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,384
Where the babies were.

844
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:22,602
Ms. Yoon was feeding the babies milk.

845
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,357
I counted the babies

846
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,526
because there were so many of them.

847
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,654
There were 10.

848
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:38,160
I went to look at the babies every day

849
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,495
because they were so cute.

850
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:45,584
I went in the mornings
whenever Ms. Yoon fed the babies.

851
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,879
But that day…

852
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,050
Why are there so many defective ones?

853
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,845
- Do your jobs properly!
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

854
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,346
I'm deeply sorry.

855
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,474
What are you going to do
about these useless maggots?

856
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,268
- Huh?
- I-I'll take care of them, Director Ko.

857
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,318
You can't do one thing right.

858
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,163
My gosh. How ridiculous.

859
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,542
What were you thinking
using this little child

860
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,170
to fabricate all these lies?

861
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,797
My goodness.

862
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,965
Exactly, ma'am.

863
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,551
This is an important case, Detective Kim.

864
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,720
Why did you involve
a little child like this?

865
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:39,930
Let us go, Chairwoman.

866
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,766
That child is old enough
to give an accurate testimony.

867
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,852
This child is young enough
to be scared into saying anything!

868
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:48,980
Mr. Kim Youngnam,

869
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,651
were you taught to lie to adults?

870
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:55,946
B-But I'm not lying.

871
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,832
Your left hand, Director Ko.

872
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,836
You can't do one thing right.

873
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,258
Are you hurt, Director Ko?

874
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,009
Are you all right?

875
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,640
If he's lying,

876
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,392
there wouldn't be a scar
on your left hand.

877
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:26,977
Take off your glove.

878
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,690
Well…

879
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,444
I refuse.

880
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,656
I don't have to listen to you!

881
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:40,740
Yes, you do.

882
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,451
He's the detective
who'll prove you guilty.

883
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,245
Chairwoman.

884
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,956
This is a waste of your time.
We should go now.

885
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,710
It's such a relief
you're here, Chairwoman.

886
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:56,256
If Secretary Audrey Ko really is innocent,
shouldn't she prove so?

887
00:52:56,965 --> 00:53:00,302
It would be a shame
if she besmirched the Women's Society.

888
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:05,599
Ma'am, these people are slandering me
to my face.

889
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,434
Give me your hand.

890
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,187
Goodness, ma'am.

891
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,563
Now.

892
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:17,986
Your left hand.

893
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,489
No, wait. I…

894
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,741
Damn you!

895
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,578
That's not what I meant. I was just…

896
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,040
I hurt my hand
while organizing my desk drawers.

897
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,249
Oh!

898
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,876
Chairwoman.

899
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:36,338
Ma'am! Chairwoman!

900
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,131
Ms. Ko Geumja.

901
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,467
You're also charged with infanticide.

902
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,718
- This can't be real.
- Cuff her.

903
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,720
- Yes, sir.
- This can't be happening.

904
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,556
Get your dirty hands off of me.

905
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,849
- Stay still.
- Let go.

906
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,517
- Cuff her.
- Let go of me, you prick!

907
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:54,064
Is this how you repay me
for taking you in, you orphan scum?

908
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,108
You little prick.
You must've lost your nerves.

909
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:58,735
You better watch your back!

910
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,696
How could you tell he knew everything?

911
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,156
I know how it feels…

912
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,951
to be too scared to talk.

913
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,372
I'll just take a quick look.

914
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:57,961
Gosh.

915
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,337
It must have really hurt.

916
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,132
I know how it feels to get beaten up.

917
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,675
Really?

918
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,260
Of course.

919
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,971
I got whooped by my orphanage director
and the boys around town.

920
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,472
I was the neighborhood punching bag.

921
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,644
I was a lot smaller and weaker
than you as a kid,

922
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,605
so I came up with my own way of fighting.

923
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,441
What was it?

924
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,528
Biting as hard as I could.

925
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,698
If you're weaker than them,
just bite as hard as you can.

926
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,743
The bullies eventually run away
if you keep biting.

927
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,329
Can I get good at it too?

928
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,413
Definitely.

929
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,124
When in doubt, bite.

930
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,084
They'll all take off.

931
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,306
The 10 babies were there.

932
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,771
I saw them.

933
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:03,860
Why are you crying?

934
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,447
I admire you and Youngnam

935
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,450
both so much,

936
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,452
and I feel so sad.

937
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,247
Hey, save your tears.

938
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,461
- What's wrong with me?
- Look at you two.

939
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,886
Good job, Detective Kim.

940
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,561
I didn't do a good job, sir.

941
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,816
Those 10 babies won't come back to life.

Please.

953
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,716
Aim!

954
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,266
Fire!

955
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,061
Aim!

956
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,646
Fire!

957
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,028
Hey! Why aren't you firing?

958
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,073
What are you doing, student soldier?

959
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,578
Don't look at me.
Look forward, aim and fire.

960
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,332
What's wrong with you? Face forward.

961
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,541
Please spare me.

962
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,627
Just aim and fire. Like this.

963
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,295
Aim.

964
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:30,089
I'm carrying a child.

965
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,592
- Please spare me.
- Shut up! Tsk.

966
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,802
Fire. Fire!

967
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,888
Fire, you little prick!

968
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,685
You dumb prick.

969
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,729
This is how you shoot.

970
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,424
Closed

971
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,844
You'll meet great people over there.

972
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,972
I looked into it, so don't worry.

973
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,599
- I'm not worried.
- Really?

974
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,184
I have my secret weapon now.

975
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,690
Goodness.

976
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,859
Chulsoo, listen to your brother, okay?

977
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,570
Okay.

978
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,196
Give me your hands.

979
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,198
Hold tight.

980
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,202
Never let your brother go, Youngnam.

981
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,579
I won't.

982
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:48,835
Go on now.

983
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,938
What happened to the director?

984
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,064
She died.

985
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,233
Her cellmate, Ms. Yoon,

986
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,986
stabbed her in the neck
with a snapped toothbrush.

987
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:18,364
Really? She just killed her like that?

988
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,658
Ms. Yoon might have stabbed her,

989
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:24,954
but it was Director Ko's own past
that truly killed her.

990
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:29,042
What goes around really must come around.

991
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,126
Exactly.

992
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,837
Detective Kim seemed
particularly relieved after.

993
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,423
- He was really devoted to this case.
- Mm.

994
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:40,428
By the way,
how is Sungchil following along?

995
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,514
Nansil is very strict with him,

996
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,266
so he has to study hard.

997
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,893
That's good to hear.

998
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:48,853
Thank you again

999
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:52,565
for offering him space to study
at your bookstore.

1000
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,776
There's a space for you too,

1001
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,653
so you're always welcome to come over.

1002
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,075
What is it?

1003
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,993
Should I get rid of your space?

1004
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,287
No, it's not that.

1005
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,956
It's curfew already.

1006
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,708
- But I'm a cop--
- Let's run.

1007
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,001
Wait.

1008
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,003
- Hyeju!
- Come on.

1009
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,051
But I'm a cop.

1010
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:39,445
Oh.

1011
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,424
Are you okay?

1012
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,217
Did I run too fast?

1013
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:06,764
What was that?

1014
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,350
You're a cop, so why did you run?

1015
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,435
You're right.

1016
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,146
I guess I wanted to be with you.

1017
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,190
Uh…

1018
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:20,278
That was a joke.
I actually don't have my ID on me.

1019
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,699
I think they're gone. We should go now.

1020
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,451
Not yet.

1021
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:29,579
They go around in pairs,
so they might return right away.

1022
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:32,498
That's all right.
I know a secret detour here.

1023
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,000
Wait.

1024
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,961
I'll be honest with you.

1025
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,844
Wait, isn't that…

1026
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,345
It's my police ID.

1027
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,099
I actually have it on me.

1028
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,145
It's just that I want to be with you.

1029
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,691
You could've just told me.

1030
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:02,403
Will you leave me a space
in your bookstore?

1031
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,280
Always.

1032
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:58,311
Chief Detective 1958

1033
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,146
Sungchil…

1034
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:02,607
Is it really Sungchil?

1035
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,483
Any witnesses?

1036
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,360
- They're just afraid to talk.
How could they be like this?

1037
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,112


1038
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:09,405
I'm sure he did it.

1039
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:10,740
-

1040
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,617
-
I know you killed him.

1041
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,993


1042
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,745
- Do you have proof?

1043
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:17,246
I know who killed him,

1044
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,332
- but there's nothing I can do.

1045
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,292


1046
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,753
I'll give you a choice.

1047
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:27,340
Either die or work for me
and chase fortune and glory.

1048
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,926
Chairman Lee,
ruler of the heavens and the earth.

1049
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,386
I'm here to humbly offer you a proposal.
