1
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:32,949
Chief Detective 1958

2
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
This series is unrelated to any places,
persons, settings or events.

3
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,953
Scenes involving animals were filmed in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.

4
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,737
Climb up, Yeonghan!

5
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,322
- Hey.
- Damn you!

6
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,956
Get up, you punk.

7
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,043
You're under arrest
for attempted murder, Jung Heesung.

8
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,173
- Let us go in!
- No!

9
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,550
- What are you--
- Move!

10
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,431
Jung Heesung has been arrested
for attempted murder.

11
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,018
Go take care of your master, boys.

12
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,401
Episode 10
The Last Witness

13
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,864
Sir.

14
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,742
How dare you enter my house
while I'm not here?

15
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,953
What kind of insolence is this?

16
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,127
"Any brothers-in-arms are always welcome."

17
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,963
Those were your words, not mine.

18
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,341
Now is not a good time. Leave.

19
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,721
Don't you think things will get worse
if I leave right now?

20
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,642
I hear that you took the lead in importing

21
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,520
certain toys from Japan, Colonel.

22
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,688
What do you mean?

23
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,064
The pachinko.

24
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,568
It's a pinball machine, isn't it?

25
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,864
What did you find out?

26
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,117
College professors are up in arms
about the pinball machines

27
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,453
that Deputy Minister Jung Byungpil
pushed to be imported.

28
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,581
Even the Supreme Council
is concerned, sir.

29
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,082
How concerned?

30
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,918
His place in the Council

31
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,003
may be at risk.

32
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,885
Throw this out for me, will you?

33
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,179
Surely, I will.

34
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,975
- Look, you punk.
- You…

35
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,854
You and your father's lives
are under my thumb now.

36
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,692
You better kiss my feet from now on.

37
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:59,906
I heard the professors
are absolutely enraged about those toys.

38
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,115
I even hear complaints

39
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,203
that the government
is encouraging people to gamble.

40
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,415
What do all those armchair academics
know about reality?

41
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,212
Sure, but the problem is
that the chairman actually listens

42
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,256
to those armchair academics.

43
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,679
Keep going down this path…

44
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,474
and you'll fall out of favor
with the chairman.

45
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,270
What are you trying to say?

46
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,816
Actually, you know what?

47
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,780
Whatever you do,
your situation is hopeless regardless.

48
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,286
Jongnam Hospital

49
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,454
Thanks for saving my life, Gyeonghwan.

50
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,039
Don't mention it.

51
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,457
Good job.

52
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,881
- Hop on in!
- Why don't you go ride your horse?

53
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,717
This guy.

54
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,679
Good job in there, Officer Nam.

55
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:09,392
How much do you know about your own son?

56
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:14,063
That accident at Jongnam Intersection
where his friends died.

57
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,107
That wasn't an accident.

58
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,651
It was a murder case.

59
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:23,364
And your son is the murderer.

60
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,867
That's ridiculous!

61
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,786
If you don't accept what I say…

62
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,041
you'll have to deal
with bigger problems down the road.

63
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,169
What do I mean?

64
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,463
Well…

65
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,014
This is another victim of your son.

66
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,225
He personally asked me
to deal with this matter,

67
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:56,147
and I managed to clean up his mess,
leaving no traces behind.

68
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,401
Imagine finding out
that your dear, precious son

69
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,195
turned out to be a murderer.

70
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,407
You must feel absolutely devastated.

71
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,495
Who on earth would believe this nonsense?

72
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,626
Colonel Jung.

73
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:21,714
I'm going to bundle up
everything I've told you until now…

74
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:27,637
and toss it with a spark right at you.

75
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,555
Imagine that.

76
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:34,060
The government has made a big deal
about eliminating corruption and evil.

77
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:38,272
Now imagine an official's son
turning out to be a murderer.

78
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,025
Once the people find out,

79
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,236
the chairman…

80
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,989
won't be so happy.

81
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,450
Well then?

82
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,702
The choice is yours.

83
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,871
Either your son…

84
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,209
gets acquitted of his crimes,

85
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,839
or we can all die together…

86
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,136
after exposing the truth.

87
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,576
Salute, Senior Superintendent Baek.

88
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,955
Jung Heesung has just been arrested
for attempted murder.

89
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:38,958
What was that?

90
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,760
- What's going on?
- He was caught attempting murder.

91
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,137
We have a witness, sir.

92
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,307
We'll just follow the law, sir.

93
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,810
Why don't I question Jung Heesung?

94
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,190
I'm afraid you can't, sir.

95
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,276
And why is that?

96
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,945
As our ancestors wisely said,

97
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,239
"Don't let a fox guard the henhouse."

98
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,368
If I don't question him,

99
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,704
you'll all get in trouble.

100
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:23,002
I'd like to find out
how much trouble we'll face.

101
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,504
Whatever happens to us,

102
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,797
we at Unit 1

103
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,967
will have Jung Heesung locked up.

104
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,261
As with you, sir, if we can.

105
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,846
Right.

106
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,850
It seems you all need
to be taught a bloody lesson…

107
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,269
you doggone pricks.

108
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,271
You don't want to know

109
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,357
how hard this dog can bite.

110
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,235
- Take him, Detective Seo.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,825
Senior Superintendent.

112
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,035
Senior Superintendent!

113
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,208
You don't have much time, sir.

114
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,670
Until you begin…

115
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,964
going down the drain, I mean.

116
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,051
We'll see about that.

117
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,442
- Damn this!
- Look at him.

118
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,864
You're under arrest for attempted murder.
At least pretend to be remorseful.

119
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,409
They'll try to have the charge dropped

120
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,369
since you were the only witness, Yeonghan.

121
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,539
I'm not the only one.
Nam Junggil was there too.

122
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,416
Do you think he'd willingly testify?

123
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,710
He'll have to expose his own crimes.

124
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,379
Then we'll make him do it.

125
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,589
Where's Officer Nam?

126
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,132
He's standing watch at the hospital.

127
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,634
He'll contact us if anything happens.

128
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,887
Jung Heesung
won't be going anywhere for now,

129
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,600
so get Nam Junggil's testimony,
Detectives Park and Kim.

130
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,767
Yes, sir.

131
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,230
Why aren't these two coming with us, sir?

132
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,440
I have a job for them.

133
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,988
What is it?

134
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,909
Master Heesung is being held
at Jongnam Police Station, sir.

135
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:20,995
What happened?

136
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,331
He entered Nam Junggil's ward

137
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,957
and attempted to murder him.

138
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,418
- That fool!
- Furthermore,

139
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,587
Nam Junggil has awakened.

140
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,759
I understand. Leave.

141
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,552
Yes, sir.

142
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,164
What if I have Nam Junggil killed first?

143
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,542
No.

144
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,463
Learn to Dance in Hawaii

145
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,840
Do I flee…

146
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,467
…and go abroad?

147
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,346
I'll need more money for that.

148
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,391
Much more money.

149
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,936
How do we convince Nam Junggil's mother?

150
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,606
She won't let her son confess to
sexual assault and abetting in a murder.

151
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,402
Salute.

152
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,028
Salute!

153
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,658
Did you take them under your wing,
Officer Nam?

154
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,660
Well…

155
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,623
Actually, Nam Junggil's mother
ordered you to be let in immediately.

156
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,921
Goodness.

157
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,550
I apologize
for the discourtesy, Detectives.

158
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,428
I didn't realize
you were trying to protect my son.

159
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,471
There's no need to apologize, ma'am.

160
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,015
I'm just glad
you understand our intention now.

161
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:09,937
But the thing is,
your son isn't entirely safe yet.

162
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,021
That's right.

163
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,233
Who knows what Jung Heesung
might do to harm him?

164
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:18,446
Then please tell me,
what can I do to get him executed?

165
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,448
Ah…

166
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,203
Your mother loves you dearly.

167
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,373
Why don't you testify
for your mother's sake?

168
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,167
Talk to us.

169
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,586
Jung Heesung is the one…

170
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,214
who killed Kim Soonjung, isn't he?

171
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,594
Look.

172
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,471
If it wasn't for us,

173
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,432
you'd be buried right next to
Kwon Hyunggeun and No Yoonhak.

174
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,602
You better not clam up
on the people who saved your life.

175
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,187
Nothing will change…

176
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,773
even if I testify.

177
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,776
You know he'll get off scot-free
thanks to his father.

178
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,111
"Nothing will change"?

179
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,363
Listen, you punk.

180
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:05,451
Jung Heesung faked a car accident
just to kill you.

181
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,746
He was caught trying to choke you
to death with this pillow.

182
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:14,251
And you're telling me
that you'll wait for that prick

183
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,086
to come back and finish the job?

184
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,632
Testify.

185
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,469
Not for anyone else but yourself.

186
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,140
If you want to live…

187
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,476
you need to testify.

188
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,647
All of us…

189
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,692
told him to stop.

190
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,403
We told him to go easy.

191
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,657
Nice.

192
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,659
He said he was tired of Mokryeongak.

193
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,287
He said we could pay

194
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,873
the factory girls a little money

195
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,251
and send them back.

196
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,169
So we did as he said.

197
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,923
But that night…

198
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,677
the opium didn't really take effect.

199
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,596
When the girl started resisting,

200
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,767
- Heesung beat her to death.
- What do we do now?

201
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,019
- Hey, is she really dead?
- Hyunggeun, wait.

202
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,646
You damned prick!

203
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,106
Damn it!

204
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,818
- What are you going to do now, you prick?
- Calm down. I'll take care of it.

205
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,239
Hello?

206
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,032
It's me, Junggil.

207
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,035
He told us about a cop who could help us

208
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,746
and we threw the body off a cliff.

209
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,626
And that cop was Baek Doseok?

210
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,921
Yes. He said he'd take care of it

211
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,007
and told us not to worry.

212
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,176
And it was just you three
in the car that night?

213
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,596
Heesung had an argument with Yoonhak.

214
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,766
At the time,
I thought Yoonhak had started the fight.

215
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,020
Then Jung Heesung gave you
expensive alcohol to break the tension.

216
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,983
And that bottle made the three of you
get in one car.

217
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,322
You all had no idea he was trying
to run you all over with a truck.

218
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,074
I-Is this enough?

219
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,411
Now get that prick executed.

220
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,916
- That won't be too easy.
- What do you mean?

221
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,542
Why won't it be easy?

222
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,713
What can be so hard for cops
to arrest and execute a murderer?

223
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,467
Calm down. We need evidence, all right?

224
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,803
Unless you're willing to testify in court.

225
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,056
Are you out of your mind?

226
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,100
I'm not doing that, ever.

227
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,603
Come on, Junggil.

228
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,899
If I testify in court,

229
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,320
not only will Heesung be at my neck,
but his dad as well.

230
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,451
That coward!

231
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,994
I knew this would happen.

232
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,082
Without his testimony,
Jung Heesung and Baek Doseok are free men.

233
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,586
Has Senior Superintendent Baek
made any movements, sir?

234
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,004
He's been quiet,

235
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,131
which is all the more suspicious.

236
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,175
Damn it.

237
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,471
Detective Park!

238
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,267
Where have you been
the past two days, Officer Bong?

239
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,770
Yangja, Boksoon, and I

240
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,189
convinced the people
who know the missing girls to talk.

241
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,317
They were either their fellow boarders

242
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,111
or night school classmates.

243
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,738
- Did you find anything out?
- Yes.

244
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,366
These are the identities
of the other four missing workers.

245
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,245
They did hesitate at first,

246
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,999
but thankfully,
they agreed to see us today.

247
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,673
I know how difficult
it must've been to show up,

248
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,425
so I'd like to thank you all first.

249
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,636
I heard Soonjung was killed.

250
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,680
Is it true?

251
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,309
Yes, it's true.

252
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,686
There's no way.

253
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,313
Are you sure she's not back home?

254
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,232
Have you checked?

255
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,656
She was discovered in this state.

256
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,874
We desperately need witnesses
to testify in court.

257
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,126
I know you all must feel afraid,

258
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,462
but those evil pricks

259
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,213
need to be punished.

260
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,466
No, what we want…

261
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,801
isn't their punishment.

262
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,221
What we want is to forget everything

263
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,474
as if nothing ever happened.

264
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,394
But would you be able to forget?

265
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,564
Don't you think
you'll live the rest of your lives…

266
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,067
with resentment in your heart?

267
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,404
We're only here because Officer Bong
asked us to see you just once

268
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,200
and that she'd never contact us again
if we did.

269
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,577
Please just leave us alone.

270
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,001
I understand.

271
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,504
I apologize…

272
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,256
for the painful request.

273
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,550
If you'll excuse us.

274
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,844
Wait. Just a moment.

275
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,809
Soonjung's mother asked me

276
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,603
to give you this.

277
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,730
Here.

278
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,966
She's been very worried about you all.

279
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,803
She says none of it is your fault.

280
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,180
She sincerely hopes

281
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,684
you can forget the past
and live healthy lives.

282
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,316
So please…

283
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,904
don't worry too much
about this matter today.

284
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,180
Hello? This is Baek Doseok.

285
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,058
We will need to make
a slight adjustment to our plans.

286
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,936
I apologize for only calling now.
Are you currently free?

287
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,731
All right.

288
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,942
What exactly is this adjustment
you speak of?

289
00:19:55,611 --> 00:20:00,741
I've completely changed my mind
about the terms I set for you.

290
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,535
And you see,

291
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,537
I've been thinking…

292
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,959
If you could muster up
100 million hwan for me,

293
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,630
I might feel more interested
in helping you out.

294
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,256
What do you say?

295
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,467
Listen here.

296
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,387
How am I supposed to come up
with that kind of money?

297
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,472
Look.

298
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,058
It's not the time for you to whine.

299
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:31,230
If you'd like to see Nam Junggil's corpse…

300
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,982
that's the price of admission.

301
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,904
Meet me at Jongnam Cathedral at 11 p.m.

302
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,407
Don't overthink this.

303
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,244
I've made up my mind
to leave for a warm country

304
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,037
in the Southern Hemisphere

305
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:52,000
and quietly spend
the rest of my life fishing.

306
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:57,422
I promise you
I'll never set foot in this nation again.

307
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,510
But 100 million hwan is just too much.

308
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:06,932
And it doesn't seem like
Nam Junggil will even testify in court.

309
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:11,895
I'm sure Nam Chulwoo of the KCIA
thinks otherwise.

310
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,566
Do you think he'll let
his son's attempted killer go free?

311
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:22,155
Nam Junggil
might not be inclined to testify now,

312
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,201
but his father could threaten you
and your son at any time.

313
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,621
Are you really willing to let him
hold and point the knife at you?

314
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,959
Very well.

315
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,378
I'll get the money.

316
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:53,895
It's me.

317
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,149
This prick is out of control.

318
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,610
He'll be at Jongnam Cathedral at 11 p.m.

319
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,196
Get rid of him quietly.

320
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,870
It's quite late already.

321
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,247
You ladies should head home.

322
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,250
We'll walk you to the terminal.

323
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,132
We…

324
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,217
want to speak up.

325
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,139
Everything you said is right.

326
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,768
We'll go to court

327
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,853
and reveal the truth.

328
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,107
Are you all sure about this?

329
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,696
There's something else I need to tell you.

330
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:47,949
Please.

331
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,578
After what happened to me,
I went back to my hometown.

332
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,124
I only returned a few days ago…

333
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,003
wanting to report what happened.

334
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,006
But when I did,

335
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,512
your senior superintendent
and a detective pulled me aside

336
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,930
and told me…

337
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,142
that if I ever set foot
in a police station again…

338
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,855
they'd kill me without anyone knowing.

339
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,860
We're aware.

340
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,238
They're all in on this together.

341
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,284
I know it's tough,
but please trust us and wait.

342
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,495
We'll catch all of them

343
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,914
and we'll make them pay.

344
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,419
Goodness.

345
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:44,965
Hey.

346
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:46,967
Just leave.

347
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,387
You worthless punk.

348
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,348
Why did you let your temper
get the best of you?

349
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,308
Just get lost, will you?

350
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,393
Come on.

351
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,895
Imagine how worried your mother must be.

352
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,440
If you can't do your duty as a son,

353
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,276
the least you could do
is not break your dear mother's heart.

354
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,736
You can't even call her anymore.

355
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,406
I said, get lost.

356
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,907
Fine, I'll go.

357
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,493
- Lock him up.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,662
- Detective Oh.
- Yes, sir?

359
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,581
Don't play any tricks. Watch him closely.

360
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,499
I need to hit the can.

361
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,625
Yes, sir.

362
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,139
Hey, you.

363
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,099
Who did you say you were? Detective Oh?

364
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,644
Yes, are you talking to me?

365
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,605
Yes. Let me make a call.

366
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,611
Just wait, sir.
You'll be free in a short while.

367
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,704
Here.

368
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,792
Happy? Go fetch me a phone now.

369
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,047
You see,

370
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,591
- the thing is…
- Detective Oh.

371
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,968
Go get him a phone.

372
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,222
Yes, sir.

373
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,431
Oh, my.

374
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,350
Hurry up and get him a phone.

375
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,531
I don't need the money.

376
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,326
Just send your regards to your parents.

377
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,581
All right then.

378
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,133
Please help me.

379
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,095
Damn it.

380
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,180
- Is everything good?
- Yes, sir.

381
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,267
Hey, you worthless punk.

382
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,811
Spend some time
thinking about your worried mother?

383
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,193
I'd appreciate it
if you stopped calling me…

384
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,404
a worthless punk.

385
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:16,199
What else would I call you,
you worthless punk?

386
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,243
Stop! Stop calling me that!

387
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,789
My father and Senior Superintendent Baek
are going to work things out.

388
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,752
Stop worrying about my mother
and worry about your detectives.

389
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,838
They just might kick the bucket soon.

390
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,507
Is that so?

391
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,055
All right then.

392
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,906
- Hello, this is--
- It's Officer Nam, sir!

393
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,909
Nam Junggil has been abducted!
I'll keep you updated, sir!

394
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,128
Thank you.

395
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,635
- Hello, this--
- Is Detective Park there?

396
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,638
Yes, just a moment.

397
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,057
Honey, it's Chief Yu.

398
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,144
It's me, sir.

399
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,687
Detective Kang has kidnapped Nam Junggil.

400
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,358
Officer Nam is in pursuit.
I'll call you again. Stand by.

401
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,488
Damn it!

402
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:08,186
♪ Thine be the glory ♪

403
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,899
♪ Risen, conquering Son ♪

404
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:17,237
♪ Endless is the victory ♪

405
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:22,409
♪ Thou o'er death hast won ♪

406
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,849
- Did you get him?
- Yes.

407
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,978
That way.

408
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,153
Location, Officer Nam?

409
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,320
Got it.

410
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,869
- Hello?
- Detective Kang

411
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,121
- is at Jongnam Cathedral.
- Jongnam Cathedral.

412
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,205
Let's go.

413
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,519
Damn it.

414
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,454
Damn it.

415
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,280
Sit down.

416
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,576
Come with us, Senior Superintendent Baek.

417
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,706
Sure.

418
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,190
Let's go through the back.

419
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,780
- What happened?
- Baek Doseok and Detective Kang

420
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,699
took Nam Junggil into the cathedral.

421
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,701
Are they inside?
Has there been any movements?

422
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,704
About 10 men wearing black suits
followed after.

423
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,956
Are there civilians inside?

424
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,584
The choir and people praying
are still inside.

425
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,377
You're here, boys.

426
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,628
What are they doing here, sir?

427
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,921
They turned over a new leaf.

428
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,052
Chief Yu.

429
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,512
It's hard for you to walk.

430
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,848
Please let us escort you.

431
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,933
Give us a chance.

432
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,476
That's right.

433
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,521
I'll carry you on my back
if I have to, sir.

434
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,567
Let's go.

435
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,533
Since there are civilians
in the cathedral,

436
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,702
their safety is our first priority.

437
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:53,828
Yes, sir.

438
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,705
Damn!

439
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,970
- Police!
- Freeze!

440
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,350
I wonder who you guys are.

441
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,434
Pull out.

442
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,727
Hey, get them!

443
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,437
- Evacuate the civilians first!
- Yes, sir!

444
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,189
- Come with us!
- Everybody, leave!

445
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,857
- Hurry!
- Come this way!

446
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,818
Go and bring Nam Junggil here, all right?

447
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,947
Come this way!

448
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,619
Come here.

449
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,497
Baek Doseok!

450
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,167
Damn it.

451
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,589
Don't move, you punk! Stay down!

452
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,841
You stay down! Everyone, evacuate now!

453
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,385
- Everybody, leave!
- Don't move.

454
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,053
- You stay. Get out, everyone!
- Don't move.

455
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,390
Get out now!

456
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,101
Not you, you punk!

457
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,894
Stay down!

458
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,647
- Come on, you need to help them.
- All right.

459
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,274
- Let's go.
- Everybody, out! Out now!

460
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,529
Come here.

461
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,615
- Shut up. Shut up!
- Please spare me.

462
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,409
- Quiet.
- Please.

463
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,246
Baek Doseok!

464
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,709
- Please save me.
- Ah!

465
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,836
You!

466
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,214
Aren't you tired of this?

467
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,008
Drop your gun now!

468
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,677
Do you really want to see

469
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,346
another pregnant woman
with a bullet through her?

470
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,391
Do you want me to kill her
for old-time's sake?

471
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,564
I'm carrying a child.

472
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,858
Please spare me.

473
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,119
Drop your gun.

474
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,622
Put it on the ground and kick it to me.

475
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,547
Detective Kang.

476
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,717
If Nam Junggil dies,
it's over for both of us.

477
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,052
Let him go.

478
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,511
Just fight it out with me.

479
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,977
If you beat me, I'll let you go.

480
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,476
Drop it.

481
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,938
Kick the gun to me.

482
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,400
Kick it, you punk!

483
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,114
Drop your gun!

484
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,075
Drop it.

485
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,035
Drop it now!

486
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,133
Now kick it over to me.

487
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,093
I said, kick it to me!

488
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,973
Hey, you punk.

489
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,394
I've always wondered.
Are you a complete moron?

490
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,105
Or is it just that you never change?

491
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,066
How are you still the same,
student soldier?

492
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,069
There's no turning back
for you now, is there?

493
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,197
I never turn back, you punk.

494
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,700
Don't move.

495
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,296
Yeonghan!

496
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,841
You little prick!

497
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,483
Sangsun!

498
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,569
- Damn it.
- Are you okay?

499
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,487
Arrest him. Get him in cuffs.

500
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,532
Come here, you little…

501
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,535
Gyeonghwan!

502
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,582
Gyeonghwan!

503
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,262
Damn you.

504
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,350
You're under arrest for the murder

505
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:11,020
of Kwon Hyunggeun and No Yoonhak
and harboring Kim Soonjung's killer.

506
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,025
I really didn't want to do this.

507
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,699
Let go, you prick!

508
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,330
Come here.

509
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,466
So?

510
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,551
What did you get in return?

511
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,346
A fancy new title? Some money?

512
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,683
I see what happened.

513
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,894
I can tell you've been stabbed blindly
in the back.

514
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,022
Too bad for you.

515
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,858
There's nothing you can do now.

516
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,529
You pathetic student soldier!

517
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,007
You punk!

518
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,137
Listen.

519
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,515
Do you know
why people like you always fail?

520
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:35,813
It's because of your foolish conscience
and sloppy sense of justice, you idiot.

521
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,606
That's all fake.

522
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,151
It's all hypocrisy.

523
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,194
No matter how hard you try,

524
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,781
you'll never be
more than a student soldier, you fool.

525
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,203
You're wrong.

526
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,082
Look how far I've come.

527
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,678
Get up. Get up, you punk!

528
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,691
Baek Doseok.

529
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,902
You're under arrest
for abducting Nam Junggil,

530
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,279
abetting in
the Jongnam Intersection accident,

531
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,990
and destroying evidence
at Kim Soonjung's crime scene…

532
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,368
along with other charges.

533
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,370
Just kill me now!

534
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,454
Never.

535
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,831
No matter what happens,
I'm going to get you to trial

536
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,416
and have you executed by the law.

537
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,754
And I'll do the same for hundreds
and thousands of criminals like you.

538
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,595
Farewell.

539
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,078
It wasn't me.

540
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,746
I didn't do it.

541
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,415
I swear it wasn't me!

542
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,417
I'm an innocent man!

543
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,671
Please.

544
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,257
Get him in.

545
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,760
I'm not going in!

546
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,595
I didn't do anything!

547
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,852
Over here. Why can't you clean better?

548
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,936
Yes, sir.

549
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,814
- Faster!
- I'm sorry.

550
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,111
Why is this so hard to clean?

551
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,570
Next up on the news.

552
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,157
It has been revealed that an official
from Jongnam Police Station

553
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,202
was the perpetrator in last month's
car accident at Jongnam Intersection,

554
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,829
leaving many in shock in the community.

555
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,836
Inmate code, 1RA 07. Name, Baek Doseok.

556
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,921
Is that correct?

557
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,423
Yes.

558
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,859
Any last words?

559
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,489
No.

560
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,582
To much shock,

561
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,835
the tragic accident was proven
to be a murder case.

562
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,003
The two perpetrators,

563
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,257
Baek, the former Senior Superintendent
of Jongnam Station,

564
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,300
and Jung, once the son
of a high-ranking man

565
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,386
but estranged from his family,

566
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,805
were both brought to justice on the 24th

567
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,975
as they faced the full weight of the law.

568
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,452
Park Yeonghan!

569
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,496
Park Yeonghan!

570
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,206
Park Yeonghan!

571
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,000
Park Yeonghan!

572
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,419
Park Yeonghan!

573
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:38,907
Welcome…

574
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:40,909
Honey.

575
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,411
Look what I brought, honey.

576
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,871
What is all that?

577
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,291
I was passing by Jongnam Department Store
when I thought of our baby.

578
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,752
Let's see.

579
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,381
Look. Isn't it cute?

580
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,550
It's adorable.

581
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,679
It'll look great on our baby.

582
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,183
Is there something wrong, honey?

583
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,228
No, nothing's wrong.

584
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,230
Are you sure?

585
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,568
You always bring gifts to mask
how you feel when you're worried.

586
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,236
Uh…

587
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,821
You can tell me.

588
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,406
What's wrong?

589
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,786
It's about this case.

590
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:29,083
I desperately wanted Jung Byungpil
to be punished by the law.

591
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,628
But I guess that was beyond my powers.

592
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,216
I keep feeling ashamed of myself

593
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,385
that I couldn't do more.

594
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,138
Come here.

595
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,731
Ta-da.

596
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,941
What's this?

597
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,653
Try it on.

598
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,031
- Are you sure I can?
- It's yours.

599
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,372
Wow.

600
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:14,545
Goodness, it looks great on you.

601
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:19,717
Now, let's think about
what a great person you are.

602
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,677
The Angel House babies,

603
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,638
Sungchil, Soonjung, and…

604
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,849
I could go on all day.

605
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,268
There's one too many to count.

606
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,438
Do you mean the people I couldn't save?

607
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,647
No.

608
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,984
Those are all the times
you caught the bad guys

609
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,445
so the innocent could rest in peace.

610
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,198
With all the criminals you've caught

611
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,160
and all the rest
you'll catch in the future,

612
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,288
imagine how much cleaner
the world will get.

613
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:54,877
And our baby will be proud
to have a dad like you.

614
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,339
So whenever you wear this,

615
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,967
always remember that.

616
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,386
Will you do that?

617
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,265
Yes, I will.

618
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,226
I want to apologize too.

619
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:15,814
I feel like I've neglected you
because of how busy I've been.

620
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,443
You haven't. It's all right.

621
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,571
I love you, honey.

622
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,240
I love you too.

623
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:32,956
You're all I have.

624
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,710
Actually, I have you and our baby now.

625
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,462
That's right.

626
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,297
Cheer up, honey.

627
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,675
We've caught the barbershop attacker
and the Kwangkyo-dong thief duo.

628
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,136
Are there any cases left?

629
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,472
No, we've closed all our cases.

630
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,973
Not even any unsolved ones?

631
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,142
What about the intersection pickpockets?

632
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,479
They're in the interrogation room
after turning themselves into Unit 2.

633
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,898
Why not to us?

634
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,316
Why else?

635
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,902
They heard what you did in the cathedral.

636
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,695
- What?
- You mean the rumors

637
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,532
that he stabs people with candlesticks
and burns people with iron?

638
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,575
Yes, he's now known

639
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,869
as the devil-hunting angel of Jongnam,
Archangel Michael.

640
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,455
You guys are ridiculous.

641
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,833
If you have time to joke around,

642
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,085
you should go
take cases off the other units.

643
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,294
Yeonghan.

644
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,172
I don't know
if we're on the right track to justice.

645
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:26,677
We've caught countless bad guys,
but the world hasn't changed a bit.

646
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,178
Who says it hasn't?

647
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,932
One bad guy locked up
means that crime is reduced by that much.

648
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,393
And the world turns that much better.

649
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,771
But then more bad guys show up,
and it's just rinse and repeat.

650
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,315
Why are you so negative--

651
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,067
Detective! Detective Park!

652
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,904
He was caught snatching!

653
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:49,658
We'll have the report
and his warrant done by today.

654
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,368
You can trust us!

655
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,703
- Don't move!
- Officer Bong.

656
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,832
Catching a criminal isn't even half of it.

657
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,458
Sorry?

658
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,711
It isn't?

659
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,466
Oh?

660
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,720
- We missed you, sir!
- Sir!

661
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,599
How have you two been?

662
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,018
Here you go. That's hot.

663
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,102
Eat up.

664
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,982
I'd like to dedicate
something to you first, sir.

665
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,483
Dedicate what?

666
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,950
- I got an award.
- What?

667
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,952
It's the first I've ever received.

668
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:35,662
I got one too.

669
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,372
Thanks to you,
I learned to read and write.

670
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,707
I can even read books now.

671
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,709
Let's see.

672
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,503
"For serving as a model
to the other inmates

673
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,631
with his kind heart and warm smile…"

674
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,509
And you won first place for a book report?

675
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,305
Yes, the title was The man I respect most,

676
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,098
Detective Park.

677
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,852
I'm disappointed you left us out.

678
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,773
We even visited you in jail
and wrote you letters.

679
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,942
I guess they just don't respect us yet.

680
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,403
No, it's all thanks to you
we were released early for good behavior.

681
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,072
Thank you all so much.

682
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:13,367
As your sign of gratitude,
you better live an honest life

683
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,868
so we don't see you at the station.

684
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,871
We promise to be honest and hardworking.

685
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,915
Starting at dawn, we'll be shining shoes.

686
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,709
Don't bother competing
with the territorial shoeshines.

687
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,835
Just work here instead.

688
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,672
Sorry, sir?

689
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,173
Goodness, that's a good idea.

690
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,801
You two can shine
all of the detectives' shoes here.

691
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,221
Thank you. Thank you.

692
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,808
Let's see.
This is my payment for tomorrow.

693
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:38,976
Shine them well.

694
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,354
Let's see here.
Any chance of a discount, boys?

695
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,524
This is for all of next week.

696
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,734
Here, this is for the month.

697
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,696
Thank you.

698
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,990
- Eat up.
- Okay.

699
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,831
See you tomorrow, boys.

700
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:01,999
Goodbye.

701
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,544
Why are you guys all gathered here?

702
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,004
Congratulations.

703
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,088
What for?

704
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,172
Take a look.

705
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,594
Wait, is this real?

706
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,931
So he's no longer Chief Yu,

707
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,267
but Senior Superintendent Yu now!

708
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,102
Finally, Chief Yu!

709
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:26,023
Chief Yu's worries are all over now!

710
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,656
- Did you get the intersection pickpockets?
- Goodness me.

711
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,410
That's not what's important, sir.

712
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:41,204
We just saw
the notice of your promotion, sir.

713
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,831
Senior Superintendent Yu!

714
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:45,125
When I heard
the National Police called you in,

715
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,710
I thought it was for another scolding.

716
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:47,794
You saw the notice?

717
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,172
Well, it just happened.

718
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,550
Are you putting on
an air of dignity now, sir?

719
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,926
Dignity? No.

720
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,762
Just don't make a fuss about it.

721
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,514
If not now, then when?

722
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,476
Guys. Everyone.
We need to celebrate, don't you think?

723
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,977
Yes!

724
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,353
Senior Superintendent Yu!

725
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,314
Senior Superintendent Yu!

726
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,191
Senior Superintendent Yu!

727
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,401
- Senior Superintendent Yu!
- That's enough!

728
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,612
Fine, I'll buy you all a drink!

729
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,034
Wait a minute. Hold up.

730
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:23,872
I wonder who's going to be
the chief of Unit 1 now.

731
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,583
There's this guy
I've had my eye on for years.

732
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,419
He'll do great.
I knew from the very beginning.

733
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,629
Who is it?

734
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,758
Please don't tell me
it's someone from a different station.

735
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,259
I'm shy with new people.

736
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,761
Can you not read the room?

737
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,347
Detective Seo.

738
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,932
Don't worry about that.

739
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,810
Your new chief is right here.

740
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,312
Me?

741
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,980
The best cow thief catcher in Gyeonggi-do.

742
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:52,067
The best violent criminal catcher
in Jongnam.

743
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,153
He's Hwangchun and Jongnam's pride,
Park Yeonghan!

744
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,155
That's right!

745
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,033
Who else could be the chief of Unit 1?

746
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:04,204
Right, no one else could handle
the Mad Dog and Brown Bear of Jongnam!

747
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,915
Chief Park. Chief Park!

748
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,835
My goodness.

749
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,419
I look forward to working with you,

750
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,964
Chief Park of Unit 1.

751
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,765
I'm happy to serve you, sir.

752
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,564
Chief Park!

753
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,359
Stop! Stop it!

754
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,735
Detectives!

755
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,571
Hey, detectives!

756
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,407
A burglar is robbing
the Goryeo Jewelry Store!

757
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,908
But we're celebrating his promotion.

758
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,704
The celebration can wait.
We need to go and solve the case.

759
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,667
- We'll be back, sir.
- Take care.

760
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,295
Let's go!

761
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,671
Yes, sir!

762
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,047
Chief Park!

763
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,674
Chief Park!

764
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,703
Welcome.

765
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:27,871
Listen.

766
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,789
- Do you remember that time--
- Quiet.

767
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,124
All right.

768
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,542
- So…
- He's here.

769
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,960
Here you are, sir.

770
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,046
Salute!

771
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,464
Welcome, sir.

772
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,632
It's been a while.

773
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,593
Have a seat. Sit down.

774
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,932
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

775
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,727
Why did you have me come
to this expensive place?

776
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,104
It's not expensive at all.

777
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,649
Enjoy whatever you'd like.

778
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,360
You know the rice thief
during the May 16 coup?

779
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,279
- Yes.
- Apparently, he changed his ways

780
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,240
and has gathered some wealth now.

781
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,825
Goodness, he's one to talk.

782
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,787
The gangster of Jongnam Intersection
has changed too.

783
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,997
Do you still pack a punch?

784
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,999
Come on, stop it.

785
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,418
Here.

786
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,587
Enjoy, sir.

787
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,840
Congratulations, sir.

788
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,300
For what?

789
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:26,930
For Junseo receiving a commendation
for catching Jung Hochul.

790
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,767
Well, it's a cop's job to catch criminals.

791
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,561
He still deserves that commendation

792
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,522
for getting that evil punk.

793
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:39,150
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree,
wouldn't you say?

794
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,444
He's just like Yeonghan.

795
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,615
Junseo has a long way to go.

796
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,953
Don't you remember
how terrifying Yeonghan used to be?

797
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,956
You're right.
I used to be scared out of my mind.

798
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:56,293
Back in those days,
one look at Yeonghan's face

799
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:59,796
could make me crap my pants.

800
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:04,342
Anyway, I hope you eat well
and stay healthy.

801
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:07,470
We'll take care of
everything else for you.

802
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,347
You two take care of yourselves.

803
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:12,809
- Now that I see your face again…
- Yes.

804
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,562
…I miss Sangsun.

805
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:20,025
I also miss
Gyeonghwan and Hojeong so much.

806
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:24,237
I miss the dashing Nam Sunghoon

807
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:28,074
and the beautiful Officer Bong.

808
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,345
Thank you for the food.

809
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,183
- Yeonghan.
- Yes?

810
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:57,187
Just have one more drink at my place.

811
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,147
I'll cook you a chicken, sir.

812
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:03,651
Thank you, but I have to go.

813
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,987
- Just one more drink, sir.
- I've had enough.

814
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,323
I've got something to do tomorrow.

815
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:11,743
Don't tell me
you're secretly dating someone.

816
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,289
All right, now.

817
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,625
Yeonghan.

818
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,461
Thank you so much…

819
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,297
for helping us become better.

820
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,673
Goodness.

821
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,967
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

822
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,096
Don't even mention it.

823
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,515
I love you, Yeonghan.

824
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,578
Here it is.

825
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,256
Detective Kim.

826
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,884
It's been a while, Sangsun.

827
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:11,970
Goodness.

828
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,433
Detective Jo.

829
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,893
It's been a while, hasn't it?

830
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:21,896
Detective Jo.

831
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:23,940
Goodness.

832
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,445
Heejeong visits me sometimes.

833
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,780
Detective Seo.

834
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,657
How have you been?

835
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,410
I always miss you.

836
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,204
I think of you whenever I go to Busan.

837
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,001
Detective Nam.

838
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,295
How are you?

839
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,672
I hope you're still healthy.

840
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:54,637
You look dashing to this day.

841
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,264
Chief Yu.

842
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,936
Here lies Yu Daecheon

843
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,271
Goodness.

844
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,027
I missed you so much.

845
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,737
I really did.

846
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,415
I really wish

847
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:26,252
I could just live here.

848
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:30,173
Actually, not long ago,

849
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:35,887
Lee Gyein and Song Kyungchul
came to see me.

850
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:37,722
Jang Doosik

851
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,642
and Park Soomyung…

852
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,686
also visit me often.

853
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,775
Without all of you here…

854
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,028
they try to cheer me up.

855
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,241
Goodness.

856
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,576
Recently…

857
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,829
I've missed you all so much

858
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,207
that I can't sleep.

859
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,392
Did I fall asleep?

860
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,478
The sun is setting already.

861
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,355
I should go.

862
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,942
Goodbye then.

863
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,626
I'll see you again.

864
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,048
Right.

865
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:55,800
It must be nice…

866
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,138
to be here together.

867
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,057
I'm going now.

868
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:07,478
Goodbye now.

869
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:21,492
Take care.

870
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,516
Hello.

871
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,936
My name is Seo Hojeong, and I passed
the 18th special recruitment test.

872
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:53,316
Jongnam Station's best talent
blew up the Senior Superintendent's car.

873
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:54,400
Let's work together.

874
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,235
A cop should do what cops do.

875
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,154
Take a look at this.

876
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:00,990
With Zhuge Liang joining our unit…

877
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,077
And look at Hojeong.
He's a real man now.

878
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,371
It means the perps are former military.

879
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,209
Are those rice sacks
full of cotton or what?

880
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:12,502
How is he doing that?

881
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,337
Would you like to be a cop?

882
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,505
How did you find that out though?

883
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,091
We convinced him earnestly.

884
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,802
We poured our hearts into it.

885
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,096
Not your muscles?

886
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:26,099
I thought police work would be boring,

887
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,517
but it's like being on a battlefield.

888
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,186
I'm ready.

889
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,110
The Biter of Dogs, Kim Sangsun.

890
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,987
I hate even looking
at the chief and the others.

891
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:43,741
What I'm trying to say is,
people like us need to stick together.

892
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:44,867
The world may have changed,

893
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,412
but the real thieves
keep growing in number.

894
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:50,248
I'm here with your sawdust,
you dusty punks!

895
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,585
I was a lot smaller
and weaker than you as a kid…

896
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,172
- …so I came up…
- Freeze!

897
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,757
…with my own way of fighting.

898
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,134
Biting as hard as I could.

899
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:02,927
The bullies eventually run away

900
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,679
if you keep biting.

901
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,348
I wish Soonnam would turn into a human.

902
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,394
The best cow thief catcher in Gyeonggi-do.

903
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:14,355
Catching cow thieves involves every skill

904
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,775
a detective needs to be good at.

905
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,486
Only one thing should matter
to a detective.

906
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,029
Protect the weak.

907
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,365
And beat the crap out of bad guys.

908
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,785
All I wanted…

909
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,538
was to keep the people closest to me
from dying in vain.

910
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,876
And those are rules
I've never broken until now.

911
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,920
I'm going to get you no matter what.

912
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,005
Arrest them all!

913
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,548
Little pricks like you

914
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:43,134
should be eliminated early on
for everyone's sake.

915
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:46,554
In what world
does a cop help out a suspect?

916
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:49,390
Scum up to no good could be 100 years old

917
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,225
and still be beneath me.

918
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:55,229
There's no punk in this world
that can't be caught.

919
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,692
Look how much the world has changed,

920
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,444
but it's like we're stuck.

921
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,905
What are you talking about?
We've all changed.

922
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,406
That's why people like us

923
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,575
need to take the side of the powerless.

924
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:09,869
Do you regret becoming a cop?

925
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,996
Definitely not.

926
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:13,998
It's a fact

927
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:17,126
that those who do evil
will pay for what they've done.

928
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:24,592

929
