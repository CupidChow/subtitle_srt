Chief Detective 1958

2
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
This series is unrelated to any places,
persons, settings or events.

3
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,953
Scenes involving animals were filmed in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.

4
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,569
Right, the rice cakes.

5
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,696
I almost forgot.

6
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,290
Honorary retirement

8
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,929
I'll be back.

00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,906
Episode 1

10
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,917
- You're here.
Hello.

11
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,877
- Is my order…
I have it ready.

12
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,172
Would you like to try a piece?
It just came out.

13
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,757
You don't have to.

14
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,384
No, I insist.

15
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,177
- All right, then.

16
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,345
- Just a moment.
All right.

17
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,644
- This is delicious.

18
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,938
- Here's your order.
Thank you.

19
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,191
Have a nice day.

20
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,276
Thank you.

21
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,069
Business is booming.

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,401
Jongnam Police Station

24
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,363
Welcome, sir.

25
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,865
Greetings, sir.

26
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:19,949
Hello.

27
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,367
Wait.

28
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,415
- Share this with the others.
- Thank you, sir.

29
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,839
- Welcome, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

30
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,966
Where's Detective Park?

31
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,343
He's inside, sir.

32
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,386
You guys must be on the move.

33
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,846
- Hello, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

34
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,431
Hey, there.

35
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,600
You're here.

36
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,186
Did Jung Hochul
stick his head out of his hole?

37
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,064
We got a report that he's in
an internet cafe in Naksun-dong.

38
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,943
Why couldn't he show up
when you were on a stakeout?

39
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,027
Exactly.

40
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,656
I brought you a change of socks.

41
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,491
Thank you, Grandpa.

42
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,409
But I'll wear these after I catch him.

43
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,787
- Goodbye.
- All right. Look what…

44
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,249
Wait, I brought rice cake.

45
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,751
Share this with the others.

46
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,087
This is my favorite kind.
Thank you, Grandpa.

47
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,880
- No problem.
- I love you.

48
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,841
- Off you go. All right.
- I'll be back.

49
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:23,197
The legendary detectives of 1962

50
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,344
Careful, kids.

51
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:56,105
♪ When I haven't got a penny
to spare, I head to the cattle market ♪

52
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,192
♪ And gorge myself
on stolen cabbage pancakes ♪

53
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,696
You no-good bum!

54
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,864
Goodness.

55
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:07,950
What's…

56
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,953
Hmm?

57
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:20,254
Year 1958
Hwangchun, Gyeonggi-do

58
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,269
This here is the cow.

59
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,566
Huh?

60
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,493
- Here.
- What took you so long?

61
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,870
Get lost now, cow.

62
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,996
Let's go.

63
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,387
Hello.

64
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,056
Get lost.

65
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,684
Leave, you bum.

66
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,185
I got money, all right?

67
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,895
I've got a lot.

68
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,272
Stop lying, you…

69
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,024
See? I'm rich.

70
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,318
How long did you beg for all this?

71
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,613
Fine, you punk.

72
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,032
One round, and that's it.

73
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,255
Today isn't my day.

74
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,174
All right.

75
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,759
- Don't stay too long.
- Sure.

76
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,685
There we go.

77
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,939
I'm feeling good.

78
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,399
Let me join in.

79
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,030
Hey, who let this bum in here?

80
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,657
Come on, that hurts to hear.

81
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,077
I'm not a bum today.

82
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,412
You smell like crap.

83
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,915
Let's go!

84
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,251
Here, take your five cards.

85
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,006
You don't look like
you're from around here,

86
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,508
Mr. White Suit.

87
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,676
Did you come all the way here
to sell cattle?

88
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,013
Shut up and just play, you bum.

89
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,390
With your hair done up like that,

90
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,975
I doubt you know a thing about cows.

91
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,977
What did you say?

92
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,813
I can just tell.

93
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,398
See, right there.

94
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,943
I've never seen a cattle farmer
wear shoes like that.

95
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,863
What on earth
is this bum blabbering about?

96
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,744
You aren't a cow farmer,
yet you just sold one.

97
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,329
I wonder where it came from then.

98
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,833
Did it fall from the sky or did you…

99
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,336
steal it?

100
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,133
Actually, you fancy gentleman
must be the boss.

101
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,760
So who actually stole it?

102
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,054
Let me see here…

103
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,222
There.

104
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,640
Those two.

105
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,644
You've got rope burns, haven't you?

106
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,899
That's what happens
when strangers try to pull a cow.

107
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,527
It fights to hold its ground.

108
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,571
Who the heck are you?

109
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,073
Me?

110
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,784
Who do you think I am?

111
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,131
Recognize me?

112
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,257
You're…

113
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,467
the Hwangchun Police Detective.

114
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,886
So you've seen me in the papers.

115
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,057
I wasn't expecting to see
a Hwangchun Police detective…

116
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,602
…in a place like this.

117
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,479
Run!

118
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,359
You two, freeze.

119
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,241
You little punk!

120
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,082
Damn it.

121
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,876
Are you okay?

122
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,462
That crazy punk.

123
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,095
Are you all right?

124
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,110
Damn you!

125
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,366
Hey!

126
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,368
Wait a minute!

127
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,827
Do you know whose cow that was?

128
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,412
How in the world would I know?

129
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,582
It was meant to be sold
for Mandeuk's mother's surgery.

130
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,669
Get up, you worthless punk.

131
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,799
Stealing someone's cow
is stealing their lives.

132
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,634
Got it?

133
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,177
Come with me, you punk.

134
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,222
Have some of this!

135
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,225
- Look at you.
- Stay away!

136
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,227
What will you do with that? Butcher a cow?

137
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,772
No, I'll butcher you!

138
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,732
I'd like to see you try, you punk.

139
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,693
Don't get closer, I'm telling you!

140
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,194
- I'll stab you!
- Hey, wait.

141
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,699
Wait, stop moving back.

142
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,453
- Stay still.
- Why should I?

143
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,914
You're just playing with me.

144
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,040
Wait!

145
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,094
Damn…

146
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,641
Just wondering…

147
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,644
You're not an only son
or anything like that, are you?

148
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,318
Please slow down. It still hurts.

149
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,529
- Move it.
- It hurts.

150
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,531
Jeez.

151
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,741
Damn.

152
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,908
Slow down.

153
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,577
Come on, slow down.

154
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,414
Why is that punk walking funny?

155
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,375
He nearly lost his family jewels.

156
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,755
What's this stink?

157
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,258
Did you really have to play the bum
to catch him?

158
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,052
I wasn't exactly happy either, all right?

159
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,681
But you keep plastering my face
on the papers.

160
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,099
All the criminals know me now.

161
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,435
- Lock him up.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,562
- But I'm in so much pain.
- Move it.

163
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,356
I'm pretty sure something fell off.

164
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,317
Number of arrests

165
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,401
Park Yeonghan

166
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,946
At long last, Detective Park

167
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,950
has arrested his 96th cow thief!

168
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,076
Give him a hand. A round of applause.

169
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,370
- Great job.
- Nice job.

170
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,708
Come on, it's really not a big deal.

171
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,793
Don't flatter me.

172
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,629
How is it not a big deal?

173
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:20,174
That's three straight years of
the most cow thief arrests in Gyeonggi-do.

174
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,348
Well, Detective Park's leaving soon
for greener pastures.

175
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,891
Time for a farewell party.

176
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,685
Sounds good.

177
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,938
Tonight is on me.

178
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,941
But you asked
for an advance on your salary

179
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,734
to rebuild that orphanage wall.

180
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,860
You're right.

181
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,738
Then tonight's on you, Chief.

182
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,906
Come on.

183
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:48,661
Don't you own a brewery?
You can afford to treat us.

184
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,499
I've told you countless times
that it's my father who owns it, not me.

185
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,583
But…

186
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,294
we can put it on his tab tonight

187
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,381
and drink ourselves
until we can barely walk!

188
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,882
Let's go!

189
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,050
Let's go!

190
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:08,264
Bulam Brewery

191
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,941
How many were there last night?

192
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,653
Well, everyone at the substation…

193
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,239
…so about eight people.

194
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,157
You spent enough to feed hundreds.

195
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,702
I'm sorry, Father.

196
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,580
Still, you'll be off to do great things,

197
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,456
so it's right that you treated them.

198
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,962
Living in this world

199
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,299
is much like brewing alcohol.

200
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:48,304
One must filter out the impurities
to produce the purest alcohol.

201
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:53,601
My wish is that you help create a world
that's pure like alcohol.

202
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,482
Life won't be easy,

203
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,277
but I believe in you, son.

204
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,862
Thank you, Father,

205
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,449
for raising me to be
as strong as a cow's horn.

206
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,744
You may be a cow's horn,
but you must take care of yourself.

207
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,537
Don't get hurt.

208
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,333
I'll give my all to be the best…

209
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,959
No…

210
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,463
to be a respectable detective.

211
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:28,010
Public service and order

212
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,136
Yeonghan.

213
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,639
Go out there into the big world

214
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,099
and go catch the big criminals.

215
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,645
All right, I'll try to get myself
on the papers in Seoul too.

216
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,523
Seoul is crawling with gangsters
like Lee Jungjae and Im Hwasoo.

217
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,317
Take them all out.

218
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,694
All right. I'll catch all of them.

219
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,031
- Here.
- Thank you.

220
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,824
It's food for the road.

221
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,451
Thanks, Officer Kim.

222
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,787
Why the sad face though?

223
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,625
You didn't know?

224
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,045
She's waited years to get married to you.

225
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,298
I can't believe you!

226
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,639
Thank you, everyone.

227
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,308
I'll be back for the holidays.

228
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,936
All right.

229
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,606
You better be the best
at Jongnam, Yeonghan!

230
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,149
Of course!

231
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,318
Don't get hurt!

232
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,029
Good luck in Seoul!

233
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,077
Goodbye, Detective Park!

234
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,717
Hey, kid, do you want one?

235
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,926
Thank you.

236
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,522
Episode 1
Man From a Small City

237
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,025
We can't take it anymore.

238
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,485
Kick corruption out of politics now.

239
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,281
We can't take it anymore.

240
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,575
Kick corruption out of politics now.

241
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,577
Jongnam-gu

242
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,370
We can't take it anymore.

243
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,748
Kick corruption out of politics now.

244
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,758
What a sight.

245
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,281
Excuse me.

246
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,658
- Yes?
- Where's the Investigation Division?

247
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,867
Investigation Division

248
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,457
Stop right there, you punk!

249
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,085
Excuse me. Damn you.

250
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,171
That startled me.

251
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,637
Unit 3.

252
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,598
Unit 2.

253
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,060
Unit 1

254
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,902
Hello, Chief.

255
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,738
I'm Detective Park Yeonghan

256
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,533
from the Hwangchun Police Substation.

257
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,451
From where?

258
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,911
Hwangchun, sir.

259
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,455
So you're a grim reaper?

260
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,584
Not to toot my own horn,
but the criminals do fear me.

261
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,881
I heard you arrested the most cow thieves
in all of Gyeonggi-do.

262
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,799
You must be
the famous detective from Hwangchun.

263
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:41,763
I didn't know news about me
had spread all the way to Seoul.

264
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,473
You made the headlines

265
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,726
of the papers in Gyeonggi-do.

266
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,769
Once seems enough,

267
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,521
but they keep mentioning me.

268
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,065
I'm worried
it might affect my investigations.

269
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,651
But why were you so amped
on catching cow thieves?

270
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,404
Look, Chief.

271
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,075
Cow thieves are the worst ones out there.

272
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,160
Why?

273
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,454
They're basically stealing
someone's livelihood.

274
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,538
Damn it.

275
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,750
A cow will pay
for Kyungsoo's college tuition,

276
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,336
help Okbun's daughter get married,

277
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,172
and pay for Mandeuk's mother's surgery.

278
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,300
- So stealing a cow ruins…
- What time is it?

279
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,761
- Sir?
- I asked you what time it is.

280
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,346
Oh.

281
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,391
It's 11:47 a.m., sir.

282
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,311
Perfect time for a drink. Let's go.

283
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,773
Shall we, sir?

284
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,945
I don't know if I should indulge myself
on my first day.

285
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,039
This is so stale.

286
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,707
The rice was undercooked.

287
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,919
You'd get slapped if you made
rice wine like this back home.

288
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,837
Who's slapping who?

289
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,547
It's still delicious, ma'am.

290
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,138
Detective Park.

291
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,182
Why do you think I called you up?

292
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,184
Hmm…

293
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,435
Because you had a spot open?

294
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,605
A spot open at Jongnam Police Station,
in the very heart of Seoul?

295
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,108
I get it.

296
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,860
You must make
your subordinates' lives a nightmare,

297
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,237
so they keep quitting.

298
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,156
You're smart, country boy.

299
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,577
How badly do you treat them?

300
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,998
I just send them out to catch gangsters.

301
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,001
How is that a bad thing?

302
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,502
Isn't that our job?

303
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:39,089
That's what they all say
on their first day.

304
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,260
Well,

305
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,721
you'll find out soon enough

306
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,848
why going after gangsters
makes life a nightmare.

307
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,352
This is your desk, Detective Park.

308
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,817
Even desks are a lot bigger in Seoul.

309
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,157
You need to screw your head on, all right?

310
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,746
Look who it is.

311
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,622
I've heard all about you.

312
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,207
I'm Hwang Sooman of Investigation Unit 2.

313
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,586
- It's nice to meet you.
- And this is our youngest, Mr. Cow Thief.

314
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,005
Hello, sir!

315
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,590
I'm Detective Oh Jisub.

316
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,758
I'll let you get back to it.

317
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,343
- Welcome.
- Nice meeting you.

318
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,095
By the way, Detective Hwang.

319
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,641
I'm not a cow thief.

320
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,268
I arrested cow thieves.

321
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,604
Same thing, right?

322
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,983
And where are you from,
arrester of cow thieves?

323
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,485
Was it the afterlife?

324
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,364
Right, you're from Hwangchun.

325
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,366
Is that town even labeled on the map?

326
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,912
Look, Seoul isn't like
your little old town out in nowhere.

327
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,290
Once you get paid,
go get some proper clothes.

328
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,293
Let's keep it classy, all right?

329
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,713
Where'd you get your outfit, Hwang?

330
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,132
Why? Do you like it?

331
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,302
No, I assumed you were wearing something
an American soldier had thrown out.

332
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,182
- Listen here, you little--
- Wait, Hwang.

333
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,352
You've got lettuce in your teeth.

334
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,480
Damn it.

335
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,193
Mr. Oh!

336
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,945
Mr. Oh, what's wrong?

337
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,198
- Grab a chair for him, Detective Park.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,909
Have a seat here.

339
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,911
- Careful.
- Oh, goodness.

340
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,329
Goodness!

341
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,915
Please do something, Chief Yu.

342
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,000
We're too scared to live.

343
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,711
Mr. Oh here runs a fabric store
in Jongnam Market.

344
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,296
Who did this to him?

345
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,466
Men from the Dongdaemun gang.

346
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,885
They had snake names.

347
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,762
Rattlesnake? Viper?

348
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,097
Yes.

349
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,141
Those are definitely gangster names.

350
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,810
Should I get them?

351
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,520
Suit yourself.

352
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,646
I'll be back, sir.

353
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,315
This isn't a walk in the park.

354
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,984
Do you even know where to go?

355
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,861
Right.

356
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,156
- Where can I find them?
- Goodness.

357
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,075
Have you heard of
Dongdaemun's Lee Jungjae?

358
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,370
Every soul in this land knows Lee Jungjae.

359
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,455
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

360
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,415
Which way is it to Ilsimkwan?

361
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,167
- Is it this way?
- Ah.

362
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,044
His men are fighting
to take over Jongnam Market.

363
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,379
Go to this address.

364
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,008
By the way, there are 30 of them there.

365
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,676
30 of them, huh?

366
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,013
If I knock out one every second,

367
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,681
it'll only take me 30 seconds.

368
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,018
One, two, three, four.

369
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,605
Five, six, seven… eight.

370
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,648
That's a lot.

371
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,949
Specializing in snake soup

372
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,662
Huh.

373
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,123
- Hand it over.
- Yes, sir.

374
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,374
Hello.

375
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,542
Hello.

376
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,631
- Chief Yu.
- Yes?

377
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,716
I heard you sent a rookie
to his death again.

378
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,512
No, I sent him to the gangsters' den.

379
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:17,641
The rookies always get beat up at that den
and come back a bloody mess.

380
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,394
Want to bet if he can make them
a bloody mess instead?

381
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,646
Take it easy on the new ones.

382
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,190
You keep scaring them off.

383
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,693
I'm not the one who made them quit.
They quit on their own.

384
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,159
As of yesterday,

385
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,496
Viper, the pillar of the Dongdaemun gang,

386
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,165
was put in charge of Jongnam Market.

387
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,792
A round of applause.

388
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,839
Give us a speech, sir.

389
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,927
I, the Viper of Yongmoon Mountain,

390
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,638
climbed to where I am now
serving the great Lee Jungjae.

391
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,807
Let's keep this momentum going

392
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,976
and make Jongnam-gu our territory.

393
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,644
Let's toast to that!

394
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,104
Cheers!

395
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,480
Eat up, boys.

396
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,440
Yes, cheers!

397
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,572
Is this place Ilsimkwan?

398
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,658
I guess it is.

399
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,327
Why isn't there a sign out front?

400
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,246
It took me ages to find this place.

401
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,873
Hey, what do you think you're doing here?

402
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,711
You, right there in the middle.

403
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,339
You sure look like
you're out of your depth.

404
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:32,966
Are you Ou Samryong?

405
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,219
Come on, seriously?

406
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,680
I'm the Viper of Yongmoon Mountain.

407
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,683
All right,
Mr. Ou Samryong of Yongmoon Mountain.

408
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,936
I'm Park Yeonghan
with the Jongnam Police Station.

409
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,439
I heard you beat up
the owner of the fabric store.

410
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:51,276
Well, I'm here to arrest you,
Mr. Ou Samryong,

411
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,029
for assault.

412
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,619
Put that on.

413
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,208
Jeez.

414
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,171
I guess folks in Seoul
are really happy to get arrested.

415
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,882
You can't pull that crap around here.

416
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,426
I'm Lee Jungjae's right-hand…

417
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,847
Well, I'm probably his right-foot man.

418
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,434
Who's Lee Jungjae?

419
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,728
You don't know Lee Jungjae,
the Muscle of Icheon?

420
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,189
It doesn't ring a bell.

421
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,608
Are you fresh out of jail or a temple?

422
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,693
I'm fresh out of Hwangchun.

423
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,695
Our boss is known all over the country,

424
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,489
and Hwangchun, Gyeonggi-do
is no exception.

425
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,741
You're a real talker, aren't you?

426
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,493
Listen.

427
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:45,038
If you don't put those handcuffs on,

428
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,707
I'm going to grind you into dust.

429
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,378
I'm so scared.

430
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:55,298
Let me get this right.
You're saying you'll grind me?

431
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,300
You're a real savage punk.

432
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,678
Boys,

433
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,013
turn this detective from Hwangchun
into a bloody mess.

434
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:06,059
Lift a finger, and I'll turn you all
into a bloody mess.

435
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,525
In here are 30 poisonous snakes.

436
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:17,028
Come at me, and this bag flies open.

437
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,656
That punk is a snake hunter,
not a detective.

438
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,116
Let's see what's inside.

439
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,453
By the way,
why is everything in Seoul so expensive?

440
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,872
I had to write a long tab for this.

441
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,250
You could get 30 snakes in Hwangchun

442
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,210
for only 35 lbs of rice.

443
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,586
Get him!

444
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,966
- Snakes!
- Hey!

445
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,259
It's a snake.

446
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,137
Careful, everybody.
You saw what's inside, right?

447
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,805
A-Are those real?

448
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,808
Do you want to check for yourself?

449
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:47,976
Don't get scared.

450
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,561
Damn it.

451
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,610
Get back!

452
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,321
Stay still and calm down.

453
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,406
Viper.

454
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,158
Come with me,

455
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,535
and I'll tie this bag up.

456
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,871
I'll go with you.
Just keep that thing closed.

457
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,080
Good choice!

458
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,875
- Bring me those handcuffs.
- Me?

459
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,961
Then would you rather have
that snake bite you?

460
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,883
Hey, you…

461
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,968
Careful.

462
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,515
Good job.

463
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,017
All right.

464
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,685
You made the right choice.

465
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,395
You're a smart guy.

466
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,647
Right.

467
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,524
If you follow us,

468
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,359
I'll let these things loose.

469
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,905
Go.

470
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,959
- They're out!
- Put them back in here, will you?

471
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,421
Damn it.

472
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,231
Everyone calm down
and get back to your food.

473
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,608
There are snakes on that side,
so stay clear, all right?

474
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,902
Yes, of course.

475
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,362
And how's your health?

476
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,988
I'm fit as a fiddle.

477
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,699
Come in.

478
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,332
Now that you've conquered
the world of gangsters,

479
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,125
it's time to move on to greater things.

480
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,461
A seat at the National Assembly
is yours for the taking.

481
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,797
Well, I'm flattered.

482
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,174
I simply serve the president

483
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,593
as an ordinary member
of the Liberal Party.

484
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,804
What humility and modesty.

485
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,641
You are a true patriot of this country,
Chairman Lee.

486
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,935
You're very generous,
Senior Superintendent Choi.

487
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,572
You shouldn't have.

488
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,449
I know how poorly
the police get paid in this country.

489
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,620
And you work tirelessly day and night
for all of our safety.

490
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,206
I hope this can be of some comfort to you.

491
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,250
Thank you, Chairman Lee.

492
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,837
I feel comforted already.

493
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,717
Now, don't think about lying.

494
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:30,638
Did you or did you not hit
the fabric store owner?

495
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,852
I didn't hit him.
I beat the living daylights out of him.

496
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,150
That was a quick confession.

497
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,029
Now, why did you
beat the living daylights out of him?

498
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,697
He wouldn't pay his dues

499
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,324
and kept giving me crap.

500
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,327
So is all of Jongnam Market yours?

501
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,203
Yes, it's my territory.

502
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,205
Then show me any property deeds you have.

503
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,541
I don't need that stuff, all right?

504
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,876
Any land I spit on becomes mine.

505
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,419
Is that so?

506
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:03,838
Wait a minute.

507
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,635
Oh.

508
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,142
Does that mean you're mine now?

509
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,604
What on earth is wrong with you?

510
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,106
You said it's yours if you spit on it,
you punk.

511
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,359
Look, this isn't hopscotch.

512
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,110
You can't just claim land.

513
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,030
Who taught you to be such a prick,

514
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,324
you worthless punk?

515
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,369
Hey, Detective Park.

516
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,413
You can't treat these people like that.

517
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,126
You good-for-nothing, rotten punk.

518
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,046
- How old are you?
- I'm 34. What's it to you?

519
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,715
The fabric store owner is 50!

520
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,344
He's old enough to be your uncle.

521
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,720
Where's your sense of respect?

522
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,764
If you were my nephew,

523
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:59,143
I'd beat the crap out of you
until you stopped breathing, you punk.

524
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,980
Well then, how old are you?

525
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,064
Me?

526
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,443
I'm 27.

527
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,487
So you're younger than me, you crazy punk.

528
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,366
Scum like you could be 100
and still be beneath me.

529
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,993
What's going on here?

530
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,416
Are you Park Yeonghan?

531
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,293
Yes, sir.
I'm Park Yeonghan from Hwangchun.

532
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,671
Are you out of your mind?

533
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,297
You call yourself a detective?

534
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,508
How could you let snakes loose
on innocent citizens?

535
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,344
They were no-good gangsters, not citizens.

536
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,222
And I had no choice
but to use the snakes for the arrest.

537
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,516
Shut up and let him go.

538
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,601
Why would I do that, sir?

539
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,313
He confessed to the assault,
Senior Superintendent Choi.

540
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,773
What assault?

541
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,484
It was just a quarrel between neighbors.

542
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,569
Wait, sir.

543
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,490
Are you letting him go
because he's Lee Jungjae's underling?

544
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,159
So you've heard of him.

545
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,536
You disrespectful punk!

546
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,956
Is that how you were taught
back in Hwangchun?

547
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,167
Yes, this is what I was taught.

548
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,211
To lock the criminals up
when charges are proven.

549
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,629
You little…

550
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,881
- Detective Hwang.
- Yes, sir?

551
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,174
Let Viper go!

552
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,926
Yes, sir.

553
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,387
Get your hands off of him, Hwang.

554
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,058
Or else you'll be his accomplice.

555
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,562
Detective Park.

556
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,939
Come with me. Come on.

557
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,650
What are you doing?

558
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,236
- It'll be quick.
- Come on!

559
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,239
We don't do stuff like this
even back in the countryside!

560
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,658
- I understand.
- Don't let him go.

561
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,911
I told you not to let him go.

562
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,454
Chief Yu, seriously!

563
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,289
Hey, Hwangchun.

564
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,999
I'm going to send you
to the literal afterlife.

565
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,751
- Try me then.
- Hey.

566
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,628
Send me to hell, you scumbag!

567
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,837
You prick!

568
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,506
Hold him back, Detective Oh.

569
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,217
- Stop.
- Seriously, come on!

570
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,718
Let's go.

571
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,803
Chief Yu!

572
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,596
- Just come with me.
- Damn it!

573
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,099
- Just sit for a minute.
- Damn this.

574
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,809
Have a seat.

575
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,435
Jeez.

576
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,021
Do you get it now?

577
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,441
Why catching thugs in Jongnam
is a nightmare?

578
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:14,112
I can't imagine this happening
back in my home…

579
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,863
This would never happen there.

580
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,324
The moment we catch some gangsters,

581
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,159
we bust their heads open.

582
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,579
We give them a good old stomping,
all right?

583
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,039
Goodness.

584
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,958
It must be nice being a cop there.

585
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,295
It's only my first day here,
and I'm already losing steam.

586
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,050
So?

587
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,219
Are you going back then?

588
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,680
No, it's just…

589
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,641
If this is how it's going to be,

590
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,935
how can I keep being a cop?

591
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,277
You, follow me.

592
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,739
- Where, sir?
- Just follow me.

593
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,202
Hey, wait up!

594
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,746
Let's play together!

595
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,206
Damn you!

596
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,584
You punk!

597
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,136
Die, you punk.

598
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,637
Damned scumbag.

599
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,684
Take that.

600
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,190
Stay out of Dongdaemun
and keep your cop business in Jongnam.

601
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,947
Hey, is he dead?

602
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,866
No way.

603
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,784
Come on, check.

604
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,663
No need. Let's go.

605
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,668
Hey!

606
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,132
Jeez.

607
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,731
I took a good punch, didn't I?

608
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,485
Are you done?

609
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,946
Almost.

610
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,658
You punk!

611
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,544
You prick!

612
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,299
- Let him go!
- Stop, you punk!

613
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,186
Tailor Jongnam's

614
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:04,031
Are you getting me a suit
so I don't run away?

615
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,325
That's not it.

616
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,328
I came into some money recently,
and I had nothing to spend it on.

617
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,083
I guess the chiefs in Seoul
are really generous.

618
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,669
You actually spend money
on your subordinates.

619
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,381
So, are you thinking
of going back to Hwangchun?

620
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,926
I'm starting to think I've got a reason…

621
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,679
to hold my ground here.

622
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,639
And what might that be?

623
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,475
Well, I won't say.

624
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,147
Hey, Kim Sangsun.

625
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,607
What part of jurisdiction
don't you understand?

626
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,236
It's the territory
where authority can be exercised.

627
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,533
Then why did you go to Dongdaemun
to beat thugs up?

628
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,289
These gangsters crossed over
to Jongnam first.

629
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,583
These aren't ordinary gangsters.

630
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,377
They're the Great Tigers of the East.

631
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,712
As in the big cats of the east side.

632
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:04,216
They help Lee Jungjae change
vagrants' lives for the better.

633
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,678
Better, my foot.

634
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,763
Jeez.

635
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,975
These bastards roughed up
some child beggars in Jongnam

636
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,019
for refusing to hand over money.

637
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,567
I'm sure they were collecting the money
for their good cause.

638
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,235
Apologize now.

639
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,782
What?

640
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,619
Apologizing won't be enough.

641
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,537
Kneel in front of them.

642
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,089
Why on earth would I do that?

643
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,176
Sangsun.

644
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,969
Hey.

645
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,680
I have three kids at home.

646
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,225
If you don't kneel, I'll lose my job.

647
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,769
Think about my wife.

648
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,188
Please, just this once.

649
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,107
What…

650
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,817
Damn it.

651
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,581
Hey.

652
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,543
Both knees on the ground.

653
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,562
My apologies to your wife, Chief Byun.

654
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,897
Are you kidding me?

655
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,316
Hello, sir.

656
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,028
Who was that?

657
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,490
That's Kim Sangsun, the Mad Dog.

658
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,659
He's the one punk in this station
that can't be tamed.

659
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,787
Why would you tame him?
He's not a wild animal.

660
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,998
That punk actually bites.

661
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,792
He bites the criminals he arrests.

662
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,253
Even the Dongdaemun guys leave him alone.

663
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,713
What a nutcase.

664
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,632
But nutcases were a dime a dozen
in Hwangchun.

665
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,884
Even I was a mad dog.

666
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,177
That's not all.

667
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,430
He even bites dogs.

668
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,681
Dogs?

669
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,765
Yes.

670
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,769
He really is a wild animal.

671
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,237
Boarding house

672
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,533
Yes?

673
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,036
Hello.

674
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,580
Thank you.

675
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,750
I've never seen
such a handsome cop before.

676
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,918
You have a fine face.

677
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,754
You're flattering me.

678
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,090
Hmm?

679
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,175
What is it?

680
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,427
Marilyn Monroe?

681
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,013
Aren't you Marilyn Monroe?

682
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,516
You flatter me.

683
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,142
- Anyways, ma'am?
- Yes?

684
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,393
Which way is my room?

685
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,606
Coming through.

686
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,316
Oh!

687
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,322
I'm hungry, ma'am. When's dinner?

688
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,491
It's coming right up.

689
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,661
Let's all eat together.
You should get to know the other boarders.

690
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,954
Of course.

691
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,455
- I'll call when it's ready.
- Okay.

692
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,831
- Get some rest.
- Thank you.

693
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,843
All right,
we've got a new boarder.

694
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,099
This right here is Eundong,

695
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,518
who works at the renowned Goryeo Bank.

696
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,644
Nice to meet you.

697
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,355
This here is Gukjin, a legal official…

698
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,816
Well, he's still studying to be one.

699
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,359
Hello.

700
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,363
Gukjin is a little shy, as you can tell.

701
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,614
I see.

702
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,200
Do you always get to eat this well?

703
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,577
I hope you like the food.

704
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,287
I'm sure I will.

705
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,413
Detective.

706
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,373
I have a question.

707
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,709
I'm all ears.

708
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,838
Do you have
an installment savings account?

709
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,592
I know just the right product
for a civil servant like you--

710
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,843
There you go again.

711
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,303
Don't you know detectives get paid…

712
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,638
Get paid pennies?

713
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,682
You heard her.

714
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,603
Even if you save up a little,

715
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,105
you can use that later
when you get married or…

716
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,189
Detective?

717
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,525
Y-Yes?

718
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,652
Could you…

719
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,863
show me your gun later?

720
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,449
Well…

721
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,951
My gun?

722
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,122
You're making him uncomfortable.
Please, eat.

723
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,707
It's all right.

724
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,628
Just go home already if you're drunk.

725
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,963
I'm not drunk yet.

726
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,716
I got whooped so hard today
that my mind is still wide awake.

727
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,843
You don't know what I went through.

728
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,221
Where's Soonnam? Huh?

729
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:06,602
I wonder where my friend Soonnam is.

730
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,521
Here, Soonnam.

731
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,858
There you were, little Soonnam.

732
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,111
You're hungry, aren't you?

733
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,447
Do you want a little bite of this?

734
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,907
Do you want a little bite of this?

735
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,120
That's too expensive to give to that dog.

736
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,998
You don't know how dogs feel.

737
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,876
They need a special treat once in a while.

738
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,545
It must be so nice
knowing how dogs feel.

739
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:38,133
Well, it takes one to know one.

740
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,305
She's right.

741
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,016
Only you and I understand each other.

742
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,190
Jeez. Wait a minute.

743
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:56,527
Look at how full the moon is, Soonnam.

744
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,904
Why don't you make a wish, Soonnam?

745
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,281
Let's make a wish.

746
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:05,202
I wish Soonnam would turn into a human.

747
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,830
Please turn into a human, Soonnam.

748
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,207
Please turn into a human.

749
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,629
Please spare me.

750
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,216
Please.

751
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,177
Aim!

752
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,681
Fire!

753
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:29,768
Aim.

754
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,939
Fire!

755
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,280
Hey! Why aren't you firing?

756
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,701
What are you doing, student soldier?

757
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:50,581
Don't look at me.
Look forward, aim, and fire.

758
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,332
Fire.

759
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,376
Fire, you little prick!

760
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,702
I knew this would happen.

761
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,247
Thanks to our Detective Hwangchun,

762
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,875
the snake soup store is booming.

763
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,503
What do you mean?

764
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,298
You better hurry there.

765
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,344
Go.

766
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,567
Sir.

767
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,778
I'm not selling to you.

768
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,072
Don't ever come here again.

769
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,491
Stay away.

770
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,285
I'm fine.

771
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,870
Just go to Mr. Oh.

772
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,208
He left?

773
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,044
He didn't have a choice
when his store was destroyed.

774
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,798
Good job letting all those snakes loose.

775
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,635
Maybe they were all in on that scheme.

776
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,846
You're right.

777
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,015
He tried to make it seem like
he wasn't in with the gangsters.

778
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,183
That's not…

779
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,644
Just collect your dues
from the market and leave.

780
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,437
Stop causing more trouble.

781
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,648
I'm very sorry to butt in,

782
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,650
but I'm not a dirty cop.

783
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,527
Sure you aren't.

784
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,195
Cops only care about money

785
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,739
and you're all in cahoots
with the gangsters.

786
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,241
Excuse me, ma'am.

787
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,742
What does that make me--

788
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,744
Forget it.
Just have a bowl.

789
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:54,872
Then leave.

790
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:09,261
What on earth did the cops do
to deserve this reputation here?

791
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,638
I'm starving.

792
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,723
Hey, Detective.

793
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:16,977
Come eat at our place.

794
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,814
Your place? Where is it?

795
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,068
Baeknyeonhwapyeon Rice Cakes

796
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,655
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

797
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,457
This is so delicious.

798
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,250
Eat up.

799
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:44,963
I was wondering.

800
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,841
Are you the cop who let the snakes loose?

801
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,053
You should slow down.

802
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,971
Yes.

803
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,437
How did you think of letting
poisonous snakes loose on the gangsters?

804
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,981
Those weren't poisonous.

805
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,067
I didn't want them to die for real.

806
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,027
That would've been awful.

807
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,612
What a waste.

808
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,989
I would've used real poisonous snakes.

809
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,825
There you go again with your nonsense.

810
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,788
Will you keep going after
the gangsters like that?

811
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,623
Mm…

812
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,501
Yes.

813
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,920
I'll let snakes, centipedes,
and whatever else loose on them.

814
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,465
Hmm.

815
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,633
You're a lunatic.

816
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,513
If you ever get your butt kicked
by the gangsters and feel hungry,

817
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,973
feel free to come here.

818
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,350
If you're going to get beat up,

819
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,686
you might as well be full.

820
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,979
Huh?

821
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,647
Yes, ma'am.

822
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,066
Hey, Detective.

823
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,819
I admire you.

824
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,405
Shut your trap
and go pound the rice cakes.

825
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,907
You're always on my case.

826
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,917
My goodness.

827
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,212
Did I block out the sun too much?

828
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,050
Yes, I guess it's a little chilly
in the shade.

829
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,427
Just a moment.

830
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,439
Look at all these cabbages.

831
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,190
This looks like a lot of work.

832
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,817
I'm doing all right.

833
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,485
How can I help you?

834
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,574
Would you like to go look at birds
with me later

835
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,617
in front of the noodle shop?

836
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,287
I'm scared of birds.

837
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,751
I just remembered
that I'm scared of birds too.

838
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,045
I got pecked on the forehead as a kid.

839
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,923
Out of the way.

840
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,051
Get out of the way!

841
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,764
I'm sure you've heard already.

842
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,474
From now on,

843
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:04,561
the Dongdaemun gang
will be in charge of Jongnam Market.

844
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,774
Now pay your dues, everyone.

845
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,401
Dues?

846
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,449
Didn't you see
what happened to the fabric store?

847
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,494
That'll be your fate if you don't pay up.

848
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,537
Look here, Mr. Rattlesnake.

849
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,208
How are we supposed
to cough up that much money?

850
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,463
You little prick.

851
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,589
Hey!

852
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,803
Who on earth is that?

853
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,894
Stop causing trouble and leave.

854
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,941
Just sit still and shut up,
you poor little rice boy.

855
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,567
I won't play nice anymore.

856
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,447
Damn.

857
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,825
The vegetable store owner's daughter

858
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,577
looks a lot like that pretty actress.

859
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,375
I didn't know she was this pretty.

860
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,962
Let me pinch those cheeks of yours.
Look how cute these…

861
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,716
Hey.

862
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,302
- Why don't I pinch yours first?
- Wait…

863
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,146
Take care of
your adoptive grandmother, all right?

864
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,981
She treats you like her own grandson.

865
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,566
Don't worry about that.

866
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,777
I'm going to study hard
and make sure she lives the best life.

867
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,279
That's right.

868
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,116
What? Did a fight break out?

869
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:45,078
It's the Dongdaemun gangsters again.

870
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,348
Are you just going to watch, Detective?

871
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,310
I mean, it looks like it's almost over.

872
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,537
You little--

873
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,503
Is this guy a giant
or really someone from around here?

874
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,257
He's both.

875
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,051
What?

876
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:57,692
I need you to go somewhere.

877
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,278
- What's this, sir?
It's top secret.

878
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:03,657
Bring it to Senior Superintendent Kim
in Daejeon by today. Got it?

879
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,077
What is it?

880
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,412
Get moving.

881
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,039
All right.

882
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,669
Don't glare at me like that.

883
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,196
Stop playing innocent.

884
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,447
I'm telling the truth.

885
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,574
You stubborn little prick.

886
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,243
Who did you arrest now?

887
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,829
I caught him touching
a woman's bottom in a streetcar.

888
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,872
I didn't. She had a loose thread.

889
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,916
And I happen to be good at sewing.

890
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,793
I'm also a medical student
at Hanju University.

891
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,212
Follow me before I sew your mouth shut.

892
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,297
Please.

893
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,134
That detective from Hwangchun
is a real grim reaper.

894
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,593
Gather up.

895
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,097
- Address?
- Insa-dong…

896
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,682
What do we do about the cow thief?

897
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,643
You told me you live in Hyehwa-dong.

898
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,894
That's what you said before.

899
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,940
- Should we take him there?
- Should we?

900
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,109
Are you serious?

901
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,111
He let snakes loose.
What if he causes trouble?

902
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,905
Think of your children
and be more decisive.

903
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,073
So not Hanju University?

904
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,160
You lie every time
you open your mouth, don't you?

905
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,831
Listen.

906
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,875
If you ever feel the urge
to feel someone up,

907
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,877
just do it to yourself.

908
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,045
Okay.

909
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:41,713
Do some self-reflection.

910
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,590
- I'm sorry.
- Go.

911
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,054
Hey, Yeonghan.

912
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,555
I want you to organize some files.

913
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,057
What files?

914
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,017
The station's second quarter case files.

915
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,436
But why me?

916
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,397
The new kid always does it.

917
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,690
It helps you get caught up.

918
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,943
I see what's going on here.

919
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,695
Just follow the orders I give you.

920
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:12,994
Detective Park.

921
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:20,418
Are you saying they're trying
to leave us out of something?

922
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,503
Exactly.

923
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,173
Choi sends me off to Daejeon
and Byun has you organizing files.

924
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:28,093
Those rotten scumbags.

925
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,844
They're all in on this.

926
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,806
Wait, has this happened before?

927
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,350
Yes, they had cops stand guard
for Lee Jungjae's birthday bash.

928
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,977
And when they got rid of
Lee Kipoong's nemesis, Assemblyman Hong.

929
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,106
I would've flipped tables
if I had been there.

930
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,190
So…

931
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,360
considering the circumstances,

932
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,071
you think they'll do
something similar again?

933
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,656
I think so.

934
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,741
But I have a worse feeling today.

935
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,786
Keep an eye out.

936
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,749
I'll try, but…

937
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,169
I have a question.

938
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,088
What is it?

939
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,717
Well, it's something
I've wanted to ask you.

940
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,347
Why are you fighting this lonely fight?

941
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,224
You know nothing will change.

942
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,269
You're right. It won't.

943
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:23,231
But it doesn't hurt for someone like me
to exist in this world.

944
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,068
Join me, and we'd make two.

945
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,489
Keep your eyes peeled.

946
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,200
Have a safe trip, sir.

947
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,460
This is going to take forever.

948
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,024
Jeez.

949
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,986
I thought someone was riding a motorcycle.

950
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,365
Well, I do sound like one.

951
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,660
Do you know who I am?

952
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,954
Yes, the one-way ticket to the afterlife.

953
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,916
That's not who I am.

954
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,544
I'm the number one arrester
of cow thieves from Hwangchun.

955
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,797
Right, number one. Good for you.

956
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,551
Could I get some more sleep now?

957
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,721
Just don't snore.
You're distracting me from work.

958
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:38,973
Got it.

959
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,955
I'm clocking out.

960
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,416
See you later, boys.

961
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,834
- I'm off.
- Yes, sir.

962
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,381
Shall we get going too?

963
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,550
I'm off as well.

964
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,244
I'll go ahead.

965
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,080
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

966
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,290
Are you going home?

967
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,591
I'm headed to the bathhouse.

968
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,135
Lucky you.

969
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,469
Scrub yourself clean.

970
00:59:58,553 --> 00:59:59,554
All right.

971
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,681
I'll go now.

972
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,289
You should finish.

973
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,042
The bathhouse, was it?

974
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,794
Yes.

975
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:35,256
Don't all bathhouses nationwide
take the day off on Tuesdays?

976
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,552
Well, I built my own bathhouse…

977
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,180
at home.

978
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:48,853
What did I say I was in Hwangchun?

979
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:52,815
You caught the most cow thieves.

980
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,400
That's right, Detective Oh.

981
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:58,946
Right now, you're looking
just like the cow thieves I've caught.

982
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,741
Do I?

983
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,330
I wonder where everybody went.

984
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:10,792
What? Everybody went somewhere?

985
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,921
Listen.

986
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,465
Back in Hwangchun,

987
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,551
do you know
how we got punks to tell the truth?

988
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:22,553
No, sir.

989
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:26,766
Five seconds with their heads
in the crapper could make anyone fold.

990
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,601
Is that so?

991
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,104
But you know what's worse?

992
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,857
They'd get a rash from the crap

993
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,485
and have their faces burning for days.

994
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:41,114
Don't even get me started on the stench.

995
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,449
And imagine having flies
buzzing on your face for days.

996
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,703
That sounds nice, right?

997
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:49,080
So where is everyone again?

998
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,836
I need to go.

999
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,966
- You're not going anywhere, you punk.
- Wait, where are you taking me?

1000
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,761
- Let the fun begin.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1001
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,847
Are you ready?

1002
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,642
All right, this is your chance.

1003
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,686
Please, no.

1004
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,271
- Detective!
- Come on.

1005
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,022
Are you really
going to keep your trap shut?

1006
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,526
You're so close to touching
that thing on the right.

1007
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,528
This one's got lots of crap.

1008
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:23,156
Damn, that's a big one.

1009
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,991
I really don't know!

1010
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,206
Hey, get up.

1011
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,459
What happened to letting me sleep?

1012
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:35,835
We need to move out.

1013
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:37,920
Where to?

1014
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,505
To catch a smuggler.

1015
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,965
Which one?

1016
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:44,051
Lee Jungbum of Yongsan
or Sergeant Park of Dongducheon?

1017
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,679
Lee Jungbum,
Lee Jungjae's distant relative.

1018
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,432
Seriously,

1019
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:52,769
does Lee Jungjae know
every scumbag in this country?

1020
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,604
There's also an accomplice.

1021
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,273
Who is it?

1022
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:04,572
Reservoir

1023
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,129
Do you know my name?

1024
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,800
Park Yeonghan.

1025
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,723
What about mine?

1026
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,851
The Biter of Dogs,

1027
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:35,728
Kim Sangsun.

1028
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:39,148
I don't need the fancy nickname,

1029
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,150
Detective Park From Hell.

1030
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,114
I'm curious.

1031
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,284
Why do you live like that?

1032
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,788
I mean, going around biting gangsters

1033
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:55,748
and not ever listening to your superiors.

1034
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,128
It doesn't hurt
for someone like me to exist.

1035
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,550
It doesn't hurt for someone like me
to exist in this world.

1036
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,302
Join me, and we'd make two.

1037
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,680
Three.

1038
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:12,557
What?

1039
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,559
Not one,

1040
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,644
but three.

1041
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:30,616
Police

1042
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:45,840
Damn.

1043
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:48,050
I had my suspicions about them,

1044
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,260
but this blows my mind.

1045
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,055
They're worse than Soonnam.

1046
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:54,807
What do you suggest we do?

1047
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,103
Call the American military police.

1048
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,897
We're outnumbered, and they've got guns.

1049
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,317
Guns?

1050
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,321
We've got them too.

1051
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:10,990
- Calm down.
- Why?

1052
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,368
They're leaving.
Let's jump on them now.

1053
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:15,995
Let's go.

1054
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,874
- What's this?
- Imported cigarettes.

1055
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:22,543
I think they're called Lucky…

1056
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,128
You don't seem to know, Chief.

1057
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:25,630
- It says on the box.
- Chief Byun.

1058
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,131
Yes, sir.

1059
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:31,010
It's always good to know
that you officers have our backs.

1060
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,512
Call us anytime.

1061
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,306
We'll come armed to the teeth.

1062
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,559
Hey.

1063
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,770
Nice job…

1064
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:43,564
- Boys.
- "Boy"?

1065
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,984
I can never tell
how old these Westerners are.

1066
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:49,487
Thank you.

1067
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:52,907
I'm a man,
not a boy, you punk.

1068
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,707
How could you leave us out?

1069
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,632
What on earth?

1070
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,217
How did you punks find out about this?

1071
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,010
How do you think?

1072
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,428
We followed the stench.

1073
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,389
It's reeking out there.

1074
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,640
What the hell's going on?

1075
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:19,225
- Who are they?
- Calm down.

1076
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,393
Careful.

1077
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,025
This is the problem with city folks.

1078
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:29,902
They don't know how to share.

1079
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:33,072
Chief Byun.

1080
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,824
I'm on your team. Why'd you leave me out?

1081
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:36,951
You'd do the same thing if you were me.

1082
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:40,413
That's true.

1083
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:44,917
Now, load the stolen goods
back on the truck,

1084
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,878
- and we'll head to the American base.
- Come on!

1085
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,131
I said, load them back up.

1086
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:52,675
I got this, Chief Byun.
Move over, make way.

1087
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,719
Put your gun down, Hwangchun.

1088
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,805
Those American soldiers
won't even notice losing this stuff.

1089
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:00,683
They can live without them,
so put your gun down.

1090
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:03,436
You dirty, rotten scumbags.

1091
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,272
This is why
Seoul cops get such a bad reputation.

1092
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,525
Then go back to Hwangchun, you prick!

1093
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:10,943
I can't go back, you prick!

1094
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,659
I paid my rent three months in advance.

1095
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,536
And it's nonrefundable.

1096
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,000
What's he blabbering about?

1097
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,502
If you won't budge,
we can have a shootout and all die.

1098
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:29,920
- Hey.
- Calm down.

1099
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,547
- I'll shoot.
- Hey, Sangsun.

1100
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,132
Come on, shoot me.

1101
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,092
- Hey!
- Hold on, hold on.

1102
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,677
Shoot!

1103
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,686
What?

1104
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:50,167
Chief Detective 1958

1105
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,545


1106
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:55,422
Just don't do anything,
Detective Park.

1107
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,008
Not doing anything like this
makes me feel sick.

1108
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,010


1109
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,387
I'll take care of him.

1110
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,973
Don't do anything you'll regret.
I suggest you go home.

1111
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:05,766
-
Go!

1112
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:07,977
Are you okay? Are you not hurt?

1113
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,770


1114
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,438
What are you doing?

1115
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,440
- Join our unit.
Why should I?

1116
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:15,985
- Would you like to be a cop?
Goodness!

1117
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:19,238
Could I really get to work
with you, Detective?

1118
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,282
Hey, Hanju University.

1119
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:23,117
Let's work together.

1120
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,244
There are two things we need to remember.

1121
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,246
Protect the weak.

1122
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,331
And beat the crap out of bad guys.

1123
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,334
