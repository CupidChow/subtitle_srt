1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,952
There is a girl at school who I'm interested in.

2
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:05,788
There is.

3
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,482

4
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:09,851

5
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:10,753
But...

6
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:12,638

7
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,164
I wasn't asking you.

8
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:21,754
What are you doing here though?

9
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:23,673
Because of what you asked earlier.

10
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:25,843
I came to tell you who I heard it from.

11
00:00:25,843 --> 00:00:27,285
I see.

12
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:30,647
You seem really busy taking care of the transfer student.

13
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:31,973
Because I'm the class president.

14
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:34,016
My class president hates me.

15
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:36,411
He's afraid I'll become first in the natural sciences department.

16
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,063
I envy you.

17
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:40,215
It must be nice having a kind class president.

18
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:43,626
Yes. I'm happy.

19
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,446
Let's go. I don't know where the gym is.

20
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,448
Okay, hang on.

21
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:48,557
I'll get going then.

22
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:50,358
Oh, right.

23
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,769
Are you coming to the Han River too?

24
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:56,064
You didn't say anything in the chat room.

25
00:00:57,332 --> 00:00:59,617
When did you join our chat room?

26
00:00:59,617 --> 00:01:02,211
Bo Ram invited me earlier.

27
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:03,722
Are you coming then?

28
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,593
I wasn't going to...

29
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,265
But I will now.

30
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:16,184
 A-TEEN 2

31
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:18,720
Why isn't it coming? I'm starving.

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,522
Hey, did you order rice balls too?

33
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:21,774
Of course!

34
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:24,425
Non-spicy, two rice balls with extra glass noodles.

35
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:26,494
Good.

36
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,281
Why is he here?

37
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,676
What? He's a member of our chat room.

38
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,911
Did you expect me to eave him out? That's so mean.

39
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:35,579
Why did you invite him in the first place?

40
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,549
We eat lunch together. We're friends.

41
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,086
Friend? Whatever.

42
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:45,463
What about Doha? Weren't you coming with her?

43
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:46,882
Doha said she couldn't come today.

44
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:48,367
She's on a date with Si Woo.

45
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,510
Oh, right. Today is Friday.

46
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,279
Those two must be busy with their art and training.

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,190
It's amazing how they make time to go on dates.

48
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,711
Aren't you in the same department? Aren't you busy?

49
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:01,846
No, not really.

50
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:04,433
Oh, right. We have to buy something to drink.

51
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:05,359
I'll go buy them.

52
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,478
No. I'll go.

53
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:10,790
- Let's go together. 
 - Okay.

54
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,335
I'm not going to drink coffee today.

55
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:25,512
Why do you think this is for you?

56
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,189
Sorry, I guess I was mistaken.

57
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,616
It is for you. Should I not buy it then?

58
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,884
No, don't buy it.

59
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,445
I don't want to drink coffee when I'm having fun.

60
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:37,141
Oh, right. I have tickets for Lee Myeong Hak's free lecture.

61
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:38,925
Do you want to come? It's tomorrow.

62
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,560
Tomorrow?

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,304
I have a private lesson.

64
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,939
Really?

65
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,916
Instead, let's go to the library together on Sunday.

66
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,526
Okay.

67
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,482
Why are you sitting next to me? It's so awkward.

68
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,579
Thank you, guys.

69
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,913
I want Sprite!

70
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:04,167
- Put them down here. 
 - Okay.

71
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,153
Wait, the tteokbokki hasn't arrived yet?

72
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:10,132
I know. It's so boring having to wait like this.

73
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:13,635
Are you bored? I brought something really fun.

74
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:15,420
Guess what it is.

75
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,972
- Whiskey? 
 - Not again.

76
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:19,098
Your dad threw a fit the last time you stole his whiskey.

77
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,693
No, I didn't steal it this time. I bought it.

78
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:22,894
You bought whiskey?

79
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:25,213
No.

80
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:27,648
Look. It's a lie detector.

81
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:28,666
Wow!

82
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,902
Is this meant for Kim Ha Na?

83
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:31,711
Hey!

84
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,189
Does this actually work?

85
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:37,066
Gi Hyun, stick your hand in here.

86
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:38,676
Ask him a question.

87
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,604
It's obvious what the question is.

88
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,308
If I'm born again,

89
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,251
I will go out with Bo Ram.

90
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:48,145
Yes. Of course.

91
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,472
Isn't the question too easy?

92
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:52,674
This feels a bit emotional. It isn't fun at all.

93
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:56,527
Gosh, was the question too obvious?

94
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,834
No... No, wait.

95
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,945
- Oh, no. 
 - No, this is...

96
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:14,738
Something is wrong with this machine.

97
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:16,506
Hey!

98
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,978
You're dead.

99
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,641
To be honest, I think...

100
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,335
Gi Hyun is extremely good-looking.

101
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,540
I really don't want to answer, but I'll say yes.

102
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,134
You're dead.

103
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,076
This machine is weird.

104
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,127
No, it's totally accurate.

105
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:47,162
I want to go home.

106
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,030
Hey!

107
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,525
All right. What's the question?

108
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,193
I'll ask her.

109
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,654
I think taking care of the transfer student Joo Ha

110
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:58,048
is a pain in the butt.

111
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,785
I'm afraid at least one of us will end up being hurt.

112
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:04,546
- Does this hurt? 
 - Hurry up and answer, Kimha.

113
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:06,731
I'm scared.

114
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:08,233
A little bit?

115
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:10,243
That's mean.

116
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,583
 Nobody likes lies.

117
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,968
- What does it mean? 
 - It means she lied.

118
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:28,227
Why did you lie?

119
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,896
What?

120
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:34,315
 But now, lying doesn't seem so bad after all.

121
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:36,103
It's because she's a liar.

122
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,613
She's right, I am a liar.

123
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:40,699
Kim Ha Na has many secrets.

124
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,243
I'm not keeping any secrets from you guys anymore.

125
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,303
Are you sure this is accurate?

126
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,513
Joo Ha, you try it too.

127
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,499
You'll be in big trouble if you lie.

128
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,935
Right. Okay, Joo Ha can go next.

129
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,687
Here, put your hand in.

130
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,009
There is a girl at school...

131
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:02,203
who I'm interested in.

132
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,990
There is.

133
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,942
My goodness, there is? Who is it?

134
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,243
I had my hopes up for nothing.

135
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,547
Why did you get your hopes up? We should throw this away.

136
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,166
I was just kidding.

137
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,426
The machine must be broken.

138
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,938
Oh, yes. I'll be right there.

139
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:30,649
Our tteokbokki is here! I'll go get it.

140
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:35,044
- Hey! 
 - Wait, wear your shoes.

141
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:36,396
No one's taking your tteokbokki.

142
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,189
Hurry back.

143
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,081
- This is delicious. 
 - It is.

144
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:48,659
Were you left-handed? I didn't know.

145
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,077
By any chance, are you a genius?

146
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,104
They say left-handed people are geniuses.

147
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,015
I was always left-handed.

148
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,216
Genius? That's ridiculous.

149
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,361
What are you doing?

150
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,857
- You guys are so funny. 
 - Hey.

151
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,408
Is that a compliment or an insult?

152
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:06,702
It's an insult, of course.

153
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:08,978
It was a compliment.

154
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,874
I know I'm quite a witty girl.

155
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:15,435
If my mom took care of me instead of my sister,

156
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,979
I'd be working in broadcasting...

157
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,947
Broadcasting?

158
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:21,433
Shall I do a broadcast?

159
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,468
Just like that, out of the blue?

160
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:24,836
I think you'll be good at it.

161
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:26,738
Tell me if you'll do a broadcast.

162
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,832
I'll lend you my game console.

163
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:30,033
Really?

164
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,095
Game console? What game console? What do you have?

165
00:07:33,095 --> 00:07:35,471
A PlayStation.

166
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:37,190
And a Nintendo Switch.

167
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,276
Oh, I also had a Nintendo Wii,

168
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:41,011
but I just keep it in a box now because I don't play it anymore.

169
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:43,813
- I see. 
 - Stuff like that.

170
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:46,533
You're a really great guy.

171
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,152
And you're a real suck-up.

172
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,679
- I know. 
 - But Bo Ram,

173
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,631
I think you will be a great YouTuber.

174
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:54,625
I'm going to master YouTube starting today.

175
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,818
I'll subscribe to your Channel.

176
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:59,129
I'll become a YouTuber, so you can be a civil servant

177
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,381
- and provide a stable income. 
 - That was a secret.

178
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,108
Gi Hyun!

179
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,343
You want to be a civil servant?

180
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:05,344
Wow!

181
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:07,578
That doesn't suit you at all.

182
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:12,458
What about me? What do you think will suit me?

183
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,994
- A lawyer? 
 - A lawyer?!

184
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,522
"I plead the defendant's innocence."

185
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:18,748
- Gosh. 
 - No, that sounds bad.

186
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,942
A stewardess?

187
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:22,510
Or a teacher?

188
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,613
"Kids, lying is bad." Something like this?

189
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:26,665
Hey, stop teasing me.

190
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:29,083
Or a news anchor?

191
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:33,296
"This is the nine o'clock news." How do I sound?

192
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:36,542
But shouldn't news anchors always tell the truth?

193
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,209
I told you to stop.

194
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:39,720
It's fun.

195
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,072
What's wrong? I think she'll do well.

196
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,778
Wasn't the tteokbokki delicious?

197
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,305
It wasn't bad.

198
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:54,284
  You shouldn't say what your birthday wish is, stupid.

199
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,903
  - Why not? 
 - What is it? Just tell me.

200
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:02,275
Are you all going home?

201
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,235
Where else would we go?

202
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:05,654
If I get back too late, I might wake my siblings.

203
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:07,864
I have to go home too before my grandma goes to bed.

204
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:10,967
Me too. My parents will kill me.

205
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,061
I don't have to go home yet.

206
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:15,371
I don't have any parents who will kill me.

207
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,461
Do you live alone then?

208
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,296
Can I come over and use your PlayStation then?

209
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,190
Oh, no. My house is far from here.

210
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,551
I bet Kimha's house is farther away.

211
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,769
I bet my house is farther away.

212
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,305
If it's farther than Kimha's house,

213
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,973
is your house located in Tongyeong or something?

214
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,084
Hey. Do you still not know where Tongyeong is?

215
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:38,620
I do know. It's in Gyeongsang...

216
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,455
The south... Anyway, it's in Gyeongsang-do.

217
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,492
It's in Jeolla-do, you idiot.

218
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,977
- Gosh. 
 - It's in Gyeongsangnam-do.

219
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:49,614
What are you doing tomorrow?

220
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,211
I mean...

221
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:56,145
If you don't want to stay at home,

222
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:59,424
how about going to a special lecture with me?

223
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,352
Okay.

224
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,645
Let's go together.

225
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,590
Sure.

226
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,540
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

227
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,900
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

228
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,430
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

229
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:24,566
 Hello.

230
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:28,385
This is Bo Ram of "Yeo Bo Ram's Happy Day".

231
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:32,532
Today, I will teach you about the Glacial Augment Ahri.

232
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,334
The Glacial...

233
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:37,578
The Glacial...

234
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:39,397
The Glacial Augment Rune.

235
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:44,001
This is all you need to know about Ahri.

236
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,587
I need to post something to get more subscribers.

237
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,505

238
00:10:58,717 --> 00:10:59,451

239
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,328
What do I have to do first?

240
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,999
New... New.

241
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,018
Open.

242
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:10,462
Close... Oh, gosh.

243
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:14,610
Is it open or close? Why are there so many buttons?

244
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,560

245
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,084
I think I made a mistake.

246
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,855
Oh, there we go.
