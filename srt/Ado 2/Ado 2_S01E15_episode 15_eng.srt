1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:01,960
You were that nice someone.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,137
Is this a confession?

3
00:00:05,137 --> 00:00:06,798

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,767

5
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:10,719

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,687
Why did you want to see me?

7
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:14,481
I'm busy.

8
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,408
I'm sure you're busy being the top student.

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,545
Stop saying that. It makes me uncomfortable.

10
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:22,322
That's what I'm trying to do.

11
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,382
What a lie.

12
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:27,602
So what do you need to tell me?

13
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:31,848
I...

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,547
Didn't you say

15
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:42,634
that you like someone who's nice?

16
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:43,652
Is it about that again?

17
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,137
No.

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,990
You said you used to like that person, right?

19
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,919
Yes, I did. But why?

20
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,540
It's nothing.

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,783
That's boring.

22
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:03,946
My mom wants me to go and study abroad.

23
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,913
Hey, that's great.

24
00:01:11,913 --> 00:01:14,857
Is this to study veterinary medicine?

25
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,152
It's great?

26
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:19,596
Yes. Congratulations.

27
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:21,397
I'm jealous.

28
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,737
Are you glad that I'm going abroad?

29
00:01:28,737 --> 00:01:32,717
Yes. It's something to congratulate you on.

30
00:01:37,915 --> 00:01:41,126
I guess you don't care if I leave.

31
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:43,119
That's not what I meant.

32
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,039
- Why are you saying that? 
 - Because it's true.

33
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,866
Since you're the top student,

34
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:51,143
you wouldn't care about me. 
 Hey.

35
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:52,646
Bye.

36
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,472
Oh, right.

37
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:57,159
I'm not going abroad right now. I'm going home.

38
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,619
Why are you giving me that attitude?

39
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,245
You said you were happy that I was going abroad.

40
00:02:02,397 --> 00:02:04,407
I don't want you to be happy about it.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,684
Bye.

42
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:08,645
I told you

43
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:13,190
that I used to like someone who is nice, right?

44
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:18,354
You were that nice someone.

45
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:26,920

46
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:30,675
I liked you.

47
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,093
Is this a confession?

48
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,287
- No. 
 - Then what are you doing?

49
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:45,715
I'm not trying to do anything.

50
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,209
I'm just telling you.

51
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:52,539
That's not nice.

52
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,724
You're right. I'm not nice.

53
00:02:55,724 --> 00:03:01,394
And maybe that's why you're being so cold toward me.

54
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:06,587
I'm being so cold toward you, and yet you're telling me

55
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,596
that I'm a nice person?

56
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:11,490
You are.

57
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,911
And I used to like you.

58
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,355
But

59
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,742
you've hurt me again with your words.

60
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:26,330
 You're the one who confessed,

61
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,993
 but I'm the one who got hurt.

62
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:34,205
We are very similar.

63
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:38,982
So while I relied on you a lot,

64
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,064
I also felt uncomfortable about it.

65
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,488
I didn't want you to meet someone like me,

66
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:54,400
whom you'd later have to realize the truth about.

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,011
I thought it'd be best

68
00:03:56,011 --> 00:04:00,356
for you to meet someone whom you could be nice to.

69
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:06,529
That's why I decided to stop liking you.

70
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:15,544
 It's contradictory and ironic.

71
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,351
It's okay. I've had enough coffee today.

72
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,395

73
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,818
I heard you transferred to natural sciences.

74
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,970
I did.

75
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,405
You told me to.

76
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:44,334
And since when did you listen to me so well?

77
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,279
You've always wanted to study natural sciences.

78
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,923
That's why I told you to.

79
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,610
And since when did you care so much about me?

80
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,638
I've cared about you for a long time.

81
00:04:57,638 --> 00:04:59,657
That's ridiculous.

82
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:02,285
Why didn't you choose natural sciences from the start?

83
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,898
It's obvious I'd be compared to you if I did,

84
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:09,308
so why would I?

85
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:13,587
You must be having a rough time after transferring in your senior year.

86
00:05:13,587 --> 00:05:16,382
Yes, it is hard.

87
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:19,327
It's because unlike you, I'm quite stupid.

88
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:23,472
Who said that?

89
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:25,358
Mom.

90
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:29,979
Do you really think she meant that?

91
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:34,484
You're always spending time with her,

92
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:36,778
but you don't know her.

93
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,723
You just do whatever she tells you to.

94
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:43,109
Son.

95
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,678
Why aren't you resting?

96
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,138
Coming home is pretty much resting.

97
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,018
And where have you been?

98
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,565
Mom.

99
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,235
 Professor Kim recommended me, so I'll be attending

100
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,595
 the medical conference at Seoyeon University.

101
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,655
  - Really? 
 - Yes.

102
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,591
 I told him that I was interested in neurosurgery.

103
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,286
 He offered to introduce me to the professors in that field.

104
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:14,131
 I should call him to thank him.

105
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:15,833
 Thank you.

106
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,217
 Your watch was broken.

107
00:06:41,217 --> 00:06:44,612
 You know that time management is crucial for a senior, right?

108
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:52,737
 I'm going to go out for dinner with Mom, so get some rest.

109
00:06:53,564 --> 00:06:57,024
 I'm doing what Mom wants me to do,

110
00:06:57,693 --> 00:07:00,511
 so I hope you'll do what you want to do.

111
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:19,380
 I was the one who wanted to do it.

112
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:24,859
 My brother was the one who couldn't.

113
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:32,207
 It's contradictory and ironic.

114
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:48,210
♫  At the end of the day, I always expect you to come to me  ♫

115
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:56,060
♫  So that you can look forward to tomorrow for your day  ♫

116
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:03,410
♫  You don't have to tell me everything  ♫

117
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,230

♫  Close your eyes and feel the warmth,  ♫

118
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:13,140
♫  today is a good day to permeated  ♫

119
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,479

120
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,989
Sir, we're here.

121
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:19,757
You know that Seoyeon University's admission briefing session is today, right?

122
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:21,218
- Yes. 
 - Good.

123
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:22,628
It will be held in the auditorium at 3 p.m.

124
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,171
Don't be late.

125
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,489
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

126
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:29,542
You can go now.

127
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:33,846
- Sir. 
 - Yes?

128
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:38,784
I don't think I need to go.

129
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,537
Ha Na.

130
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,123
You should still go.

131
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,925
You said you wanted to go to Seoyeon University.

132
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,501
It'll help you if you go to the session today.

133
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:49,530
Listen to the briefing,

134
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,591
think about which admission process might be ideal for you,

135
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:55,101
and ask crucial questions.

136
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,545
Okay?

137
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,107
Okay.

138
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,900
Good.

139
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,422
I've briefed you on Seoyeon University's admission for 2020.

140
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:13,668
Please raise your hands if you have any questions or any personal questions.

141
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:15,964
I'll take your questions now.

142
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:17,424
Yes?

143
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,936
When you were explaining the rolling admission,

144
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,213
you said that the "Seoyeon Love" admission process

145
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:24,898
will only look at our school grades.

146
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,050
I've never heard about this type of admission before.

147
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,053
"Seoyeon Love" is an additional admission that was branched out

148
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:31,446
from the regular rolling admission.

149
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,074
It focuses on only your school grades and records.

150
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,526
You can only apply for it with your school's recommendation.

151
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:39,695
What's important is that it's aimed at recipients of the basic living income.

152
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:41,231
The biggest advantage of this admission process

153
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:45,134
is that if you get in, you'll receive a full scholarship.

154
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:52,225
Then is there no CSAT cut-off score for "Seoyeon Love"?

155
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,986
Yes, there is.

156
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:58,731
You can read about the details on page 18.

157
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,959
Any other questions?

158
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,129
Yes?

159
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,564
If the major you want to study

160
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,010
is difficult to get into,

161
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,372
would it be safer to apply for a major with lower requirements?

162
00:10:15,724 --> 00:10:17,976
I'll give you an example.

163
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:19,578
I knew a student

164
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,130
who wanted to study business, which was difficult to get into.

165
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,708
So the student applied for philosophy and got in,

166
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,344
and studied business too as a double major.

167
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:29,905
Although this was different from the student's original goal,

168
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:33,498
the student got into Seoyeon University and got to study business.

169
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:36,345
 A crisis may turn into an opportunity.

170
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,788
Not everyone can study a double major.

171
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:41,633
It's an opportunity for those who try hard.

172
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:45,818
 And the worst becomes the best.

173
00:10:45,818 --> 00:10:47,964
Thank you.

174
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:52,227
What do you think? Did it help?

175
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:53,803
Yes.

176
00:10:56,807 --> 00:11:01,058
 It's contradictory and ironic.

177
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:02,179
A scholarship...

178
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:03,722
Any more questions?

179
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:07,340
If not, I'll end this briefing. Thank you, everyone.

180
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,986
They bought her a better phone after she lost hers.

181
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,346
This is exactly why she keeps losing them.

182
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,416
What is this?

183
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,458
That's crazy!

184
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,647
But I feel guilty about secretly looking at her phone.

185
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,403
Hey, what did you do with my phone?

186
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:53,354
Nothing.

187
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,450
Why did you steal my phone, you thief?

188
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,036
"Thief"? I just took a look, that's all.

189
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:02,122
As if. You wanted to see what Min and I talked about, right?

190
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,941
Min? Are you guys that close?

191
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,784
Mind your own business, you thief!

192
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:06,919
How much did you read?

193
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,604
I didn't look at anything!

194
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:12,040
Forget it. Think whatever you like, you little...

195
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:20,490
 Kim Ha Na, a senior in Class 3.

196
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,050
 Last year, she copied Do Ha Na and this year, she's copying Kim Min Ji.

197
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,890
 As if being the class president wasn't enough,

198
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,700
 I heard she's aiming for the same university and major.

199
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,455
 She gives me the creeps.

200
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,025
 She's already busy flirting with Ha Min and Ryu Joo Ha.

201
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:32,044
 Now, she's become even busier copying Kim Min Ji.

202
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,786
 Written anonymously.

203
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,184

204
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:40,652
What did you say?

205
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:42,670
Did you not hear me?

206
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,760
Stop flirting with Min.

208
