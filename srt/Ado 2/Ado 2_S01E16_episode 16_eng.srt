1
00:00:02,027 --> 00:00:03,912
I like you.

2
00:00:05,531 --> 00:00:07,299

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,367

4
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:12,594

Ah Hyun, what is it?

5
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:15,724
Ha Na, I'm impatient and can't beat around the bush,

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,517
so I'll just say it.

7
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:20,428
Okay.

8
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:25,191
Ha Na, I like Min.

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,611
So if you don't have feelings for him,

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,913
please don't make it seem like you do.

11
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:32,090
What?

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,708
Did you not hear me?

13
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,994
Stop flirting with Min.

14
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:40,724
"Flirt"? Don't be mistaken. I don't like him.

15
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:43,093
Then why do you keep doing that?

16
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:44,845
What did I do?

17
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,671
Look how brazen you are.

18
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,323
Do you know how annoying you are?

19
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:51,434
Is it that fun to flirt with other guys?

20
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:54,788
I've never flirted with anyone.

21
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,365
Don't lie.

22
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:58,324
I've heard things.

23
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,986
- If you flirt with him again... 
 - Who did you hear it from?

24
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,356
What?

25
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:08,342
You don't need to know that.

26
00:01:08,342 --> 00:01:10,303
I know a lot of people.

27
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,172
But why do you ask?

28
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,623
Do you feel guilty?

29
00:01:14,623 --> 00:01:15,942
No.

30
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,587
But hearing you accuse me of something like that

31
00:01:18,587 --> 00:01:20,098
doesn't feel too good.

32
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:24,592
And I asked because it was regarding myself.

33
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:27,019
- But... 
 - Anyway,

34
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:30,648
it's not true, so don't misunderstand, okay?

35
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:34,051
I have to go and prepare for the mock test.

36
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:35,862
I'll see you around.

37
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,338
Wait...

38
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,853
Gosh, she's really sly.

39
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,567

40
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:02,663

41
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:06,375
 Everyone knows

42
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,278
 that a barren valley

43
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:10,388
 is nature that has been destroyed,

44
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:12,682
 and that the roaring sounds coming from a quarry

45
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:15,684
 are the tyranny of civilization.

46
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:19,372
 These are metaphors.

47
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,329
The answer to question 43 is number 1.

48
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,139
- Okay. 
 - Gosh.

49
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:29,757
The answer to question 44 is number 2.

50
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:33,712
- Right. 
 - The answer to question 45...

51
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:34,780
is number 4.

52
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,114
- Right. 
 - Wow, Kimha.

53
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,115
Did you get all of them right?

54
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,917
Yes, I did.

55
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:41,011
 You traitor.

56
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:43,329
 You're freaking good.

57
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,649
You're full of surprises.

58
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:47,000
- What do you mean? 
 - Oh, it's nothing.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,918
Min Ji, are you okay?

60
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,546
Don't worry, you have good grades.

61
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,364
That's right.

62
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:53,323
You just need to get the minimum score, so don't worry.

63
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:54,633
 What are you doing?

64
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,634
  - It's all right. 
 - Was that okay?

65
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,094
- Don't worry about it. 
 - Of course.

66
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,480
Are you being serious?

67
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,332
Seriously?

68
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,096
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

69
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:09,173
What are you doing today?

70
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:11,950
I'm going to the library to check the wrong answers.

71
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,552
Can you take a break just for today?

72
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:16,563
A senior can't just take a break. But why?

73
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,932
I was going to ask if you wanted to hang out.

74
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,508
Oh, right.

75
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:22,502
I need to study.

76
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,062
Fine, then.

77
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:26,064
I'll just go home.

78
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:28,500
Fine, all right. I'll hang out with you today.

79
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,668
- Really? 
 - Yes.

80
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,752
Where do you want to go?

81
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:33,021
Let's see.

82
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:35,423
- Wait a minute. 
 - Sure.

83
00:03:40,144 --> 00:03:42,781
This is so complicated.

84
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,712
All right.

85
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:50,297
- I'm ready. 
 - Boram.

86
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,674
This is seriously not about me.

87
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:55,402
There are four people. A, B, C, and D.

88
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,678
Who are they?

89
00:03:57,678 --> 00:04:00,031
I'm good at keeping secrets.

90
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,992
Still, I can't tell you.

91
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,670
Come on. Then how could I possibly give good advice?

92
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,823
It's about my friend.

93
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:09,608
That's not important.

94
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:12,085
A likes B.

95
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,313
"A likes B." Got it.

96
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:17,090
But B likes C.

97
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,800
"B likes C."

98
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,286
D is A's older brother.

99
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:22,788
B and C are that scumbag's friends.

100
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:24,664
Right...

101
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,783
- "Scumbag"? 
 - Oh...

102
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:30,036
No, that's not what I said.

103
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,914
I meant to say, "that kid."

104
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,208
- "That kid." 
 - Anyway,

105
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,362
D should be rooting for A and B.

106
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:41,581
But instead, D is being suspicious and disturbing them.

107
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,042
That scumbag is totally useless.

108
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,336
"That scumbag"?

109
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:49,989
 A is Ah Hyun.

110
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,626
 I don't know who B and C are.

111
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,670
 And D is Gi Hyun.

112
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,740
I'm so bothered by this these days.

113
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,941
I...

114
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:02,310
I mean, nothing goes the way A wants it to.

115
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,337
D is the obstacle here.

116
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,665
Get rid of D.

117
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:09,000
D is an idiot.

118
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,295
Hey, I'm not an idiot.

119
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:14,347
I didn't say that it was you.

120
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,699
Oh, okay.

121
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,904
How could you siblings be this similar?

122
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,239
- What do you mean? 
 - What?

123
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,599
No, it's nothing.

124
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:31,298
Anyway, A and B are always seen together.

125
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,550
And A told me... No.

126
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,545
- A asked D for B's number. 
 - I see.

127
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,715
I'm certain that A likes B.

128
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:43,409
Right? She likes Min, right? I knew it!

129
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,712
My gosh.

130
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,222
So B is Min.

131
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:50,600
- No... 
 - Then C is...

132
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,721
B isn't Min. B...

133
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:57,732
 I don't know.

134
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:06,491
That means Min likes Kimha.

135
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,768
I knew this from last year.

136
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,562
Then is Kimha...

137
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,941
Why did you tell me to come alone? What is it?

138
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,835
This is regarding your future school life.

139
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,986
All right, so what is it?

140
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,682
Look.

141
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,351
A

142
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,261
likes B.

143
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,780
But B likes C.

144
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,108
And D is A's older brother.

145
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:34,052
He's an idiot.

146
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:37,272
B and C are that idiot's friends.

147
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,683
B likes C?

148
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:43,386
Yes. But there's a twist.

149
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:47,683
E comes into the picture.

150
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:50,977
E is friends with B, C, and D.

151
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,482
There seems to be something between E and C.

152
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,360
 She is making one seem like the other.

153
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,021
 That is the core of metaphors.

154
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,281
Is that so?

155
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:05,166
Anyway, I'm friends with all...

156
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:09,888
No, it's not about me.

157
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,709
Today,

158
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:16,853
E tried to confess his feelings to C.

159
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:19,973
But D's girlfriend stopped him.

160
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:23,025
D? That's... That's me.

161
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:27,422
That's me!

162
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:32,108
 It's like an open secret that everyone knows about.

163
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:35,513
 That is the charm of metaphors.

164
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:37,424
I only eat aglio e olio pasta.

165
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,501
- Do you like cats? 
 - I like dogs

166
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,029
and rabbits. By the way, you're good at drawing them.

167
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,131
-By the way, 
 - Yes?

168
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,507
Did you finish checking your wrong answers?

169
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,017
Oh, right.

170
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:48,760
I didn't. Why?

171
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,128
Come on.

172
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:51,889
We were going to hang out after you were done.

173
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,282
Let's hang out next time.

174
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:55,717
It's already getting late.

175
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:58,312
I also left my belongings at the library.

176
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,739
I shouldn't have talked to Bo Ram.

177
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:04,242
What did you guys talk about?

178
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:05,744
It's a secret.

179
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:09,171
Come on. I'm curious.

180
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:11,149
Do you want me to tell you?

181
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:12,751
Yes.

182
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,978
A likes B.

183
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:18,490
"A likes B"? Go on.

184
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,268
- Listen to everything first. 
 - Okay.

185
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:24,638
Anyway, so E likes C.

186
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:27,073
"E likes C"?

187
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,900
Who are they?

188
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,220
And E is going to confess to C today.

189
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,855
Really? That's crazy.

190
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:37,600
 Everyone seems to know about this.

191
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,920
 I wonder if you do too.

192
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,130
Do you want to go out with me?

193
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,340
I like you.

194
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,120
Say something. You're making me embarrassed.

195
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,440
♫  I wonder what you feel, I draw pictures every day  ♫

196
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:04,819
Okay. I'd like that.

197
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,696
- What did you say? 
 - What?

198
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:07,460
What did you say?

199
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,950
♫  your lips, and our time  ♫

200
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:11,626
Well...

201
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:13,695
I like you too.

202
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:16,813
Hey. 
 ♫  Maybe I remember you  ♫

203
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:18,920
I like you too.

204
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,060
♫  Maybe I like you, maybe I remember you  ♫

205
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,600
♫  My heart is strange,  ♫

206
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,620
Do you want some of mine? 
 ♫  My heart is strange,  ♫

207
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,100
♫  but I am really curious about you  ♫

208
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,284

209
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:38,352

210
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,277
You want it to be a secret?

211
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:47,237
Yes. Think about it.

212
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:50,065
Bo Ram and Gi Hyun will tease us for sure.

213
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:53,401
Doha and Si Woo broke up not too long ago.

214
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,471
All right. But are you confident

215
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,664
that you can keep it a secret?

216
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,684
Hey, my nickname is Liar.

217
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,394
And you?

218
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:20,545
It'll be difficult for me.

219
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,363
What are you two doing there?

220
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,824
What? We're playing rock-paper-scissors.

221
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:34,535
Rock-paper-scissors!

222
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:36,761
I won.

223
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:45,287
Hey, Min. I haven't seen you in a while.

224
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:47,230
Are you studying well?

225
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,932
I have a callus on my finger.

226
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:51,509
What did you two

227
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,871
whisper about?

228
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,783
- It's a secret. 
 - Hey.

229
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,518
Why do you guys have a secret?

230
00:11:00,518 --> 00:11:01,437
Don't tell me...

231
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:03,080
He's going to lend me his PlayStation for four months.

232
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,814
- Wow, really? 
 - I am?

233
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:04,915
- Yes. 
 - What about me?

234
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,525
- Thank you! 
 - No, that's not it.

235
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:08,402
- Lend it to me too. 
 - You need to study.

236
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:10,437
Sir. I'll call you "sir" from now on.

237
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,005
- "Sir"? 
 - I can play it during my break.

238
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,482
- Ha Na. 
 - Yes?

239
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:15,092
- You need to study. 
 - Can I come with you

240
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,293
to the library today? 
 - Thank you.

241
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:19,054
Of course, you can.

242
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,248
- When will you head there? 
 - I'm going right after school.

243
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,325
- Oh, and he's coming with me. 
 - Today?

244
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,185
You said you were going to study.

245
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,129
Will it be okay if we all study together?

246
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,530
Sure.

247
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,175
- No. 
 - I'm going to play all of them.

248
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:32,526
Do you want to come?

249
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,427
No, thanks.

250
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,875
- Hey, don't do that. 
 - Why not?

251
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,727
You can't.

252
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,525
Ha Na.

253
00:11:56,525 --> 00:12:00,578
I heard you did well on the mock test.

254
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,122
I did.

255
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,990
Lucky you.

256
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,686
It's only a mock test. It's not the CSAT.

257
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,247
But you have good grades as well.

258
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:13,491
You're smart too.

259
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:18,530
Still, I'm sure she has worries as well.

260
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,733
When you do well on a test,

261
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:25,978
don't you feel determined to do well on the next one?

262
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,764
I do.

263
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:32,675
That's why I plan to do well on the finals.

264
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:35,796
Let's study hard and get good grades.

265
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:40,119
I'm going to buy some coffee. Do you want some?

266
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,686
Sure.

267
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:44,581
I'd like the same one as you.

268
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,149
Okay.

269
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,002
I need to stop by the restroom.

270
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,146
I won't be long.

271
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:05,000

272
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:14,627
Why aren't you going inside?

273
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,888
Oh, I'm about to.

274
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:20,470
Come on. 
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

275
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,840
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

276
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,650
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

277
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,305
- Hey. 
 - What is it?

278
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,639
Yes?

279
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,110
This is seriously not my story.

280
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,629
A likes B.

281
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:34,631
But B likes C.

282
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:36,366
- But... 
 - Isn't this about you?

283
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,993
- No, it's not. 
 - Continue.

284
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:41,787
You know what "tall and handsome, young and rich" is, right?

285
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,616
"Toy Story sandwich"?

286
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,410
Do you know what it is?

287
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,819
Roughly, yes.

288
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:50,355
Anyway, B, whom A likes,

289
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:52,082
is exactly that.

290
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,902
He's tall, handsome, young, and even wealthy?

291
00:13:55,902 --> 00:14:00,473
What? No, Min isn't wealthy. He's rich.

292
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,542
What?

293
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,169
Do you like Ha Min?

294
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:07,706
No. Who said I liked him?

295
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,016
It seems like it.

296
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:12,276
Can you like several guys simultaneously?

297
00:14:12,276 --> 00:14:13,562
That's not true.

298
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,098
I liked Ryu Joo Ha because he was good-looking.

299
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:17,174
As for Min...

300
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:19,835
- No, this isn't about me, okay? 
 - Hey.

301
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:21,336
You do like him.

302
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:22,571
- Stop pretending you don't. 
 - Be quiet.

303
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,114
What do you like about him?

304
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,624
He's nice... No.

305
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:26,683
I mean...

306
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:30,853
My friend, A, told me that he's nice.

307
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:33,248
Why do you like a liar who didn't even tell you

308
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,541
what those English words meant?

309
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,193
What?
