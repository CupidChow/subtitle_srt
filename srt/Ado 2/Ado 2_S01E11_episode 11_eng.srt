1
00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:02,752
- What are you doing tomorrow? 
 - I'm going to the library.

2
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:04,395
Why?

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,056

4
00:00:07,056 --> 00:00:09,617

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,888

6
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,891
- That looks fun, right? 
 - Yes.

7
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,101
Where do you want to go first?

8
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:21,422
But are we even allowed to be here?

9
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,031
Yes.

10
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,260
By the way, you look pretty today.

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,928
What?

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,789
You look pretty too.

13
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:32,724
- I look pretty too? 
 - Yes.

14
00:00:32,724 --> 00:00:33,933
Don't you like being pretty?

15
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,961
I like it.

16
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:38,680
Would you like to take part in our free photo event?

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,575
We're taking pictures for couples. Come and take one.

18
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:46,045
- We're not a couple... 
 - Okay, we'll take it.

19
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:50,800
Can you move a little closer to each other?

20
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:54,988
 One, two, three.

21
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,299
 You need to look more affectionate.

22
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:02,987
 Okay, good. One, two, three.

23
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:05,748
Here you go.

24
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:07,359
- What class are you? 
 - Well...

25
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,152
The class of 19.

26
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,629
You must be freshmen.

27
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:12,872
You make a great couple.

28
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,283
- Thank you. 
  - It's time for the next song.

29
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,143
 Please gather in front of the stage.

30
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,520
Hey, why did you lie?

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,972
Lying is necessary at places like this.

32
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:23,499
We have to pretend we're freshmen today, got it?

33
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,893
We can't.

34
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:27,362
Why not? You said you were a liar before.

35
00:01:27,362 --> 00:01:30,014
Stop making fun of me.

36
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,080
Really? - I think there will be a concert.

37
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,400
♫  lt's really stupid how l keep looking at your face,  ♫

38
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:36,770
Let's go and watch.

♫  l wonder if we'll be happy when we see each other's faces  ♫

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,260

43
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,920

51
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,640
Yes.

52
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,120

58
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:00,863
It is. 
 ♫  but l am really curious about you  ♫

59
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:01,890
Do you want me to take your picture?

60
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,300
Yes, sure. 
♫  My heart is strange,  ♫

61
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,620
♫  but l am curious about us  ♫

62
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,420
I'll take it now.

63
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,387
You look pretty. I'll send it to you later.

64
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:17,305
Okay.

65
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:19,799
It will be so exciting to be a university student.

66
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,601
I can't wait to be one.

67
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,629
What do you think will be the best thing about university?

68
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:28,791
I'm not sure, but... 
 ♫  l wonder what you feel,  ♫

69
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,978
The feeling of freedom that I'm not a senior anymore?

70
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,114
♫  l draw pictures every day  ♫
 Oh, right. I want to ask you something.

71
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,483
What is it?

72
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:41,288
You said you wanted to major in industrial design, right?

73
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,222
Yes.

74
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,757
Why do you want to go to art school?

75
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:49,745
 I always wondered about people who found what they wanted to do.

76
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:54,281
It's just... fun to draw.

77
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:55,551
I see.

78
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,838
Why?

79
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:59,748
It seems like everyone is doing something fun.

80
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:02,559
Or something that they like.

81
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,893
I don't know what is fun yet.

82
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:08,560
I don't have anything that I like either.

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,917
Aren't you having fun now?

84
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,286
Yes, I am.

85
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,090
Don't you like it now too?

86
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,450
♫  l' ll draw a picture,  ♫

87
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,540
♫  give me a big smile  ♫

88
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,100
Hello.

89
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,144
We're from SYBC, Seoyeon University's broadcasting club.

90
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,144
Do you have time for an interview?

91
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,720
- Me? 
 - Yes.

92
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:41,320

93
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,142
 One, two, three. Cue.

94
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:46,787
Hello, I am Park Jin Ho from SYBC.

95
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,106
I'll interview people who have visited our club festival.

96
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:53,434
First, can you please introduce yourselves?

97
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:56,988
Hello, my name is Kim Ha Na.

98
00:04:56,988 --> 00:04:58,632
- What about your boyfriend? 
 - He's not...

99
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,525
My name is Ryu Joo Ha.

100
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:02,402
It's nice to meet you.

101
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,129
Are you two freshmen?

102
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:05,222
Yes.

103
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,748
What's your major?

104
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:08,600
I major in fine arts.

105
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,635
What about you?

106
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:12,679
Journalism and broadcasting.

107
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,957
- Journalism and broadcasting? 
 - Yes.

108
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:20,286
I see. Which clubs did you visit at today's festival?

109
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:24,055
We visited the photography club and the magic club.

110
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:27,109
We also saw a busking performance earlier.

111
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:30,471
Is there a club you want to join?

112
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,424
No, not yet.

113
00:05:32,424 --> 00:05:37,503
What was the most memorable thing at today's festival?

114
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:42,909
This moment. This interview.

115
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:47,572
Thank you for today's interview.

116
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:49,607
This was Park Jin Ho.

117
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:51,034
Thank you.

118
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:52,711
Thank you.

119
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:53,896
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

120
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,922
- Thank you. 
 - Goodbye.

121
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:58,675
I need to use the bathroom.

122
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:01,986
- I'll wait here. 
 - Okay.

123
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:08,769
No, delete this.

124
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,703
- I deleted it. 
 - Did you?

125
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,705
Excuse me.

126
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,699
Can I ask you something?

127
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,578
Of course. How can we help you?

128
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,824
What do you usually do in a broadcasting club?

129
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,514
On days like this, when there is a big event,

130
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,091
we make videos and promote our school.

131
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:34,918
We also visit various places that can be helpful to our students.

132
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,240
We also interview students and hear their opinions.

133
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,541
You're really awesome.

134
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,620
Thank you.

135
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,972
We're recruiting new members, so if you're interested, you should stop by.

136
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:48,892
Okay. Next year. I promise I'll come and see you next year.

137
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:52,286
I see. I really hope you make it to our school next year.

138
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,939
Okay.

139
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:59,033
I major in journalism and broadcasting, but I've never seen her before.

140
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,948
Thank you.

141
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,953

142
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:11,381
I don't think I'm a liar anymore.

143
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:12,249
Why not?

144
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,901
Someone found out that I'm not a freshman.

145
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,744
Who found out?

146
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:20,089
That cool girl we met today.

147
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:25,536
 I wondered about people who found what they wanted to do.

148
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:31,109
 Why, and how, they came to find what they wanted.

149
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:35,280
I want to be a reporter.

150
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,083
Like that girl who interviewed us.

151
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:39,417
Why so suddenly?

152
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,685
 I realized it once I found something I wanted to do.

153
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,441
Because I like it.

154
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:49,051
 That you start doing something...

155
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,521
 because you just like it.

156
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:53,548
Is that it?

157
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:55,283
Yes.

158
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:58,087
Do you want to see the picture I took of you earlier?

159
00:07:58,087 --> 00:08:00,430
Yes, show me.

160
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,802
This picture looks amazing. How did you take it like this?

161
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:07,053
It's a piece of cake.

162
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:07,971
 Because I liked it.

163
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:10,515
I'm going to show it to my friends.

164
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:15,601
 It just happens... when you like it.

165
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:16,955
I'll send it to you too.

166
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,448
Okay.

167
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:29,175
Aren't you hungry?

168
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:47,217
Hey. Can you please clean?

169
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:48,637
I'll do it next week.

170
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:52,590
I cleaned last week and I'm doing it again this week.

171
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:57,227
Then let's clean together. I'll hold this and you can sweep.

172
00:08:57,227 --> 00:08:59,322
I have to go take an order.

173
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:02,868
What order? We don't even have any customers. Sweep here.

174
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:04,886
Here too.

175
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,874
What? What is it?

176
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:10,458
I think I'll have that one.

177
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,344
- Who is it? 
 - I'll explain later.

178
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,795
Move.

179
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:16,330
 May I take your order?

180
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,878
 Hello.

181
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:23,981
- I'll have two shrimp burgers 
 - Who is it?

182
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,591
- Be quiet. 
 - and two bulgogi burger meals.

183
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:29,352
Hey. Why are you ordering so much?

184
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:31,279
Can you eat all of that?

185
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,414
- It won't be enough. 
 - What?

186
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:35,751
That jerk Gi Hyun never answers his phone at times like this.

187
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,703
I don't know that guy's number.

188
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,663
Why? What's going on?

189
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,890
Be quiet. I need to take a picture.

190
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,383
Thank you.

191
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,381
That was close.

192
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:54,544
Thank you.

193
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:56,613
Where should we sit?

194
00:09:56,613 --> 00:09:58,298
Do you want to eat at my place?

195
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,433
What?

196
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,218
Let's go.

197
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:04,545
Oh, okay.

198
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,179
Did you hear that?

199
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,639
They're going to eat at his place.

200
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,824
Who is she?

201
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,871
Hey, you're home.

202
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,449
Hey, Kimha is here too.

203
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:27,985
Guys, when did you come?

204
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:29,396
I'm certain I smell hamburgers.

205
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,448
That's why he bought so much.

206
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:33,841
I brought burgers.

207
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:37,204
Did you come to play PlayStation too?

208
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:40,932
What? No, I came to eat my burger.

209
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,226
You have a nice house.

210
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,169
- It is, right? 
 - Is this your first time here?

211
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:45,970
Yes.

212
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,988
Joo Ha, can I have some water?

213
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:50,983
Water? It's over there.

214
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:54,120
Hey, me too.

215
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:59,509
Hey. Why is there nothing but water in your fridge?

216
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:01,803
At least I have water.

217
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:05,030
- Don't run away! 
 - You have to shake it with me.

218
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:13,089

219
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:17,177
 Forget it. Don't tell me his number, you idiot.

220
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,537
 I'll send him a Facebook message.

221
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:20,547
This is boring.

222
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:26,903
Has Min been...

223
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:29,172
flirting with someone lately?

224
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:30,924
I don't know. Why?

225
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,901
It's nothing.

226
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,823
- What are you doing? Catch that. 
 - Here's your water.

227
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,591
Thanks.

228
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,206
Are you having fun?

229
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,590
It's so fun. Don't talk to me.

230
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,361
Hey, did you see that?

231
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,490
What are you doing? Come here and eat.

232
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,534
What? Okay.

233
00:11:57,534 --> 00:12:01,562
It's shocking that you only have water in your fridge.

234
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:06,434
- Give me some coke. 
 - Coke?

235
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,829
- Give it to me. 
 - We only bought two cokes.

236
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,664
I'm sorry. Let's share.

237
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,024
Sharing is caring!

238
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:15,226
I didn't know you guys were here.

239
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:16,361
Here's your straw.

240
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,679
- French fries. 
 - Okay.

241
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,739
- Take your coke. 
 - Hurry.

242
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,432
- Here. 
- We didn't buy yours.

243
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:24,077
- French fries. 
 - Goodness.

244
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,837
Do you want to die? Give it here.

245
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:27,630
- I saw everything. Give it here. 
 - This is ours.

246
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,358
Gosh. Hey, take this.

247
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,394
Doha hasn't been...

248
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:36,480
posting her drawings lately.

249
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,541
She must be really busy.

250
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:49,978

251
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,812

252
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,244
 I thought...

253
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:01,931
 anything would be possible if I liked doing it.

254
00:13:17,147 --> 00:13:18,740

255
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,034
 Wait a second. Where are you?

256
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,754
 Don't tell me you're on a date. Who are you with?

257
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:25,613
 She's with me.

258
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,351

259
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:40,111

260
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,433
Hello?

261
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:47,611
 Doha. Are you busy?

262
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:49,379
 What are you up to?

263
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:50,730
Nothing much.

264
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,242
 Goodness. Doha, you sound just like Si Woo.

265
00:13:54,242 --> 00:13:56,452
 That's what he always says.

266
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:58,788
I just saw your picture.

267
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:00,390
You look pretty.

268
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,992
 Right? Doesn't it look nice?

269
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,784
 However, I will not change my profile picture.

270
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:08,848
 I like your drawing the most.

271
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,101
I didn't finish drawing that.

272
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,453
I posted the completed drawing on my Instagram.

273
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,488
Use that.

274
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,081
 Really?

275
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:22,143
 No. It's okay because I like everything that you draw.

276
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:24,022
 I won't change it.

277
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:26,791
 Is anything possible...

278
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,468
 if I like it?

279
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,712
It's incomplete.

280
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,465
- Do you still like it? 
   - Yes.

281
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:35,976
 And you wrote a comment last time

282
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,386
 that it was the finished drawing.

283
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,980
Right.

284
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,868
 Doha. I'm home now. I might wake up my grandma.

285
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:47,603
 Sorry, I have to go.

286
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:49,747
Okay, bye.

287
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:59,257
 If you like something,

288
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:03,719
 will everything be all right?

289
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,672

290
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:08,230

291
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,790
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

292
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,360
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

293
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,425
 Here.

294
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,617
 It's from an event that we did.

295
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,067
 Thank you. I actually used up my tint.

296
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:22,060
 I'll use it well.

297
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:30,357
 Pretty.

298
00:15:31,693 --> 00:15:34,505
 Your lip color... is pretty.

299
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:37,374
 It's pretty, right?

300
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:39,016
 Yes.

301
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:41,994
 This color is pretty.
