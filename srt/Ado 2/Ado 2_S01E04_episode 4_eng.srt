1
00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:03,486
There's a bad rumor going around after you went looking for her.

2
00:00:03,486 --> 00:00:05,780
Do you like Do Ha Na?

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,775

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,619

5
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:12,804
Which class is Do Ha Na in?

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:13,439

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,356
What?

8
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:17,000
Do Ha Na.

9
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,744
You don't know her?

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,214
How do you know Doha?

11
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:24,758
Oh, she's a friend from the academy.

12
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,609
Academy?

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,429
Oh, the art academy?

14
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,021
Doha is in Class 2.

15
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:31,640
Why are you telling him that?

16
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,933
Because he asked.

17
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:36,018
Shouldn't you help him out as the class vice president?

18
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:51,101
Do Ha Na.

19
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:53,562
Hey. What are you doing here?

20
00:00:53,562 --> 00:00:55,204
I told you at the academy yesterday.

21
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:56,748
That I'll see you tomorrow.

22
00:00:56,748 --> 00:01:00,268
I thought you meant you'd see me at the academy.

23
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,037
I meant school.

24
00:01:02,037 --> 00:01:03,830
So why are you here?

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,457
I'm a student here now.

26
00:01:05,457 --> 00:01:07,675
Did you transfer here?

27
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:10,487
Move.

28
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,106
That's my seat.

29
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,574
Oh.

30
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,659
Okay.

31
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:18,278
Right.

32
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,022
Are you going right away after school today?

33
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:22,048
To the academy? Yes.

34
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,984
But I'm not going to go with you.

35
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,536
- Why not? 
 - Because she's going with me.

36
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,873
Okay.

37
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:31,741
Hey, Joo Ha.

38
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:34,360
We have to go to another class. Let's go together.

39
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,955
Hi, Doha. Si Woo too.

40
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,882
Hey, did you guys hand in your homework?

41
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:49,075
Oh, hang on.

42
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,986
Here.

43
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:55,515
By the way, he's the new transfer student, right?

44
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,558
From your academy?

45
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,434
Yes. From my art academy.

46
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:02,513
That's so unusual. To transfer schools when he's a senior.

47
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:04,933
- He's so good-looking, right? 
 - I know.

48
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:07,940
 I thought he was an idol star when he walked in here.

49
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,260
The flow of Eastern ethical ideologies.

50
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,730
Confucianism was founded in the Warring States period in ancient China.

51
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,560
 Underline the Warring States period.

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,880
 What is the Warring States period?

53
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,280
 It is moment for drastic change in China.

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,660
  - From the VII century B.C. to the V century B.C. 
 - Here.

55
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,660
 Confucius who inherited humanism. Confucius Circle.

56
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,600
 He suggested benevolence in an attempt to recover morale and build a stable society.

57
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,220
 Underlined here. Benevolence.

58
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,720
 For pursuing

59
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,350
 ideology and

60
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,320
 humanism

61
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,790
Hold on. Let me write this down.

62
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,590
 and here is a business human being,

63
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,910
What is its importance?

64
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,220
What is it?

65
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,050
Well....

66
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,820
Here. Write this.

67
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,730
 A way to overcome the chaos during the Warring States period.

68
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,090

69
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,560
- What are you doing? 
 - This...

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,640
looks like you.

71
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,295
The mock exam is next week. Let's stay focused, okay?

72
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,396
Okay.

73
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:37,867
Bo Ram, what did the teacher...

74
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,294
What?

75
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:40,770
Why?

76
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,280
It's nothing. Keep studying.

77
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,230

78
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,362
- Hello. 
 - Hey, Ha Na!

79
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,264
- Do you have an exam today? 
 - Yes.

80
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:02,834
You really do eat almonds during the exam period.

81
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,836
Hello, Min.

82
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:06,588
What's with this coffee all of a sudden?

83
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:08,857
- What about milk? 
 - Why? Can't I drink coffee?

84
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:10,367
No, you can't.

85
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:14,321
People shouldn't suddenly do things they don't usually do.

86
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:17,290
I copied Ha Na today because it's the day of the mock exam.

87
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,327
I'm curious to see if coffee will help me get a better score.

88
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,061
It's my first exam as a natural sciences major.

89
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,956
You know this is my jinx.

90
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:27,158
You do well wherever you go, so don't worry.

91
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:28,769
 I heard he changed his major to natural sciences.

92
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,170
 Is he crazy? He's a senior.

93
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,523
 Whatever. I guess it doesn't matter since he's so smart.

94
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,834
 It'll be fun to watch his grades drop though, right?

95
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:39,362
You'll do well too.

96
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,341
You have five minutes left.

97
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,360
Fill in your OMR cards.

98
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,910
 I made a mistake.

99
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,335
 It was an unexpected mistake.

100
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,750
 Well,

101
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,944
 if I'd seen it coming, I wouldn't have made a mistake.

102
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:45,590

103
00:05:57,132 --> 00:05:59,200
 Anyway,

104
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,040
 I made a mistake today.

105
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,867

106
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,180
I'm so full. My buttons are about to pop.

107
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,848
Again?

108
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,067
Do you want to get beaten up?

109
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,969
No.

110
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,913
Sorry!

111
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,249
By the way, about that transfer student.

112
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,334
Is it true that he likes Do Ha Na?

113
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:26,929
No way. Doha has Si Woo.

114
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,039
That's right. Don't be ridiculous.

115
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,774
I don't think he's a bad guy.

116
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:32,300
Who knows?

117
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,644
You never know

118
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,879
what will happen between people until it actually goes down.

119
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,649
You've become an oldie, hanging out with Ji Woo lately.

120
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,160
I didn't like that dude from the beginning.

121
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,554
- He's annoying. 
 - He's good-looking.

122
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:47,291
Aren't you saying that because he seems close to Bo Ram?

123
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,259
No, I'm not.

124
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,979
Gosh, what a loser.

125
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,897
Kimha, did you do well on your exam today?

126
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:56,374
You look really happy.

127
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,384
I think I did okay.

128
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,237
You're coming to the group study session, right?

129
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:02,530
Yes, I should go.

130
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,058
About that group study. Can only the top 15 join?

131
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,826
No, I think it's the top 10.

132
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,904
Hey. Then will my two friends...

133
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:11,765
be the top students in each department?

134
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,193
Right. First in liberal arts and the natural sciences.

135
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:16,336
I doubt I'll be first place.

136
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,838
Then you'll come in second or third.

137
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,674
For smart kids, no matter how much their grades drop,

138
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,426
it's not much of a difference.

139
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:25,304
What I really don't understand is that regardless of the rank,

140
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:28,056
their scores are similar anyway. But they compete so fiercely.

141
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,391
Because they have to come in first place.

142
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:30,976
Hey!

143
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:34,604
- Can't you keep your mouth shut? 
 - What?

144
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,147
Why?

145
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:37,691
What?

146
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:41,119
Ask him.

147
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,154
Hey.

148
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:45,741
You really want to learn how to play this game?

149
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:47,367
Yes.

150
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,545
What if...

151
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:52,873
he reaches the highest rank as soon as he learns?

152
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,742
Hey. I'm a Silver rank player.

153
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,844
Do you really think that's possible?

154
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,879
What do I have to do first?

155
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,655
Oh, well...

156
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:02,049
I'll invite you in.

157
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,926
You need to click the "Accept" button.

158
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:05,819
- This? 
 - Yes, the button there.

159
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,981
 Welcome to the Summoner's Rift.

160
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:13,242

161
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,413

162
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,900

163
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,985
 This way.

164
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:24,312
 Which character are you?

165
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:26,365
Hey. Get me a leash here.

166
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:28,316
A leash?

167
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:31,011
Hey. Over here. Come here.

168
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,496
Come here and kill the monsters with me.

169
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,023
Okay.

170
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,385
 Hey, you can't go like that.

171
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:44,599
 We're doomed.

172
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,637
 Hey! Where are you going? Come here.

173
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:50,055
 Hey, fight!

174
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:51,765
  - Don't fight. 
 - No, come back.

175
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,076
  - Stop overreacting! 
 - Don't fight and come back.

176
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,018
What happened?

177
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:56,611
Gosh, come on.

178
00:08:56,611 --> 00:09:00,231
The screen turned gray. I think I'm dead.

179
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,126
Can you come back me up here?

180
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,487
I can't do this by myself.

181
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:07,439
I'm still on the third level.

182
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:08,698
Because of him.

183
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:11,917
Did I do something wrong?

184
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,262
 Hey, wait!

185
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,912
 Finish with your last blow.

186
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:15,998
 What do you mean?

187
00:09:15,998 --> 00:09:18,474
Hit the minions with your last blow.

188
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,253
- What are minions? 
 - Those little moving things.

189
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:22,596
Oh, right.

190
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,156
Okay.

191
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:25,715
What's a last blow then?

192
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:26,967
You don't even know that?

193
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,052
Gosh, how would he know what that is?

194
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:31,914
I thought he was smart.

195
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:33,298
 Where should I go?

196
00:09:33,298 --> 00:09:34,767
  - Just... 
 - Just fight.

197
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,435
  - No. 
 - Stop fighting.

198
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,812
  - I'll just fight. 
 - Where are you going?

199
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,021
 Hey, watch out.

200
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:42,273
 We died again.

201
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:45,777
 Hey, a weird guy in armor is chasing me.

202
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:47,037
 Run away.

203
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:48,897
 Hey, a fish is chasing me this time.

204
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:49,582
You have to run away.

205
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:51,867
- Run away. 
 - Again? Isn't he on our side?

206
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:54,177
Hey, Joo Ha!

207
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,612
I just said hi.

208
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:58,606
- Hi. 
 - Why are you here?

209
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:02,276
Joo Ha, come here. There's an empty seat.

210
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,339
Oh, you don't know Min, right?

211
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,249
This is Ha Min from Class 5.

212
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:10,218
He's a transfer student in our class, Ryu Joo Ha.

213
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:12,304
- Say hi. 
 - Okay.

214
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,755
Hi!

215
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:15,448
Hey.

216
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,159
Do you live nearby?

217
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,602
Do you come here often? Are you good at games?

218
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:19,912
Aren't you going to play?

219
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,280
I am playing.

220
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,991
I heard you went looking for Do Ha Na.

221
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:34,392
Yes.

222
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:35,977
Why did you?

223
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:36,979
What?

224
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:39,773
 When something unexpected happens,

225
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,233
 anyone can make a mistake.

226
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:45,695
There's a bad rumor going around after you went looking for her.

227
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:47,322
What rumor?

228
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:50,583
A rumor that you like Do Ha Na.

229
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,328
Oh. That rumor?

230
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:55,680
Do you like Do Ha Na?

231
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,806
No.

232
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:59,508
Then why are you worried about her?

233
00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:01,136
Because she's my friend.

234
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:04,121
Her boyfriend is my friend too.

235
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,107
I see.

236
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:13,044

237
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,801
Don't worry.

238
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:21,414
Girls like Do Ha Na aren't my type.

239
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:26,753
Then stop acting like that.

240
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,223
There's someone else I like.

241
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,858
Ha Na.

242
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:35,912
 I wasn't expecting that.

243
00:11:37,848 --> 00:11:41,109
Kim Ha Na. Our class president.

244
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:45,020
 Which means...

245
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,230
 I made a mistake.

246
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,770
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

247
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,200
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

248
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,030
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

249
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,060
♫  At the end of one and only nineteen  ♫

250
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:10,960

251
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:22,400
