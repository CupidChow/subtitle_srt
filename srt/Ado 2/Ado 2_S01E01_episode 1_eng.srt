1
00:00:00,301 --> 00:00:04,910
When will you tell me... who the person you like is?

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,824
I can't, because I don't have one anymore.

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,544

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,929

5
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:17,291

6
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:20,020
Ha Na!

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:28,020

8
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:33,392
Kimha, Doha! It means, "Hi, Kim Ha Na and Do Ha Na".

9
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:34,335
 Why did you come so early today?

10
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,979
 It's our first day as seniors. If we don't come early today,

11
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:40,497
  - it's just not right. 
 - I know.

12
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:42,901
  I can't believe we're not in the same class. It makes me sad.

13
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:43,961
 My class is right next to yours.

14
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,671
 Doha, you should come often during recess.

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,010
  - Okay. 
 - Yes, you'd better promise us.

16
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,992
- What? 
 - Is our class...

17
00:00:59,992 --> 00:01:02,078
a class for honor students?

18
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:05,198
No way. You and I are in this class.

19
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,693
But what's with this atmosphere?

20
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:20,029
All right. Nobody came late today, right?

21
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:21,640
 No.

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,458
You're not juniors anymore. You're seniors.

23
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,735
You can't be tardy now.

24
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:28,395
In the blink of an eye, the CSAT will be just around the corner.

25
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:30,507
You'd all better stay alert and study hard.

26
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,992
- Okay. 
 - Please write down

27
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,620
the universities and majors of your choice.

28
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,680
I'll check and give you advice during counseling.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,515
Pass the paper behind.

30
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:53,546
 Nineteen.

31
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:57,000
 The age when we're about to take the biggest exam of our lives.

32
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,706
Yeo Bo Ram.

33
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:08,295

34
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:11,030

35
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:18,554

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,334

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,914
What?

38
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,441

39
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:38,241

40
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,085
 And...

41
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:45,596
 It's the age when we have to make the best choices.

42
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:48,485
What are you writing?

43
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:52,447
What? Oh, I haven't decided yet.

44
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:55,383
You've written down Seoyeon University at least.

45
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:58,862
I don't know which major I should apply for.

46
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:01,506
Still, you can choose any major you want.

47
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:03,316
I envy you.

48
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,104
Please submit your answers before you go home today.

49
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,122
You know tomorrow is the class president election, right?

50
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,357
 Yes.

51
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,259
Excuse me, sir.

52
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,869
Yes?

53
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:17,897
Can I submit this tomorrow?

54
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:22,502

55
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:27,246
If you consider repeating an year, you can aim for universities in Seoul.

56
00:03:27,246 --> 00:03:28,358
Repeat an year?

57
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,027
Your scores aren't high enough for admission to any school.

58
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:33,438
You know that too. That's why you came to me for advice.

59
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,049
I'm not forcing you to study for another year.

60
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,642
But in order to go to a university in Seoul, I'm just saying it's an option.

61
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:40,637
Considering the situation you're currently in,

62
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,138
wouldn't it be better to prepare another year and go to a university that you want to go to?

63
00:03:44,138 --> 00:03:47,577
I'll apply for the art contest at Seoyeon University for now.

64
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:49,646
Okay. Good luck with that.

65
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,456
I know things are hectic because you're a senior

66
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:55,642
but since you started later than others, you have to try harder.

67
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:57,320
Okay.

68
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,599
Hey. Did you wait for me?

69
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,810
Yes. How did your counseling go?

70
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,012
Well, it went all right.

71
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:15,463
Oh, right.

72
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,724
If you start camp training tomorrow, when will you come out?

73
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:20,627
Besides every Friday.

74
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,170
- My day off? 
 - Yes.

75
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,131
Hold on. Let me check my calendar.

76
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,076
When are you going to change this?

77
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:29,328

78
00:04:29,328 --> 00:04:30,870

79
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,047
I'm not going to.

80
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,067
Right.

81
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,811
Let's go to an exhibition on the day I come out.

82
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,246
Okay, so when are you coming out?

83
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,107
March 16th.

84
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:44,926
Okay.

85
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,559
You said you'll eat lunch separately, right?

86
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,804
Yes. I eat with the sports team.

87
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,217
What is it?

88
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,894
A roe deer?

89
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:05,455
What is it? My gosh.

90
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:07,557
Look!

91
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,751
Seriously.

92
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:14,922
Sorry. We'll keep it down.

93
00:05:14,922 --> 00:05:17,983
- They're S.S. 
 - What?

94
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:20,845
- I mean, "so sensitive". 
 - Oh.

95
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:23,306
You should watch your pronunciation...

96
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:32,064
We might become mutes at this rate.

97
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:36,370
She was the class president of Class 1 last year.

98
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,355
She's usually very nice

99
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,465
but apparently, she gets really cranky during the exam period.

100
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:44,887
Then we can be friends with her when we don't have exams.

101
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,621
No.

102
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:50,758
For seniors, the whole year is considered an exam period.

103
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:53,911
Is she running for class president again?

104
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:55,389
Probably.

105
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,691
By the way, depending on who the class president is,

106
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,618
it's natural that the atmosphere of the class changes.

107
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,034
What? Class president?

108
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:25,369
Yes.

109
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:28,255
How can I be the class president? I can't do that.

110
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,140
Why not? Be our class president.

111
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,867
Why? Why should I do it?

112
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,728
Because it's good to be a class president.

113
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,914
It's a good experience and will help when you go to university.

114
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:41,359
If it's that good, you guys can do it instead of asking her.

115
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:44,646
Come on, that's ridiculous.

116
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:46,907
Our grades are already hopeless for any university.

117
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,534
We should give students like her a chance.

118
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,261
But...

119
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,882
I've never been a class president before.

120
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,801
Do you want to do it then?

121
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,286
What?

122
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:05,174
Didn't you say no because you didn't want to do it?

123
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,578
It's not that I don't want to.

124
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:10,947
But I'm afraid I might not be good at it.

125
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:15,334
Still, if you want to do it, don't you think it's possible?

126
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:28,030

127
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,663
What are you doing here alone?

128
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,081
What?

129
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,191
I was just taking a break.

130
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,442
What about you?

131
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,846
I went to Class 3 to see you but you weren't there.

132
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:44,823
You're doing that again.

133
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:46,358
Doing what again?

134
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:48,377
You don't have any friends in Class 5, right?

135
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:50,979
Are you afraid I'll be a loner in my class or something?

136
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:55,366
That's possible. You have a way of annoying people.

137
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:58,570
Don't worry. I'm only like that to you.

138
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,023
Gosh. You do so many things only to me.

139
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,842
Why do you always act like that just to me?

140
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:14,377
When will you tell me...

141
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,547
who the person you like is?

142
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,092
I can't...

143
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:23,970
because I don't have one anymore.

144
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,465
Why don't you like that person anymore?

145
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,909
Because we're seniors now.

146
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,720
That doesn't make sense.

147
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,455
Do you think controlling your emotions is that simple?

148
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:35,866
I have to control them.

149
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:38,635
Besides, we have less than a year left until the CSAT.

150
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:47,301
I guess you don't want to tell me then.

151
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:50,688
I can't tell you, because I don't have anyone anymore.

152
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:55,393
You used to like someone, but you don't anymore.

153
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,414
That's why you can't tell me?

154
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,407
Right.

155
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,126
Then...

156
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,506
tell me who you used to like.

157
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,284
Let's go back inside.

158
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,002

159
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:32,780

160
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,458

161
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,690

162
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:24,890
♫  With my few words, will I be able to comfort you?  ♫

163
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,490
♫  How upset are you?  ♫

164
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,420
Why did I say I couldn't do it?a

165
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,280
♫  Is there anything I can do?  ♫

166
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,077
 Because I didn't have any options,

167
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:38,763
 I thought I couldn't...

168
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,960
 make a choice.

169
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,940
♫  So your day can get better  ♫

170
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,256
You know today's the day we pick the class president, right?

171
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:48,841
Yes.

172
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,801
Okay. This person must be

173
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:52,903
someone who can lead you through your tough year as seniors,

174
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,738
so choose carefully.

175
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,907
- Okay? 
 - Okay.

176
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,409
Then let's see who the candidates are.

177
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,178
I knew you'd run again.

178
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:01,995

179
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,122
Min Ji, you'll be chosen again this year.

180
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,232
- Thanks. 
 - You can do it.

181
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,451
Gosh, I wasn't expecting this candidate.

182
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:10,128

183
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,630
- It's Ha Na. 
 - Ha Na?

184
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,711
Are you running for class president?

185
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,571
- You said you wouldn't. 
 - What?

186
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:21,206
Oh, well...

187
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:24,134
Hey, if you don't want to run for class president,

188
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:27,579
shouldn't you tell the teacher right now?

189
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:33,025
- Sir, Kimha won't run for... 
 - Wait.

190
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,206
I'll run for class president.

191
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,692
I want to do it.

192
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:43,111
 If there are no options,

193
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:46,214
 I can just make my own options.

194
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,254
 That is what I want to do...

195
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:56,675
 at the age of 19.

196
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,887
Oh, my. Will our class be okay with him as class president?

197
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:00,929

198
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,090
Gi Hyun, have you finally grown up?

199
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,400
Gi Hyun, are you running too?

200
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,378
Oh, yes.

201
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:09,938
You said you wouldn't run!

202
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,215
You guys told me to.

203
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:12,841
You said you wouldn't,

204
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:16,094
so we decided to make Gi Hyun a candidate.

205
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,749
If I run for class president, it would be...

206
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:23,760
truly nice.

207
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,554
- Good luck. 
 - Okay.

208
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:27,488
We're competitors now.

209
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,497
Then who should I pick?

210
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:38,374
Me.

211
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,319
Me, me.

212
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:43,387
What should I do?

213
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:49,953
I mean, why did Gi Hyun run for class president?

214
00:12:49,953 --> 00:12:51,196
- Seriously? 
 - What? Why?

215
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:52,856
Can't people with bad grades run for class president?

216
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,967
This is hilarious. How could Gi Hyun be the vice-president?

217
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:58,011
I can't believe my boyfriend is the class vice-president.

218
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,556

219
00:13:00,556 --> 00:13:02,516
I think you'll fail as the class vice-president.

220
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:03,842
I agree.

221
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:06,118
I can do a good job.

222
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,320
Oh, right.

223
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,589
Where is Kimha?

224
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,399
What's this?

225
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:23,586
Why? What? What is it?

226
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,122
What is it?

227
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,722
What?

228
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:36,790
Is something wrong?

229
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,639
What is this?

230
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,621

231
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,248

232
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,417

233
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,811

234
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:57,921

235
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,898

236
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:03,176

237
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,746

238
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:07,915

239
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,808

240
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,059

241
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,895

242
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,213

243
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:17,000

244
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,789
I...

245
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,327
I became the class president.

246
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:59,930
 After spending an unordinary 18th year of my life...

247
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,006
 We...

248
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,309
 turned 19.

249
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,920
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

250
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,860
♫  Trust yourself  ♫

251
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,590

252
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,980
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

253
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,840
♫  At the end  ♫
