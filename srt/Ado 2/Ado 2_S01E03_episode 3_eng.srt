1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,678
- It's you, isn't it? 
 - What are you talking about?

2
00:00:01,678 --> 00:00:04,479
I know it's you! It's you!

3
00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:06,089

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,169

5
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:09,700
  - I'm hungry. 
 - Me too.

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,630

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,710
What about the others?

8
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,700
The menu is stir-fried pork. Gi Hyun said he'll come later

9
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,300
and ask for an extra serving.

10
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,279
Min will come too then.

11
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,160
I'm hungry.

12
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,239
Hey. Don't cut in line.

13
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,260
Hey, you!

14
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,589
- Me? 
 - Yes, you.

15
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:30,960
Why are you cutting in line?

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,259
Oh, my teacher told me to eat lunch early and hurry back.

17
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:36,060
What is she saying?

18
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,279
That doesn't mean you can cut in line.

19
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:41,310
Can you go back and stand in line?

20
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,030
Okay.

21
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:47,360
Stir-fried pork. 
  (T/N: Korean sweet and spicy pork with strips of marinated pork loin that is seared with fresh vegetables and mixed with a sweet and spicy sauce that includes plum jam and Korean gochujang paste)

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,780
Wait!

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,589
Are you Kim Jo Yeon?

24
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,049
What?

25
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,120
Hey. Watch your mouth.

26
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,940
Why?

27
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:07,470
I used to be Kim Jo Yeon, but now I'm Kim Ha Na.

28
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,840
Can you call me by my real name?

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,970
It's confusing.

30
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:16,320
What the heck! That's so lame.

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,329
Hey, you!

32
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,708
What did you just say?

33
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:22,709
I didn't say anything.

34
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,270
- You little... 
 - Just go and eat your lunch.

35
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,420
You look so stupid and all you care about is food.

36
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,299
What did you say?

37
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,010
Hey!

38
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,540
Apologize.

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,670
Apologize to my friend.

40
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,239
You cut in line first and mumbled under your breath.

41
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,640
Am I wrong?

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,629
You're the one who caused a problem first.

43
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:48,160
What's your problem?

44
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,709
Okay.

45
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,940
Does she think she's some star? How annoying.

46
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,340
  - Does she think she's some star?  
 - Hey, stop.

47
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,360
Hey, kid.

48
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,409
It's you, isn't it?

49
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,900
- What are you talking about? 
 - I know it's you!

50
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,050
It's you!

51
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,779
  - Let go! 
 - Hey!

52
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:18,719
  - Boram! 
 - Let go of me!

53
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,710
  - Let go! 
 - You let go first!

54
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,090
  - You let go! 
 - Hey!

55
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,409
  - You let go! 
 - You crazy brat!

56
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,750
 I said, let go! Hey!

57
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,629
 I said, let go!

58
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:31,279
 Let go of each other, please!

59
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,960
  - Let go of each other! 
 - Let go of me.

60
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,590
  - You crazy brat! 
 - Let go on the count of three.

61
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,169
 One, two, three!

62
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:37,550
  - Why aren't you letting go? 
 - You let go!

63
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,850
 You told me to let go!

64
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,800
  - Let go of me.  
 - What are you doing?

65
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:48,900
- Hey! 
 - Hey, let go!

66
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,900
It's her. I'm sure it's her.

67
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,190
It's her. She's the one who posted it.

68
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,300
Isn't she a freshman? I've never seen her before.

69
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,169
Seriously, that crazy wench.

70
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:04,219
She didn't have a name tag, so I don't even know her name.

71
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:07,929
Stop scowling. You'll get wrinkles on your cute face.

72
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:10,150
You're right!

73
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,429
Anyway, she'd better not get on my nerves again.

74
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:15,340
Although the English teacher caught me today

75
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,869
and I had to go to the teachers' room...

76
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:18,840
You'll end up going there again soon, won't you?

77
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,979
- What? 
 - What?

78
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:22,329
- It's nothing. 
 - If I see her again,

79
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,169
I'll make sure I find out the truth.

80
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:25,710
Don't do that. I'm fine.

81
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,740
And besides,

82
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:34,029
I'm not going to look for the person who posted that anyway.

83
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:34,890
Why not?

84
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,829
You have to find out who it is and teach her a lesson so that she'll never do it again.

85
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,000
But...

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,960
people who hate me will always hate me regardless.

87
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,810
As long as...

88
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,050
you guys are beside me, I'll be okay.

89
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,609
Like this, right now.

90
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,519
Okay.

91
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,440
 No matter what happens,

92
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,569
 we will each stay in our own places.

93
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,700
That's my choice. Can you respect that?

94
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,710
Sure, we will.

95
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,650
Still, I'm going to find out who it is.

96
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,610
If that's your choice, I'll respect that.

97
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,750
 Caring for each other

98
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,239
 in our own places.

99
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,200
Thank you!

100
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,459

101
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:34,459
You're a total superstar and celebrity on social media.

102
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,408
- Cut that out. 
 - Is that a new post?

103
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:37,859
I'll like your post too.

104
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:39,709
- I love Doha's drawings. 
 - Let me see.

105
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:40,909
It's so pretty.

106
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,750
I'm glad you like it.

107
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,509
I don't like my drawings these days.

108
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:47,039
Why not? Don't you love to draw?

109
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:49,420
And your social media totally went viral.

110
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,009
I do like drawing illustrations.

111
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,370
But drawing in order to go to university is...

112
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,689
Is it tough going to the art academy?

113
00:04:57,689 --> 00:04:59,439
I mean...

114
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,700
I chose this because it's what I wanted to do.

115
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,529
But I'm not sure if doing what I want

116
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:07,259
is the right thing to do.

117
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,459
You both have a lot of worries.

118
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,979
How come I don't?

119
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:17,509
You're so carefree for a senior.

120
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:20,109
I know. That's the problem.

121
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,300
The English teacher is keeping an eye on me now.

122
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,989
How can I find out her name?

123
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:30,970
Right, I need to catch that brat first.

124
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:33,429

125
00:05:33,429 --> 00:05:35,720

126
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,139
 Everyone has...

127
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,379
 a place that's fit for them.

128
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,970
I heard he changed his major to natural sciences.

129
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,470
Is he crazy? He's a senior.

130
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,289
 Whatever. I guess it doesn't matter since he's so smart.

131
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:53,320
 It'll be fun to watch his grades drop though, right?

132
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,729
 Everyone has...

133
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:58,479
 a place they desire.

134
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,709

135
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,559

136
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:05,279
Min, your mother called me.

137
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,038
- Why? 
 - What do you think?

138
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:09,820
She was worried about you.

139
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,129
It's rare for seniors to switch majors

140
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:14,759
from liberal arts to natural sciences.

141
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,320
She's probably not worried.

142
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,970
Pardon? What was that?

143
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,539
It's nothing.

144
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:22,609
I'll try my best, sir.

145
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:25,400
I haven't even taken the March mock exam yet.

146
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,439
Okay.

147
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,009
Since you were first place in the liberal arts department,

148
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:32,509
I'm sure you'll do fine.

149
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:35,059
Yes.

150
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:39,530

151
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:47,970

152
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:50,858
- Kimha. 
 - Yes?

153
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,779
- Hey, Min. It's you. 
 - What's up?

154
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:58,189
You look happy today. Why are you smiling?

155
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:01,000
What about your counseling? Did it go well?

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,909
There was nothing special about it.

157
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:05,609
It was my first counseling session.

158
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:08,099
By the way, is Si Woo coming to school tomorrow?

159
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,179
Yes, Friday.

160
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,059
It's the day he walks Do Ha Na to the art academy.

161
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,870

162
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,320

163
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,539

164
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,379

165
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,250
The English teacher must hate me.

166
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,220
He's not even my homeroom teacher but he bosses me around.

167
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,759
So who told you to get into a fight with a freshman?

168
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,589
What?

169
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,950
Are you siding with that freshman who you don't even know?

170
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,450
- No, I just meant... 
 - Your girlfriend...

171
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,970
is me.

172
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,459
Don't forget that.

173
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,720
I know that.

174
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:53,250
You guys fight every day, right?

175
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,550
Right. Stop fighting all the time.

176
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,409
We're not fighting.

177
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,569
He just took that brat's side.

178
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,699
She might be the one who wrote the nasty post about Ha Na.

179
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,629
She might not be.

180
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:07,989
Besides, I told you I won't look for the person who wrote that.

181
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:11,050
You do that. But I will.

182
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,908
She'd better not try anything funny.

183
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,689
I'm really going to kill her.

184
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,379
Hey, Min Ji.

185
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:22,109
Hey!

186
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:24,050
What a loser. Doesn't she have anything better to do?

187
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,579
I'd rather play games if I were her.

188
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,890
 I'm home.

189
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:43,510
Hey, move.

190
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,659
- Hey! 
 - You startled me.

191
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,960
What is this?

192
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,659

193
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,190
What are you doing? Why did you delete it?

194
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,239
What? Mind your own business.

195
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,549
This is my business. What is this?

196
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:00,569
Why do you want to know? You have nothing to do with me.

197
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:02,610
Don't be ridiculous. You and I are siblings.

198
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,199
You have such a loud voice!

199
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,960
If you turned on the computer, do what you always do.

200
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Watch porn or play a game.

201
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,190
Hey, I don't watch porn.

202
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,340
Liar. I'll close the door for you. Have fun.

203
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,060
Hey, I don't watch porn!

204
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,929
What will she become when she grows up?

205
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:19,929
Right, tell me what this is!

206
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:22,069
Cha Ah Hyun!

207
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,009
Are you sick or something?

208
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:32,049
Why do you keep writing down the wrong answers?

209
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:37,319
Hey. What do you want to eat at the internet cafe today?

210
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:39,449
Jjapaghetti with eggs and cheese...

211
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:42,448
I can't go to the internet cafe today.

212
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,210
Why not?

213
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,899
I have to study.

214
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,360
I've never heard such crap in my entire life.

215
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:53,490
Attention, everyone.

216
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,698
We have a new transfer student.

217
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:58,159
He is very good looking.

218
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,049
How could a senior suddenly transfer?

219
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,960
How could a senior be so good-looking?

220
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,909
What?

221
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,299
Please introduce yourself. What's your name?

222
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,059
I am Yeo Bo Ram.

223
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:10,449
I'm...

224
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:11,590
Ryu Joo Ha.

225
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,329
Okay. Joo Ha, you can sit...

226
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:19,109
Okay, over there. Sit next to Ha Na.

227
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,609
Ha Na, take good care of him since you're class president.

228
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:22,319
Pardon? Oh, okay.

229
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,909
Okay then. Go and sit down.

230
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:25,560
Okay.

231
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,829
 Everyone has...

232
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,360
 a place that's fit for them.

233
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,630
 And a place that they desire.

234
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:55,069
Hi!

235
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,759
Which class is Do Ha Na in?

236
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,669
What?

237
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:05,329
Do Ha Na.

238
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:06,540
You don't know her?

239
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,529
 And...

240
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:12,360
 the moment they find a place that doesn't belong to them,

241
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,719
 someone else...

242
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,879
 is bound to lose the place that they desire.

243
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,250

244
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,820
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

245
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,090
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

246
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,920
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

247
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,360
♫  At the end of one and only nineteen  ♫

248
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,090
Fine. You can do whatever you want, but Kim Ha Na is my friend.

249
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,779
Please be careful.

250
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,719
Are you listening?

251
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,140
Yes.

252
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,549
Can you choose which picture looks better?

253
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:56,649
Fine. Just keep on posting your darn pictures like this.

254
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,060
I haven't seen that jacket. Did you buy a new one again?

255
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,783
Yes, I did. Isn't it pretty? Doesn't it look good on me?

256
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:03,599
- What about mine? 
 - There's nothing for you.

257
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,840
Just choose a picture.

258
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,479
I like number three or four.

259
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:12,340
Anyway, stop posting stuff about other people's personal life. Okay?

260
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,110
Whatever. I should edit this before posting it.

261
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,478
Don't you think number five looks better?

262
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,659
You look too short in number five.

263
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:20,279
Even if you're the administrator...

264
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,648
Gosh, get out if you're going to keep talking trash.

265
00:12:23,648 --> 00:12:24,709
"Trash"?

266
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:27,040
- I need to use the computer. 
 - Hey, wait!

267
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,119
- Get out! 
 - Why?

268
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:32,107
- Get out! 
   - Promise me you'll stop posting.

269
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:34,260
Gosh, he's so annoying.

270
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:40,026
Number five looks pretty.

271
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,603

272
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:48,279

273
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,809

274
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:54,540

275
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:58,417
This girl should get a life.

276
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:05,589

277
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:11,217
Well, since she's my brother's friend and all.

278
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:15,496
Then is that girl with yellow hair his friend too?
