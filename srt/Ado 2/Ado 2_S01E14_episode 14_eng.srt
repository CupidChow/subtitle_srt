1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:04,420
By the way, who's your ideal type?

2
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:08,941
Anyone but you.

3
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:10,485
   

4
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:12,537
   

5
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:15,481
   

6
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:19,786
How much harder do you need to study to get a scholarship?

7
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,881
I know, right? I guess I need to be even more diligent.

8
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:26,293
But I've never seen anyone who is more diligent than you.

9
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,928
Right.

10
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,437
Gi Hyun took my phone.

11
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,731
Hey, it's probably for the best.

12
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:42,234
You'll become more stressed after reading the comments.

13
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:43,902
Right.

14
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:48,465
Oh, right. Didn't you say you had something to tell us?

15
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,608
Oh, that.

16
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:51,359
Never mind.

17
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,594
Let's just eat some tteokbokki first.

18
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,712
Come on, tell us.

19
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:58,499
Aren't you buying this because you have something to say?

20
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:00,235
I'll tell you later.

21
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:01,979
It's not the right time to talk about it.

22
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,113
Why not?

23
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:07,434
Is it something that'll make us depressed too? For example,

24
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,819
that you broke up with Si Woo

25
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,096
or quit the art academy? 
  Hey.

26
00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:13,890
Those are silly examples.

27
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,295
Wait.

28
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:20,614
Was I right?

29
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,582
No way.

30
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:29,113
I did break up with Si Woo.

31
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,433
And I also quit the art academy.

32
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,710
- What? 
 - Are you serious?

33
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,361
Yes.

34
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,185
So one of us broke up and quit her art academy.

35
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,896
And another one fought with her boyfriend

36
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,722
after getting bombarded with malicious comments.

37
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:48,049
And the last one can't go to her dream university.

38
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:49,426
Why is life so depressing for us?

39
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:50,861
It's not that I can't go.

40
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,271
I just can't receive a scholarship with my grades.

41
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:56,099
I can't major in journalism and broadcasting.

42
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:00,562
Then what are you going to do? You wanted to become a reporter.

43
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:03,732
I'm not sure about that.

44
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:12,582
I have

45
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,153
good news.

46
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:19,072
What is it?

47
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,583
I couldn't take your calls yesterday.

48
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,768
- That was because... 
 - Oh, that?

49
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,587
Are you sorry? That's totally fine.

50
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:29,006
Gosh, thinking about yesterday is giving me goosebumps again.

51
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,243
Actually...

52
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,288
   

53
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,585
I'm sorry for calling you out at such a late hour.

54
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,028
Did you read over the contract?

55
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:52,064
Well, yes, I'm almost done.

56
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:54,466
Everything I told you through the phone last time

57
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,201
is written in this contract.

58
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:59,812
If you have any other questions,

59
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,081
call me on this number.

60
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,466
Okay, thank you.

61
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:07,154
Now, you just need to sign it.

62
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,922
All right.

63
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:13,234
   

64
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:19,949
   

65
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,081
No way.

66
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,699
That's great. Congratulations.

67
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:30,752
Wow. Does that mean you're a designer now?

68
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,088
You got to do what you truly wanted.

69
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,281
That's great.

70
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,425
I'm also doing something that I truly want to do.

71
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,811
But it's just ruined.

72
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,992
I might not have the right to say this, but...

73
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,469
Oh, come on. Just say it.

74
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,921
You've already bragged about yourself anyway.

75
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:54,233
I realized that

76
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:57,804
there are many ways to achieve what you want.

77
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,842
I'm sure you'll find another way.

78
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,647
And I'm sure you'll find a way to fix your problem.

79
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,752
Not me.

80
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,728
Gi Hyun took my phone.

81
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:15,563
I'm so irritated.

82
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:18,375
What is this?

83
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,268
   

84
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:24,396
Wait. "Yeo Bo Ram's Happy Day" is broadcasting live 
right now?

85
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:25,774
It is?

86
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:26,850
But I'm here.

87
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,743
Exactly.

88
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,357
Gi Hyun?

89
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:38,987
Can you hear me?

90
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,121
Who are you?

91
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:42,090
 He looks cute.
I don't want to see a guy. 

92
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,534
 Where's Kim Ha Na? 
 Who is he? 

93
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,893
Shut up.

94
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:46,911
 What? 
 He's so manly. 

95
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,288
 I'm so frightened. 
 Me too. 

96
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,315
 Can someone explain? 
 This is awkward. 

97
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:52,467
I'm Cha Gi Hyun, the eldest son of the Cha family

98
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:53,994
and the boyfriend

99
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,046
of Yeo Bo Ram from "Yeo Bo Ram's Happy Day."

100
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,214
   
   

101
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,133
I'm here to tell you all something important.

102
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,094
 He's totally in love. 
 Bo Ram could do so much better. 

103
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:05,597
First of all, raise your hands if you wrote malicious comments.

104
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,665
 Me. 
 Me too. 

105
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:07,599
 I'm first. 
 I'm second. 

106
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,393
 It's true that she's ugly though. 

107
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,254
With those hands of yours, I command you

108
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:14,331
to slap your own face. Do it.

109
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:15,774
 What? 
 He's hilarious. 

110
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,067
 Are you insane? Are you insulting the viewers? 

111
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,402
 Hey, he wants us to slap ourselves. 

112
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,611
 You can slap yourself. 
 Do it. 

113
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,029
 This is new. 

114
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,115
Those who talked badly about my girlfriend, listen up.

115
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,901
I don't know what kinds of scumbags you are.

116
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:29,279
It doesn't matter how ugly, pretty, or great someone is.

117
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,833
Is it that fun to talk down to them? Does it feel good?

118
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,311
Gosh, I wasn't going to go this far.

119
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:38,046
Have you ever met her?

120
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,716
Have you? Are you guys close? Are you friends?

121
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,518
You scumbags are nothing but keyboard warriors.

122
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:45,495
He must've gone insane.

123
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:50,433
   
   

124
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,369
My girlfriend Bo Ram

125
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:54,646
is the prettiest...

126
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:58,350
She's the cutest and...

127
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,785
And she's great.

128
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:04,473
She's an admirable girlfriend, you scumbags.

129
00:06:04,473 --> 00:06:07,500
She's even better than you at 'League of Legends.'

130
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,970
- Anyway, 
 - What's wrong with...

131
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,246
I'm warning you.

132
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,456
   
   

133
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:16,092
You'd better not talk down to her ever again. I'm leaving.

134
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,364
- Is he crazy? 
 - Bo Ram.

135
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:22,766
I'm sure Gi Hyun was just worried and upset...

136
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:24,651
Of course. You're his girlfriend.

137
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,162
- Right. That's why he did this. 
 - He's so freaking cool.

138
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:29,614
- What? 
 - What?

139
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:37,388
He's so freaking cool!

140
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:46,420
   

141
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:03,700
♫  Youth, our steps we walk together  ♫

142
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,530
♫  Our precious time  ♫

143
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,920
♫  Our precious time, because I'm with you,   ♫

144
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,130
♫  I can be brave  ♫

145
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,082
That's right. She got 1,230,000 views.

146
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:15,694
My video was shared too. It got 34,000 likes.

147
00:07:15,694 --> 00:07:16,920
Let's go, superstar.

148
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,310
Okay. Let's get it.

149
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,610
♫  it pushes me to start the day  ♫

150
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,500
Goodness!

151
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,404
- Hey, superstar. 
 - Yes?

152
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,632
What is it?

153
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:32,651
It seems we have two superstars in this class.

154
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,972
But let's take off those sunglasses.

155
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:39,484
It's independent study time. It'll be too dark to read.

156
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,090
- Bo Ram, open your book. 
 - Yes, sir.

157
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,049
Good.

158
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,001
Let's study quietly.

159
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,915
I'm home.

160
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,367
Hi. You must be hungry.

161
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,694
I already ate.

162
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,271
Did you study well today?

163
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,040
Yes, I did.

164
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,935
I visited the community welfare center today.

165
00:08:12,935 --> 00:08:15,729
I bragged to the others about how you will become

166
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,331
a reporter in a few years.

167
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:21,776
You shouldn't have.

168
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:26,964
Why did you do that without my permission?

169
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:31,869
Don't do that again, Grandma.

170
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:54,868
    
♫  I can see myself in your heavy steps  ♫

171
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,630
 The 99 percent of certainty that I worked so hard to achieve 

172
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,780
♫  I don't know for how many more words I can hold you in my arms  ♫

173
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,360
 is crumbling down 

174
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,317
♫  I've been so upset,  ♫

175
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:07,079
 just because 

176
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,360
 of one percent of apprehension.  
♫  I've been wondering if there's anything I can do  ♫

177
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:19,083
 I'll see you in the study room. 

178
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,200
Where are you going?

179
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,502
I'm going out to study.

180
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,346
Did you give studying abroad a thought?

181
00:09:31,346 --> 00:09:32,973
Yes.

182
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,157
You're going, right?

183
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,637
No.

184
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,253
My son.

185
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,905
- Hi, mom. 
 - Welcome back.

186
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:50,874
It's all thanks to you. Have you been well?

187
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:52,692
Of course.

188
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,453
Let's go inside.

189
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,480
I'm stuck on this question.

190
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,758
Mark it. I'll explain all of them in a bit.

191
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:43,051
By the way, who's your ideal type?

192
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:46,530
Anyone but you.

193
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,632
Why? I'm extremely charming.

194
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,968
You're like my little sister.

195
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:55,038
What? I'm not.

196
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,809
Why aren't you asking me?

197
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:03,096
You like someone tall, handsome, young, and rich.

198
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,174
Stop chatting and study.

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,026
It's changed.

200
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,823
Then who is it?

201
00:11:12,823 --> 00:11:15,266
My ideal type is someone who's as nice as you.

202
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:18,328
I'm not nice. You seriously don't know how to...

203
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:21,656
 You said there's someone that you like. 

204
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:23,066
 Who is it? 

205
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,726
 It's a secret. 

206
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:25,894
 Someone really nice. 

207
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,504
 Why do you always talk that way? 

208
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:30,314
 He's still a nice guy. 

209
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:37,278
 Rather than relying on the 99 percent of uncertainty... 

210
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,033
Where are you going?

211
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,644
I'll get going first. Sorry.

212
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:47,331
 I decided to trust 

213
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,070
 the one percent of certainty. 

214
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,378
What was that?

215
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:02,120
He's not nice at all.

216
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,490
♫  I'll sing for you  ♫

217
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,070
♫  Even if this moment passes  ♫

218
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,820
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

219
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,510
♫  When we have ourselves,  ♫

220
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,770
    
♫  999teen  ♫

221
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,100
♫  999teen  ♫
