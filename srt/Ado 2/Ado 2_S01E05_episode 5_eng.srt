1
00:00:00,526 --> 00:00:03,528
I might not be able to do what I want.

2
00:00:03,528 --> 00:00:04,971
You envy that?

3
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:07,731
That's not what I meant.

4
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:09,635

5
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:12,261

- Kim Ha Na.

6
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:12,963

7
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:14,206
You came in first in the mock exam.

8
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:16,733
- Congratulations! 
 - Thank you!

9
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:19,378
You're pretty, kind, and even get good grades.

10
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:21,380
Your grandma must be proud of raising you.

11
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,265
I hope she really is.

12
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:25,867
I'm sure she is.

13
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:28,762
By the way, she needs to come for teacher-parent counseling.

14
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,439
Did you ask her when she has time?

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,251
But my grandma has been...

16
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,395
She has been having a hard time walking around.

17
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:38,454
I see.

18
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,709
Then I'll give her a call.

19
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,844
Okay, sir.

20
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:46,488
Okay. Take good care of your health.

21
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:47,573
- Thank you. 
 - You can go now.

22
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:50,099
- Okay. Thank you. 
 - Bye.

23
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:52,226
Joo Ha, come on in.

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,214
- Oh, Ha Na. 
 - Yes?

25
00:00:56,214 --> 00:00:58,208
Can you put this up in the hallway on your way out?

26
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:58,984
Okay.

27
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:01,640
It's your test score, so you should be proud.

28
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:08,520

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,604
Joo Ha, let's see...

30
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:14,699

31
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,697
Hey. You didn't leave yet?

32
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:24,075
Were you waiting for me?

33
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,119
No, it's just...

34
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,097
I have something to ask you.

35
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:29,623
What is it?

36
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,049
Did you...

37
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:34,519
hear everything?

38
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,355
Hear what? Your counseling?

39
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:39,357
Or...

40
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:43,595
The guy from the convenience store saying he likes you?

41
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:45,313
What?

42
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,333
 Class president? Class president!

43
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,135
  - That's awesome. 
 - Thank you.

44
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:51,996
 Gosh, it's impossible not to like you.

45
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:54,030
  - What? 
 - What?

46
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,023
How do you know that?

47
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,967
Well, I somehow found out.

48
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,971
Please don't tell anyone else.

49
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:10,205
Oh.

50
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:12,982
Is it a secret that you're popular?

51
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,980
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

52
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,658
Okay. Please keep it a secret.

53
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,351
Okay.

54
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:28,832
 Something only I know about.

55
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:31,743
Wait for me. We're in the same class.

56
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:35,380
I have to put this up first. I'll see you later.

57
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,920
Guys, someone is attaching the mock exam scores in the hallway.

58
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,430
 Darn it. Who?

59
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,681
 The class president of Class 3.

60
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,083
 Gosh, her.

61
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,359
 I heard she came in first place again.

62
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:49,945
 Something only I want to know about.

63
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:51,438
What, again?

64
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,030
- Come on, let's go see. 
 - Let's go.

65
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,863
I told you that I'd come with you.

66
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:20,157
You're not tall enough.

67
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:21,835
I'm tall.

68
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,812
I didn't say you were short.

69
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:25,947
I said you're not tall enough to reach.

70
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:31,302
That corner too.

71
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,585
Did you do well on the exam?

72
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,411
Yes.

73
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,531
  - Ha Na came in first place. 
 - Done.

74
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:44,483
  - She comes in first every time. 
 - Thanks.

75
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:45,767
  - I envy her. 
 - How can she always be first?

76
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,019
  - First place. 
 - Exactly.

77
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,146
  - What about you? 
 - I don't know.

78
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,340
  - Why is Ha Min in 20th place? 
 - I don't know.

79
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,226
What are you staring at? Your name is right there.

80
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:55,735
What?

81
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,513

82
00:03:57,513 --> 00:03:59,656
It's nothing. Let's go.

83
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,783
- Anyway... 
 - What about you?

84
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,968
Where do you go after school?

85
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:06,304
- The library. 
  - Come and see this.

86
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:08,315
Hey, have you guys seen this?

87
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:12,118
Where is Ha Min's name? I can't even find it.

88
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,121
He was top in the liberal arts department.

89
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,122
I guess his scores dropped after changing majors.

90
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,957
I know.

91
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,754
You can just do better next time.

92
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:26,574
Right. Or you can go back to the liberal arts department.

93
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,610
I'm not going to go back.

94
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,410
Okay. See you later then.

95
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,534

96
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:55,336

97
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:03,027
Hey, I think your watch stopped.

98
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:05,580
I know. I'm going to fix it.

99
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,799
By the way,

100
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:11,102
why did you decide to be a veterinarian?

101
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,554
Why do you ask?

102
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:15,106
It's just, I envy you.

103
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,175
You envy me?

104
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:17,809
Yes.

105
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:22,872
I have nothing I want to do, so I have a lot on my mind lately.

106
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:25,641
You came in first place in the mock exam.

107
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:30,738
I might not be able to do what I want.

108
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:32,565
You envy that?

109
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,734
That's not what I meant.

110
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,098
I heard Ji Woo told you that he likes you.

111
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:40,565
What?

112
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:42,442
Why are you so startled?

113
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,069
Did Joo Ha tell you that?

114
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,816
You must be close to Joo Ha.

115
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,343
Not really.

116
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:54,229
I just have to take care of him as the class president.

117
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,589
How responsible of you.

118
00:05:57,841 --> 00:06:01,636
 I should've been the only one who knew about it.

119
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,363

120
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,670
- Here. 
 - Thanks.

121
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,759
Why are you sitting here?

122
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,621
- I... 
 - Should he sit separately then?

123
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:23,158
How could a vice president not care for a transfer student?

124
00:06:23,158 --> 00:06:24,384
Someone else will take care of him.

125
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,169
We should take care of him.

126
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,138
We even played games at an internet cafe together.

127
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,684
Please, you only play RPG games.

128
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,886
What's wrong with RPG games?

129
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:36,930
He plays 'League of Legends' too.

130
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,806
He's a Diamond rank player.

131
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:40,267
Diamond?

132
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,585
What's that?

133
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:44,279
It means he's about a level 2 player.

134
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,382
He's a Silver rank player. That's about a level 7.

135
00:06:47,382 --> 00:06:49,284
I'm good enough to be a Gold rank player.

136
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,410
Wow!

137
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:55,848
What was your rank again?

138
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,377
I'm a Diamond. My goal is to become a professional gamer.

139
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:02,688
Although my mom is opposed to it.

140
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,725
Still, it's admirable that you have a dream.

141
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,528
What about you?

142
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,739
What? What about me?

143
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:13,741
What is your dream?

144
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:15,835
Me?

145
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,545
I...

146
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,370
Grades matter the most for seniors.

147
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,620
What use is a dream?

148
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:29,316
It's fine since she has good grades.

149
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:32,084
No need to worry about her.

150
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,153
I see.

151
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,372
But...

152
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,791
I wasn't asking you.

153
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:51,680
Does it make sense that seniors need to attend P.E.?

154
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,957
Come on, don't say that.

155
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:56,126
Our bodies need to be healthy

156
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:58,444
in order to go to a good university.

157
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,947
You just want to play soccer.

158
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,258
Ha Min. That meant, "Hi, Min."

159
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:04,443
Get off me.

160
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,728
Do you have P.E.? Where is Kimha?

161
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:10,356
I don't know. She said she had something to say to Joo Ha.

162
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,952
I wonder what they'll do alone in an empty classroom.

163
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,387
Let's go.

164
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:26,773
What is it you want to say?

165
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,760
Did you tell him?

166
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,370
Tell him what?

167
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:36,107
About that guy telling me that he likes me.

168
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:39,010
No. Why?

169
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:41,288
Never mind.

170
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,581
What is it?

171
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:46,734
Did someone else find out besides me?

172
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:48,962
Yes.

173
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,255
Who found out?

174
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,825
Never mind. Okay, then.

175
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,644
I'm sorry for suspecting you.

176
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:57,478
Let's go.

177
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,332
 Something only I know about.

178
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:06,254
 It turns out, that wasn't the case.

179
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:09,890
What's wrong? It's like you're hiding something.

180
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,635
Were you having a secret chat or what?

181
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,871
What? Oh...

182
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:16,590
- Well... 
 - Yes.

183
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,368
With me.

184
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,637
I see.

185
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:24,364
With you?

186
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:27,683
 I wish I were the only one...

187
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:29,610
 who knew about it.

188
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:34,566
But...

189
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:38,960
I wasn't asking you.

190
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,610
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

191
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,060
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

192
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,690
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

193
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,790
♫  At the end of one and only nineteen  ♫

194
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,120
♫  999teen  ♫

195
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,490
Our handsome student, Joo Ha. Are you adjusting well here?

196
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,334
Yes. Thanks to the class president.

197
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,752
Ha Na is a nice girl.

198
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:05,172
If there is anything you don't know or you have

199
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,007
anything that bothers you, ask Ha Na anytime.

200
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,525
Okay.

201
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,704
Anyway, since you took your first

202
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:13,605
mock exam at this school,

203
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:16,825
I need to talk to your parents. When will they be free?

204
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,584
Oh.

205
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:24,640
I don't think they'll be able to make it.
