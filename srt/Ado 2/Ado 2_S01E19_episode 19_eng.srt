1
00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:02,560
Are you crying?

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:07,757

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,843

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,303
- Are they fighting? 
 - It looks like it.

5
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:15,314
Are you suspecting me just because I did well on the exam?

6
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:17,184
You always copy what I do.

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,961
You always blame other people.

8
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:22,280
You're a liar who's toying with Joo Ha and Min!

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,665
Are you done?

10
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:25,900
- Min Ji. 
 - "Min Ji"?

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,244
- Is that all? 
 - Kim Min Ji?

12
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:30,363
- No way. 
 - I copy everything you do and flirt with the boys.

13
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,490
Are those it?

14
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,841
I'm right.

15
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:35,726
- Last year, you and Min... 
 - Hey!

16
00:00:37,563 --> 00:00:40,490
- Who is she? 
 - What is she doing?

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:46,140

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,565
- Me? 
 - Yes, you.

19
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:50,425
You don't deserve to be shown respect.

20
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,994
What's wrong with her? Are you insane?

21
00:00:51,994 --> 00:00:53,287
Was I ever not?

22
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:56,356
- Stop causing a fuss. 
 - Be quiet.

23
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,300
Hey.

24
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,527
When did she toy with them?

25
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,606
Who are you to interfere in our business?

26
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,616
Do you know me?

27
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:08,210
No, I don't. Just answer my question.

28
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,096
When did she toy with those guys?

29
00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:14,115
That's what the rumors say.

30
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,035
I should've known when there were rumors about you on the school's anonymous page.

31
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,991
"Anonymous page"?

32
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:25,535
Oh, that page?

33
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:30,047
How about if I read you something interesting?

34
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:35,937
- What is it? 
 - What is she doing?

35
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:37,823
"Kim Ha Na, a senior in Class 3."

36
00:01:37,823 --> 00:01:40,459
"She's already busy flirting with Ha Min and Ryu Joo Ha."

37
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,686
"Now, she's become even busier copying Kim Min Ji."

38
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,054
"Written anonymously."

39
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:46,747
"Sent by Kim Min Ji."

40
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:49,717
- She sent that? 
 - I had no idea.

41
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,055
- I know. 
 - What has she been doing?

42
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:54,489
"Kim Ha Na from Class 3."

43
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,633
"She's being nice to the transfer student just to flirt with him."

44
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:59,520
"Since when was she such a responsible person?"

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,005
"I hate that she's the class president."

46
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,381
"Written anonymously."

47
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,491
"Sent by Kim Min Ji."

48
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,076
No.

49
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:09,896
- No. 
 - It was her?

50
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:13,408
No. No, it wasn't me!

51
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:18,547
How can you prove that it was me?

52
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:20,523
Who are you?

53
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,409
Me?

54
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,746
I'm the administrator of the school's anonymous page.

55
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,099
- She was the administrator? 
 - This is shocking.

56
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,218
Has Min Ji been pretending to be nice all along?

57
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,694
"Kim Ha Na from Class 3."

58
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,888
"You'd better not act up and get on our nerves."

59
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,865
"What is she? An attention-seeker?"

60
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,409
"She's so annoying. By an anonymous student."

61
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,853
"Sent by"

62
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:42,837
"Kim Min Ji."

63
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,706
What is she going to do?

64
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,959
 This is what happens when you try to cause trouble

65
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:49,577
 without fully understanding the situation.

66
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:53,340
Guys.

67
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,908
It wasn't me.

68
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,134
It really wasn't.

69
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,169
I didn't write them.

70
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:00,313
I'm telling the truth.

71
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,900
What? Do you want me to read more?

72
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,424
Min Ji, calm down. Let's talk in private.

73
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,733
I don't need to talk to you in private.

74
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,151
Quit acting all nice!

75
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,806
This is all your fault.

76
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:20,325
You pretend like you don't know anything and act nice.

77
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,352
But in fact, you make sure you gain something!

78
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,133
Because of you...

79
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,171
people like me suffer.

80
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,464
Min Ji, stop.

81
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:42,497
- I can't believe she wrote them. 
 - I know.

82
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,434
- Ah Hyun. 
 - Wait.

83
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,036
I didn't do it for you.

84
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:50,438
It was for Min.

85
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,999
I see. Thanks.

86
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,293
But...

87
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:58,121
I hope you won't do that next time.

88
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,148
Do what?

89
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:03,250
Putting someone on the spot

90
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,662
even if they did something wrong

91
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:10,116
could really hurt them.

92
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,753
She was in the wrong first.

93
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,429
Aren't you mad?

94
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:16,839
Why wouldn't I be?

95
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,967
She spread false rumors about me.

96
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,536
But still...

97
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,898
she's probably the most upset right now.

98
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,235
Why? She has no right to be.

99
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,788
She probably knows best that she was wrong.

100
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:34,132
I've been through this before.

101
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:38,603
She's probably suffering the most right now.

102
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:42,265
Right.

103
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:43,967
I see.

104
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,554
I should go now.

105
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,231
Let's not talk over something like this again.

106
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:00,675
So?

107
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,910
Is Kim Ha Na okay?

108
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,228
She is.

109
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:05,397
Min Ji is the one who was completely destroyed.

110
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:06,890
You're right.

111
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,784
I saw Min Ji going to the teachers' room.

112
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:11,203
Ah Hyun was so amazing.

113
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:15,239
"I'm the administrator of the school's anonymous page."

114
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,569
Oh, right. Give this to your sister.

115
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,847
Why do you have this?

116
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:24,607
Bye.

117
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,684
Bye.

118
00:05:25,684 --> 00:05:27,761
Hey, why do you have this?

119
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,729
Let's go.

120
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,415
- Let's go. 
 - What's going on?

121
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,091
Come on.

122
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:34,793
- Explain this later. 
 - There's nothing to explain.

123
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:35,878
You have to.

124
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:39,297

125
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,883
Why did Gi Hyun give this to me?

126
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,468
- Should he not have? 
 - No.

127
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,536
Why not?

128
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:47,414
You're completely clueless.

129
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,150
There's no point in giving it to my brother.

130
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,902
I still don't get it. Why not?

131
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:54,296
You should've given it directly to me.

132
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:57,015
That way, we can become closer.

133
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,094
Our alliance is over, so there's no need for us to meet.

134
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,578
We don't need to become closer.

135
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:05,448
- What? 
 - That's why I gave it to Gi Hyun.

136
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,500
Hold on.

137
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,203
Why is our alliance over?

138
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,747
Because the girl I like and the guy you like

139
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,383
are dating someone else.

140
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,537
I'm going to be busy studying.

141
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:21,989
So don't call me.

142
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,361
Why are you doing this to me?

143
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:28,154
What do you mean?

144
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,131
I mean...

145
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:32,759
We've become quite close lately.

146
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,761
But now, you're saying that our alliance is over and that I shouldn't call you.

147
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,256
Does that make any sense? Are you putting a wall...

148
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:39,324
I am.

149
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,453
I like Kim Ha Na.

150
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,557
So of course, I should put up a wall between you and me.

151
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,300
Our alliance isn't over yet.

152
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,345
The guy I like

153
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,998
isn't dating anyone.

154
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,052
 You have no idea.

155
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,405
Give this back to me later.

156
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:24,877
Hey, there's a couple I'm suspicious about.

157
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,038
Me too. No, wait.

158
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,300
It's a bit too early to call them a couple.

159
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,786
Have you caught on as well?

160
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,105
You're talking about those two, right?

161
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:37,666
He's always taking care of her.

162
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,877
And they're always going around together.

163
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,880
It seems like they have a secret between them.

164
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,590
I'm sure there's something going on.

165
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,756
 What did you two whisper about?

166
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:55,074
 It's a secret.

167
00:07:56,994 --> 00:07:59,128
 Give this to your sister.

168
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,223
 Why do you have this?

169
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:04,108
 Bye.

170
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,529
Even for a slow-witted girl like you, it's fishy, right?

171
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,706
It's so obvious...

172
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:12,642
You're more slow-witted than I am.

173
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:16,921
Hey, why are you coming home so late?

174
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:18,381
I don't want to listen to you.

175
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:20,225
Are you crying?

176
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:23,427
What? What's going on?

177
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:25,797
Why are you crying? She's crying.

178
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,199
Don't tease me.

179
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,700
"Don't tease me."

180
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,245
So why are you crying? Tell me.

181
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,931
Is she really crying? Hey, are you crying?

182
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,750
Yes, I am. Are you happy?

183
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,477
Are you?

184
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,523
"Yes, I am."

185
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,550
- Stop it! 
 - "I'm crying."

186
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,485
- My gosh! 
 - That hurts.

187
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,237
If you're slow-witted, at least behave well.

188
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,413
What? What is it?

189
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:54,759
I'll go and comfort her. You stay here.

190
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,836
What's going on?

191
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:03,234
Hey. Why did you cry yesterday?

192
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:04,361
I don't know.

193
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:06,680
Tell me. I'm going to ask until you tell me.

194
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,600
Tell me, tell me.

195
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:11,217
Because I was dumped! Are you happy now?

196
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,928
- You were dumped? 
 - Yes, I was.

197
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,788
That's why I cried. Do you want me to repeat it?

198
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,615
I cried because I was dumped!

199
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:18,100
- By whom? 
 - Who do you think?

200
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,310
By the tall and handsome, young and rich guy!

201
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,296
Who is that?

202
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:26,524
I don't know. If you don't know anything, just get lost!

203
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,564
 You have no idea.

204
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:35,592
 Even though I know now.

205
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:39,003
I know that "rich" means you have a lot of money.

206
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,420
Are you crying?

207
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,476
Ha Min!

208
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,187
Min, do you want to die?

209
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:14,489
- Hey! 
 - Hey.

210
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,991
- Hey! 
 - Let me go first.

211
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,784
- No! 
 - What's wrong with you?

212
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,536
- Talk it out. 
 - Let me go!

213
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,100
