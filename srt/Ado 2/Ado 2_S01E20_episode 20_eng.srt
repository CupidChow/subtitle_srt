1
00:00:00,692 --> 00:00:02,385
Attention.

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,046
Greet the teacher.

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,548

4
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,883

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,221

6
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,676
Min, do you want to die?

7
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:19,436
- Hey! 
 - Hey.

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,171
- Hey! 
 - Let me go first.

9
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:23,290
- No! 
 - What's wrong with you?

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,383
- Talk it out. 
 - Let me go!

11
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:29,029
Hey, everyone's preparing for their graduation photos.

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,581
You can't cause a scene here.

13
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,643
Then I can cause a scene somewhere else, right?

14
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:37,354
Don't cause a scene anywhere, you jerk!

15
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:39,497
Follow me.

16
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,507
What's wrong with him?

17
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,675
What did you do yesterday?

18
00:00:58,675 --> 00:00:59,935
I went to the library.

19
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,679
I mean, what did you do with my sister yesterday?

20
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,622
With your sister?

21
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:06,550
We talked for a bit. Why?

22
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,734
What did you talk about?

23
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,219
We were just chatting.

24
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:12,529
Did you just smile? Did you?

25
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:13,949
I'm sorry. I think there's been a misunderstanding.

26
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,109
A "misunderstanding"?

27
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,853
Am I misunderstanding something?

28
00:01:17,853 --> 00:01:21,322
My sister came home crying last night, and I misunderstood that?

29
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,008
She cried?

30
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:28,678
Anyway, are you toying with my sister?

31
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:30,716
That's a bit harsh.

32
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,992
She's like a sister to me.

33
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,294
What are you blabbering about? She's my sister!

34
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,187
Okay.

35
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,292
You'd better not hang out with her ever again.

36
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:43,178
And stop toying with her if you're not going to date her.

37
00:01:43,178 --> 00:01:46,146
Then if I date her, can we hang out?

38
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:48,734
- What? 
 - Hey, hey.

39
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,028
Just go on and date your crush, Kim Ha Na.

40
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,746
Don't drag my sister into this.

41
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:56,480
Kim Ha Na is dating me.

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,218
What?

43
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,121
- You're dating? 
 - See?

44
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,474
I knew this. Since when? You asked her out, right?

45
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:06,926
Why didn't you tell me?

46
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,628
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,447
You knew too?

48
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:12,249
So we were the only ones who didn't know?

49
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:14,592
He probably knew as well.

50
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,761
You did?

51
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,296
- Do you really like my sister? 
 - Stop it!

52
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,782
Hey! You lunatic!

53
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:24,002
What are you doing, you psycho?

54
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:26,755
Why are you here? How did you know we were here?

55
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:28,357
I told her.

56
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,883
Why were you grabbing him by the collar?

57
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,852
- Mind your own business! 
 - Don't shout at me!

58
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:36,189
 We're busy enough with our studies.

59
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,333
 But we have other things to do as well.

60
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,461
 I guess being 19 is just that.

61
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:45,457
That's enough. Let's go and take our graduation photos.

62
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,709
- Yes. 
 - Get lost!

63
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,878
- I hate you! 
 - I hate you too!

64
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,872
That's enough!

65
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:54,490
- My gosh. 
 - That little...

66
00:02:57,828 --> 00:03:01,873
I'm sorry about what my brother did to you.

67
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:08,946
Study hard.

68
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,630
- Look at you. 
 - You look hilarious.

69
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,218
- Look at me. 
 - Let's take a photo.

70
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:23,470
- Take a photo of us. 
 - Two, three.

71
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,215
- Us too. 
 - Look here.

72
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:29,985
- Look at them. Take a photo. 
 - Hurry up.

73
00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:31,836
How have you been doing?

74
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,514
Good. And you?

75
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,308
It's the same for me.

76
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,503
It looks like it.

77
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:42,672
You must be busy.

78
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:45,183
I'm still busy like before.

79
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:49,762
And I still think about you.

80
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,816
I see.

81
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,517
Don't you hate me?

82
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:04,244
Why should I?

83
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:06,805
Just because.

84
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:14,278
I've never hated you.

85
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:19,325
- Are you a cat? 
 - What?

86
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,328
Oh, yes.

87
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,696
You look cute.

88
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,565
That was lame.

89
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,111
Look over there.

90
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,052
Whistle if you need me.

91
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,387
You know how to, right?

92
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,105
Whistle, whistle!

93
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,583
Your costume really suits you.

94
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,359
Do you even know why they're laughing?

95
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,677
No.

96
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,463
When did you prepare all this?

97
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:15,614
I heard you weren't going to dress up, so I prepared that myself.

98
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,709
Stop complaining!

99
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,935
You should be grateful.

100
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:20,779
- Hi! 
 - Hey.

101
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,189
Were you here?

102
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,124
- You look so pretty. 
 - What's that on your nose?

103
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,786
Look who's here. Aren't you our school celebrity?

104
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,346
- When did you come? 
 - Where did you get this?

105
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:31,356
- Just now. 
 - Traitor.

106
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:34,158
He's always busy going on dates with Do Ha Na.

107
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:37,504
Be quiet. They broke up.

108
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,397
- Oh, right. 
 - Gosh, Gi Hyun.

109
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:41,508
How's basketball going?

110
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,402
- Good. 
 - Si Woo, are you still busy?

111
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:48,521
- A bit. 
 - Your basketball skills have improved.

112
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:51,451
But your conversational skills still need some work.

113
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,512
- He's always like that. 
 - You're right.

114
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:55,438
That's not true.

115
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,284
Is Si Woo not going to get a makeover?

116
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:01,044
I'll do it for him.

117
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:02,787
- No, thanks. 
 - What?

118
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:05,123
Hurry up. We have no time.

119
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:06,658
Try it. It'll be fun.

120
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,576
Yes, you should try it.

121
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:11,513
I know you're going to do it anyway.

122
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:13,006
Just hurry up.

123
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,516
Even Min got a makeover.

124
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:16,251
See? Just do it.

125
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,245
- Hurry up! 
 - Hold him down.

126
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,438
Hey.

127
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:20,923
- Sit down. 
 - Just sit still.

128
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,133
- I'll hold him down. 
 - Hey.

129
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,710
- Here. 
 - Draw on the sides.

130
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,087
That looks funny.

131
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,305
That does.

132
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,665
 We can forget

133
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:33,543
 even the most important things that lie ahead.

134
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:37,870
 I guess being 19 is just that.

135
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,735
I'll take the photo now.

136
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,212
Please take one step forward.

137
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:47,056
Stop. Go back a little bit.

138
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,144
Can you get closer?

139
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,164
All right, here I go.

140
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,430
 One, two, three.

141
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,742
 Here I go. One, two, three.

142
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:06,440
 One, two, three.

143
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,100
 One, two, three.

144
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:11,290
 One, two, three.

145
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,691
 Two, three. Two, three.

146
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:14,393
- Wait. Stop it! 
   -Two, three.

147
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,019
 Two, three. Two, three.

148
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,063
 One, two, three.

149
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,439
 Two, three.

150
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,607
 Two, three.

151
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,302
What's going on?

152
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:27,029
 Two, three. Two, three.

153
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,466
- Good, right? Let's take one. 
 - Sure.

154
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:30,784
The weather's so nice.

155
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,261
No, it's too hot. Sorry.

156
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:34,438
Why are you wearing such thick clothes?

157
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:35,939
- I know, right? 
 - Yes.

158
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,133
- Bo Ram told you to, right? 
 - Yes.

159
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:41,344
It would've been nice if we'd all taken a photo together.

160
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,238
- You're right. 
 - Let's take one, then.

161
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:45,198
Who can we ask?

162
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,784
How about our teacher?

163
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,528
No way.

164
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:52,805
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

165
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,708
Let's take an awesome group photo.

166
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,227
- What? 
 - What's wrong with her?

167
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,987
I don't know.

168
00:07:58,987 --> 00:07:59,755
Let's go.

169
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:03,741

170
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,130
What should we do? How about this?

171
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,939
How about this?

172
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,618
This is our graduation photo.

173
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,961
Why is she here?

174
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,956
We already took that back there. This is a group photo.

175
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,550
Can you please stop talking to me?

176
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,820
Stop arguing and let's decide on our pose.

177
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,787
Let's do this.

178
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:27,507
I'll puke if I see Si Woo doing that.

179
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,210
- Hey. 
 - How about this?

180
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,720
Since our alliance is still ongoing,

181
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,488
I can sit next to you, right?

182
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:36,666
You're already sitting there.

183
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:40,010
And don't cry.

184
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,105
- I look like a bad person. 
 - How should we pose?

185
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,148
- Like this. 
 - Like this?

186
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,275
I want to be a good person.

187
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,769
How about this?

188
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:48,654
I like it.

189
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,656
No, it's too boring.

190
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,566
Can't we all just pose however we want to?

191
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,825
I think that's for the best.

192
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,537
- Fine. 
 - I'll take the photo now.

193
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,541
 One, two, three.

194
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,026
Don't link arms!

195
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,671
 Gosh, Gi Hyun!

196
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,564
 Like this,

197
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:10,158
 we're spending our one and only days

198
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:12,610
 as 19-year-olds.

199
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,430
Ta-da.

200
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,100
My friend designed this herself.

201
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,209
Isn't it pretty?

202
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,562
I'll share the link in the comments section,

203
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,738
so make sure you buy them.

204
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,024
Oh, right.

205
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,577
During my counseling today, I told the teacher

206
00:09:28,577 --> 00:09:30,420
that I won't be going to university.

207
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,080
And as for my boyfriend,

208
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,282
he's depressed because he's third on the waiting list for acceptance.

209
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,536
Check him out.

210
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:43,257
You're looking at a senior who has gone insane.

211
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,656
I'm Amazing, thank you for the 100,000 won donation.

212
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:53,701
Have a great "Yeo Bo Ram's Happy Day."

213
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,498
Hey, that's enough.

214
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,126
Let me save you from this unsightly scene.

215
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:03,504
Okay. Poor you.

216
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:04,755
All right.

217
00:10:04,755 --> 00:10:08,467
Anyway, I have good news for you.

218
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:11,185
 I'm going to do what I want.

219
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:14,530
 This is my life anyway.

220
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,326
 I need to make this year worthwhile.

221
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,952
Isn't it such great news?

222
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,639
Gi Hyun, hold on tightly.

223
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,282
This is so unnecessary.

224
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:25,050

225
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,586
I knew my son was a genius.

226
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,531
I gave birth to such a smart son.

227
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:33,742
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

228
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:35,093
Dad, be careful.

229
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,371
- Is it even? 
 - That side is higher.

230
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,039
- What's wrong with this? 
 - How about hanging it there?

231
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,250
If you do, I think more people can see it better from afar.

232
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,227
- Where? 
 - It'll be facing the school.

233
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,753
It's fine here.

234
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:49,057
 I'm not going to give up.

235
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:52,210
 I might stumble a bit along the way.

236
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,904
 But stumbling when you're 19 is natural.

237
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:01,161

238
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:05,039

239
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,416

240
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,927
Ha Na, you should still go to university.

241
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:12,989
I'll go if I feel like I should.

242
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:15,600
But for now, I'm enjoying what I'm doing.

243
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,410
♫  Maybe I like you,  ♫

244
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,363
 We don't need to make the same choices.

245
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:21,081

246
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,667
 As a 19-year-old,

247
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,711
 I must listen to myself when making choices.

248
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:30,200
♫  My heart is strange,  ♫

249
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,490
♫  but I am really curious about you  ♫

250
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,830
♫  I wonder what I you feel,  ♫

251
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,848
Si Woo.

252
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:44,019
 I thought everything would end in a single moment.

253
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:46,214
 But I was wrong.

254
00:11:46,214 --> 00:11:48,041
 This is what I've come to realize

255
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,500
 at the age of 19.

256
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,920
♫  our time  ♫

257
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,660
♫  Maybe I like you, maybe I remember you  ♫

258
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,100
Good luck on the CSAT.

259

♫  Maybe I like you,  ♫

260
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:04,282
I'm going to repeat a year anyway.

261
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:07,192
But thanks. 
 ♫  My heart is strange,  ♫

262
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:10,830
Once you're done with the exam, let's hang out together.

263
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,349
I can't.

264
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:15,977
I need to go to the States for a bit.

265
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:19,755
Why? Are you going to see someone?

266
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,126
Yes. My brother.

267
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:27,503
 Life doesn't always turn out the way you want it to.

268
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:32,368
 And this is the life

269
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:37,080
 of the 19-year-old me.  
 ♫  I wonder what I you feel,  ♫

270
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,230
♫  I draw pictures every day  ♫

271
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:42,190

272
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,050
♫  Let's be honest, my heart that sparkles as I run towards you  ♫

273
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,244
  - Good luck on the CSAT. 
 - If you're stuck, pick number 3.

274
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:51,230
 What? Are you teasing me because I'm the third on the list?

275
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,881
 Do you have a victim mentality?

276
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:54,566
 I hope you guys don't end up on the waiting list like me.

277
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,550
 The CSAT doesn't have such things.

278
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,251
♫  Maybe I like you,  ♫

279
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:01,430
Jooha. 
 ♫  maybe I remember you  ♫

280
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,160
♫  My heart is strange,  ♫

281
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:04,810
 These are my last days as a teenager.

282
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,845
 This is the last time I'll go through adolescence.  
 ♫  but I am really curious about you  ♫

283
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:11,875
 I'm glad you're in my life in my last days as a teenager.

284
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,777
I'm sorry for making you wait. Let's go.

285
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:15,712
Okay. Good luck.

286
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,847
Thanks. You too.

287
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,016
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

288
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:24,852
 The rest of my 19-year-old life belongs to you.

289
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,838

290
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:34,022
 I'm sad.

291
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,300
  - Isn't it bittersweet? 
 - I love that I'm graduating.

292
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:39,211
  - Don't you? 
 - I'm sad.

293
00:13:39,211 --> 00:13:42,129
 Let's go and get jajangmyeon after this.

294
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,116
  - Okay. 
 - Do you want to? Let's get some.

295
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,659
  - Let's have jajangmyeon. 
 - And tangsuyuk.

296
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,953
 Okay. You're going to have jjamppong, right?

297
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,746
 You're not?

298
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,915
 Will you have jajangmyeon or jjamppong?

299
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,692
 Should we order guobaorou? What do you think?

300
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:55,685
 In the end,

301
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:59,546
 we made our own choices and didn't regret them.

302
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:02,850
All right. Sit down, everyone.

303
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:12,127
Guys, you did well over the past three years.

304
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:14,279
Feel free to come and see me

305
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,506
if you have anything you want to talk about.

306
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,393
Congratulations on your graduation.

307
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,569
Good job, everyone.

308
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,264
I'm about to cry.

309
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,965
Don't.

310
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,536
Class president.

311
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,205
Shall we do our last greeting?

312
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,015
Okay.

313
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,988
Attention.

314
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,352
 We make all sorts of decisions.

315
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,355
Greet the teacher.

316
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,366
Thank you.

317
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,553
 And none of them

318
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,356
 are wrong.

319
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,409
Ha Na.

320
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:22,129
 Because our lives as 19-year-olds

321
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:25,408
 are

322
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:28,719
 all unique.

323
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:34,675

324
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:37,590
