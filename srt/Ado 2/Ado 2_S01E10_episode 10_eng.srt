1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,703
Oh, you're that guy from before.

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:05,196
Are you interested in me?

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,258

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,680

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,872
I quit the art academy.

6
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:16,482

7
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:18,376
Is something wrong?

8
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:20,486
Not really.

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,582
But it's not like everything is going well either.

10
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,778
Even though I quit the academy,

11
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,639
it doesn't mean I quit drawing too.

12
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:35,958
Whether you quit the academy or quit drawing, it's all okay.

13
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,904
The decision is up to you.

14
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,140
I'm okay with whatever you like.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,851
So I want to reconsider...

16
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:45,803
what I like.

17
00:00:45,803 --> 00:00:48,189
I'll help you.

18
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:50,800
How will you help me?

19
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:54,896
I'll wait for you.

20
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:02,236
I felt like I had to do something.

21
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,931
- Si Woo... 
 - I...

22
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,841
get my leave next week.

23
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:10,027
Do you want to go to the exhibition we missed last time?

24
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,481
Si Woo.

25
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,624
 If not,

26
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:17,560
 I felt like I'd lose her.

27
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:22,565
Let's break up.

28
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,107

29
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,394

30
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:53,522

31
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:55,165

32
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,558

33
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:59,469

34
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:01,813

35
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:04,149

36
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:06,042

37
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,178

38
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:10,346

39
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:14,120

40
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,119

41
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:26,410

42
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,287
Hey. I'm glad you're here. Teach me this.

43
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,539
Did you buy another workbook?

44
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,791
- It's not mine. It's Bo Ram's. 
 - I see.

45
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,176
- Come on and teach me. 
 - This?

46
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,997
The answer is number three.

47
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:55,200
Because an infinitive has to come after "to."

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,068
What about this then?

49
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,367
If an "or" or "and" comes after an imperative sentence,

50
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:05,477
the meaning can be interpreted differently.

51
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,938
But an imperative sentence followed by "or" means

52
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,416
"Do something. If not, something will happen."

53
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,551
Isn't it really easy?

54
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:15,036
You call this easy?

55
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:18,657
It's quite easy. Don't worry. You can study hard from now on.

56
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,933
I've never seen this before.

57
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,118
Study.

58
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,370
If not, you won't make it to university.

59
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,880
Hey.

60
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,990
What?

61
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,375
I just showed you an example.

62
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,621
I'd better study hard.

63
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:37,023
If not, my life will be ruined.

64
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:40,012
Your life won't be ruined just because you don't study.

65
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,547
That's because you're good at studying anyway.

66
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:44,333
What use is that?

67
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,051
There's nothing that I want to do.

68
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:50,179
Still, you can choose any major as you please.

69
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:54,759
But there is nothing I want to major in right now.

70
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:57,721
- What are you doing tomorrow? 
 - What?

71
00:03:57,721 --> 00:04:00,932
I'm going to the library. Why?

72
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,472
What class is he in?

73
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:10,560
This is so annoying. Why does he make me bring his stuff?

74
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,438
I found him.

75
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:20,568
Wait. What are they doing there together?

76
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:25,406
Did you lose your name tag or did you just throw it away?

77
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:26,783
You startled me.

78
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:28,901
Who are you?

79
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,545
Here.

80
00:04:31,947 --> 00:04:35,716
Oh, you're that guy from before.

81
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,612
Why did you take my name tag?

82
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,039
Are you interested in me?

83
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:52,842
Even if I'm interested in you,

84
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:55,511
I don't think I have a chance since you like him.

85
00:04:57,239 --> 00:05:00,232
Why do you think I like him?

86
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:04,368
Your eyes... were glued to him just now.

87
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,463
I get it.

88
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:16,015
You like her too.

89
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:19,218
I like Kim Ha Na?

90
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,171
Your eyes...

91
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:25,047
were glued... to her.

92
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,773
- Why are you here? 
 - Oh.

93
00:05:30,773 --> 00:05:33,692
Gi Hyun left his book at home. I brought it for him.

94
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:35,860
I'll see you later.

95
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,845
Oppa.

96
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,499
Do you want to form an alliance?

97
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:42,951
An alliance? What are you, a little kid?

98
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:47,371
Why? It'll be nice to exchange information with each other.

99
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:49,874
I don't need any information.

100
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:52,126
I already know everything.

101
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:55,339
We're both in the same boat. Can't we help each other out?

102
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:57,807
You'll have to try something, at least.

103
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:00,443
I'm not in the same boat as you.

104
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,047
Hey.

105
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,890
Don't lie.

106
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,059
It's so obvious.

107
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,610
Goodness. An alliance with someone clumsy like her?

108
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,735

109
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,930
If not.

110
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,982
If not...

111
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:40,308
"How to go to university...

112
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:43,069
even with bad grades?"

113
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,323
 If your current grades won't get you anywhere,

114
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,899
 Daesung Mimac is the answer.

115
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:49,785
 Just give up.

116
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,962
 How could you go to university without any effort?

117
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:54,731

118
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:58,101
 Today, I'll show you how to study when you have bad grades.

119
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,820
 I know many of you are struggling with your studies.

120
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,548
 The CSAT is just around the corner.

121
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,783
 You must all be worried.

122
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:07,878
 Remember that concentration is the key to studying.

123
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:10,305
 We learned how to study better today.

124
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,940
 I'll see you next time.

125
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,343
What a messed-up blog.

126
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:18,863
An aptitude test?

127
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:24,794
My aptitude is having fun or sleeping.

128
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:27,313
I have your report card!

129
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,132
- Where did you get that? 
 - Do you call these grades?

130
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:31,326
- Give it back. 
 - I'm going to show mom and dad.

131
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,813
No, hey! Do you want to die? Give it to me!

132
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:37,115
Daddy.

133
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,651
- Seo Hyeon is here. 
 - Come here.

134
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,211
It's okay to have bad grades.

135
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:51,847
The important thing is to be happy. Okay?

136
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:56,076
Right. But don't just guess all the questions next time.

137
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,777
Slacking off all the time...

138
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,588
isn't a good habit.

139
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:03,340
I tried solving the questions.

140
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,243
You solved them?

141
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,446
This is hilarious. You actually solved the questions?

142
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,822
And these are the grades you got?

143
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,807
What an idiot!

144
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:13,976
It's okay. You did a good job, my son.

145
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,704
Men should be honest like that.

146
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,848
That's right!

147
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:21,167
I'll let you do everything you want.

148
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,112
If you want to go to university, just tell me.

149
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:26,006
- I... 
 - Hey.

150
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,883
Will you be able to go to university with those grades?

151
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,459
I doubt it.

152
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,020
I know.

153
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,880
You should study hard.

154
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,600
If you don't want to regret it, like me when you're a senior.

155
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,435
Why are you being so serious all of a sudden?

156
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,445
Good. There you go.

157
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:41,647
Watch it with us.

158
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,440
Okay.

159
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,760
Gi Hyun, play with me.

160
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,784
This is a rainbow.

161
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:54,660
Right.

162
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,411
This is a mountain.

163
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,521
What is this?

164
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:59,898
This? Apple.

165
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,208
And this?

166
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,693
Pineapple.

167
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:04,619
And this?

168
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,547
Green.

169
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,056
Green.

170
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:10,875
Green? Green.

171
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,277
Ice cream.

172
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:14,413
And this?

173
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:17,173
This? Watermelon.

174
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:18,984
And this?

175
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:23,029
- Zebra. 
 - Wow, you're a genius!

176
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,589
I'm...

177
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:27,049
- a genius? 
 - Yes.

178
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:29,428
Gi Hyun, buy me a Jouju doll.

179
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:32,263
- A Jouju doll? 
 - Yes.

180
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:35,458
I'll make a lot of money when I go to university

181
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,810
and buy you a hundred Jouju dolls.

182
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,687
Wow, you're amazing!

183
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:41,264
- Am I amazing? 
 - Yes.

184
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:43,299
Amazing!

185
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:46,002
How amazing am I?

186
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:50,957
This much?

187
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,166
How do you plan on going to university?

188
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,143
How do you think?

189
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,386
By taking the CSAT.

190
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,464
Go and study abroad.

191
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:18,451
Go abroad and study like your brother Min Joon did.

192
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,698
- What are you talking about? 
- With those grades,

193
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:26,042
you'll never make it to your university of choice.

194
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,194
Especially Seoyeon University.

195
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,849
My university of choice?

196
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,703
You mean the university you and Dad want me to go to,

197
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,688
not my university of choice.

198
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:42,433
Did I ever say that I wanted to go to Seoyeon University?

199
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,711
Even if you want to now, you won't make it

200
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,563
with those grades.

201
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,931
Also,

202
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:50,400
other people are desperate to go and study abroad.

203
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,210
Can't you just do as I say?

204
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,388
I won't go.

205
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,766
When we sent Min Joon abroad to study,

206
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:01,235
- he was so thankful... 
 - That's his business.

207
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:03,288
I'm not going.

208
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,423
You really...

209
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,312

210
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,216

211
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:42,869

212
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:46,814
 I feel like I have to do something.

213
00:11:46,814 --> 00:11:51,142

214
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:57,114
 If not, I feel like I'll lose.

215
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,430
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

216
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,690
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

217
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,950
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

218
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:16,500

219
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,197
- You're back. 
 - Sorry?

220
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,782
Aren't you the one who came with that girl the other day

221
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,392
and bought a whole bunch of books?

222
00:12:22,392 --> 00:12:23,619
Yes, I am.

223
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,621
Did you already finish looking through those books?

224
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,639
You came to buy more?

225
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,076
Gosh, you must really be good at studying.

226
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:34,338
I wish my son would study as hard as you.

227
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,989
But he just...

228
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,258
plays games all the time.

229
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,344
Goodness. It's so frustrating.

230
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,012
Here.

231
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,347
Drink this.

232
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:44,598
It's okay, sir.

233
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,016
It's all right. When an adult gives you something,

234
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,085
 just say "thank you" and take it.

235
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:50,521
 You should drink that and take good care of your health.

236
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,606
 That's how you'll be able to study harder.

237
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,300
Thank you. I drink red ginseng often too.

238
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,527
  - Really?  
 - Yes.

239
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:59,312
 Gosh, you're good at studying...

240
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:02,157
 and take care of your health. Your parents must be proud.

241
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,601
 Aren't they really proud of you?

242
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:06,511
 I wish you were my son.
