1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:01,468
We broke up.

2
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,953
What?!

3
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:05,797

4
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,424

5
00:00:08,424 --> 00:00:09,268

6
00:00:09,268 --> 00:00:12,061
 Let's break up.

7
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:13,788
 Is it because we can't see each other often?

8
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:16,833
 Or is something wrong?

9
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,402
 Answer me.

10
00:00:19,402 --> 00:00:22,355
 Why do you want to suddenly break up?

11
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,443
 No reason.

12
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,420
 I'll get going then.

13
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,409
 Stay a little longer.

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,395
 I'm sorry.

15
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,706
 Right now,

16
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:51,951
 rather than spending time with you,

17
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,829
 I need more time for myself.

18
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,624
Just look at him.

19
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:08,943
- Hey. 
 - Gosh!

20
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,463
You're taking a nap when you're supposed to be training?

21
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:12,814
Get up!

22
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:14,433
You're carefree now, right?

23
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,709
Since you'll become a professional soon.

24
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,811
No, I'm not.

25
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,289
We came all the way down here

26
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,474
because it was so hard to see your face.

27
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:23,892
Right.

28
00:01:23,892 --> 00:01:25,227

29
00:01:25,227 --> 00:01:27,361

30
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:33,099
 All of my time is spent on you.

31
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:35,411
 Because you are...

32
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:37,171
 what I need.

33
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,392
How is your training going?

34
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,443
We broke up.

35
00:01:42,443 --> 00:01:44,604
What?!

36
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,032
In my dream.

37
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,046
Hey. Dreams usually mean the opposite, so don't worry.

38
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,940
- I thought they really broke up. 
 - Me too.

39
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,618
What about the others?

40
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,128
How are they doing?

41
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:02,514
They're all busy now since we're seniors.

42
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:04,608
I haven't seen Do Hana much after she changed classes.

43
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:06,943
- Right? 
 - Yes.

44
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:09,195
I started studying too.

45
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:11,998
Why are you doing something you never used to do?

46
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,217
Why does everyone start getting suspicious first?

47
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,369
Can't you just root for me?

48
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,439
You really don't know why?

49
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,683
I don't. Why? Why is it?

50
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,560
Good luck. Let's play ball.

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,853
Come on!

52
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,113
Tell me, why?

53
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,866
Just go and study then.

54
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,904
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,873
Have we...

56
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:39,350
met before?

57
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,454
I'm not sure.

58
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,274
Just tell me that I'm pretty if you want to hit on me.

59
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:46,358
No, it's...

60
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,001
Goodness, my stomach almost killed me.

61
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,036
What on earth?

62
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,488
Why are you here?

63
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,884
Wow! You two look really alike.

64
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,802
We look alike?

65
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,412
Is she your sister?

66
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,631
Yes. Although I don't want to admit it.

67
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:02,991
Same here.

68
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:05,836
Don't act like you know me on the streets. It's embarrassing.

69
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:07,854
Where are you going?

70
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,548
You should be studying all day in the study room.

71
00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:11,749
I'm working part-time starting today. Why?

72
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:13,443
Mom said she won't buy me a new phone if I lose it again.

73
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,162
You lost it again?

74
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,805
How many times has it been?

75
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:19,132
Whatever, I need to go to work.

76
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,234
Stop acting like you know me.

77
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,488
There's no use raising a little sister.

78
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:26,715
All she does is lose things all the time.

79
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:28,900
I have to go to my lesson now. What about you?

80
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,543
I need to see Bo Ram...

81
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,279
Hey. I need to get going.

82
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:44,383
Cha Ah Hyun?

83
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:46,809

84
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,338
She really does lose things easily.

85
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:52,541

86
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,150

87
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,387
Why isn't he replying? He's not even reading my texts.

88
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,633
Hey. Why are you so late?

89
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:04,236
- I couldn't even reach you. 
 - I'm sorry.

90
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:06,495
I changed my phone to this.

91
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,791
- What is that? 
 - From now on,

92
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,344
I'll delete my social media accounts and focus on studying.

93
00:04:17,783 --> 00:04:20,451
Are you sick?

94
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:22,037
Don't you have to go to the hospital?

95
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:25,424
Hey. I even changed my phone. Why won't you believe me?

96
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:27,351
I'm really going to focus on my studies now.

97
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,212
Is something wrong? What's gotten into you?

98
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:32,305
Gosh. Follow me.

99
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,840
Hey.

100
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,090
Gi Hyun! Should I call an ambulance?

101
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:45,952
Hey!

102
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,388
Why are you buying so many books?

103
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,323
Look who's talking.

104
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,839
I started broadcasting on YouTube.

105
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,866
And since I don't visit the bookstore often,

106
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,425
I have to stock up when I have the chance.

107
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,211
I understand why you need books on video editing.

108
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:05,788
What are the English vocabulary books for?

109
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:09,117
I didn't know I needed them, but I do. Or...

110
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:10,210
should I buy a dictionary?

111
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,962
Hurry up and choose. We don't have time.

112
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:14,213
I need to go study.

113
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:18,234
- You're going to buy all that? 
 - Yes.

114
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,761
I'm going to study really hard this time

115
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,146
and become a civil servant. 
 - Me too.

116
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:30,664
I'm going to get more than a million viewers

117
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,982
and receive the Gold Play Button.

118
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:36,128
Gosh, I suddenly feel so motivated.

119
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:44,335
The shopping basket is full. What should I do?

120
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:46,112
 This is so heavy.

121
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,156
Ta-da!

122
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,148
I suddenly feel hungry.

123
00:05:56,148 --> 00:06:00,777
Guys, you're going to study all of that today?

124
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,887
Yes.

125
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:04,572
We're going to become regulars at this study cafe.

126
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,809
But first of all, let's go eat.

127
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:09,945
You're right. I'm hungry from all the walking. Let's eat.

128
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:11,855
Joo Ha went to get some hamburgers.

129
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:14,007
Should I call him?

130
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,167
Burgers sound good.

131
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,652
- I love burgers. 
 - Me too.

132
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,808
Hello?

133
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:27,246
You stupid. It's Kimha calling Joo Ha on the phone.

134
00:06:27,246 --> 00:06:28,580
Oh, right.

135
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,907
- Here. 
 - I'll just go.

136
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:32,967
- Two shrimp burgers, right? 
 - Yes.

137
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:34,353
- I'll be back. 
 - Thanks.

138
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,605
Hurry back. I feel dizzy from hunger.

139
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,257
Hey, let's study.

140
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:42,418

141
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,797
Stop mentioning him.

142
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:48,783
Why? Do you still like him?

143
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,636
When did I say I liked him?

144
00:06:51,636 --> 00:06:53,989
I even had a boyfriend back then too.

145
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:56,383
But you kept hitting on Nam Si Woo

146
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:59,711
so he quit the basketball team. Don't you remember?

147
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,838
What are you saying?

148
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,340
 I'll call you when your order is ready. Please wait over there.

149
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,175
May I take your order?

150
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,606
Excuse me.

151
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:16,502
- If you haven't chosen yet... 
 - Just wait already.

152
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,815
Just move over already.

153
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,699
What?

154
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:24,278
Oh, the person standing behind you is waiting.

155
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,438
- Hey, how old are you? 
 - Hey.

156
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:27,773
Let's just go.

157
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:29,732
There are people waiting behind us.

158
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:31,985
You're so annoying.

159
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,956
May I take your...

160
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,691
I'll have a shrimp burger value meal,

161
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:41,510
- and a bulgogi burger value... 
 - You're so handsome.

162
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,196
Sorry?

163
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,224
I see.

164
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:48,494
I'll have a bulgogi burger value meal,

165
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:51,621
and please change the coke to an iced coffee.

166
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,526
I'll pay by card.

167
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:58,111
Sorry?

168
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,955
- I'll pay with this. 
 - Oh.

169
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:02,273
Yes, sure.

170
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,572
I'll call you when your order is ready.

171
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,215
Okay.

172
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,984
Joo Ha.

173
00:08:14,436 --> 00:08:16,362
Wait.

174
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,923
You?

175
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:30,709
Did you come back from the art academy?

176
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,979
 Yes. I'm sorry I couldn't answer your call earlier.

177
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,281
It's okay.

178
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,857
I understand.

179
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:37,835
 Did you have dinner?

180
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:39,686
I'm about to now.

181
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,912
What about you?

182
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:43,106
 I don't have an appetite, and I'm too busy.

183
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,583
You should still eat.

184
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,785
Oh, right.

185
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:48,695
I can leave next week.

186
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,739
 Oh, really?

187
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:55,266
 All of my time is spent on you.

188
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:58,504
 It's time spent solely for you.

189
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,974
- I'll see you then. 
   - Si Woo.

190
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,359
  - I...  
 - Si Woo.

191
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:04,528
Hurry up and eat.

192
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:05,921
- I need to go. 
   - Okay.

193
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,422
I'll call you when I go home. Sorry.

194
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,324
Come and have dinner.

195
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:11,218
- Gosh. 
 - Man, I'm starving.

196
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,886
You're lucky your girlfriend even makes you food.

197
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:13,720
- You must be happy. 
 - Yes.

198
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,556
Hey. Didn't you say you have a girlfriend too?

199
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,449
When is she coming?

200
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:19,092
- She's busy. 
 - Whatever.

201
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,994
Si Woo's girlfriend is really hot.

202
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:24,129
- Really? 
 - Yes.

203
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:26,175
There was a reason he wasn't concentrating on his training.

204
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:28,151
Tell me about it.

205
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,320
When will we get girlfriends?

206
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,248

207
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:36,626
 I thought...

208
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:38,837
 you needed time for yourself, not for me.

209
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:40,963
 Right now,

210
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:43,575
 rather than spending time with you,

211
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:47,320
 I need more time for myself.

212
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,864
 What I needed was...

213
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:53,458
 not time, but you.

214
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,953

215
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,820
 But I guess you felt differently.

216
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,290
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

217
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,610
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

218
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,490
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

219
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,260
♫  At the end of one and only nineteen  ♫

220
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,841

221
00:10:16,841 --> 00:10:18,792
Hey.

222
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,922
Use your own phone to search. Why are you using mine?

223
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,956
Mine is a 2G phone.

224
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,238
By the way, ¿why is Joo Ha...

225
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:32,741
coming all the way here to study when he lives far away?

226
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:35,277
This isn't the only place he can come to study.

227
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:36,386
I know.

228
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,520
His house is only five minutes away from school.

229
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:47,690

230
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,966
I see.

231
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:52,284
- What? 
 - I see.

232
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,529
What's going on?

233
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:58,457
Go on and study.

234
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,526
Thank you.
