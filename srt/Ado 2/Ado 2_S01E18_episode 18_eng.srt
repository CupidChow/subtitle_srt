1
00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:03,586
Are you suspecting me just because

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:06,097
I did well on the exam?

3
00:00:06,097 --> 00:00:08,008
   

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,401
   

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,497
   

6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,521
You have five minutes.

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,364
Please fill in your OMR cards and get ready to hand them in.

8
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:48,028
 At times, desperation is cruel. 

9
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,486
Bo Ram's answers are always the same.

10
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,971
Good work on the exam.

11
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,006
Thank you.

12
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:57,432
- Do you think you did well?  
 - I failed.

13
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,352
Hey, Kimha. What was the answer to question seven?

14
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,305
Why bother asking when you didn't even answer it?

15
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:04,940
 The ominous feeling that things aren't going to turn out 

16
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:10,758
 the way you want them to makes you desperate. 

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,348
 The ominous feeling that you might not get what you want 

18
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:35,728
 makes you desperate. 

19
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:39,390
Min Ji, did you...

20
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:42,877
do well on the exam?

21
00:01:42,877 --> 00:01:44,321
I did.

22
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,564
Min Ji.

23
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:56,758
Guys.

24
00:01:56,758 --> 00:01:59,602
Have you thought about how we can advertise Doha's merchandise?

25
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:02,748
Hurry up and speak up. I have no time to waste.

26
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,567
Gosh, that sounds so weird coming from him.

27
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,653
I'm hungry.

28
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:09,938
Kimha.

29
00:02:09,938 --> 00:02:11,481
- Kimha. 
 - Yes?

30
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:13,391
Any ideas?

31
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:15,552
I'm sorry. I was distracted.

32
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,555
What's wrong with you guys? Can you please focus?

33
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,999
How about if we advertise it on the school's anonymous page?

34
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:22,384
The anonymous...

35
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:23,952
Oh, that's a good idea.

36
00:02:23,952 --> 00:02:25,162
What will you write?

37
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:27,939
- I'm not sure. 
 - Let's see.

38
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,253
Why are you here?

39
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,480
- Mind your own business. 
 - You little...

40
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,050
Go home and study, you idiot.

41
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,995
Hey, aren't you being too harsh on her?

42
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,289
So what? She's my sister.

43
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,267
You're right. She's your sister.

44
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,494
Come on! Focus!

45
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:51,922
What do you guys think about Joo Ha's suggestion?

46
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:55,125
- I like it. 
 - Yes, I like it too.

47
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,327
Hey, log in.

48
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,366
- Wait. 
 - Bo Ram.

49
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:04,101
His phone is too old to surf the web.

50
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,286
Hey, give that back.

51
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,425
I'll do it.

52
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,394
What should I write?

53
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,242
   

54
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,535
   

55
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,253
I've sent it.

56
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:33,179
Ah Hyun.

57
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,006
Yes?

58
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:41,003
Did you change your phone case? Where did you get it?

59
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:42,614
Oh, this? Isn't it pretty?

60
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:45,017
I got it online. Do you want me to give you the link?

61
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,768
Yes, please. It's freaking pretty.

62
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,578
One minute.

63
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,996
 Let's meet at the playground later. 

64
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:08,264
   

65
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:17,991
   

66
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,369
How did you know I was at the cafe?

67
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:23,305
I didn't go there because of you.

68
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,582
Bo Ram told me to come.

69
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,083
Did she?

70
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,311
- Why? 
 - Because you were...

71
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,400
I mean, because they sell delicious cakes there.

72
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,378
We didn't even have any cake.

73
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,240
Come on. That's not what's important right now.

74
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,474
Why haven't you been replying to my texts?

75
00:04:42,474 --> 00:04:44,685
How could you not give me a single reply?

76
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:45,978
And why haven't you been answering my calls?

77
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:47,454
Why did you suddenly leave that day?

78
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,720
- And back there... 
 - Ask me one at a time.

79
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,745
Fine.

80
00:04:57,322 --> 00:05:00,491
Why did you suddenly leave that day?

81
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:02,994
I went to see Kim Ha Na.

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,122
Then why haven't you been replying to my texts?

83
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:08,032
I'm really busy. I'm a senior.

84
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:11,303
What about my calls?

85
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:14,005
For the same reason.

86
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:18,285
Then

87
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,729
why did you side with me back there

88
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:23,122
when Gi Hyun was causing a fuss?

89
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:27,410
Just because. You're like my younger sister.

90
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,506
I'm Cha Gi Hyun's sister, not yours.

91
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,442
Then be my sister.

92
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:36,519
No, because then I won't be able to date...

93
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:40,774
I mean...

94
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:44,077
I want to be Bo Ram's younger sister.

95
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,931
I'm a bit hurt. I'd like you to be my younger sister.

96
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,333
You get hurt so easily.

97
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:57,707
Where are you going this time?

98
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:00,076
I'm going to study, of course.

99
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,496
But I haven't seen you in a while.

100
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,455
Bye.

101
00:06:04,455 --> 00:06:06,457
Wait.

102
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,603
I'm going to leave before you do.

103
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,487
Take this with you!

104
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:37,672
 We'll be playing soccer today, right? 
   

105
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:38,774
I'd rather play baseball.

106
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,492
No, we have to play soccer.

107
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:42,236
- How about you? 
 - I hate PE.

108
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,120
Hurry up and get changed so we can go outside.

109
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,489
Is a PE ghost bothering you or something?

110
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,124
You're always so eager for PE.

111
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:50,893
Don't mention ghosts in front of me.

112
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,974
Guys, I'll stay behind with Min Ji and lock the door.

113
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:57,643
You can all leave first.

114
00:06:57,643 --> 00:06:59,678
Why? Let's go together.

115
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:03,197
Okay. Let's head out first.

116
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:04,775
Hurry up. Let's go.

117
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:06,985
- Let's go. 
 - Come on.

118
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:08,862
I don't want to.

119
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:13,283
Min Ji.

120
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,303
I have a question.

121
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,840
I... need to stop by the restroom.

122
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,066
Wait.

123
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,985
Spare me a minute.

124
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,396
Stop avoiding me.

125
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:29,174
What is it?

126
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,318
Did you...

127
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:37,548
cheat on our English exam?

128
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,578
What are you talking about?

129
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:45,783
I think I saw you cheating.

130
00:07:45,783 --> 00:07:49,010
Are you sure you weren't seeing things

131
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,354
after tiring yourself out studying?

132
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:53,998
You should take care of your health.

133
00:07:56,527 --> 00:08:00,453
Also, that day,

134
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:04,526
my palm was dirty because it was stained with ink.

135
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,395
I didn't write anything on my palm.

136
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:10,131
Are we clear now?

137
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:11,850
I never

138
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:16,362
mentioned your palm.

139
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:22,310
I was right.

140
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,988
You did cheat, didn't you?

141
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,166
No, I didn't.

142
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,326
 Desperation turns people 

143
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,504
 into cruel individuals. 

144
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:35,949
Would you like to tell the teacher yourself?

145
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,710
I think it'd be best if you were the one to tell...

146
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,845
I didn't cheat.

147
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:43,356
If you don't tell the teacher,

148
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:47,385
I have no choice but to tell him myself.

149
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:53,290
I don't need to cheat to get a high score.

150
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,344
There's not even that much of a difference anyway.

151
00:08:57,229 --> 00:09:00,013
I doubt the teacher will believe you.

152
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:01,291
It's up to the teacher whether or not

153
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,085
to believe me.

154
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:07,188
Why are you doing this to me?

155
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:10,059
You know what will happen to me if you tell him.

156
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,985
I do know.

157
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:16,047
That's why I'm doing this.

158
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:18,007
Also,

159
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:21,712
I know

160
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:25,730
what will happen if you don't tell him.

161
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:29,586
Please. I'm begging you.

162
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:30,921
Just this once.

163
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:33,398
Could you turn a blind eye just this once?

164
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,909
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,045
I can't do that.

166
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:48,171
I tried my best!

167
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:55,219
I really gave it my all.

168
00:09:57,414 --> 00:09:59,565
But it still wasn't enough.

169
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,678
That's why I cheated.

170
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:07,412
I'm sure you did try your best.

171
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:14,138
But the moment you cheated,

172
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:20,161
you'd already started doubting your hard work.

173
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:24,374
Why couldn't you trust yourself

174
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,803
when you had given it your all?

175
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,431
 In the end, 

176
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,368
 desperation only makes you become cruel to yourself. 

177
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:38,813
I was studying. Why didn't he tell me sooner?

178
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:40,733
Why does he always make me bring his stuff?

179
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,684
- He's so forgetful. 
 - Let's get a hotdog.

180
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:43,519
A hotdog?

181
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,853
- I'm sorry. 
 - Let's go.

182
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,336
We got changed for nothing.

183
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,181
- What's going on? 
 - What is it?

184
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:59,367
- Are they fighting? 
 - It looks like it.

185
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:05,513
Are you suspecting me just because I did well on the exam?

186
00:11:05,513 --> 00:11:08,393
- Ha Na suspected her? 
 - I think so.

187
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:11,713
I know you think of me as your rival.

188
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,632
But isn't this going too far?

189
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,343
- Are they really fighting? 
 - What's going on?

190
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,745
What is everyone doing here?

191
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,155
- What's going on? 
 - It doesn't look good.

192
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:21,415
They're fighting.

193
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:25,200
And you flirt around with Joo Ha and Min.

194
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,478
- Aren't you that type of girl? 
 - Hey.

195
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,422
What are you saying...

196
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,557
Say that again.

197
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,775
You always copy what I do.

198
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,586
You always blame other people.

199
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:46,547
You're a liar who's toying with Joo Ha and Min!

200
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:57,625
Are you done?

201
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,512
Min Ji.

202
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,523
Is that all?

203
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,284
I copy everything you do and flirt with the boys.

204
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:07,576
Are those it?

205
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:09,329
I'm right.

206
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,398
- Last year, you and Min... 
 - Hey!

207
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,600
- Who is she? 
 - What is she doing?

208
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,130
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

209
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,380
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

210
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,130
    
 ♫  I'll be next you  ♫

211
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,090
♫  At the end of one and only nineteen  ♫

212
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,170
♫  999teen  ♫
