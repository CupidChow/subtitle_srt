1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:01,360
This lunatic is your younger sister?

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,070
This lunatic is your girlfriend?

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,424
   

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,784
   

5
00:00:10,702 --> 00:00:14,188
   

6
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:17,099
- Darn it. 
 - Gosh, you startled me.

7
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:18,644
My teacher keeps telling me to go to university.

8
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,445
But I want to become a YouTuber.

9
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:23,314
Of course, our teachers want us to go to university.

10
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,692
You could've just lied and said you will.

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,204
Hey. How can I go to university with these grades?

12
00:00:29,204 --> 00:00:30,439
The same goes for you too.

13
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:31,598
I'm going.

14
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,050
- What's your problem? 
 - What?

15
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,436
He has already picked out his university and major.

16
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,255
I'm going to study philosophy at Yeonri University.

17
00:00:39,255 --> 00:00:42,251
You? How? Did they say that they'd accept you?

18
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,168
I'll apply with the aptitude exam. 
  (T/N: A non-CSAT admission) 

19
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,353
They have three places and don't have minimum grade requirements. 
  (T/N: The lowest grades needed to be accepted) 

20
00:00:45,353 --> 00:00:46,988
What are you blabbering about?

21
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:48,682
Also, how could you possibly get into Yeonri University?

22
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,843
He's such an idiot, right?

23
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,603
I can get accepted if I apply with the aptitude exam.

24
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:55,247
Isn't that pretty much a miracle?

25
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:59,650
It'd be a miracle for you to be accepted there.

26
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,445
 The first thing I don't understand. 

27
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:04,422
 Why doesn't she believe in me? 

28
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:07,483
Hey, it's okay.

29
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,380
You're the best.

30
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,923
Right.

31
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,879
This is so fascinating to read.

32
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,440
Ha Na, are you reading about Seoyeon University?

33
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,042
Yes.

34
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,845
Why are you reading about Seoyeon University?

35
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:29,597
I see. You're trying to help her.

36
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:32,158
No. This is for me.

37
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,369
Come on, you're not even that studious.

38
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:36,455
You should also look into aptitude exams like me.

39
00:01:36,455 --> 00:01:38,457
Joo Ha did well on his mock exam this time.

40
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:39,925
He got Level One in Language.

41
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:41,485
- What did you say? 
 - What?

42
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,604
Didn't you see the rankings in the hallway?

43
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,538
No, I didn't.

44
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:49,375
We've never been interested in such things.

45
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,677
That's unbelievable.

46
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,047
Were you always like this?

47
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:56,425
I'm so disappointed.

48
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:57,576
Is this something to be disappointed about?

49
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,529
Why didn't you tell me you did well on the mock exam?

50
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,788
Why should I?

51
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:06,374
I thought we were close.

52
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:08,086
And?

53
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,055
It feels like we've become strangers again.

54
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,538
Anyone?

55
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,474
"Anyone"?

56
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,059
Sure, I can help you with that.

57
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,910
Incorrect answer.

58
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,796
He's asking if "anyone" wants to stay behind and study.

59
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,283
I drank this red ginseng to concentrate today.

60
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,818
Hey, what are you doing after school?

61
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,670
Do you want to study together?

62
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,988
I have to go to my art academy.

63
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,577
Do Ha Na, Nam Si Woo, and Ryu Joo Ha can't stay.

64
00:02:43,856 --> 00:02:46,616
Kim Ha Na, do you want to study with me?

65
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:47,601
Sure.

66
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,995
But I'm going to the library. Do you want to come?

67
00:02:50,995 --> 00:02:52,897
I'm going to study here.

68
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:55,075
From my experience,

69
00:02:55,075 --> 00:03:00,195
I can't focus at study cafes or libraries.

70
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:04,133
You have so many excuses.

71
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,694
 The second thing I don't understand. 

72
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:11,296
 Why does my girlfriend have a prejudice about me? 

73
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,513
This friend, this friend, and this friend can't come.

74
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,310
Do you want to study with me?

75
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,614
I have tutoring after school.

76
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:29,393
You must be preparing hard for the civil servant exam.

77
00:03:29,393 --> 00:03:31,904
No, I'm not. I'm going to study philosophy at Yeonri University.

78
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:33,672
I'm not going to become a civil servant.

79
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,133
I don't even have a smartphone. Do you see how determined I am?

80
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,710
What's gotten into him?

81
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,179
Don't you know that you need at least Level Two

82
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,663
or Level Three grades to get into Yeonri University?

83
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:44,007
That's exactly why I'm applying with the aptitude exam.

84
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:46,484
I'm preparing for it.

85
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:49,971
What's wrong with your boyfriend?

86
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:52,132
He's not my boyfriend.

87
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,000
I am.

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,195
- No, you're not. 
 - What are you writing down?

89
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,404
-"Gi Hyun, you can do it." 
 - Gosh, I have a headache.

90
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,847
"You need to take the aptitude exam."

91
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,724
Determination is what matters.

92
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:03,060
It won't last long, so snap out of it.

93
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,269
Determination is what matters when you're studying.

94
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:05,270
That's not true.

95
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,146
That's why I have that 2G phone.

96
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,789
Let's just go to an internet cafe.

97
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,599
No.

98
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,070
I thought you were going to stay behind and study.

99
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,863
I will, starting tomorrow.

100
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,983
By the way, are you really going to study at school?

101
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:22,045
Yes. Why?

102
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:23,096
You're insane.

103
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,989
What is it?

104
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:26,825
You know that rumor, right?

105
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:28,618
What rumor?

106
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,680
The rumor about a ghost at our school.

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,290
My gosh, I do know.

108
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,375
The top student was murdered by the one who came second.

109
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,422
Come on. Every school has that kind of rumor.

110
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:42,390
Aren't you the top student?

111
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,376
No, this happened a long time ago.

112
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:50,613
A long time ago, the second top student
 hated the top student so much

113
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:57,193
because the top student had a habit of clicking her pen.

114
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:06,103
During exam week, the top student would click her pen relentlessly.

115
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:07,549
It was too distracting.

116
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:13,986
So the second top student believed that was the reason she couldn't come first.

117
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:17,507
And then? What happened?

118
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:22,753
The top student was pushed from the rooftop.

119
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,850
That's ridiculous.

120
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,270
I'm serious.

121
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,997
That's why they say that if you study at school late at night,

122
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:35,158
you can hear the top student clicking her pen, trying to distract you.

123
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:38,412
 The third thing I don't understand. 

124
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:40,641
 Why does she try so hard to prevent me from studying? 

125
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:44,143
Hey, you're scared, right?

126
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,120
Are you scared?

127
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,381
About what? What? I'm not scared at all.

128
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,840
You're all scaredy-cats.

129
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,367
Such rumors don't faze me.

130
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:53,703
I'm going to study at school no matter what.

131
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:56,865
At this rate, he could catch up to me.

132
00:05:56,865 --> 00:05:59,401
I'm going to study even harder.

133
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,453
You're already studying too hard.

134
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:04,272
Yes. You should take a breather.

135
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:06,550
No, I need to study even harder.

136
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,643
I've found a major I like.

137
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:10,929
- A major you like? 
 - Yes.

138
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:13,314
Journalism and broadcasting.

139
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:16,067
I want to become a reporter.

140
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,836
No way.

141
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,947
Then Kimha, I have an idea.

142
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,093
Who is he?

143
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,845
You don't know CloudTemplar?

144
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,447
He used to be a professional gamer.

145
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:30,958
Make sure to get his autograph after we're done.

146
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,451
This is a historic day.

147
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,353
- If you're ready, we'll start. 
 - Okay.

148
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,799
Hello, everyone.

149
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm Yeo Bo Ram of "Yeo Bo Ram's Happy Day."

150
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,596
I'm Kim Ha Na, the reporter for the day.

151
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:47,449
Hello, I'm Lee Hyun Woo, also known as CloudTemplar,

152
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,383
the commentator for "League of Legends."

153
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:50,535
It's nice to meet you.

154
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:54,581
Today we will have a question and answer session

155
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,559
with CloudTemplar about game-related topics.

156
00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:01,221
Thank you so much for agreeing to join us.

157
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,682
Won Myeong told me so much about you.

158
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:05,342
He said you were his junior whom he loved so dearly.

159
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,303
I heard you had many concerns about becoming a YouTuber.

160
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,972
In the beginning,

161
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,499
we may all be rookies, just like Amumu here.

162
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,893
But once we grow bigger,

163
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,688
we will be able to conquer this world.

164
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,832
Then what was the driving force that helped you grow?

165
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:25,320
That's a very standard question.

166
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,223
Every moment and every second, I think about ways

167
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:31,485
to live a more trashy life.

168
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:33,203
- "Trashy"? 
 - You are

169
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,080
most definitely trash.

170
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,099
- Thank you. 
 - Hey, how could you say that?

171
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:39,234
- To someone older than you? 
 - What are you talking about?

172
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:42,145
I'm not old. I'm young trash.

173
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:44,739
You are so awesome.

174
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:49,511
Did you have any difficulties during your career?

175
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,072
   

176
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,653
Why do you keep calling me?

177
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:00,080
I'm a senior, so I have a tight schedule.

178
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,558
This is our first time meeting since we formed our alliance.

179
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,294
Why did you want to meet?

180
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:07,821
Tell me everything you've heard in detail.

181
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,649
Did Kim Ha Na really go to Joo Ha's house?

182
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:13,944
I mean, was it just those two? Just them?

183
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:15,120
I don't know.

184
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,663
How could you not?

185
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,373
I thought you and Kim Ha Na were close.

186
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:22,185
We are. But Gi Hyun is close to her too. Ask him.

187
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:23,578
Are you crazy?

188
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:26,772
I don't want to show my weakness to that idiot.

189
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,275
It wasn't just those two.

190
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,576
The others were there too.

191
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,728
Really?

192
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,546
Thank goodness.

193
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,125
Why do you like Joo Ha?

194
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,496
He's handsome.

195
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:44,082
"Tall, handsome, young and rich."

196
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:45,975
You know what I mean, right?

197
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:50,012
But what does "rich" mean?

198
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:53,165
I'm rich.

199
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,584
Really?

200
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:58,488
Objectively speaking, you're tall and handsome too.

201
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:00,831
But you're not my type.

202
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,109
I'm a bit hurt.

203
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:08,931
Why do you like Kim Ha Na?

204
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,576
She's not my type either.

205
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:12,769
She's a bit frustrating.

206
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,788
Just drink this.

207
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,700
I prefer coke to coffee.

208
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,019
Really? Then I'll drink it.

209
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,265
Next time, I'll get you coke.

210
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,683
No way.

211
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:29,711
You told me not to call you, but I guess we're meeting again.

212
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,746
I'm dumbfounded.

213
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,562
- Where did it go? 
 - What is it?

214
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:40,046
Did you lose your name tag again?

215
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,215
No, my transportation card.

216
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,999
Your transportation card?

217
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:54,928
Here. You need to stop being so clumsy.

218
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,799
It's not something I can control.

219
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:02,418
And if I lose it again, you can find it for me.

220
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,391
Let's go. I'll buy you coke on the way.

221
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:09,310
Really? Yes!

222
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,229
By the way, do you have a lot of money?

223
00:10:11,229 --> 00:10:14,381
No. I'm rich.

224
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,419
   

225
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:19,170
- What? 
 - What?

226
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,347
- What? 
 - How is it different from you doing YouTube?

227
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:24,292
That was out of the blue. Have you even watched my videos?

228
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,519
- Yes. 
 - Hey.

229
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,254
Are Kim Ha Na and I the same? Are we?

230
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,190
What is it this time? Isn't it great if you get a lot of views?

231
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,983
I'm so irritated. All the comments criticized me.

232
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:33,235
They want me to get lost.

233
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:35,070
So, why did you go out of your way to film with her?

234
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,404
You're so nosy.

235
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,106
What?

236
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:42,119
You were like this when I fought in the cafeteria last time.

237
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:44,579
And you're doing it again. Shouldn't you side with me?

238
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:47,615
Why should I take sides? I was just stating my opinion.

239
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:50,960
Are you even my boyfriend? Are you looking down on me?

240
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,146
You're the one who looked down on me first.

241
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:54,923
You said I wouldn't get into Yeonri University.

242
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:56,049
 What now? Do you feel guilty? 

243
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:58,443
 No, not at all. Why should I? 

244
00:10:58,443 --> 00:11:00,262
I know you feel guilty. You said I wouldn't get in.

245
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:02,389
- You looked down on me first! 
 - You did it first!

246
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:04,307
- It always starts with you! 
 - What?

247
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:05,684
- When did I do that? 
 - You always did it!

248
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:08,461
- Gosh. 
 -What are you doing here?

249
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:11,364
I'm in a serious situation right now.

250
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:14,399
- Go home first. 
- What is this?

251
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,503
Oh, right. She's my younger sister

252
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:18,496
and she's my girlfriend.

253
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:20,807
This lunatic is your younger sister?

254
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:24,268
This lunatic is your girlfriend?

255
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,897
Was it your sister who cut in line in the cafeteria?

256
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:30,517
Was it your girlfriend who grabbed her junior's hair?

257
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,127
Do you guys know each...

258
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:34,904
You must've been doing well all this time.

259
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:36,765
Why wouldn't I have been?

260
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:38,567
Let's not fight here.

261
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,493
Tell me whose side you're on.

262
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:42,471
Bo Ram, he's my brother.

263
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:44,389
Hey, he's my boyfriend.

264
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:45,765
I have a younger brother, so I know very well

265
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:47,450
how much siblings can hate each other.

266
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,560
 The fourth thing I don't understand. 

267
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,662
 Why is she doing this? 

268
00:11:50,662 --> 00:11:53,564
Hurry up! Whose side are you on?

269
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:55,792
That doesn't matter.

270
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,277
Is it that hard for you to decide?

271
00:11:57,277 --> 00:11:59,312
Why are you so indecisive?

272
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:01,281
- Why are you venting at me? 
 - Are you not siding with me

273
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:03,800
because we just had a fight?

274
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,244
You're so pathetic. What a cheap jerk.

275
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:07,979
I've never been in this kind of situation before.

276
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:09,372
You lack flexibility.

277
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:10,999
Isn't he so frustrating? How do you even date him?

278
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:13,376
- Just dump him. 
 - Hey.

279
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:14,920
Maybe I should.

280
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,771
What?

281
00:12:19,716 --> 00:12:21,001
You know what?

282
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:24,303
Gi Hyun roams around the house in his underwear.

283
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:26,514
 The fifth thing I don't understand. 

284
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:29,201
 How did they get so close? 

285
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:32,229
You know his grades dropped even more this time, right?

286
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:35,440
Of course, I do. People don't change.

287
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,817
If you're going to talk badly about me, do it elsewhere.

288
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:39,369
I need to study.

289
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:41,822
No, thanks. You can study elsewhere.

290
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:45,242
Exactly. You were the one who followed us here.

291
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:46,644
You said you'd study at school.

292
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:49,487
- Will you be able to go to Yeonri University like that? 
 - Never.

293
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:53,399
Fine, I'll leave. I'll go to school to study.

294
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:57,719
He's sulking.

295
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:59,480
How scary.

296
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,441
Are you... Hey!

297
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:02,943
I still don't get it.

298
00:13:02,943 --> 00:13:05,245
How is he planning to go to Yeonri University?

299
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:06,555
 I bet his determination 

300
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:08,390
  - will only last until tomorrow. 
 - I agree. 

301
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,441
 You don't get it? 

302
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:11,852
 Then I'll do this until you get it. 

303
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:15,020
- They have chocolates too. 
 - Chocolate?

304
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:17,630
- This is tasty. 
 - Yes, it is.

305
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,180
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

306
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,470
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

307
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,350
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

308
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:31,528
- Hey, Bo Ram. 
  - Kimha. 

309
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:33,415
- Is something wrong? 
   - Gi Hyun 

310
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:36,333
  - has gone missing!  
 - What?
