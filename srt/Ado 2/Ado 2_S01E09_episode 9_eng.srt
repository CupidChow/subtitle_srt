1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:03,303
Why do you always talk that way?

2
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:07,341

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,400

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,977
Joo Ha.

5
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,079

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,547
- Wait. 
 - You?

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,236
Did you come here to eat?

8
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:20,303
No.

9
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:22,856
I came to order shrimp burgers for the others.

10
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,058
You should've called me.

11
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,727
You left your phone behind.

12
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,728
Right.

13
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,722
I'll have two more shrimp burgers to go, please.

14
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:33,015
It's her again?

15
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:34,517
Sorry?

16
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,211
It's nothing.

17
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,973
- I'll prepare them right away. 
 - Okay.

18
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,358
Please wait over there.

19
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:50,990

20
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:59,024
Do you know that girl who was standing behind the counter?

21
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:01,794
I do know her,

22
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:04,489
but just her face, and not her name.

23
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,934
How could you know her when you don't even know her name?

24
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,763
Actually, before you transferred to our school,

25
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:12,347
we had a fight in the cafeteria.

26
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:14,174
You know how to fight too?

27
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,292
It somehow happened.

28
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:20,680
You're the top student in our school and you like to fight.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,257
We haven't even taken our midterms yet.

30
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:23,692
I'm not the top student.

31
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:26,320
Stop calling me that. It makes me uncomfortable.

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,513
- Okay. 
 - Hey, top student.

33
00:01:28,513 --> 00:01:29,590
Seriously.

34
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,841
Where have you guys been?

35
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,242
We went to buy markers.

36
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,971
Seeing Kimha drink coffee

37
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,631
reminds me that it's really the exam period.

38
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,403
Let's study hard. It hurts.

39
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:47,400

40
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:51,052
Hey, I'll ask you a question.

41
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:54,272
"What is the correct topic for the following passage?"

42
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:55,949
The choices are, number one...

43
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,692
Number three.

44
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,121
What? How did you know? I didn't even read them out.

45
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,589
Aren't those the sample questions the teacher gave us?

46
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,734
This is unbelievable.

47
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:08,194
How did you memorize all that?

48
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,639
You must really stink at studying too.

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,358
Hey. You stink too. Just leave him alone.

50
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:15,501
I'm just checking how good he is.

51
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,295
He's my only competitor.

52
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:20,223
Friendly competition is always helpful.

53
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,700
Competition?

54
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,562
 The good thing about having a competitor...

55
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,813
No, I don't want to.

56
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,798
 is that you get to try harder.

57
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:31,509
Fine.

58
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:39,000
Ha Na.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,535
Good luck on the exam.

60
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:42,771
Thank you. You too.

61
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,464
 But there's one thing to remember.

62
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,391
 One person...

63
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:48,668
 must always lose.

64
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:53,465
It's not because I want to eat it.

65
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,142
But if I remember correctly, you can't eat chocolate.

66
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,719
You must be happy you did well on the exam. Congratulations.

67
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,720
Thanks.

68
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,890
Hi.

69
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,534
Min, how was the exam?

70
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,096
Well, not bad.

71
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:27,182
I'm glad. It was your first exam after you changed majors.

72
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:29,993
I guess it's easy for you after I switched to natural sciences.

73
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:31,628
You'll come in first place again this time.

74
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,648
No. The midterms aren't even over yet.

75
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,241
Stop calling me the top student.

76
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:39,402
What else should I call you when you are the top student?

77
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,330
Are you trying to be modest or what?

78
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,998
Hey.

79
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,935
Why do you always talk that way?

80
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,177
He's still a nice guy.

81
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:56,945
She's right.

82
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:00,432
He does speak in an annoying manner, but he's kind.

83
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:04,835
You silly. Why are you still wearing that broken watch?

84
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,971
I'm going to fix it.

85
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:08,965
What is this?

86
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,125
What?

87
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,893
Oh, my. Joo Ha.

88
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:13,345
You too?

89
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:14,588
Me too.

90
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,006
It was his first exam after he transferred,

91
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,991
and he didn't learn everything properly yet.

92
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,344
Still, you got several questions right at the beginning.

93
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,271
I knew it.

94
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:25,224
Tomorrow is the math exam anyway.

95
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,475
Can't we just hang out at Joo Ha's house?

96
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,260
No, the exams aren't over yet.

97
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,287
I can't go either then.

98
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:33,848
What do you mean?

99
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:35,025
She just said no.

100
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,902
Let us go to Joo Ha's house!

101
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,196
I want to play PlayStation too.

102
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:42,957
Why are you asking me? It's his place.

103
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:45,293
We can't because Kim Ha Na said no.

104
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:48,655
Come on, please!

105
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,958
Come on. Just this once.

106
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,883
Can you play this all night since you live alone?

107
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,361
I envy you.

108
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,685
Can I really broadcast this on my channel?

109
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,194
Of course!

110
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:13,713
Really? For real?

111
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:17,391
Stop what you're doing.

112
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:19,085
Did you two...

113
00:05:19,678 --> 00:05:22,138
subscribe to my YouTube channel?

114
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,373
You guys really subscribed, right?

115
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,333
I did.

116
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,318
Then, why aren't you writing any comments?

117
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:38,278
Tell everyone at your art academy what my YouTube channel is.

118
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:39,673
Got it?

119
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,650
There's no need for that.

120
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,427
Just send the link through Kakao Talk.

121
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,304
Even your friends at your previous school.

122
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,015
Send the link to them, and send it to your family too.

123
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,584
Gosh, at this rate,

124
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:54,178
I won't be able to catch up to my rival.

125
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:56,397
Hey, come over here.

126
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,797
This is your rival?

127
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,032
Yes.

128
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:09,827
Kimha told me that I should set a big goal.

129
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,022
That's not a rival.

130
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:15,099
It's just your goal.

131
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,443
Whatever.

132
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,654
Like Kimha said...

133
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:21,848
 The good thing about having a competitor...

134
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,530
 is that you'll have a positive goal.

135
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,290
this is my goal.

136
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,997
I need to get the hang of this.

137
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:35,136

138
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:36,955
Oppa!

139
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:38,648
Oppa?

140
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:42,502
Really? Thank you so much, oppa.

141
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,820
Oppa?

142
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,480
Okay, Oppa.

143
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,392
Then I'll see you on Saturday.

144
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,107
Hey. You need to come here with me on Saturday and play games.

145
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:56,875
You startled me.

146
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,502
Oh, I'm sorry.

147
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,196
 But there's one thing to remember.

148
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:05,306
 It might make you... feel a bit upset.

149
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:09,279

150
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,291
 Saturday

151
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,168
She should be here playing games with me.

152
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:23,568

153
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,462

154
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:29,232

155
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:35,446
You're so excited to meet Won Myeong, right?

156
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,060
Hey.

157
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,096
What on earth are you doing here?

158
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,648
I told you I'd come here to study today.

159
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:49,985
I'm just cooling my head off for a second.

160
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:51,805
Go cool your head off at your place.

161
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,432
I don't have a PlayStation at home.

162
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,226
How do I upgrade this?

163
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:01,072
Press R1 and go into the menu.

164
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:02,391
Where's Bo Ram?

165
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:04,509
I don't know.

166
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:07,087
Isn't it today? The day she's supposed to be meeting that guy.

167
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,340
- Was it Choi Won Myeong? 
 - She's not meeting him today.

168
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,750
Hey.

169
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,352
Why do you hate him so much?

170
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,913
Because of him, Bo Ram found out that I liked her.

171
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:19,942
Isn't that a good thing?

172
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:22,310
No, it isn't!

173
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,614
Actually, it did turn out well eventually.

174
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:27,858
But...

175
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:31,127
I asked Bo Ram out impulsively while I was trying to stop him

176
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,729
from asking her for her number.

177
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:35,782
- You did? 
 - But you must know

178
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:39,460
that I did it romantically, so it didn't sound impulsive.

179
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,346
Do you want the full story?

180
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,748
What? What is it?

181
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:45,984
Later, if you're thinking about

182
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,537
asking Kim Ha Na out, come ask me for advice.

183
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:53,099
I'll coach you. You may be better than me at games,

184
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,068
- but I'm better with the ladies. 
 - Do you think...

185
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,012
I like Kim Ha Na?

186
00:08:58,012 --> 00:08:59,706
Don't you?

187
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,209
Forget it then.

188
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,254
Kim Ha Na is a very popular girl.

189
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,790
Who else likes her?

190
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,719
Last year, something was fishy between her and Min.

191
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:17,181
Both of them have good grades and seem like model students.

192
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:19,852
Oh, I see.

193
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:22,987
Yes. Even a slow-witted guy like me noticed it.

194
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:26,199
But I really had no idea about Si Woo and Do Ha Na.

195
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,360
Si Woo is always like,

196
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,254
"It's nothing. Forget it." I really don't understand

197
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:33,806
how he asked her out.

198
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,878
He still takes Do Ha Na to the art academy every Friday.

199
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:41,639
I admire him. He's truly amazing.

200
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,041
 Joo Ha.

201
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,034

202
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:48,270
Joo Ha has... increased the chroma of this cherry.

203
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,583
He emphasized the main point very well.

204
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,676
What is this?

205
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:56,305
Wait. Whose is this? Who drew this cartoon?

206
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:59,124
There is no dimension in this drawing at all.

207
00:09:59,124 --> 00:10:01,042
Is this your finished drawing?

208
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:02,586
Yes.

209
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:05,063
How could you call this a finished drawing?

210
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,215
It's incomplete.

211
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:10,017
You shouldn't draw like this if you want to go to art school.

212
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:12,395
Then how?

213
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:14,031
There are rules.

214
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,825
There are certain things that colleges require of you.

215
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,377
Why are you just ignoring that?

216
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:23,313
If you're going to prepare for art school like this, 
 just keep it as a hobby.

217
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:27,318
Everyone, this is an example of drawing as a hobby.

218
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:30,122
On the other hand, look at Joo Ha's drawing.

219
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:32,249
It's different, right?

220
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:35,569
If you keep drawing like this,

221
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:39,956
you'll never make it, no matter how long it takes. Got it?

222
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,718
Seo Yeong.

223
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:46,145
I like that bold color of the leaf. Good job.

224
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,214
Da Hye, let's see.

225
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:50,341
 There's one thing to remember...

226
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,327
 when you have a competitor.

227
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:18,175
 Sometimes, you end up giving up on competing.

228
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:40,649
Do Ha Na.

229
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,302
Where are you going?

230
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,353
I'm going to quit.

231
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:46,281
I'll see you at school.

232
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:56,847
 There is... another thing to remember.

233
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,527

234
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,646

235
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,881

236
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:13,266

237
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,526

238
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,803

239
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,422

240
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:29,698
 In order to start another competition,

241
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:32,493
 you have to give up...

242
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:35,046
 something else.

243
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,503
 Hello?

244
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:43,846
When do you have time?

245
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,760
I have something to say.

246
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,380
♫ To not regret the choice of day ♫

247
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,700
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

248
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,260
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

249
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:57,318
 How could you say you like me in front of everyone else?

250
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,470
 What will you do from tomorrow?

251
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,098
 Are you going to pretend like nothing happened?

252
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:02,533
 No, I can't do that.

253
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:03,617

254
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,343
 Then what?

255
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:11,910
- Say something! 
 - What do you want me to say?

256
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:24,470
Go out with me.

257
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:29,742
If you go out with me,

258
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,603
I'll go with you to the internet cafe every day.

259
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,880
And I'll even be your bot lane duo.

260
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,775
And if you go out with me, you'll never be bored.

261
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,823
Is that so?

262
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:49,043
But if I go out with you, we'll have to be a bot lane duo?

263
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:50,513
Yes.

264
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:54,433
But you suck.

265
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,546
You're right.

266
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,382
I do suck.

267
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,788
Bo Ram, where are you going?

268
00:14:07,998 --> 00:14:11,559
Aren't you going to be my bot lane duo?

269
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,464
Let's go.

270
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:21,911
It's okay to lean on me...

271
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:23,980
but I'll kill you if you pick Bard.

272
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,833
Okay. I'll pick Alistar.

273
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,218
You're too close.

274
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:29,261
Stop clinging to me.
