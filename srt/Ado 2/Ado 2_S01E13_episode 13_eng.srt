1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,090

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,258

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,420
Is he smart?

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,431
He got Level 1 for Language this time.

6
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:16,891
He's too perfect.

7
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,427
Then what's his hobby?

8
00:00:19,427 --> 00:00:21,179
- Playing games, probably. 
 - What?

9
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,174
I don't need another Cha Gi Hyun.

10
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:26,193
What else? What more do you know?

11
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,779
Is this why you suggested an alliance?

12
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,889
Yes. Hold on.

13
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:33,633
I have more questions to ask.

14
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,393
Then how about this?

15
00:00:35,393 --> 00:00:39,339
His art academy is nearby. I'll take you there.

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,566
What do you say?

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,172
Come to think of it, you and Gi Hyun look alike.

18
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,532
No, we don't.

19
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:50,333
All right, then.

20
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,862
By the way, how did you three come here together?

21
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:57,480
I'm not sure. We just met in front of the academy.

22
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,027
Why am I here for Gi Hyun?

23
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,504
Are you sure he's in there?

24
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:04,131
Since when couldn't you reach him?

25
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,216
I don't know, but I know that he's in there.

26
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:07,985
He only studies at school these days.

27
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,002
I see.

28
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,279
Then let's go inside.

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,697
- Let's go. 
 - All right.

30
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,031
Can you climb over this?

31
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,616
- Shall we see if that opens? 
 - Yes.

32
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:18,711
- It opens. 
 - Hey, it opens.

33
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,331
Hold on. Are you sure we're allowed to enter?

34
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,442
- It's fine. 
 - It's okay if we're not caught.

35
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,354
Wait.

36
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,850
Cha Gi Hyun!

37
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,536
Hey!

38
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:36,863
Where on earth is he?

39
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,993
- It's pitch-black. 
 - Right?

40
00:01:40,993 --> 00:01:42,953
- Come on. 
 - Why is he studying here?

41
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:44,838
- It's so dark at night, right? 
 - Cha Gi Hyun.

42
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,106
- Yes. 
 - Where is he?

43
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,266
When will we find him?

44
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,168
Let's split up and look for him.

45
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:52,212
That sounds like a good idea.

46
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,031
Hey, wait a minute.

47
00:01:57,434 --> 00:01:59,844
You don't think there are ghosts here, right?

48
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:01,480
No way, do you mean the ballpoint pen ghost?

49
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,856
Yes, do you know the story as well?

50
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,708
Of course, it's famous.

51
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,785
Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps.

52
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:09,304
Let's go.

53
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:12,107
Let's split up into teams of two and three.

54
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:13,967
- I'll go with Joo Ha... 
 - I'm going with you two.

55
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,804
- What? But... 
 - I'm really scared!

56
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,974
So it'll be the three of you and the two of us, right?

57
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,768
- Yes. 
 - Let's go inside.

58
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,361
Okay.

59
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,681
I'm coming for you, Gi Hyun.

60
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,258
- Let me go. 
 - No, no! Don't let go.

61
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:32,368
Let's hurry up and find him.

62
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,502
Where in the world is he?

63
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:42,170
I thought he was studying here.

64
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,905
I guess he disappeared.

65
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:46,274
Maybe he ran away.

66
00:02:46,274 --> 00:02:47,543
Are you not scared?

67
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:51,079
Oh, I don't get frightened by things like this.

68
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,397
That's a surprise.

69
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:54,257
Is he in here?

70
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,351
Gi Hyun.

71
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,006
Where did he go?

72
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:03,124
Gi Hyun.

73
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:06,102
Is he not in here either?

74
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:09,656
What is that?

75
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:18,873
Do you think that the ghost dropped it?

76
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:20,758
No way.

77
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,690
Are you scared?

78
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,559
Yes, I am.

79
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,146
I do this often when I zone out.

80
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,382
- Me too. Give it here. 
 - Sure.

81
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,746
- Are you scared? 
 - No.

82
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:44,307
- You're not? 
 - No.

83
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:08,956
Come on! Look for him quickly but slowly.

84
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:16,339
Are you not scared?

85
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,225
Scared of what?

86
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,676
This isn't scary at all.

87
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:22,170
I'm terrified.

88
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,322
I think there will be a ghost.

89
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:28,109
It's all in your head.

90
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:33,530
 Had I not known about it, I wouldn't be imagining it.

91
00:04:38,996 --> 00:04:41,464
Did... Did you...

92
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:43,458
Did you hear that?

93
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,586
Hear... Hear what?

94
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:50,955
 It would've been less scary.

95
00:04:50,955 --> 00:04:53,334
I'm talking about that sound.

96
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,204
I dozed off.

97
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,400
That was a long nap.

98
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,883
Wait.

99
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,868
Is it a blackout?

100
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:31,163
What? What's wrong with my phone?

101
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,272
- Cha Gi Hyun. 
 - Gi Hyun.

102
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,963
Seriously, where is Gi Hyun?

103
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:49,249
Can I just go home?

104
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:52,126
Stop being ridiculous!

105
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:55,688
Hey, walk a bit slowly.

106
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,940
- Hey. 
 - Oh, gosh.

107
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,418
See? The sound is getting louder.

108
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:04,063
Why are all the lights out?

109
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,936
I think we came here before.

110
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:11,721
Don't say that!

111
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:15,399
He's right.

112
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:24,743
I keep hearing it!

113
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,213
Isn't it coming from behind?

114
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,015
Come on!

115
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:40,634
There's nothing behind us!

116
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:44,540
- You're right! 
 - There's nothing behind...

117
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,598
Mommy!

118
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,087
What the heck?

119
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,183
I'm sorry I scared you.

120
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:24,511
Why did you do that?

121
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:28,072
We thought you were a ghost!

122
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,483
Do I look like one?

123
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,310
- Slightly? 
 - By the way,

124
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,228
what was that pen-clicking sound anyway?

125
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:35,062
Oh, that.

126
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:38,691
- We found this. 
 - Yes.

127
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,636
Stop that!

128
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:43,905
Stop what?

129
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:45,857
- This? 
 - Hey.

130
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:48,868
Stop it. She's scared.

131
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,715
Are you all right?

132
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:07,303
Get up.

133
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,475
Let's just look for him together.

134
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:13,276
Did you check Class 3?

135
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:15,721
Weren't you guys there?

136
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:17,297
No, we weren't.

137
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,249
We thought you guys did.

138
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,502
Then let's check it out.

139
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,154
Let's go.

140
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:33,321
All right, Gi Hyun.

141
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:35,315
You can do this.

142
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,327
You can do this. You can...

143
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:43,356
You can do this.

144
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,060
You can do this.

145
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,000
You can do this. You can do this.

146
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,680
Gi Hyun!

147
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,207
- Gi Hyun! 
 - What's going on?

148
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,959
- Gi Hyun! 
 - Hey, what's wrong?

149
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,686
- What's wrong with him? 
 - Gi Hyun, wake up!

150
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,771
- What's going on? 
 - I think he fainted!

151
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,757
- Wake him up! 
 - Shouldn't we call an ambulance?

152
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:26,074
Gi Hyun!

153
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:27,559
Gi...

154
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,809
Hey! Cha Gi Hyun!

155
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:41,055
- Cha Gi Hyun! Hey, wake up! 
 - Gi Hyun!

156
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:42,975
Why is it so sore?

157
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:44,251
You jerk.

158
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,529
I couldn't even reach you. Do you know how worried I was?

159
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,658
It's just that studying at school helps me focus more.

160
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:56,726
Also, you and Ah Hyun teased me for being stupid.

161
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:59,724
Are you saying you did the right thing?

162
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,985
No, I'm sorry.

163
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:04,379
Hey, why are you here?

164
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:06,514
You're asking me that now?

165
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:08,850
Did you bring her?

166
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,194
No.

167
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,071
She came with me.

168
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,881
Why?

169
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:18,577
Come on, what's it to you whom I came here with?

170
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,913
How dare you talk rudely to your older brother?

171
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,573
Look at that rude brat! Hey, come here!

172
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:27,693
Hey! There's a ghost behind you, you jerk!

173
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:31,147
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I am.

174
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,909
So that's how siblings fight.

175
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:36,760
I've never seen it in real life before.

176
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,171
By the way, why do you think people are afraid of ghosts?

177
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:45,194
That's because they don't know for sure if they truly exist.

178
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:54,292
Some people say that ghosts do exist, while others say they don't.

179
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:57,357
A ghost is a ghost.

180
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,017
Don't make it too complicated.

181
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:08,534
What do you think? Do I look scary?

182
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,411
You look cute.

183
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:12,998
Is this scary?

184
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:15,083
I guess it could be.

185
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,140

186
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,876

All the comments are about Kimha and CloudTemplar.

187
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,713
 CloudTemplar is trash! 
 CloudTemplar is being himself

188
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:29,231
 Kim Ha Na is so pretty.

189
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,633
 She's so much prettier than Yeo Bo Ram.

190
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:35,587
I'm... I'm ugly? My gosh.

191
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:37,322
 Seriously. Kim Ha Na is my type.

192
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,374
 I know. She's gorgeous.

193
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:41,435
 Can't she replace Bo Ram?

194
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,161
 Bo Ram is ugly anyway.
 Who wants Ha Na to replace her?

195
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,229
 Does Ha Na have a YouTube channel?

196
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:45,455
 I want to subscribe. 
 I will subscribe for sure.

197
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,140
 I'll choose Ha Na over Bo Ram any day.

198
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,042
 She's so gorgeous. 
 She's dazzling.

199
00:11:58,568 --> 00:11:59,845

200
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,864
 Hello, this is Yeo Boram.

201
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:04,875
 You all left many comments about my friend.

202
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,252
 But she just helped me out for that one day.

203
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:08,996
 She has no plans to create her own channel.

204
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:14,275
 So I'd appreciate it if you stopped mentioning her.

205
00:12:16,461 --> 00:12:17,404
You startled me.

206
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,114
Tie your hair up, will you?

207
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,873
Why?

208
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,434
What were you up to?

209
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:23,685
Oh, right.

210
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:25,938
People wanted to know if you had a channel as well.

211
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:27,480
A channel?

212
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,370
- CloudTemplar. 
 - I see.

213
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,772
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I am.

214
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,676
Ha Na.

215
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,453
The teacher wants to talk to you.

216
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:44,013
Oh, okay.

217
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,290
So many students are like her.

218
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,601
They come back teary-eyed after talking with the teacher.

219
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:01,355
Bo Ram, I'll be back.

220
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:03,942
Good luck. Kimha, good luck!

221
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,494
For journalism and broadcasting at Seoyeon University!

222
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,245
I can do it.

223
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,090
 Why is everyone ganging up on her?

224
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,566
 I don't like Boram. 
 She seems rude.

225
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:20,726
 Just delete your channel.

226
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:24,212
"Delete"? These scumbags...

227
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:26,073

228
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,416

229
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,827
Hey, are you sure about saying that?

230
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:32,312
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,

231
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,772
and a malicious comment for a malicious comment.

232
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,994
What are you doing? Give that back.

233
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:41,045
I knew it.

234
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:42,955
Knew what?

235
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,293
Why are you replying to them?

236
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,752
It won't do you any good.

237
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:50,555
Hey.

238
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,741
If you're my boyfriend...

239
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:56,227
 Had I not known

240
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:59,314
 and not seen it, it would've been better.

241
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:00,765
Forget it.

242
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:02,276
Give it back if you're not going to stand up for me.

243
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:04,528
Just ignore them.

244
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:07,713
 Had that been the case, I would've been less disappointed.

245
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:11,018
How can I just ignore them when this seems unfair?

246
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,504
Exactly! So don't read them!

247
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:16,632
Why are you getting mad? I'm already upset enough!

248
00:14:16,632 --> 00:14:20,468
- How could I not get mad? 
 - Stop yelling!

249
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:23,638
- Darn it. 
 - Hey, Gi Hyun!

250
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:29,666
 I am just scared, that's all.

251
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,528
He's probably just worried about you.

252
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:44,083
Guys.

253
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,965
I don't think

254
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,311
I can get into Seoyeon University.

255
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,990
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

256
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,390
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

257
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,410
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

258
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,935
By the way, you do look like a ghost.

259
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:12,662
Do I?

260
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,289
- Darn it! 
 - When I do this?

261
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,791
- I'm going to swear at you. 
 - No!

262
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,968
You already look like a ghost to begin with.

263
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:21,287
Really?

264
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,382
I don't think she looks like one right now.

265
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,703
You're wrong. I ran into her on my way to the restroom.

266
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:30,080
I almost fainted like you did back there.

267
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,814
What?

268
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:34,242
I didn't go to the restroom.

269
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:37,087
What do you mean? We ran into each other.

270
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:38,914
You ignored me when I said hi.

271
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:42,384
No, I really didn't go. Right?

272
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:43,369
She's right.

273
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:45,429
She was with me the whole time.

274
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:48,532
Hey, stop teasing us.

275
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:49,608
But...

276
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:53,540
I saw you in the restroom on the second floor.

277
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,960
- Hey. 
 - Oh, come on.

278
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,629
- Hurry up! We're late! 
 - What is he saying?

279
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,130
Hey, there are no such things as ghosts.
