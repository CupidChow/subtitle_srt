1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,478
I'm going to repeat a year.

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,382

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,575

4
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:14,250

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,990

6
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,167
Why aren't you going inside?

7
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,369
Oh, I'm about to.

8
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,646
- Come on. 
 - Okay.

9
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:47,897
Here you go.

10
00:00:48,523 --> 00:00:51,743
- Thanks for the drink. 
 - Sure.

11
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,630
Here.

12
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,233
Thanks. It'll help me focus.

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,308
- I'll read the question. 
 - Okay.

14
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:19,829
What is Yangmingism's argument against Zhu Xi's ideas?

15
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,839
The argument that the principle can be found in one's mind.

16
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,317
Are we moving onto English now?

17
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:26,761
No. I'm done studying for that. Let's continue studying this.

18
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:27,988
You're done with English?

19
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:28,964
Yes.

20
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,575
But I still need to study more for Ethics and Ideology.

21
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:33,768
It's your turn now.

22
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,647
Oh, right.

23
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:39,091
I have a question.

24
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:40,384
What is it?

25
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:42,077
Are you close to Kim Min Ji?

26
00:01:42,077 --> 00:01:43,345
No.

27
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:46,456
We became closer this year after being in the same class. Why?

28
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:49,275
Well... About her...

29
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,470
Right? Doesn't she seem strange today?

30
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,722
Did you see something?

31
00:01:53,722 --> 00:01:57,008
I think she's caught on.

32
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:58,660
What do you mean?

33
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:04,024
You mean about our secret relationship?

34
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:07,085
Be quiet. Someone might hear you.

35
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,454
Lots of kids from our school come here.

36
00:02:09,454 --> 00:02:11,965
How was she strange today?

37
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,842
She kept looking at us.

38
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,436
And you followed me out when I was leaving back then.

39
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:20,264
I'm pretty sure she's caught on.

40
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:26,254
By the way, why were you just standing there earlier?

41
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:30,815
Min Ji was taking pictures of your notes.

42
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,169
What?

43
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:37,480
That's why I stood there and watched her.

44
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,267
I see.

45
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,313
Maybe she forgot to write down something during class.

46
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:44,681
Still,

47
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:48,668
it would've been nicer if she had asked.

48
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,479
It wouldn't have been nicer.

49
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,182
That's what she should've done.

50
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,618
It's okay.

51
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:58,311
I understand.

52
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,396
Let's go inside.

53
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:07,546
 I'll see you in the study room.

54
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:12,008
 What are you doing? I still have tons of questions I don't get.

55
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,328
 Where are you going?

56
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,014
 I'll get going first. Sorry.

57
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,131
Hey! If you want to sigh, go and sigh in your room.

58
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,207
You're not even studying.

59
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:42,247
Hey, do you have any friends who could tutor me?

60
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:45,149
You have smart friends.

61
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:48,887
I'd feel terrible asking them to tutor you.

62
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:50,789
You're too stupid.

63
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:53,442
Hey, I'm not joking. I'm being serious.

64
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,460
I'm going to study hard.

65
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,953
Really?

66
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:59,756
There is Kim Ha Na, the top student.

67
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:01,316
No, not her.

68
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:03,350
She's a bit...

69
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:09,364
You see, Ha Min taught me so well last time.

70
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:10,275
How about asking him?

71
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:12,577
Min is pretty studious...

72
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:15,439
Hold on. He taught you before?

73
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,665
Yes.

74
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:18,075
When did you two study together?

75
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:20,828
Why are you shouting at me? You're so annoying.

76
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,204
It can't be him!

77
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:24,130
Why not?

78
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,232
He's...

79
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,076
He's studying with Kim Ha Na.

80
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:32,355
What are you looking at?

81
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,924
You have a horrible temper.

82
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,804
I've given up on my grades.

83
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:40,781
I've hit rock bottom.

84
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,457
I can't go up either.

85
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:45,627
Cha Gi Hyun. A student should not give up.

86
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:50,213
That's what you do when you count cabbages.

87
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:51,500
That's not funny.

88
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,609
Get out.

89
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:54,570
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,540
I'm a funny man. You know that, right?

91
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:03,061
Sir, can you hear me out?

92
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:04,796
A is a girl.

93
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:07,999
B is a boy and C is my...

94
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:12,178
I mean, C is another boy.

95
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,481
A is C's younger sibling.

96
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,091
B is friends with C.

97
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:19,077
So is A Ah Hyun

98
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:21,287
and C you?

99
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,348
Yes.

100
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:26,693
And Ah Hyun likes B?

101
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,778
I'm not sure about that.

102
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:31,781
But they study together.

103
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,317
I think they're texting behind my back too.

104
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:36,487
You were worried that she wasn't studying enough.

105
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:39,364
She can date and study. Isn't that great?

106
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:41,316
I can't allow that.

107
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:42,593
Why not?

108
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,419
I know for sure

109
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:47,014
that my stupid sister will get hurt by this unrequited love.

110
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,191
Look at you.

111
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:52,227
Then you can act as the middle man

112
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,987
so that it won't be unrequited love.

113
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,005
I don't want to.

114
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:56,799
You don't like anything.

115
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:59,734
You must have an O.A. to this.

116
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,761
Excuse me?

117
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:05,423
This is what the cool kids say these days. What do you think?

118
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:08,559
I see. Well...

119
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:11,038
- You really helped me today. 
 - Good.

120
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,347
But...

121
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:16,183
I'd appreciate it

122
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:17,569
if you didn't call me over for counseling again.

123
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:18,854
Get out.

124
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:19,947
Okay.

125
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,664
Get out, now.

126
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:25,110
Joo Ha, did you take notes for this part?

127
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,845
- Me? 
 - Yes.

128
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,888
You know I'm lazy when it comes to taking notes.

129
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,440
Really?

130
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,392
Then I should ask Min Ji.

131
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,794
Do you think she will show you her notes?

132
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,379
Of course.

133
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:41,827
Min Ji.

134
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:45,571
Could you show me your notes for this part?

135
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,190
- Sure. Hold on. 
 - Okay.

136
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,025
- Here. 
 - Thanks.

137
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,863
- See? She lent me her notes. 
 - You were right.

138
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:09,236

139
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:14,175
 Things that you don't know for certain

140
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,587
 should never be overlooked.

141
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:18,721
Next.

142
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:20,790
Page 180.

143
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,609
Study this page thoroughly.

144
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,987
Make sure you translate them as well, okay?

145
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,350
- Yes. 
 - Good.

146
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,290
Even if you only study the ones I'm telling you about,

147
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,567
- you'll get 50% right tomorrow. 
 - Oh, yes.

148
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:44,639
She's pretty much telling us to study everything.

149
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,909
It's like buy one, get one free. It's a trick.

150
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:51,663
Now that I'm done reviewing what might come up on the exam,

151
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:53,307
you can study on your own.

152
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,475
You're welcome to study other subjects,

153
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,920
- but you must ace my exam. 
 - Okay.

154
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:05,811
You must be confident about the English exam.

155
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:10,223
I am. I've been perfecting it at home.

156
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:15,052

157
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:32,203
You have so many wrong answers to review.

158
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:35,416
You're reviewing them multiple times, right?

159
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,042
If you don't, you'll get them wrong again.

160
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:39,436
And you'll keep on making the same mistakes.

161
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,363
You know all the right answers.

162
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:44,691
- You just make mistakes. 
 - Sometimes, I don't know them.

163
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,260
You wouldn't be doing this right now

164
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,820
if you had chosen natural sciences earlier.

165
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,060
I'm going to repeat a year.

166
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:05,311
Are you confident about that?

167
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:09,482
What?

168
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,160
Are you confident?

169
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:18,066
I know I'll do better next year.

170
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,809
Does that mean

171
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,713
you'll definitely get into Seoyeon University next year?

172
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:28,932
I'm going to do even better next year.

173
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,605
If you can't get into Seoyeon University next year,

174
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,873
you'll be studying abroad.

175
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:38,261
I'm only letting you repeat a year

176
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:41,522
because it's better than going to an average school.

177
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:43,308
Do you understand?

178
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,444
Yes.

179
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:48,738
Your grades are a mess.

180
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,724
Let me know if you need anything.

181
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,775

182
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,749
Hi.

183
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,000
Hi.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,161
What's so important

185
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,713
that you wanted to see me the day before our final exams?

186
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:24,782
I'm not trying to do anything, so don't worry.

187
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,012
How's your studying going?

188
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:31,347
It's going well. I'm doing my best.

189
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:33,083
Hey, you got a new watch.

190
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,718
Yes.

191
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,720
It's really expensive.

192
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,346
Aren't you jealous?

193
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,356
You're so annoying.

194
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:44,219
Is that something to smile about?

195
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:45,521
It's funny hearing that I'm annoying when

196
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,105
I've decided to repeat a year.

197
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,841

198
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,934
You're repeating a year?

199
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:52,585
Yes.

200
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,188
This is a gift.

201
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,820
Why aren't you saying anything?

202
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,206
I just don't know what to say.

203
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,459
Have you already made your decision?

204
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,044
Yes.

205
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:11,922
I'm going to take the CSAT this year for the experience.

206
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,574
Next year, I'm going to give it my all.

207
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:17,561
Do the others know?

208
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:19,387
No.

209
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,090
You're the first person to know about this.

210
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,835
Really? Why?

211
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,008
Because I like you.

212
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,684
Min, the thing is...

213
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:43,352
I already know.

214
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:45,988
I know you two are going out.

215
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:48,274
How did you know that?

216
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,728
I can see through the lies of a kindhearted girl like you.

217
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,740
We have many things in common.

218
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,002
I know you.

219
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:01,705
You're right.

220
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:04,190
You caught me.

221
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:10,037
I'm repeating a year, so I'm in no mood to congratulate you.

222
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:15,143
I understand. I'll cheer for you.

223
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:18,705
You'll do well. I know you will.

224
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:22,125
I know that I'm good as well.

225
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,578
Once you get into a good university next year,

226
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,688
you'd better congratulate me then.

227
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:36,506
I still won't be able to.

228
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:40,919
That's all I wanted to say. I'll be going now.

229
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,779
Already?

230
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:46,700
You know I'm busy with tutoring and studying.

231
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,018
- Bye. 
 - Okay then.

232
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:54,732

233
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,284
I thought you weren't going to study.

234
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:58,736
"Everyone..."

235
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,947
I can't do it.

236
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,024
Why is it so hard?

237
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:07,688
Ha Na, have this.

238
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,539
Good luck on the exam.

239
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,209
Thanks. Good luck to you too.

240
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,094
I'll share this with my friends.

241
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,837
Okay.

242
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:21,735
Wow. Look at the kind rivalry between the two top students.

243
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,686
Here's the kind rivalry between the two worst students.

244
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,638
Good luck.

245
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,166
- Sure, second-worst student. 
 - Okay, worst student.

246
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:31,628
Guys, you can have this.

247
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:32,688
Are you sure?

248
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,856
You know I'll get a stomachache if I have this.

249
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,360
Thank you.

250
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,030

251
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,214
 I thought I knew everything.

252
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:01,842
 But I was wrong.

253
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,802
You have five minutes.

254
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:07,360
Please fill in your OMR cards and get ready to hand them in.

255
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,133
 When you think you know everything,

256
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:22,137
 that's when you fail

257
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,970
 to notice things.
