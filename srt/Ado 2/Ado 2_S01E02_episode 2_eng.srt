1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:03,078
I cried last night.

2
00:00:03,078 --> 00:00:05,321
Why did you cry?

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,651

4
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:12,094

5
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,308

6
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,677
  - Isn't this Kim Ha Na? 
 - Could I have your homework?

7
00:00:19,677 --> 00:00:21,588
  - Here. 
 - Thanks.

8
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,615
Hey, could I have your homework?

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,169
Your homework.

10
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:29,363
Ha Na.

11
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,782
Did you see the school's anonymous page?

12
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,391
What?

13
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:36,011
Yes, I did.

14
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:39,872
 I wanted to be someone who was loved by everyone.

15
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:41,625
Min Ji, could I have your homework?

16
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,227
Oh, okay. Here.

17
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:45,554
Thank you.

18
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:47,655
Could I have your homework?

19
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,883
Could I have your homework?

20
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,717
You should've been class president.

21
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,552
No, no.

22
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,295
Look at her puffy eyes.

23
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:55,581
- Do you think she cried? 
 - Probably, because of guilt.

24
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:58,541
 Instead of an ordinary supporting role,

25
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,353
 I wanted to be the one and only star.

26
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,397
  - You're much better than her. 
 - I agree.

27
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,648
 You should've become the class president.

28
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,924
 I think so too.

29
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:12,121
I ate ramyeon before going to bed last night.

30
00:01:12,848 --> 00:01:14,967
I guess I ate too late at night.

31
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:16,276
I see.

32
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,486
What kind of ramyeon did you have?

33
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:22,439
Hearing you talk about ramyeon is making me crave it.

34
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,485
Let's eat something good for lunch.

35
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,120
I'm so hungry.

36
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,840
I'm absolutely starving.

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,566
I'm hungry.

38
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:33,535
Bo Ram, could I have your homework?

39
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:34,469
Homework?

40
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,804
- That's what I mean. 
 - Good job.

41
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,265
Homework. Hold on.

42
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,516
Let's see, I...

43
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,261
I didn't do it.

44
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:47,357
Are you still the administrator of the school's anonymous page?

45
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,960
I'm not. I'm really not the administrator.

46
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,136
I'm sorry I was mistaken.

47
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:54,306
There's no need to be sorry. Seriously, don't be.

48
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:55,932
Okay.

49
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,160
Who on earth posted this?

50
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,013
Do you want me to find out who it is?

51
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:03,190
My friend made someone else the administrator a while ago,

52
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,333
so I can't remember who it is.

53
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,101
No, it's all right.

54
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:10,388
It might be better not knowing...

55
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,382
who it is?

56
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,395
Ha Na, I know this because I used to be an administrator.

57
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:19,740
People who post things like this are usually outsiders

58
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,959
and social misfits. You know this, right?

59
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,769
Come on, don't say that.

60
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,647
Do they make time to post nasty comments like this?

61
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,083
Normal people like you are busy studying and going to academies.

62
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,878
Oh, I told you I don't attend academies.

63
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,155
I'm busier now since I became the class president.

64
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,423
Class president?

65
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,492
That's awesome. Good for you.

66
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,869
- Thank you. 
 - You're really impressive.

67
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,964
You're smart, kind, polite and pretty.

68
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,991
You even have power now.

69
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:49,077
Gosh, it's impossible not to like you.

70
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:51,337
- What? 
 - What?

71
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,927
- I... 
 - You don't have to answer.

72
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,814
Oh, okay. I'll get going now.

73
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:01,749
Sure.

74
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:05,235
Anyway, if you need any help, come by and I'll like you.

75
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:07,436
I mean, I'll help you.

76
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:10,123
Okay. I'll go now. Bye.

77
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,325
Okay, bye.

78
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,005

79
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,048

80
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,909

81
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:39,027

82
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:41,430

83
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,265

84
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,324

85
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,143

86
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,159
I'm home.

87
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,577
 Hey, you're home.

88
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,931
What's up?

89
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:11,509
Hey. Why is it so hard to get hold of you?

90
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,946
What are you guys doing? When did you come?

91
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:17,424
Us? A while ago.

92
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,159
You ate ramyeon alone last night, didn't you?

93
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:23,246
We're going to eat the yummy food that your grandma makes us.

94
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:24,640
Here, wear this.

95
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,991
What? Oh...

96
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:28,143
What is this?

97
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,236
We are...

98
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,147
going to have a pajama party!

99
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,699
Put it on.

100
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,202
Try it on. Pink looks really good on you.

101
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,431
- Thank you for the meal. 
 - Let's eat.

102
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,250
- Let's eat. 
 - Enjoy your meal, guys.

103
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,060
Of course, we will.

104
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,354
This looks like a scene in a commercial.

105
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,367
Eat up.

106
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:05,460

107
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,180
I'm so full. My stomach is about to explode.

108
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,623
My belly button is about to pop out.

109
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:12,516
I know, right?

110
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:19,124
Gosh, if we sleep after eating so much,

111
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:21,443
our faces will be seriously puffy in the morning.

112
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:22,994
I know.

113
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:24,404
Just like Kimha's this morning.

114
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:26,706
- Her eyes were like this. 
 - Right?

115
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:28,400
You know Kim Jong Kook, right? 
  (T/N: It is a Korean celebrity)

116
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,676
- What about him? 
 - His eyes look like that too.

117
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,386
It's like they're closed.

118
00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:36,081
Actually...

119
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:39,418
I didn't...

120
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:41,779
I ate ramyeon last night.

121
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:51,372
I cried last night.

122
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:55,000
Why did you cry?

123
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:05,027
Because I felt upset.

124
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:15,380
Because of me,

125
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,799
- even you guys were blamed... 
 - Kimha, wait.

126
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:22,670
This is so irritating.

127
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:27,591
I can beat up all of them.

128
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:31,378
I'll beat them up for you.

129
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:33,398
Bring anyone who talks badly about you to me.

130
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:35,542
- I can beat up all of them. 
 - Gosh.

131
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:36,968
Why are you laughing?

132
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:38,719
Hey.

133
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:40,747
They're all so skinny and weak,

134
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:43,266
and all I need is one little slap to teach them a lesson.

135
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:45,852
That's not what Ha Na is talking about right now.

136
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:47,654
Don't worry!

137
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:50,005
I'm a strong fighter.

138
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:56,087
Stop crying.

139
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:57,547
Stop.

140
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,858
Hey, have you forgotten I'm a Diamond rank player?

141
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:01,751
Stop trying to be funny.

142
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:04,861
You're making me cry more.

143
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:06,040
Then what should I do?

144
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,366
If you keep crying, I'll have to crack a joke at least.

145
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:13,587
Don't cry.

146
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:15,973
Hey.

147
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:22,002
If you keep crying, you'll make me cry too.

148
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:34,934
Thank you.

149
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:40,932
Don't cry.

150
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:59,600
Still, I feel a bit better after letting it all out.

151
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:04,814
Are you done crying?

152
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,942
Yes.

153
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:16,742
Don't get upset over something like this now.

154
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:22,706
Don't listen to what they say.

155
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,346
We won't either.

156
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:33,801
Okay.

157
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:05,224
Guys...

158
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:42,978
Hey, Ha Na.

159
00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:45,415
This question seems wrong.

160
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:47,100
Have you solved this?

161
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,810
Oh...

162
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:53,405
I haven't tried solving this part yet.

163
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:56,258
Let me take a look though. This seems...

164
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:58,752
Hey, Ha Na.

165
00:09:58,752 --> 00:10:00,713
Are you sick?

166
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:04,374
Your eyes are really puffy.

167
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:07,028
I guess she ate ramyeon again last night.

168
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:11,340
- Yesterday, I... 
   - She had ramyeon again?

169
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,535
Gosh, I just took a big dump.

170
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:17,505
Did it feel nice?

171
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:20,033
Of course!

172
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:22,719
Look at Kimha's eyes.

173
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,754
I saw them earlier, but it's still so funny.

174
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,981
Your eyes are just like hers.

175
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:32,461
Did you guys do something yesterday?

176
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:39,109
We watched "Coco" at my place yesterday.

177
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:42,430
Kim Ha Na cried so hard watching "Coco". It was hilarious.

178
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,391
You cried like crazy too.

179
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:47,911
Hey, I didn't cry. Something just got in my eyes.

180
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:51,364
 I won't be loved by everyone.

181
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:55,224
 Not in the future, or ever.

182
00:10:55,986 --> 00:10:58,079
 However,

183
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,307
 I'm already the one and only person in this world.

184
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:05,436
 There are people who care about me.

185
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:06,538
Who wants to go for ice cream at the convenience store?

186
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:09,740
 And I care about them too.

187
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,518
- I want something else. 
 - Okay.

188
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:13,278
I need to reduce the swelling in my eyes.

189
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:15,337
Let's go!

190
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:21,644
- I'm hungry. 
 - Me too.

191
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:23,530
- What about the others? 
 - The menu is stir-fried pork.

192
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,283
Gi Hyun said he'll come later and ask for an extra serving.

193
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:28,467
Min will come too then.

194
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,178
I'm hungry.

195
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:33,372
Hey. Don't cut in line.

196
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:36,417
Hey, you!

197
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:40,188
Me?

198
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:42,532
Yes, you. Why are you cutting in line?

199
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:46,202
Oh, my teacher told me to eat lunch early and hurry back.

200
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:48,329
What is she saying?

201
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:51,899
That doesn't mean you can cut in line.

202
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,902
Can you go back and stand in line?

203
00:11:53,902 --> 00:11:56,320
Oh, okay.

204
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:01,276
Stir-fried pork.

205
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:02,619
Wait!

206
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:05,646
Are you Kim Jo Yeon?

207
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:07,365
What?

208
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,460
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

209
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,960
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

210
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,620
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

211
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,550
♫  At the end of one and only nineteen  ♫

212
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:45,990

213
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:53,770

214
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,413

215
00:12:55,413 --> 00:12:57,715

216
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:04,631

217
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:11,538

218
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:14,749

219
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:16,584
