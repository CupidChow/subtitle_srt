1
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,274

2
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,575

3
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:14,989

4
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,836

5
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:22,989

6
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:26,759

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:37,080

8
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,428
Whenever we encounter unfamiliar grammar,

9
00:00:45,428 --> 00:00:47,697
we usually give up and say goodbye.

10
00:00:47,697 --> 00:00:49,491
You've experienced this often, right?

11
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:52,702
We're supposed to figure out the meaning through the context,

12
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:54,562
but that's not as easy as it seems.

13
00:00:54,562 --> 00:00:56,558
After taking an exam,

14
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,443
you have probably heard your friends say this.

15
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,938
They say, "I was too flustered

16
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,565
to solve the question."

17
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:08,326
We all know that being flustered is not the real problem.

18
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:10,220
This grammar we use in these kinds of situations

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,855
is called the "Too...to" method.

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,543
Oh. 
 Hello.

21
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,770

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,150
 Usually you all think you know everything about "Too...to" 
 method because you learnt it well when you were young.

23
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,060
 But usually you don't know it well because...

24
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,664
Here.

25
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:31,966
Thank you.

26
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,085
You came really early.

27
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:35,220
Do you call this early?

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,260
 I also have to figure it out,

29
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,470
  but it's not who I'm talking about,

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,720
 it's not just going, it's actually not a...

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,650
 Now, take it through an exemple sentence.

32
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,230
 You said you live far away.

33
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,300
 I live five minutes away from here.

34
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,420
Huh! Geez.

35
00:02:00,848 --> 00:02:04,523
 You're a total liar.

36
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:06,520
 So are you.

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,740

38
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,230
 So we read it.

39
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,230
 Lies.

40
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:36,773
- Where are you going? 
 - What?

41
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:37,741
Oh.

42
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,435
In case you're uncomfortable since you're left-handed.

43
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:43,990
 You're too distant for me to feel comfortable.

44
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:52,280
 But are we too close to study together?

45
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:03,959

46
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,263

47
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:11,299

48
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:30,652
Do you eat hamburgers often?

49
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:33,496
Yes. Almost every day.

50
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:36,127
I told you, I live alone.

51
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:38,809
Oh, why?

52
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:42,080
My parents got divorced last winter.

53
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,950
So I just told them that I'd live alone.

54
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:49,287
I see.

55
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:50,222
Do you feel sorry for me?

56
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:53,466
No, it's not that.

57
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,544
It's just... I don't know what to say.

58
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:56,803
I mean...

59
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,413
If you live alone,

60
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:02,241
you must feel bored when you eat.

61
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,478
That's why I asked you to eat with me.

62
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,329
Oh, right.

63
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:13,828

64
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,917
I'll walk you home.

65
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:22,471
What? Why so suddenly?

66
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,833
My house is very far from here. It's about 40 minutes away.

67
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,092
So?

68
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:31,862
What do you mean? Your house is close by.

69
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:35,842
 Too close to go home.

70
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,642
Then you can come somewhere with me.

71
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,826
 There's a lock inside, and it looks identical front and back.

72
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:46,295
 Press it more than three times to reset it.

73
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:49,114
 Press the password and pull down to open it.

74
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:50,549
It's my first time playing the room escape game.

75
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,409
I've played it a few times.

76
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,810
- Doesn't it look fun? 
 - But...

77
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,746
I think we'll fail. I don't think we'll be able to escape.

78
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:57,680
Do you want to bet?!

79
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,416
- Okay, sure. 
   - Please wear

80
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,484
 your eye masks and enter the room.

81
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:03,812
Okay. I feel nervous.

82
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:06,355
- Are you scared? 
 - Yes.

83
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,259
What do we do?

84
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,478
I think we should remove the handcuffs.

85
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,329
- The key... 
 - We should look here.

86
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,416
Hey, what is that? Why is the key in there?

87
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,935
Oh, it's right here.

88
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:19,036
Look!

89
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:20,495
Look. I found it!

90
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:22,305
- It's in here. 
 - Yes.

91
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:23,231
Hey!

92
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:25,934
You're good at this. Wow!

93
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,910
Thank you.

94
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,538
- This is number five, right? 
 - Yes.

95
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,026
We did it! What is this?

96
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:36,002
Do you want to try?

97
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:38,963
Hey! Bye.

98
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:42,276
- Oh, my gosh! 
 - You're really not scared?

99
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:45,186
- I'm not scared at all. 
 - Really?

100
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:46,421
Stop it!

101
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,865
What is this? Oh, gosh!

102
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:51,902
 Since you escaped successfully, I'll take a Polaroid picture.

103
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:54,029
 I'll take it on the count of three.

104
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:57,530
 Get ready. One, two, three.

105
00:06:00,602 --> 00:06:02,563

106
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:06,315

107
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:10,061
Here.

108
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,691
You must really like cake.

109
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,718
No, not that much.

110
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:19,746
What? Why is this your wish if you don't even like cake?

111
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:23,475
I just wanted to eat cake on a day like this.

112
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:25,460
I see.

113
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,590
But is it okay if you go home this late?

114
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,334
Hey. You were the one who wanted to hang out.

115
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:34,978
I called my grandma and said I'll be late today.

116
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,938
Your grandma?

117
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,584
I live with my grandma. It's just the two of us.

118
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,695
You heard before, right?

119
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,539
Is it a secret?

120
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,725
That you live with your grandma?

121
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:53,079
No. It's not a secret.

122
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,241
- Thanks for the cake. 
 - Sure.

123
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,538
I have to go this way.

124
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:11,757
- I'm going this way. 
 - Okay.

125
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:14,383
I'll get going then. See you tomorrow at the library.

126
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:15,819
- Okay. 
 - By the way,

127
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:19,314
Min will study with us. Is that okay?

128
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,050
- Ha Min? 
 - Yes. We usually study together.

129
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,310
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

130
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,870
Okay.

131
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,624
Thank you.

132
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:32,880
What?!

133
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,264
For congratulating me on my birthday.

134
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,542
Today is my birthday.

135
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:43,611
You should've told me. I didn't know.

136
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:46,066
If I'd known, I would've gotten you a gift.

137
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,499
You did.

138
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:50,761
We listened to a lecture and played a room escape game together.

139
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:54,391
Still, it's your birthday. I should've bought a gift.

140
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,617
You also bought me cake.

141
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:59,137
Good night!

142
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,229

143
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:19,840

144
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,388

145
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:30,385

146
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,608

147
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:55,776

148
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:01,699

149
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:05,536

150
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:13,569

151
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:20,384
Joo Ha.

152
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:23,138
- Surprise! 
 - Surprise!

153
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:26,308
- Hey. 
 ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

154
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:28,840

00:09:28,842 --> 00:09:31,688

157
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:36,984
Blow out the candles!

158
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:39,404
How did you guys come all the way here?

159
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:40,739
It's your birthday.

160
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:42,950
How could you not call us once after transferring schools?

161
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,743
I know, you're so cold.

162
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:46,703
- Gosh! 
 - You're a loner, right?

163
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:48,865
I knew you'd be alone without any cake.

164
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,568
You don't have any friends besides us.

165
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:52,416
I already had cake.

166
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:55,436
- Really? 
 - Don't lie. With who?

167
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:57,256
- It's a secret. 
 - Do you have a girlfriend?

168
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:58,941
- It's a secret. 
 - My gosh, it must be true.

169
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:01,293
Stop annoying me, and leave after having the cake.

170
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:02,928
Why? We're going to spend the night here.

171
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:03,829
- That's right. 
 - Here?

172
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:05,447
- Play PlayStation all night! 
 - Yes, the PlayStation.

173
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:08,182
You'll play too, right? Let's play together.

174
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,945

175
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,073

176
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,808

177
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:20,236

178
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:28,308
Why did your English score drop?

179
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,290
I understand your math and science scores dropping

180
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,458
since you changed your major,

181
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,401
but your English score shouldn't drop.

182
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:38,154
I know.

183
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:41,933
Are you joking with me right now?

184
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:46,120
Do I look like I'm joking?

185
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:52,710
You got a lot of questions wrong on the last part.

186
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,844
You didn't manage your time properly?

187
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,450
I couldn't.

188
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,393
I had no time.

189
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,070
How many times have you taken the mock test?

190
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,372
And yet you still can't manage your time?

191
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:08,676
Isn't that a given for seniors?

192
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:10,854
It's not that I didn't manage my time.

193
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:11,914
I couldn't.

194
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:13,832
Why couldn't you?

195
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:15,876
Min Joon had so much time left during the CSAT

196
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,444
that he could solve the questions several times.

197
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,105
But 70 minutes isn't enough for you to solve just 45 questions?

198
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:23,583
Then tell me.

199
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,844
How many more minutes do you need?

200
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,626
Stop mentioning Min Joon.

201
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,059

202
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,377
Min.

203
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:43,403

204
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,988
You really came out to meet me.

205
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:46,156
Of course!

206
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,191
- Were you studying hard? 
 - Yes.

207
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,993
- What about lunch? 
 - I ate. What about you?

208
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:51,912
- I ate too. 
 - Was this place too far?

209
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,273
No, my house is near here.

210
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:56,041
You're late.

211
00:11:58,794 --> 00:12:00,212
Were you here together?

212
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:02,608
Oh, right. Didn't I tell you?

213
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,183
We were studying together.

214
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:08,495
Here.

215
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,964
Is this for me? Thank you.

216
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,167
Is this for me?

217
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,561
No.

218
00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:20,061
It's for me.

219
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:24,511
Okay, then. I'll just share with her.

220
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,156
I won't share with you. I'm going to drink it all.

221
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:30,717
By the way, Min. You don't drink milk these days?

222
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,320
No.

223
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,546
I don't.

224
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,713
Do you like milk?

225
00:12:36,582 --> 00:12:39,038
I used to like it before.

226
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,400
Do people's tastes change?

227
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,080
Do you drink coffee these days then?

228
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,591
Yes.

229
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:49,911
I like coffee better now.

230
00:12:49,911 --> 00:12:52,263
 It might be...

231
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:53,882
 too bitter to like.

232
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:56,943
I like coffee too.

233
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,930
♫  To not regret the choice of day  ♫

234
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,190
♫  Trust yourself at this moment  ♫

235
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,820
♫  I'll be next you  ♫

236
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,866
Let's break up.

237
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:18,229
Why? Is it because we can't see each other often?

238
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:21,134
Or is something wrong?

239
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:25,497
Answer me.

240
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:28,278
Why do you want to suddenly break up?

241
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:32,779
No reason.

242
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,507
I'll get going then.

243
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,354
Stay a little longer.

244
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:52,148
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,960
