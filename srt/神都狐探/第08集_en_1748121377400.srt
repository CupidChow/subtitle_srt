1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Looks like you're the first one here.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're the first one here.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hu Di!

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hu Di?

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've heard of him.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Three years ago,

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:02:01,060
In the martial arts

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
哎,你是因为这个鼻子喊灵才叫虎底的吗?

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
嗯,将虎没有散,不过我的能力不仅仅是鼻子。

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
你这个面具是在哪儿做的?

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
你听上了增上,也给我来一个。

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
这才是那是西域悬铁,天下寒有,仿造不了。

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
侯大人,看我这儿,我这儿也不有意思。

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm a good friend of the world.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I can't make up for it.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Lord Hu, I have to remind you.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't take it easy and take it easy.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Be careful and come and kill me.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Who is this?

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're joking, Hu Di.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm just a simple and pretty girl.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why are you laughing?

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
In the coffin, everyone is calling me old fox.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I didn't expect that.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I can still recognize you as a little fox.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What a nuisance.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I know how to teach a fox.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You have no strength.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now, start.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Run!

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Take this.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is the Taoist Master.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let me introduce you to him.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is the first time in a month.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If we win, we can let the three-eyed demon

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
invite the people who want to fight us.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Three-eyed demon?

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's said that he has 30 points.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
With my experience,

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the battle is not suitable for the enemy.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's not a clue anyway.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So, what should we do?

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The winner is...

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Gui Shu Cheng.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you have any more challengers?

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You have a wound.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's not suitable for you to fight again.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You have more?

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Of course.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's time to fight.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The winner is in the arena.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The game begins.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You are laughing too much.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I won't fight again.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What's your goodwill?

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't have goodwill.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Use my sword.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Take it.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Didn't you owe me a life?

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I have no regrets.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I lost.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There is no way you can lose in the ghost world.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Since you are here,

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
you are my opponent.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is the last fight.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If you win,

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
you will be the leader.

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I will win.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You are the leader?

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's fight till the end.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The late emperor.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's fight till the end.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You are so good.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I can't believe I lost.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Winner is...

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The winner is...

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The Golden Knight.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Hurry up.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Let's go to meet him.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What's going on?

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
My old friend.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You are too scared.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You can't talk about it.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I am not a coward.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
How about it?

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You won the battle.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You are a loser.

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
As long as I am with you,

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I will be fine.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I won't give up.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I will laugh.

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why don't you come to me?

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
How dare I not fight?

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What rules do you have?

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You know him again?

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He is my old friend.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Then why did you let me fight?

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Friends are friends.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He has to follow his rules.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Since he is your friend,

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
why didn't you fight the rules?

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why didn't you fight the rules?

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What do you want to ask?

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Feng Huan.

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Who is the real brother behind this?

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You are looking for...

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Pan Honghao.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The mask.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The mask.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Pan Honghao.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The mask.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What do you mean?

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There are many people like you in the martial world.

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The martial world is all about the mask.

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
People in the martial world are not people.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Are you the one who is the real brother?

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Did you ask the victim's family name?

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Chief.

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Two seniors from Daoist School.

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Is it convenient for you?

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We are.

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We are.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Who is the real brother?

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Duan Man is his.

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He wants to define me.

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This.

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The day just now.

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Who killed my daughter?

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He must let this person die.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You are a master.

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why are you talking like that?

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I am a master.

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I have been practicing martial arts for a long time.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think I understand.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I have been practicing.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Well.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I have been in the Demon Realm for a long time.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I have been in the Demon Realm for a long time.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Really?

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But I have been in the martial world for a long time.

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Have you ever been in a fight with anyone?

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I have been in a fight with a girl named Xue.

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And a girl named Fada Yuxue.

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
My daughter mentioned Xue Yu Dafa and Xue Shenjiao.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Xue Shenjiao?

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Have you heard of it?

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It seems that the breakthrough is here.

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Those dead bodies have a strong blood smell.

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It seems that they were in a place where they bought blood.

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
By the way.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The girl mentioned that she found a pair of shoes.

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
She wanted to harm people.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
She said that she needed to investigate.

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I told her not to interfere with the blood.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I didn't expect that.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I didn't expect that.

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Everyone.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Please remember to love the weapon that the murderer used.

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It should be the highest.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
God of Heaven, blood and fire.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Protect the world and the world.

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Remember to be with us.

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Always be with us.

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
God of Heaven, blood and fire.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Protect the world and the world.

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Protect the world and the world.

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
After the love was gone.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
People escaped the trap.

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But they thought that there was blood on the weapon.

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
They couldn't understand the blood.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They lost their lives.

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Finally.

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They died in the door of the Dali Temple.

194
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
How could this be?

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I have already tried.

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I hope you can understand.

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Chun Yang Qian was found by Ling Ai.

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Now, I will return it to you.

199
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can stay here.

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I hope that Hu Di Dai can protect you.

201
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He will be the murderer.

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He will be the murderer.

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
My daughter.

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Look.

205
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The one you picked.

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What else do you want?

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I want this one.

208
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It seems that

209
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
as Dao Xing and your master said,

210
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
the murderer is related to the blood god.

211
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They need a lot of blood.

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
There will be a death.

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And the red robe that the three eyes said.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The blood god.

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's a little sad.

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Shen Xuan's secret box.

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Mr. Hu.

218
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There are so many weapons.

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't be confused.

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't worry.

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I have prepared.

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Hu.

223
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Hu.

224
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hu.

225
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Hu.

226
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Hu.
