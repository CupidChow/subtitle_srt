00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540
Chatt Ø¥cord

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How you like it?

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 14

4
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,320
Little brother,

5
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,000
what's the matter?

6
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,600
The dead's mouth

7
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,520
has a bit of a strange smell.

8
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,120
It means that they poisoned him.

9
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,840
You can smell it.

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,640
Of course.

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,240
And his clothes

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,040
are also wet.

13
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,320
There is smoke and water in it.

14
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,480
Maybe before the dance girl started performing,

15
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,680
the dance leader was killed

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,320
by the other one.

17
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,080
The lover became genuine.

18
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Why did you do that?

19
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,280
I see.

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,440
She has appalled blood

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,120
inside the 606erness

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,160
and even killed the man detagnating her.

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,760
divination of the apparentOOD of the thread.

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,960
You're saying

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,960
The killer can still control the phoenix spirit's positioning.

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,960
That's too much.

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Manager, did Mudan go out today?

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,960
No. Mudan is very stubborn. He rarely goes out.

29
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,960
When was the last time you saw him?

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Probably an hour ago.

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,960
It should be half an hour ago.

32
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,960
When the threat happened, you were scared.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Why do you remember so clearly?

34
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Manager, I've been recording on the way to Xiangzhuang.

35
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,960
It's been an hour since I went there.

36
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,960
Mudan ordered the incense today.

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,960
It should be half an hour ago.

38
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,960
If Mudan didn't go out,

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,960
there's only one possibility.

40
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,960
He took the killer out after he was out of the prison.

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,960
He was sent back after the killer was killed.

42
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,960
No way. There's only one door in the restaurant.

43
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,960
I remember clearly the guest who went out.

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
That means

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,960
the crime of the murder of Wu Chi is not the first case.

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Manager, this way please.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,960
This is Mudan's room.

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,960
There are traces of the snake's demon.

49
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,960
The killer went out from here.

50
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,960
You know it clearly.

51
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Is this the second one?

52
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Could it be that the killer will be separated?

53
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,960
The snake is released by the snake.

54
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,960
The redstone is under the street.

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,960
The snake is under the street.

56
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,960
The snake is under the street.

57
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
The redstone is under the street.

58
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,960
You're right.

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,960
So, there's another man in this restaurant.

60
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Me?

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,960
When I first saw you,

62
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
I smelled a bloodstain.

63
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,960
It was so fresh.

64
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
It was raining.

65
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
I was too nervous.

66
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,960
I accidentally got a bloodstain when I was moving the body.

67
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,960
Thank you.

68
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Is this dish not fresh or...

69
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,960
Sorry, sir. I'll change it for you.

70
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Sorry, sir.

71
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,960
After I woke up,

72
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
you changed your clothes.

73
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Sir, it was the store that was closed.

74
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
I'm sorry, sir.

75
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
I'll be back.

76
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
When the customer didn't come,

77
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,960
you released the body to the bottle.

78
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,960
I accidentally broke the bloodstain in the kitchen.

79
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
So, I smelled a bloodstain.

80
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,960
If that's the case, I doubted him.

81
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,960
He opened the second floor and put a lot of money in the next door.

82
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,960
It doesn't matter.

83
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,960
As long as you find the clothes you changed,

84
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,960
see if there's bloodstain on it.

85
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
And compare it with the scene,

86
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,960
everything will be true.

87
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Sir!

88
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
I didn't kill anyone!

89
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
I didn't kill anyone!

90
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
I didn't kill anyone!

91
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
I didn't kill anyone!

92
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Mr. Hu, I did find it.

93
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
It's hidden in the basement.

94
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
The evidence is confirmed.

95
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
What else do you have?

96
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
Sir.

97
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
There's a saying.

98
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,960
What does it say?

99
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
It says,

100
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,960
The one who looks at the flowers,

101
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,960
the one who sees the flowers.

102
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,960
The one who holds the flowers,

103
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
is the one who says it.

104
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Sir.

105
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Sir.

106
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Sir.

107
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,960
My life is over.

108
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
It's over!

109
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
You're a criminal!

110
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Take this bastard away!

111
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Stop!

112
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Let's go.

113
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Others wait.

114
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
Yes.

115
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Wait.

116
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
You used to be a criminal.

117
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Sir, I'll take this person back to the Dali Temple.

118
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
And interrogate him.

119
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
Little brother.

120
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,960
You're a criminal.

121
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
You're a criminal.

122
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,960
You should thank me for your help.

123
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
You're so kind.

124
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
No, I can't.

125
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
I can't.

126
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,960
I'll take the next step.

127
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
You're so kind.

128
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
You're a criminal.

129
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
You're a criminal.

130
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
I'm not afraid.

131
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm here.

132
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
No matter what you hear,

133
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
what you see,

134
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
don't make a sound.

135
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
You must hide.

136
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Go.

137
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Go.

138
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Wait.

139
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,960
I'm here.

140
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,960
I'm from Dali Temple.

141
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
I'm Hu Zhen Yi.

142
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
How do you call me?

143
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
My name is Jian Xing.

144
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Where are you from?

145
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Lingzhou.

146
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
A good place.

147
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,960
I said you're here to seek revenge.

148
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Who are you?

149
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Who is this enemy?

150
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
The one who is looking for revenge is

151
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Dali Temple.

152
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
I'm Hu Zhen Yi.

153
