1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,800
Phu huan, look.

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,240
I'm home.

4
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
You actually thought you were home!

5
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,560
Cut the crap!

6
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,560
Jian Xing,

7
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,440
it's been a long time,

8
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,600
but why are you back,

9
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,920
and show me around.

10
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,080
S lis,

11
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,520
you are no";s over,

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,240
tell me

13
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,360
where we could have fun this time around.

14
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,560
The Huepang Temple.

15
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,800
Why isn't she here?

16
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,640
You must behind the scenes.

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
You should say something less.

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Look at the baby.

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,640
The banquet is about to start.

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
I made your favorite osmanthus cake.

21
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,640
Let's go.

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
It's time to go home.

23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Brother Jianxing,

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
it seems like

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
you are in love with me.

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
You must have come here with your father

27
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
when you were little.

28
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Mr. Hu, have you been here before?

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
I'm ashamed.

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,640
I've known General Li for many years,

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
but I only came back to Shandu

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
a few times.

33
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
I've never been to Lingzhou.

34
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Sir, hurry up.

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Hurry up. Hurry up.

36
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
Higher.

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Right.

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
Higher.

39
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Left.

40
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Right.

41
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Right.

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Sir,

43
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
may I ask...

44
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
Who is this?

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
I don't know.

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Sir,

47
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
this servant is strange.

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
What are you doing?

49
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Hurry up.

50
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Don't waste time.

51
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Right.

52
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Who are you?

53
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
I'm Hu Li.

54
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
I'm the son of the Emperor.

55
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
Hu Li?

56
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
You are the son of the merchant of Guangyuan.

57
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
You've been traveling

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
around the world with your family.

59
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
This...

60
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
This is my daughter, Hu Lailai.

61
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
This young man

62
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
is my son,

63
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Hu Tu.

64
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
This young man

65
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,640
is my guard.

66
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,640
He is my guard.

67
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,640
I've been to Lingzhou today.

68
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
I heard that there is a wedding in the mansion.

69
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
I came to congratulate you.

70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
I brought some gifts.

71
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,640
I hope you can keep them.

72
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Take it.

73
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Thank you so much.

74
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
The wedding

75
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
is scheduled for tomorrow.

76
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
Why don't you stay

77
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
in the mansion for a few days?

78
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,640
It's not so lively in our mansion for a long time.

79
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,640
I'll take it as a gift.

80
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
I'll take it as a gift.

81
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
I'll take it as a gift.

82
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
OK.

83
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Qiao Er,

84
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,640
take some guests to the guest room with me.

85
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Yes, Madam.

86
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Please.

87
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Sister, please.

88
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Come on.

89
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
To be honest,

90
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
I'm doing this for my daughter's late wife.

91
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
I'm afraid that they will be worried about you.

92
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
It's not like that.

93
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
It's like a soul-wrenching.

94
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
I think you've heard

95
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
that

96
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,640
the wives that my son Xu Qi Yan married

97
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
were all killed in this house.

98
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,640
It's said that

99
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
this is the ghost

100
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
of General Li Zuo.

101
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,640
It's just a nonsense.

102
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,640
It's just a nonsense.

103
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
General Li

104
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,640
saved my husband's life.

105
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Everyone in our mansion

106
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
is grateful to General Li.

107
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
But no one believes it.

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
These years,

109
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
the relatives

110
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
who are willing to come

111
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,640
to congratulate us

112
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,640
are all dead.

113
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
I don't believe that

114
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
there are ghosts in this world.

115
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
If there are,

116
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
I'd like to meet them.

117
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Young man,

118
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,640
you're so brave.

119
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Do you know

120
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
that the ghost

121
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
is watching you?

122
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
I'm not afraid of ghosts

123
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
if I don't do anything wrong.

124
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
Young man,

125
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
this is your room.

126
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Thank you.

127
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Here.

128
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Jia Qing!

129
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Jia Qing!

130
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Mom, I'm scared.

131
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Jia Qing, don't be scared. I'm here.

132
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Don't be afraid of anything

133
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
and be like your father.

134
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Mom.

135
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,640
I'll take you to the secret room where we played hide-and-seek before.

136
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
We must hide well, okay?

137
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
We must hide well.

138
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Go.

139
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Young Master.

140
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Qiao Er, Qiao Er.

141
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Look what I brought you.

142
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Here you are.

143
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,640
I stole this from the kitchen.

144
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,640
My mother almost found out.

145
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Thank you, Young Master.

146
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
Is it good?

147
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
Yes.

148
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
I like to eat cake.

149
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
These are all yours.

150
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Enjoy.

151
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
Don't worry.

152
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Li Jianxiu!

153
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
You thief!

154
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Did you steal something from the kitchen?

155
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Stop right there!

156
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
Qiao Er, it's been a long time.

157
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
When Old Xu called you Qiao Er,

158
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
I thought it was your real name.

159
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
I didn't expect it was you.

160
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Young Master, you've changed a lot.

161
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
You've changed a lot.

162
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
I didn't recognize you at first.

163
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
I didn't expect this to happen.

164
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
It's lucky.

165
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
You went to the kitchen to steal osmanthus cake

166
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
and fell asleep in the firewood.

167
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
You hid from me.

168
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Yes.

169
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
But since then,

170
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
I've been separated from you.

171
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
I haven't heard from you in the past 12 years.

172
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,640
You must have been very tired these years.

173
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
I'm fine.

174
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
But why are you a maid again?

175
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
I'm a poor girl.

176
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
I'm a maid's life.

177
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Besides, Mrs. Li treated me very well.

178
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,640
I have a feeling for this place.

179
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
By the way, Qiao Er,

180
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
do me a favor.

181
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Don't tell anyone about my identity.

182
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Including those who are in the same situation as me.

183
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
Don't worry, I understand.

184
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Thank you.

185
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Then I won't disturb you.

186
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Brother Jianxing.

187
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
Jianxing.

188
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
You...

189
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Brother Jianxing, you're really a spy.

190
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Are you jealous of Mr. Hu's tone?

191
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,640
There was a case in Dali Temple before.

192
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:58,640
A man with a heart of flowers was

193
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
