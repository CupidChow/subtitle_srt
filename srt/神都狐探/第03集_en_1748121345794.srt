1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
La.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
negotiation

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,720
General.

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:28,200
You are

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,480
indeed true and gaa пуPop.

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,160
Dude.

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,240
We should have announced it

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,320
here he would have met

22
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,800
without so much accusation.

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,680
Well,

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,920
How long have you been here?

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm afraid I'll kill you.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
I'm not afraid.

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
I'm not afraid.

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Why didn't you ask me

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,680
why I didn't come to the restaurant

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
instead of the restaurant?

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
That's because

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
we heard that

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Snow Phoenix is in danger.

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,680
We've been to this area

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
to investigate.

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,680
The people in the capital

37
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
are so cruel.

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
They're so cruel.

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
The people here are so cruel.

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
They're so cruel.

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
Brother, I hope

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
you can help us

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,680
investigate the truth.

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
That's all.

45
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Your room is here.

46
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,680
No one has cleaned the house for half a year, right?

47
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,680
I'll let you live here.

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Listen,

49
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,680
you have a big suspect now.

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Don't run around.

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
Since you've told me

52
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,680
to come here to help you

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
investigate the Snow Phoenix case,

54
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,680
what right do you have

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
to treat me as a criminal

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
and to drink with me?

57
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
You!

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
I can't stand fighting with you.

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Hu Mou frequently

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,680
runs the gym for El downs.

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
The迪子号 is already

62
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
underPod.

63
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Give me an excuse.

64
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Get out now.

65
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
There are assassins.

66
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,320
Don't chase they are.

67
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,440
Yes.

68
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,640
Sir, are you okay?

69
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,480
No problem.

70
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,960
Let's go out and have a look.

71
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,560
Fire매

72
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
оф Emb Priest

73
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,600
乔心和主

74
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,480
blijexp

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,040
з bas soon

76
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,660
Rather more skillful.

77
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,720
Ren Xuan,

78
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,060
I haven't seen you for a long time.

79
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,660
Your fox nose

80
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,200
does look pretty cool.

81
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,760
But why do you

82
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:40,580
treat me like a monkey

83
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,520
when you marshmallow in the waters?

84
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,540
Didn't I tell you

85
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,540
to assassinate that old fox.

86
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,540
I don't need to worry about you.

87
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,540
Even if he is the emperor,

88
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,540
as long as he is your enemy,

89
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,540
I will also kill him.

90
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,540
My lord.

91
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,540
I heard that you have been living in Fulai's foot house recently.

92
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,540
I just got in for a few days.

93
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,540
But I still have a chance to kill him.

94
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,540
You shouldn't have killed him.

95
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,540
The four of you told me that Li Jia's secret case is Hu Zheng Yi.

96
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,540
His name is just like a seal.

97
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,540
He is deep in my heart.

98
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,540
But I still need to find out all the truth behind the secret case.

99
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,540
So I need to wait.

100
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,540
You always have a share in your business.

101
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,540
I believe in you.

102
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,540
But don't let me down.

103
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,540
It's been a long time since I've found out

104
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,540
about the secret case and Hu Zheng Yi.

105
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,540
The only clue is that he can't be killed.

106
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,540
And Luo Yang Cheng has been in a bad mood lately.

107
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,540
He can't be killed.

108
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,540
You only knew him for a day.

109
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,540
But he has been bewitched.

110
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,540
Now you even found out the case.

111
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,540
I think the case is not that simple.

112
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,540
It should be related to the secret case.

113
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,540
But you are here to avenge.

114
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,540
I am here to take care of you.

115
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,540
You know what?

116
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,540
My heart.

117
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,540
When you get the revenge,

118
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,540
we will go to the mountain together.

119
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,540
I will go wherever you go.

120
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,540
Shen Xun.

121
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,540
Look into my eyes.

122
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,540
Go out.

123
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,540
Yes.

124
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,540
So many.

125
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,540
According to the investigation,

126
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,540
it can be cut off.

127
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,540
From the noon to the noon,

128
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,540
there were five times in Phoenix.

129
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,540
Almost every person was killed.

130
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,540
Any clues?

131
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,540
The body was lost.

132
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,540
No evidence.

133
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,540
And the victim's death time was not confirmed.

134
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,540
The only thing that matters is that

135
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,540
these bodies are still not out of the house.

136
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
Anyway,

137
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,540
this is your time.

138
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,540
Don't worry, Brother Feng.

139
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,540
By the way,

140
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,540
Lisi has been a star in the army recently.

141
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,540
She looks like a man.

142
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,540
But she is not a good woman.

143
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,540
Remember,

144
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,540
no matter what she says to you,

145
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,540
don't reply.

146
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,540
Don't worry.

147
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,540
I will definitely be loyal to Lord Hu.

148
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,540
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,540
I scared you.

150
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,540
You are that...

151
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,540
a godmother.

152
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,540
Li Jianxing.

153
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,540
I didn't mean that.

154
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,540
A gift from Lisi.

155
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,540
It's sweet.

156
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,540
I'm Li Jianxing.

157
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
Lord Hu asked me to help.

158
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,540
Don't move.

159
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,540
There is poison on the knife.

160
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,540
I've been in the army for many years.

161
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,540
I've seen the first female martial arts master.

162
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,540
And she is such a good female martial arts master.

163
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,540
I'm here to repay Lord Hu's kindness.

164
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Hu Zhengyi, an old fox,

165
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,540
knows how to buy people's hearts.

166
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,540
I really kept it.

167
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,540
A few years ago,

168
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,540
a monk wanted to insult me.

169
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,540
I killed him.

170
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,540
That's a bad person.

171
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,540
You're right.

172
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,540
What's wrong?

173
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,540
You always have a good head.

174
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,540
You can think like that.

175
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,540
You must not be a bad person.

176
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,540
So Lord Hu helped you to get a punishment?

177
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,540
Lord Hu betrayed me.

178
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,540
He asked me for a favor.

179
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,540
What?

180
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,540
I'm here to repay Lord Hu's kindness.

181
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,540
I'm here to repay Lord Hu's kindness.

182
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,540
I'm here to repay Lord Hu's kindness.

183
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,540
I'm here to repay Lord Hu's kindness.

184
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,540
I'm here to repay Lord Hu's kindness.

185
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
I'm here to repay Lord Hu's kindness.

186
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,540
I'm here to repay Lord Hu's kindness.

187
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,540
