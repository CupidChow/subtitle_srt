1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're first.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're first.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The needle'sつ金 我知道啦

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Is the needle Sarah's at?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,160
to find the one with Offering daughters,

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,700
he returns to the Вам boat.

27
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:16,960
Chow er sees my sister.

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,800
made something to a passive ax.

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,200
Put new mother on the grinding,

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:32,060
pull out the

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,200
classmates fighting.

32
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,960
After I've fixed the place where the bride is in the room,

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
I'll give her a rope

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,960
to make a new bride's suicide.

35
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Then she'll go back to the wedding room

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,960
and put the person in the front of the window.

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
Miss, I'm here to give you the key.

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Qiao'er, I'll give you the key. Thank you.

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
You're welcome. I'll go back first.

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Okay. You can go back to work.

41
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,960
When Tian Tian returns to the room,

42
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,960
she sees the shadow in the window and helps her to make a move.

43
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,960
It means that Liu Shi was still alive.

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,960
It means that even Tian Tian lost the key.

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
But she designed it well.

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,960
She did it to help her to prove that she's not alive.

47
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,960
If Qiao'er was really pushing you,

48
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Xu Qi Yan wouldn't be the murderer.

49
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Then how did she get into the secret room and kill Xu Qi Yan?

50
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Xu Qi Yan's blood and blood are all cleaned.

51
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,960
It seems that all the evidence is cleaned.

52
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,960
I'll go back to the room.

53
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,960
Fu Shi.

54
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
candle.

55
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Blood.

56
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
Body.

57
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Young Master.

58
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
It's Qiao'er's body.

59
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,960
It smells like the smell of the Guihua Xun.

60
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
That's it.

61
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Qiao'er stayed here in the body.

62
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
How could Qiao'er kill someone

63
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
and leave the secret room?

64
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Or she didn't leave at all.

65
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
She was hiding in the room.

66
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Tian Tian.

67
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Hu Zheng was the murderer.

68
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,960
At that time, Hu Zheng was also the woman who saw that scene.

69
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,960
And Qiao'er was also a fake.

70
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
To make things worse,

71
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,960
she made a fool of herself and made a fool of herself.

72
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
You're still so smart.

73
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
I knew you'd figure it out.

74
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Qiao'er.

75
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,960
I didn't expect you to be so cruel.

76
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
You killed so many innocent people.

77
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Innocent?

78
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,960
Who's innocent?

83
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
You two are the girls.

84
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Yes.

85
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
How much?

86
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
5 taels.

87
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
3 taels.

88
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
No.

89
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
It's too expensive.

90
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
I sent it to the General's Mansion to be a maid.

91
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
They don't want it.

92
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
It's not worth it.

93
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
It's worth it.

94
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
It's a big piece of paper.

95
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
You sold it to the troupe.

96
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
It's not worth the price.

97
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
It's too expensive.

98
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
8 taels.

99
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
I don't want to part with you.

100
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Go away.

101
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Qiao'er.

102
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Qiao'er.

103
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
I don't want to part with you.

104
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Qiao'er, be good.

105
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Qiao'er, don't cry.

106
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
When I'm rich for the past two years,

107
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
I'll surely pay you back.

108
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Wait for me.

109
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
So beautiful.

110
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Yes.

111
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
It's so beautiful.

112
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
It's so beautiful.

113
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Thank you.

114
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Stop.

115
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
What can I do for you?

116
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
What's your name?

117
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Yunyin.

118
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Yunyin.

119
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I want to give you a good life.

120
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
My lady.

121
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
We're married

122
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
after drinking this cup of Jinjiu.

123
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Drink it.

124
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Stop.

125
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Don't run.

126
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Yunyin, don't run.

127
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Go back with us.

128
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
My lady.

129
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Wake up.

130
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Let me go.

131
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
I'll kneel for you.

132
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Don't talk nonsense.

133
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Don't take me back.

134
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Yunyin, go away.

135
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Let me go.

136
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
I don't want to go back.

137
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Let me go.

138
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Don't run anymore.

139
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
I'll feel bad.

140
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Look.

141
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
This is the suit I bought for you.

142
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,960
It's so beautiful.

143
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
You must be so beautiful.

144
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
My lady.

145
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
I'll let the Guanyang

146
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
build a big stage in the house.

147
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
You can sing

148
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
whenever you want.

149
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
And

150
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
I'll let the servants

151
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,960
plant all the flowers you like in the house.

152
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
I'll be satisfied

153
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
with all the things you like.

154
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
But there's one thing.

155
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
There's one thing.

156
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
You can't leave the house

157
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
in the future.

158
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
You can't do anything.

159
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Good boy.

160
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
Good boy.

161
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Shen.

162
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Lady Su.

163
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Lady Su.

164
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Lady Su.

165
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Lady Su.

166
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,960
Oneald, invite me!

167
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Lady Su!

168
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Lady Su!

169
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,340
Speaker and disponisers

170
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,760
will sleep in Kuugao Village

171
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,220
at midnight.

172
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,120
Later after they found out

173
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,680
that the ada Jung

174
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,220
is dead.

175
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,800
mış

176
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,360
find out

177
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,340
after twenty minutes.

178
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,980
The tragedy

179
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,920
always left such a crowd behind.

180
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,960
I'll make a wall with the same size as the other one.

181
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,960
I'll make a wall with the same size as the other one.

182
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I'll make a wall with the same size as the other one.

183
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I'll make a wall with the same size as the other one.

184
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,960
I'll make a wall with the same size as the other one.
