1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Mr Xu!

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What a weirdo. Let's have a drink again.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Forget it.

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Qian'er, I'm here to give you the key.

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,400
Coming.

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,000
Qian'er, here's the key.

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
You're welcome.

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
I'll be going now.

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Okay, you can go first.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm leaving.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
I'm still watching.

27
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,600
Just sit here for a while.

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
I really can't see

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Mr. Hu and Mr. Xu.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So...

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
So boring.

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
I thought you were a bad guy.

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,800
You're right.

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,200
Tian Tian,

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,200
didn't you see

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,600
Mr. Hu's old man

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,200
playing with his girlfriend

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
at such a young age?

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's not good.

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Li Jian Qing,

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,200
I think when Qian'er took the key,

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,800
he really cared for you.

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
It seems that

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,800
Jian Qing has a family relationship.

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
What?

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,800
Mr. Zeng is jealous of me having a family relationship?

47
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
But,

48
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,800
someone has a family relationship

49
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,800
and doesn't seem to be as good as Zeng Xiong.

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,600
It seems to be a kind of

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,000
filial piety.

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,800
Right?

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
He said I didn't want anyone.

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,800
You're so tall.

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,400
You even told a girl...

56
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Stop it!

57
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Brother Jian Qing,

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,000
you're so charming.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I've known Qian'er for days.

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
She even told me everything she liked.

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,200
You two are good friends.

62
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,800
You two are close friends.

63
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,600
You're so noble and have a high taste.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Yes, Li Jian Qing.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,200
I think Qian'er is also a good friend.

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,800
Why don't you go and have a drink with her?

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
Let me have a chat with Tian Tian.

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
What's wrong with you?

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You have to be careful.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I can't see it.

71
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
You're so crazy.

72
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Can you think about it?

73
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm scared.

74
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,800
I can't see it.

75
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,000
It's true that he's a good son.

76
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
And this is the first case.

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,400
What do you mean?

78
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
According to the direction of the dead,

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,800
he can see it.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,400
He's not being dragged to death.

81
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,600
And there's a meeting on the ground.

82
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
The person who killed the dead will be in a critical condition.

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,400
Get out of the way.

84
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,600
What's wrong with him?

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,600
What's wrong with him?

86
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
He's gone.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,200
Why is he gone?

88
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,000
Where are my weapons?

89
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,800
Where's the talisman?

90
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Where's the painting?

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,400
Mr. Xu.

92
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Is this what you call it?

93
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,800
You're so stubborn.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,200
Mrs. Xu.

95
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,000
It's no wonder that you're so good at it.

96
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,600
These ladies are the ghosts of Mrs. Yun Ying.

97
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
They're from Yun You.

98
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
One more thing.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,600
If Liu Shi came here to kill himself,

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,600
why did he do that?

101
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,600
So the murderer carried Liu Shi

102
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,400
who lost consciousness to this crime scene,

103
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,800
and then he fell to the top of the cliff.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,800
Everyone,

105
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,000
do you have the talisman?

106
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,000
No.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is the agreement between our family and Liu Shi's father.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Liu Shi's father willingly sold his daughter to us.

109
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,400
The agreement was clearly written.

110
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,400
If the bride dies in three days,

111
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,400
no matter what the reason is,

112
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,400
we must not report it.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,800
But you're too...

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,800
Come here.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Since it's Xu's family,

116
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
we outsiders

117
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,800
should not interfere with the family affairs.

118
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
But even so,

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
as the guest of the Xu family,

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,400
we met such a thing.

121
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,200
We should ask clearly.

122
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
Tonight,

123
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,000
everyone is at the scene.

124
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
But you're not here.

125
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,400
Can you tell me where I was at that time?

126
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,200
This...

127
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Me?

128
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,200
This...

129
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,200
Do I need to ask?

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,800
I've been resting in my own room.

131
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
I was the greatest respect for Lady Xu

132
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,600
to attend the wedding today.

133
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,600
As for the banquet,

134
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,600
I'm not afraid of the bride.

135
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
I don't mind any of the sea and the sea.

136
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Then can you tell me

137
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
if there is a witness

138
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,800
to prove that you were indeed in the room?

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,600
This...

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,800
What do you mean?

141
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
I've said it before.

142
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,000
I've been resting in my own room.

143
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm not afraid of the witness.

144
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,200
So,

145
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,800
you're not afraid of the witness

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
as you said?

147
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,400
I...

148
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,400
Master,

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
I've spent a lot of money

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
to invite you to do something.

151
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,000
But now, I'm dead.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,200
Lady Xu.

153
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,600
If it wasn't for Master Lin,

154
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,400
how could you

155
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,400
have caused the soul to come out?

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
What evidence do you have

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
to prove that you were the soul of Yun Yin?

158
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,000
This...

159
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,800
This...

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,400
Even if Yun Yin becomes a ghost,

161
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
she's still a good ghost.

162
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
What?

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,400
A good ghost?

164
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay, okay.

165
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,600
You can keep thinking like that.

166
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,600
Guigen is not just a normal person.

167
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,600
Lady Xu,

168
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,600
you're a very good person.

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're a good person.

170
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
From now on,

171
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,800
you will never ask

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,800
anything about Xu's house.

173
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Master, Master, Master!

174
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,800
You're wrong.

175
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,800
You're wrong!

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
arreach

177
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:04,800
If there's nothing else to do,

178
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
单 move.

179
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Strange place.

180
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Our young master has been so strict.

181
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
She was scared.

182
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Xiang Gong has been training me all the time.

183
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I can't forget Madam Yun Yin.

184
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Madam, don't be afraid.

185
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
I'm already old.

186
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
I'm a little bit tired.

187
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
I'll help you to remove the ring.

188
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Let's go.

189
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
After you left,

190
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
she seemed not in a good mood.

191
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Miss Qi'er,

192
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
I'll give you the key.

193
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Okay, I'll be right there.

194
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Madam,

195
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Laila is here to give you the key.

196
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
I'll go get it.

197
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Go ahead.

198
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Qi'er, I'll give you the key. Thank you.

199
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
You're welcome.

200
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I'll be right back.

201
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Okay, you can go now.

202
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm leaving.

203
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Don't be afraid.

204
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Madam, I'll take you to rest.

205
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Let's go.

206
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
After I wash the dishes for her,

207
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
she's going to sleep.

208
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
And she's still wearing the wedding dress.

209
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Madam,

210
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
you go to rest first.

211
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
I'll go now.

212
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Go ahead.

213
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
After that, I went to the kitchen.

214
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I didn't think that

215
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
the bride would be so poor

216
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
to eat all day.

217
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
I just wanted to give her some food.

218
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
It's really troublesome, Qi'er.

219
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
What's so troublesome?

220
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
There's still a place

221
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
where I need help.

222
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
You can come to me.

223
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Okay.

224
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I went to the key room with Lailan.

225
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
I saw Xu Qi Yan

226
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
and entered the front hall.

227
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
When we came back,

228
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
she was still in the front hall.

229
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
So,

230
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
we didn't have time to do anything.

231
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Okay.

232
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
It's late.

233
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
You're tired, too.

234
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Go back and rest.

235
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Okay.

236
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
I'll go now.

237
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
You can change me if you need anything.

238
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
What are you doing?

239
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
It's almost dawn.

240
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
You're still here.

241
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
What?

242
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Are you planning to stay in the back room?

243
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
It's late.

244
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I should go back and rest.

245
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
I'll take my leave.

246
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
I'll take my leave.

247
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
I'm sorry.
