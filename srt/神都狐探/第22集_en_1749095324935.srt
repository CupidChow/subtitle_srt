1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's you.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What are you doing here?

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's said that Xu Qi Yan got a copy of the online book

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
that he was born with.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He wanted to get five different lives.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And he wanted to marry the woman he was going to marry.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So he got a copy of the book.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And who is this man?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Of course, he's his wife Yun Yin.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So he killed six people

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and got six lives.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How's the future?

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We'll see.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not like the man who was born with Xu's father.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's worth it.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a big deal.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But what's wrong with her?

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why did she become a woman?

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If it wasn't for her, would the princess kill her?

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Xu Qi Yan would kill her.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Stop talking nonsense.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What's wrong?

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What's wrong?

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Zeng Sheng, call Jian Xing to get in the car.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Jian Xing, get in the car.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He's been in the car for a long time.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Coming.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Young Master.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Young Master, I'm sorry.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I didn't expect that you would do this.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Please tell the doctor for me when you wake up.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Qiao Er, don't blame yourself.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What's your plan?

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Madam Xu brought me here.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Now that Young Master is dead,

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Xu Fu has a change of mind.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm going to stay with her.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Great.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll come back to see you later.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You must take good care of yourself.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's getting late.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You should get up.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Qiao Er, take care.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Young Master, please take care.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's go.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You...

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It smells so good.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Tian Tian.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why am I here?

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You just got the drug.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We saved you together.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank you.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Tian Tian, we were in a hurry.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We were in the front of the crime scene.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Thank you, Brother Zeng.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Brother Zeng?

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What's this?

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I remember.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It was left by Young Master Xu.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He said it was Yun Yin's relic.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I caught it before the wedding.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
According to the custom of the Lingzhuo,

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
most of them are for my daughter.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But this looks so familiar.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry, Qiao Er.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I didn't mean to ruin your fragrance.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll buy you another one.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This...

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is the relic my mother left me.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I can't even buy it.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mother.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Mother.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Be careful.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't hurt yourself.

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Be careful.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What's wrong?

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Mother, make me a different one.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Whose is this?

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Qiao Er's.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is a bit difficult.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's not a regular repair.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Look.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The needle is really hard to repair.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's very difficult.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I can't repair it.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm afraid Lingzhou City

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
can't repair it without my mother.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Qiao Er is so kind.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It should be just a coincidence.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's strange.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What's wrong?

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Before the meeting with Xu Qi Yan,

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I asked her how her mother died.

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
She believed that

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
those people were all killed by the dead.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And she firmly believed that

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the dead and her mother were in love.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Only after she married the man who came back to kill her.

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If she really killed those dead,

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
why did she say that?

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Cheng Chuang.

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I have to go back.

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll go with you.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Bye.

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Qiao Er, I'm here to return the key.

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You're here.

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Thank you.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're welcome.

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm here to return the key.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm here to return the key.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm here to return the key.

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm here to return the key.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm here to return the key.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm here to return the key.

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm here to return the key.

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm here to return the key.

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm here to return the key.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm here to return the key.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm here to return the key.

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm here to return the key.

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I haven't seen any people move here.

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,320
I was right.

147
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,960
Let's go.

148
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,840
But the shadow I saw

149
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,400
almost reached the middle of the window.

150
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,640
That means

151
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,680
the person sitting here

152
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
wasn't Liu Shi.

153
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,520
But if it wasn't Liu Shi,

154
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,440
who else could it be?

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,360
It was the white line.

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,880
It was the person

157
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,760
who was the person I saw.

158
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,320
Actually, it was the person.

159
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,400
If it was the person

160
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,760
sitting here, it means that

161
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,000
it was Qiang'er lying.

162
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,080
When you were serving Liu Shi in the cave,

163
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,440
what strange place did you find?

164
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,680
Our master was always

165
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,720
so noisy.

166
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,520
And the bride was scared.

167
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,960
Madam.

168
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,040
Madam.

169
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,960
After Xu Qi left,

170
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,160
Liu Shi was probably

171
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
scared by the sleeping pills.

172
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,040
He fell asleep.

173
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,480
Leave it to him.

174
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,360
And Qiang'er.

175
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,800
After discharging Liu Shi's clothes

176
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,160
and hisuki,

177
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,140
Hello.

178
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,020
Quer is like being taken to theестiepar.

179
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,020
She is no better than Xinyang.

180
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,020
How can she give Xinyang the light?

181
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,020
Xinyang is a very strong and strong woman.

182
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,020
She is a strong woman.

183
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,020
She is a strong woman.

184
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,020
