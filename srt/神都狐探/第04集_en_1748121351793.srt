1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
4. NãoYou

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,480
4. NãoYou

3
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,320
Who will you introduce to?

4
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,100
S creative

5
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,920
Qin

6
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,660
Yun

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,480
Su

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,220
Chief

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,400
And

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,360
Xuan

11
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,940
2020

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,160
If you can think like that,

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,920
it must be okay b

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,920
So, it's you who helped me get away from the crime?

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,920
Mr. Hu sent me to the court.

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
What?

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Two months later,

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,920
the winner is the world.

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,920
He let me go.

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Then you should be grateful to the winner.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Do you think

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
why would Mr. Hu send me to the court

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
instead of the trial?

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
They all have a strange poison.

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
It's a strange poison.

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
The victim died because of excessive bleeding.

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
But look,

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
there's only a small wound on the wound.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,920
The wound is not enough to keep so much blood.

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,920
The blood will be removed in advance.

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
But the blood on these bodies

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
have been dried out.

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,920
And I asked the department of the scene,

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,920
they said there's not that much blood on the scene.

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
So you think

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
it's because of the poison that you left so much blood?

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
I didn't think so.

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
I was the one who took it out.

39
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,920
The poison is not enough.

40
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
The wound was cleaned up again.

41
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
So it's hard to find it.

42
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
No wonder I didn't find it.

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
So do you know

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,920
what kind of poison it is?

45
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
But

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
look,

47
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,920
there's a trace on these dead bodies.

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
These traces show that

49
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
the victim was killed before he died.

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
It's like

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,920
he was dried out.

52
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
It's so cruel.

53
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
It's so poisonous.

54
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Isn't it a phoenix's fault?

55
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
When the saint ascended the throne,

56
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
the people saw that

57
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,920
a phoenix flew out of the Hall of Fame.

58
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,920
They thought it was a heavenly general, Xiang Rui.

59
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Now,

60
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,920
when the phoenix was out,

61
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Xiang Rui became evil.

62
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
I thought

63
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
it was time to investigate the case of the phoenix.

64
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
The brave people

65
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
would kill them.

66
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Besides,

67
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
please

68
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
punish the scoundrels

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
and show the details of the phoenix

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
and the blood phoenix.

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
To make it known to the people,

72
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,920
the blood phoenix is a good example of Xiang Rui.

73
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Sun Cheng Jing,

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
you're so bold.

75
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,920
I'm sorry, saint.

76
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
I deserve to die.

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
You deserve to die.

78
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
You're so bold.

79
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
How can you

80
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,920
talk to Xiang Rui like that?

81
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Saint,

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Saint,

83
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Hu Qing is here.

84
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
You,

85
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
get up.

86
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Thank you, saint.

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
I heard

88
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,920
that when the phoenix was killing people yesterday,

89
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Lord Hu

90
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
was just on the scene of the crime.

91
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
What a coincidence.

92
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
It's a coincidence

93
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
to return to the saint.

94
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
What do you think, Hu Qing?

95
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
I think

96
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
this case

97
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,920
must not be the phoenix who killed people,

98
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,920
but the human being.

99
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Since Hu Qing is so sure,

100
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
then let's leave this case

101
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,920
to the Grand Priest.

102
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Saint,

103
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
please investigate it.

104
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
Can you add a time limit?

105
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
After all,

106
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
people can't speak.

107
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,920
It's so good.

108
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,920
I will

109
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
break this case within ten days.

110
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Within ten days?

111
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,920
I'm afraid that in a few days,

112
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
this rumor

113
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
will have already

114
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
spread to the capital.

115
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
As Grand Priest,

116
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
I hope that Lord Hu

117
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
can

118
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
share the share of the country

119
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
and find out the truth

120
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
to ease the mind.

121
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Hu Zhengyi.

122
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Yes.

123
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,920
I order you to break the case within three days

124
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
and make the case as soon as possible.

125
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
Please.

126
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Please.

127
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,920
May the emperor be blessed.

128
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Mother.

129
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,920
I killed the people first.

130
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
I helped them.

131
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,920
You guys made the dishes.

132
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Good.

133
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm the first one in Luoyang.

134
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,920
I still can't break the case.

135
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
So,

136
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
I designed a big dish

137
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
for you guys.

138
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
It's called

139
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,580
the

140
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
bamboo root.

141
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,920
This is just a piece of cake.

142
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
Even if you

143
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,920
make a hole in the ground,

144
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
you can't make a color.

145
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Mother.

146
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Not only that,

147
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
I will tear your work

148
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
into your mouth

149
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
and make you

150
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
a good cook.

151
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
I will make it.

152
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
I said.

153
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
I said.

154
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,920
I said, my lord.

155
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
No.

156
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm the only one behind.

157
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
You.

158
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Hurry up.

159
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
My lord.

160
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
My lord.

161
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Protect him.

162
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Someone poisoned it in the water.

163
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
But it's so strange.

164
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,920
I've never seen such poison.

165
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,920
I thought I'd seen this kind of poison.

166
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
After Tangguan died,

167
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
we sent him the jade.

168
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
At the same time,

169
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
we investigated the four corners of the Dali.

170
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
We found out

171
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
that the poison was poisoned.

172
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
We also investigated

173
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
the old li-tou

174
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
that was sent to the Dali Temple.

175
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
The old li-tou is dead, right?

176
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Yes.

177
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
I'm sorry.

178
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Did you find out Tangguan's human relationship?

179
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Tangguan was in a panic three years ago.

180
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
He escaped to the capital

181
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
and was taken by the eunuch.

182
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,920
But he has a bad temper.

183
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
He loves to gamble money.

184
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
He went to gamble for the boss.

185
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
He was very young before.

186
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
But he has been in a big trouble recently.

187
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Open.

188
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Open.

189
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Open.

190
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,920
It seems that he was hired by the gang.

191
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Where did you find out his money?

192
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Yes.

193
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Do you still have a habit of living in the Dali Temple?

194
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
To be honest,

195
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
it's better to come to the mansion.

196
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Although we don't have a lot of families here,

197
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
but

198
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
how long do you want to live here?

199
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
How long do you want to live here?

200
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
You don't spend money?

201
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Of course, I always say

202
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,920
what I want to say.

203
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
You are a good friend.

204
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
It's the first time we met yesterday.

205
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,920
I think you are familiar with it.

206
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Have we ever met before?

207
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,920
We have met in the past.

208
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
You are very young.

209
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
You are very young.

210
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,920
I don't know if you are a good friend.

211
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Or you have a good friend.

212
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
We have a small family.

213
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
We have a good wife and parents.

214
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
We don't have a good teacher.

215
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,920
We are from the Jianghu family.

216
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
If you are a good friend,

217
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
tell me about it.

218
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I have a lot of secrets.

219
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,920
People are walking in the Jianghu.

220
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Of course, there are some things I don't want to say.

221
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
For example,

222
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,920
the real purpose of coming to the capital.

223
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Of course, I'm kidding.

224
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Didn't you invite me here?

225
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Yes, I forgot.

226
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,920
I didn't want to kill people.

227
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I didn't want to do anything.

228
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,920
I thought of an old case.

229
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
What case?

230
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
12 years ago,

231
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Li Zuo's house was closed.

232
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
The house was closed.

233
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.

234
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.

235
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.

236
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.

237
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.

238
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.

239
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.

240
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.

241
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.

242
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,920
I don't even know.

243
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.

244
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.

245
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,920
At least I've made a good one.

246
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,920
I don't know how to read this.

247
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.

248
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,920
I don't know if it's a good idea.
