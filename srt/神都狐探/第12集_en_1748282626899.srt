2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If you have any guesses, just say it.

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Even if the royal family is a state,

4
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
if they break the law,

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
they will be punished in accordance with the law.

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The saint is worried too much.

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It has nothing to do with the people in the court.

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Instead, they are just some small people in the martial arts world.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They dare to compare themselves to the three emperors and the five emperors.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I think this case may be related to them.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I will definitely pull them together.

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Even if they are not in the flow,

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
they are trying to subvert the society.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You have to find evidence as soon as possible.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The deadline is now three days.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You only caught the little Luoluo who was doing the following.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But if you don't get rid of the mastermind,

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm afraid there will be similar events in the future.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I obey your order.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Drink it.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Thank you, merchant.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Be gentle.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is there anything to be taken initiative?

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You will regret it if I take the initiative.

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Come here.

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The mastermind is not the real master behind the Phoenix case.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There is someone else behind it.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes, continue talking.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Continue talking?

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't stand it.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I was just about to ask who the real master behind it was.

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You just appeared.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But I can feel that person

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
should have a close relationship with the court.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The court has come out.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Jianxing, can we stop being so reckless?

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Isn't it you behind the Blood God Sect?

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So this is your guess?

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is the truth.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The evidence is solid. I saw it with my own eyes.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Can't you use your brain to think about it?

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If he is my subordinate, why should I interrogate him?

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How do I know why you are acting?

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Tell me, why did you enter the Court of Judicial Review?

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't shout so loudly.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Did Mr. Hu invite me here?

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Weren't you here that day?

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Why didn't you say anything?

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you don't say anything, I will torture you.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I will torture you.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is the dungeon of the Court of Judicial Review,

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
not the place you can act.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I want to see what you have.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wait!

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Sir.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sir.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Zeng Sheng, you go out first.

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Sir, give me some more time.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I will ask him right away.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How?

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
By beating Chengzhao?

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sir.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Sir, although this kid has been hurt every day,

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
he may be a poor man.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Are you going to disobey my order?

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I dare not.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Sir.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Jianxing.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I remember when we first met,

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I told you

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
that you came to Luoyang to find trouble.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I shouldn't have asked you

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
because it's your personal matter.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But now,

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I have to ask you again.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What is this trouble?

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I told you.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's just a little trouble in the world.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You want to investigate the case of the Gate-shattering 12 years ago.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is a big trouble.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Gate-shattering case?

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
How can I not understand?

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't you want to know

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
how I saw it?

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Sir, you are wrong.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You agreed to come to Dali Temple

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
because of the Phoenix case.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I thought at that time

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
you wanted to investigate something.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And the clue

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
of the Phoenix case

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
is only two.

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Phoenix and blood poison.

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I used the flame fire to test the case.

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You seem not interested.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But the blood poison is different.

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Especially after we found the Blood God Sect,

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
you started to act without permission.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Tell me.

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What is your relationship

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
with General Li Zuo?

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Great.

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You are really a good person.

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Since you have guessed it,

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I can only tell the truth.

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
My father

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
is actually

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
General Li Zuo's

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
old friend.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
When my father died,

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
he thought

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
General Li Zuo was killed by a villain.

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He told me

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
to find out the truth

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
of General Li and his family

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
who were killed by the villain.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And catch the murderer.

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
When I first came to Luoyang,

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
General Li took good care of me.

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He is a good person.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He is also my benefactor.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You have such a connection.

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The internal case.

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
These years,

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I have been asking the Dali Temple to investigate.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
the same as our goal.

128
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What?

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You don't trust me?

130
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Of course I trust you.

131
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Since you said so,

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
let me help you.

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's solve the mystery of that year.

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Go.

135
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Get in.

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Go.

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I heard

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
what you said to Hu Zhengyi.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Master,

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
it's not good to listen to the gossip.

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I didn't expect

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
General Li and your friends

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
would be so close.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I still can't forget him.

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You never forget your brother.

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Since you have heard

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
what I said to Hu Zhengyi,

148
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
you should know

149
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that we have reached an agreement.

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So I will go out soon.

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Master,

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
as long as you tell me

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
who is behind this,

154
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I can think about it.

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I will help you and spare your life.

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Whether you live or die,

157
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm afraid you can't decide.

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I didn't ask you

159
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
about the case of Xue Fenghuang.

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Besides, the case

161
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
was already closed.

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Tell me.

163
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I can't solve it.

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Is this the reason?

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
All right.

166
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I will tell you

167
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
everything I know.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Shut up!

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Don't talk to him.

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You are in prison.

171
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
How dare you be so arrogant?

172
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
If you dare to say another word,

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I will punish you.

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Come on.

175
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Fatty, why are you out?

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I have a stomachache.

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I ate too much at noon.

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Please help me to check.

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I need to go to the bathroom.

180
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's not the time for changing shifts.

181
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Right.

182
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No, no.

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
White sugar!

184
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
White sugar!

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The case of Xue Fenghuang

186
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The case of Xue Fenghuang

187
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The case of Xue Fenghuang

188
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The case of Xue Fenghuang
