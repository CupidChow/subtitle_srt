1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The red-and-white magic band of Luoyang City,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
has disappeared from the world.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And their most famous performance is

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
the magic spell.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The magic spell?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
When they disappeared,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
it was very likely that they were used by Sun Cheng Jing

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to create the Phoenix and the Rites.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And after the Rites' incident happened,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
they lost their cause.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I guessed that they were supposed to be killed.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And it seems that they still have a living thing left.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And this living thing is the Zai Yi from the Nine-Land.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No wonder the Tang Guan from the Nine-Land is just their gang of brothers.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Zai Yi is responsible for creating the Phoenix's Rites.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And there's also someone responsible for killing and moving the corpse.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So, it's useless to catch one or two people.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Or else, all the people in this world will be killed.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Brother Jian Xing,

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I have to ask you to help me.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I suspect that they should have a secret room downstairs.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You need to find this secret room.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Sir, I remember that you like to eat grilled chicken the most.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If I hadn't caught that rabbit chicken,

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you wouldn't have found that the warehouse was in trouble.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Right?

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We have a hard time at work.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I promise that I will never gamble again.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If he says so,

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
that rabbit chicken is not a good idea.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're comparing me to a rabbit chicken?

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Calm down.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But the main thing is that

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
you're not going to get caught.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't sleep, sir.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I have something to ask you.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Sir, he's dead.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Looks like we guessed it right.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's just that I came here.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What should we do now?

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Then we have to ask him.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Come out.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Murderer, murderer, murderer.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Murderer.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't be nervous.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What did you see?

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I saw someone.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I saw someone.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Murderer.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Who?

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I didn't see it clearly.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You didn't see anything in a yard?

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't kill me.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I really didn't see anything.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't be nervous.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If he saw it clearly,

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
he should be in a position to be executed.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sir, what should we do now?

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We have to thank the murderers.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's strange.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Since there's blood smell in the yard,

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can smell it.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Unless...

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Unless what?

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Unless the secret room is in the entrance and the lower floor.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If the wind blows, the smell of blood will be blown away.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now this season,

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Luoyang is in the east and south.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Then what about the secret room?

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's in the northwest.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Qingcao.

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Zhang Mu'er.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Zhang Mu'er.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Zhang Mu'er.

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Zhang Mu'er.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Blood smell.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Where is it?

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is the Shilin Ji.

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Sir, isn't this the phoenix I caught?

95
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Did you see anything?

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Blood smell.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Blood smell.

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Blood smell.

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Wuzhao Cangqiong.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wuzhao Cangqiong.

101
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Ji Meng Ci Guang.

102
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Ji Meng Ci Guang.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Long live the emperor.

104
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What the hell are you doing?

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You are trying to break my leg.

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Protect the emperor.

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Kill them.

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Come on.

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The emperor is so helpless.

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The emperor is testing us.

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The emperor is trying to save us.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes.

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Sir, how is it?

114
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Still alive?

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Still want to run?

116
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Listen to me.

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Who is the master behind this?

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Blood poison from the river.

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why do you need so much blood?

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What the hell are you doing?

121
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I won't say anything.

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll kill you.

123
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Wait.

124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Brother Jian Jing.

125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Brother Jian Jing.

126
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You asked so many questions.

127
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
How could he answer?

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I only asked you.

129
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Why do you need so much blood?

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You asked me.

131
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I told you.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Or I didn't tell you.

133
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm telling you the truth.

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Or I'm telling you the truth.

135
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What?

136
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have some blood.

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What do you mean?

138
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You are so weird.

139
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You are so weird.

140
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You are so weird.

141
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You are so weird.

142
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If you don't say anything,

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
don't blame me for being rude to you.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm a god.

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm not dead.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't be so impulsive.

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You are not afraid of death?

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes.

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What about them?

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What about them?

151
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
If he doesn't say anything,

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
why do you need blood?

153
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm the one who killed him.

154
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm the one who killed him.

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You are so weird.

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You are so weird.

157
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You are so weird.

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You are so weird.

159
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Hold his hand.

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm dead.

161
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm dead.

162
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm dead.

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The End
