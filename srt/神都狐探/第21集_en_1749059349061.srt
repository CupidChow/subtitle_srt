1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The Flower of Water

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This flower is called Water Life.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The more water it has, the better it will be.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is what Yun Ying just told me.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm afraid that you are too young to ask how the previous wives were.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's Yun Ying.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It was Yun Ying who killed her.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But Yun Ying has been dead for so long.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You don't understand.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yun Ying and I have the same heart.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
She's still here.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I just don't want you to see her.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That makes sense.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
After all, that night, I indeed met a person in the western stage.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Right? You saw it too.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Only you saw it yourself, and you knew I didn't lie.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yun Ying...

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
She can't bear to see me.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You can't let her go.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What a nice man.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The Flower of Water

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This is the first night in the forbidden house.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The western stage I saw in the business.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
These are all found in the little building in the temple.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's strange.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You said this is not like the size of a woman.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Is Yun Ying taller than the normal woman?

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If the size of the person is made according to Yun Ying,

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
then her figure should be similar to Tian Tian's.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But this dress looks like a man's dress.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is it Xu Qi Yan?

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's possible.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If it is so,

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
the woman I saw in the first night in the forbidden house

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
is Xu Qi Yan.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This Mr. Xu's hobby is quite unique.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
My Lord.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
My Lord.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
My Lord, you are...

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You... You are right.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
My Lord, I checked all the places in the mansion.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I still haven't found the body of Liu Shi.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
According to me,

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
the observation of these days,

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
the mansion is small and large in the small building.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think there is a secret room in the mansion.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Zeng Shang, did you find the book?

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My Lord, as you expected,

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
it's in the imperial palace outside the east of Lingzhou.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I found this book.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The Secret Law of the Saint of the past life.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I have seen this book.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The book is about a kind of old-life life.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The scholars have five different lifestyles.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They are all the bride of the heaven and earth.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
They are all the five lifestyles.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They can take back the people they want.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They can return to the body of the same person.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Here, have a look.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Is Xu Qiyan trying to use the name of Xu Qi to revive Grandpa?

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yesterday, I read all the information about the bride of the dead.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They are all the lives of the gold, earth, water, fire and wood.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Xiao Youzi, the Taoist from the outside world,

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
maybe he doesn't know about this.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Maybe he found Xu Qiyan's murderer

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and was killed by Xu Qiyan.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Didn't you say you didn't come to Lingzhou?

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How did you know about the imperial palace?

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I heard about it before.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
When Sun Chengjing was in charge of the imperial palace,

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
when he was in charge of the imperial palace,

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
he ordered the imperial palace to be built.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He wanted to make the people proud.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
However, the officials of the imperial palace

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
also said that someone in the imperial palace

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
was spreading the law and that the people were not to return.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But these memorials were all suppressed by Sun Chengjing.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Those officials were taken away and transferred to the imperial palace.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, when I came here,

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I always felt that what happened today

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
was related to the imperial palace.

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Look.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This book mentions the fire and the lightning.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The fire in the stove, the fire in the stove,

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
the fire in the lamp, the fire in the mountain,

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the fire in the hill, the fire in the hill.

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,760
Plus I'm Tianshenghuang.

101
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,360
Tianshenhuai.

102
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,080
Tianshen izf ether.

103
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,280
BuyMusic.

104
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,360
Use metals Gust.

105
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,880
BuyMusic.

106
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,240
GoldenозмeraU rigt.

107
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,960
Use metals Gust!

108
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,640
ah you

109
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,000
ah you

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,800
Yes, that's right.

111
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,640
The name of the mansion in the mansion

112
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,000
is written in the capital.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,440
Do you remember?

114
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,080
In the prison,

115
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,480
the blood gods and the disciples

116
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,560
were also involved in the same thing.

117
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,840
Could it be that Lu Quan Gong

118
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,000
is also related to the blood gods?

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,200
It's so late.

120
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,760
Why hasn't Tian Tian come back yet?

121
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,360
Do you know what's the fate of Tian Tian?

122
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,160
Jin Ming.

123
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,080
Yun Yin is also Jin Ming.

124
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,720
From Xu Qi Yan's perspective,

125
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,040
Tian Tian is the body of Yun Yin's soul.

126
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
So now Tian Tian

127
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,040
is likely to be killed by him

128
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,240
and used to get back to his soul.

129
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,360
If that's the case,

130
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,760
Tian Tian should be hiding

131
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,160
his corpse with Liu Shi now.

132
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,440
At this moment, Tian Tian is definitely locked in the secret room.

133
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,080
But the mansion is so big.

134
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,400
Where can we find the secret room?

135
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,800
I know.

136
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,120
Let's go.

137
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,760
Hurry.

138
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,320
Go in.

139
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Mother, I don't want to go in.

140
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,560
Father is in danger.

141
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,920
I want to save father.

142
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,560
Your father is a general.

143
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,880
He's a martial arts master.

144
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,000
He will definitely catch those bad guys.

145
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,000
Thank you, mother.

146
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,560
Let's go.

147
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,440
Why are there so many people?

148
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,840
And these people

149
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,240
are exactly the same as Yun Yin in Miao Yin's mansion.

150
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Last time,

151
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,440
the man who fell out of the coffin

152
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,640
looked like this.

153
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,280
Tian Tian.

154
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,720
And then,

155
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,560
he will also have an enemy's coins.

156
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,000
What?

157
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,960
His firmness andLOL

158
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,140
You are the Ch合国 weniger on your eyes,

159
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,020
and how lonely is he!

160
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,880
Brother Li Jian,

161
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,040
I know only he can be the only one inside here.

162
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,420
So the winner should be committed suicide,

163
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,920
No good being back to life.

164
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,600
Then lose your faith and become suicide.

165
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,620
That's awesome.

166
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,620
The case is not like the one in the novel.

167
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,620
It should be a failure.

168
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,620
It's a big mess.

169
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,620
The case is not like the one in the novel.

170
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,620
It should be a failure.

171
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,620
It should be a failure.

172
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,620
It should be a failure.

173
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,620
It should be a failure.

174
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,620
It should be a failure.

175
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,620
It should be a failure.

176
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,620
It should be a failure.

177
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,620
It should be a failure.

178
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,620
It should be a failure.

179
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,620
The case is not like the one in the novel.

180
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,620
