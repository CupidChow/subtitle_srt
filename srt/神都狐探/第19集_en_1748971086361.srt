1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
A series of

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:22,260
Chaos

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,060
The first...

4
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,360
It's ruined.

5
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,060
Are you kidding me?

6
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,260
The truth

7
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,700
is that��� log,

8
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,740
can't play it

9
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,460
without your safety.

10
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,100
Didn't you see owe me?

11
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,340
One more.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,540
A cute girl

13
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,580
who is nothing outside.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
What a weird art.

15
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,440
An lovely girl

16
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,780
tighter than the public eye.

17
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,720
Soon,

18
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,200
you will meet

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,200
the god

20
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,260
Anx species

21
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,140
in your home.

22
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,660
See what end result was?

23
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,180
Fan Cai.

24
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,620
Lady,

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
I swear on God!

26
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,840
TAI is strong forn tinha,

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,640
TAT I will reliable birthing .

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,080
Cherubin!

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,080
It doesn't have a smell of ashes.

30
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Even if the room is cleaned,

31
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,080
it can still smell the ashes.

32
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,080
It's not likely to be on the stage

33
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
after the dead body is buried.

34
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,080
You didn't smell anything else?

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,080
It's all the smell of the dead body.

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,080
There's nothing special about it.

37
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Let's go out and have a look.

38
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,080
The dead body is on the stage.

39
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,080
The dead body is on the stage.

40
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
It's not far.

41
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
It's said that

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
the dead body will be buried in the hole.

43
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,080
But this old hole

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,080
doesn't look like the one in the wedding room.

45
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,080
The wedding room only has a chair with a bed.

46
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,080
It's not convenient to move around

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,080
and to use the upper part.

48
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,080
According to Qiao'er,

49
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,080
the bride should have never left the wedding room.

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,080
Then this hole

51
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,080
could it be a murderer

52
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,080
who moved from other places

53
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,080
to commit suicide for the sake of the dead body?

54
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,080
I don't know.

55
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Two days ago,

56
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
the bride died in the West Sea.

57
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,080
It's so scary.

58
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
They slept so well these days.

59
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,080
I'm wondering if they want to leave the house.

60
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Do you want to walk with me every day?

61
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
You two, get up.

62
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
You're busy.

63
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Sit. Sit.

64
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Okay.

65
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
Well,

66
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,080
let me ask you something.

67
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Is there any hole like this

68
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
in our house?

69
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
There are many holes like this

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
in the house.

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
It's possible that anyone can move out and do something.

72
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
It's too sunny.

73
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Then, last night,

74
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,080
in this kitchen,

75
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
how many people were there?

76
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Last night,

77
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Zhen'er, Lian'er,

78
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
they all went back to rest.

79
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Is there anyone in the middle

80
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
to help?

81
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Everyone was busy last night.

82
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
I didn't pay much attention

83
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
to the work.

84
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
By the way,

85
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Qiao'er came here.

86
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
By the way,

87
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
didn't you forget

88
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
that Qiao'er

89
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,080
was the red person in front of the old lady?

90
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
The sun came out from the West Sea yesterday.

91
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
She came out to help

92
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
the people who were in such a hurry.

93
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Qiao'er is so kind.

94
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
So kind?

95
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,080
We don't know what she thinks.

96
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
She is a good person.

97
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
She is very kind.

98
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,080
Usually, she doesn't stick to the old lady.

99
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
She just sticks to Mr. Qi Yan.

100
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Maybe

101
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
she is the one who wants to kill her.

102
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Don't talk nonsense.

103
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Zhen'er,

104
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
why are you still helping her

105
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
when you are a maid?

106
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
I...

107
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
I thought I could help her

108
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
and make her a good meal.

109
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
I... I didn't.

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
Sister Liao,

111
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
stop arguing.

112
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
No need.

113
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Have some tea.

114
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Have some tea.

115
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Then, how long

116
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
did Qiao'er

117
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
go back

118
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
after helping her?

119
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
At that time,

120
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,080
the chef made a lamb pancake.

121
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
It was only two hours.

122
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Then, I went back to her wedding room.

123
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
I could take the photo.

124
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,080
Qiao'er didn't do anything.

125
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Then,

126
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
when you went back to her wedding room,

127
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
did you bring any stool?

128
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
We were all cutting vegetables.

129
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
And when we saw the corpse,

130
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
the stool

131
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
was already under the bride's feet.

132
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Have some tea.

133
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Have some tea.

134
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,080
If, as she said,

135
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Qiao'er stayed in the kitchen for two hours,

136
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
that means

137
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
after I and Tian Tian finished the meal,

138
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Qiao'er stayed in the wedding room

139
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
for less than half an hour.

140
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,080
So, she went back to her kitchen.

141
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,080
It was not enough time for her to finish the meal.

142
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Then, she was transferred to the waiting room.

143
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
If the bride

144
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
died in three days,

145
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
no matter what the cause is,

146
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
she will not be able to get the crown.

147
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Who will the murderer be

148
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,080
in this wedding room?

149
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
The room is not in good condition.

150
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
The scent of the rouge

151
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
is from the wedding room.

152
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
The bride

153
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
was in the room

154
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
and was in the kitchen.

155
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
She was in the room.

156
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
She was in the room.

157
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
She was in the room.

158
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
She was in the room.

159
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
She was in the room.

160
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
The bride was in the room.

161
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Why was the rouge

162
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
in the room?

163
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Is she afraid that

164
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
I will not be in the room?

165
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
It seems that the murderer

166
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
will put the bride in the bed

167
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
and put the ring on the room.

168
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
The bride will be in the room

169
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
and lose her balance.

170
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
The bride will be in the room.

171
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
The bride will be in the room.

172
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
That's right.

173
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
This is like a fixed murder.

174
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
So,

175
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
it's not right to prove

176
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
that you are not in the room.

177
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Such a high room,

178
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
how did the murderer

179
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
put the bride in the room?

180
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Unless...

181
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Unless he has a job.

182
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
I don't see him.

183
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
I can use a ladder.

184
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Why are you so messy?

185
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
You always

186
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
look like a fool.

187
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
You seem to be familiar with this place.

188
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
We are close.

189
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Be careful.

190
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
The murderer

191
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
put the ladder on the room.

192
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Although Liu Shi is a little bit delicate,

193
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,080
it's hard to hold a woman in the room.

194
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Mrs. Xu will not be able to hold her.

195
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,080
The maid in the house is also very strong.

196
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Xu Qian and the housekeeper are always in the front.

197
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
The chef is always in the kitchen.

198
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
They don't have time to do the case.

199
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,080
The biggest suspect is that little demon.

200
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Last night, he was not in the room.

201
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,080
He was also in the room.

202
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
Only if he doesn't stop,

203
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,080
he will not stop making money.

204
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
So,

205
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
he has been in the house for a long time.

206
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,080
He has been in the housekeeper's side.

207
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,080
I will go back to that little demon now.

208
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
The murderer! The murderer!

209
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
Hurry up, the ladder is burnt.

210
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Hurry up, let's go.

211
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
There is a question about the body.

212
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
It should be just died.

213
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,080
But what do you find?

214
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
I have searched the dead state.

215
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,080
I didn't find anyone suspicious.

216
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
The big man is dead.

217
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
The demon is too strong.

218
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Shut up, don't leave.

219
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
The big man is dead.

220
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Is there really a ghost in the house?

221
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Madam, don't worry.

222
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Tomorrow, I will find a more powerful Taoist.

223
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
I will do the magic.

224
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,080
Where is Hu?

225
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,080
I didn't see him either.

226
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
What happened?

227
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
He is dead again.

228
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Where is he?

229
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
Why are you with him?

230
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
I was lost.

231
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,080
I was looking for the way back.

232
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Tian Tian, you...

233
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Tian, what are you doing?

234
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Come, come, come.

235
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
Come.

236
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
The dead is dead.

237
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,080
The dead should have been hit by a strong blow.

238
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
They were killed.

239
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,080
It seems that the soul is dead.

240
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
It's just a lie.

241
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,080
The real murderer is in this yard.

242
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
What are you doing?

243
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
I am just trying to find out.

244
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
I am just trying to find out.

245
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
He is in this yard.

246
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
The dead is dead.

247
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,080
