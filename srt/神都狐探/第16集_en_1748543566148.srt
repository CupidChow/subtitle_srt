8
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,200
Sit down, please.

9
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,200
You're a guard.

10
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,800
How can you be invited?

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,640
Please.

12
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,840
Mr. Fog,

13
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,840

14
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,840
you can have more.

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,880
Thank you, Madam.

16
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,600
Come on.

17
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,960
Let's have a toast.

18
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,600
Okay.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,720
Thank you.

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,840
Please.

21
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,440
Madam,

22
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,440
why didn't Mr. Ling come?

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,600
He's not feeling well.

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,120
I'll be the one to entertain you tonight.

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Mr. Xu is so lucky.

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,440
I heard that this bride

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,120
is very beautiful.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
I just calculated that

29
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,760
around half year of the year her

30
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,760
blessings have run out,

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,540
he can 어떻게

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,440
earn a good fortune.

33
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,640
Don't mention it.

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,440
Just enjoy the meal.

35
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,640
Nobodymaruj izn't we sad to you?

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
We wouldn't mind.

37
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,200
Please.

38
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,640
Mm.

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,240
Why are you so jealous?

40
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,120
Are you from Shanxi?

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,160
Yes, yes.

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,160
I'm from Bingzhou, Shanxi.

43
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
We're from the same hometown.

44
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,080
I've traveled around the world since I left the mountain.

45
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,480
I didn't expect to meet you here today.

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,240
It's fate.

47
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,880
Please.

48
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,120
Cheers.

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,920
Good wine.

50
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,180
As I know,

51
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,200
the wine in Jingyang is very lovely.

52
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,460
Have you ever thought about

53
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,400
the​​ahren Judy​​?

54
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,040
As a drunkist like me,

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,320
I want to be

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,120
You can be carefree and carefree all your life.

57
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Why bother going back to your hometown?

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
That makes sense.

59
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Please, please, please.

60
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,620
Please.

61
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
Come, come.

62
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
What's wrong?

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Don't bother.

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Enjoy your meal.

65
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
I'll go to the wind chimes.

66
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Enjoy your meal.

67
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
I'm coming.

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Don't follow me.

69
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
This...

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Continue eating.

71
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Come.

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Drink.

73
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
I have one son and one daughter.

74
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
I'm not very good at teaching.

75
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm ashamed.

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
Very good.

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Drink.

78
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
Please, Mr. Hou.

79
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
You're drinking so fast.

80
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Li Jianxing.

81
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
You're really a big trouble.

82
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
You've only known her for a few days.

83
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
And you're already doing this.

84
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Just tell her that you two are married.

85
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Why is someone singing?

86
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
It's so late.

87
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Who's singing?

88
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Yunyin.

89
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Yunyin?

90
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Sorry.

91
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
It's too late.

92
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
I've got the wrong person.

93
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
You are...

94
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,320
I'm Xu Qiyan.

95
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
So you're Mr. Xu.

96
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,320
I didn't mean to break in.

97
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
I'm just fooling around.

98
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,320
I was just there when I heard someone singing.

99
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
So I came to see.

100
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Do you like to listen to the opera?

101
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Well...

102
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
I'm leaving.

103
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Wait.

104
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Miss Lailai.

105
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Let me see you off.

106
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,320
May I ask your birthday?

107
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Mr. Xu, you're kidding.

108
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,320
I don't have a birthday to ask you.

109
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
I'd better go back by myself.

110
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Yunyin.

111
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
You'll be back soon.

112
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Soon.

113
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Please have a seat.

114
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
I'm a little tired.

115
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,320
I have to arrange the wedding tomorrow morning.

116
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,320
I'll leave you alone.

117
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Thank you.

118
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
I'll see you tomorrow.

119
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Bye.

120
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Good.

121
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Thank you.

122
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Go on.

123
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Let's have another drink.

124
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
Yes.

125
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
Please have a seat.

126
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Enjoy.

127
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
Here.

128
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Please.

129
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Fill it up.

130
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
Yes.

131
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
We're friends.

132
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
Let's drink.

133
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Come on.

134
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Let's toast.

135
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
Let's drink.

136
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Come on.

137
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Come on.

138
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Cheers.

139
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Cheers.

140
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Sit.

141
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
What's wrong?

142
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Do you still remember what happened here?

143
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,320
We just came to Lingzhou.

144
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,320
But we don't know the truth.

145
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,320
We hope you can help us.

146
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,320
Actually, there's a ghost here.

147
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,320
You mean the ghost from the General's Mansion 12 years ago?

148
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,320
We've heard a lot of stories like this.

149
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,320
You only know one thing, not the other.

150
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:48,320
The second thing is that the eldest son of the Xu family, Xu Qiyan,

151
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,320
married a woman in his early years.

152
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Her name is Yunying.

153
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,320
After marriage, they were very close.

154
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
But for some reason,

155
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
within a year,

156
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,320
the woman named Yunying was born.

157
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,320
So you mean the ghost of the General's Mansion killed Yunying?

158
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
If you analyze it like this,

159
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,320
it's not logical.

160
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Think about it.

161
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,320
The ghost of the General's Mansion was born more than ten years ago.

162
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,320
If the ghost of the General's Mansion is really born,

163
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
why have they been quiet for so many years?

164
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,320
But when it suddenly appears in the last two years,

165
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,320
it will harm a woman who has nothing to do with it.

166
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,320
In order to find out the truth,

167
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,320
I will open the heaven's eye.

168
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,320
I looked at the ghost's eyes.

169
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,320
And guess what?

170
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
What?

171
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Then I saw that ghost was actually a ghost.

172
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:36,320
And the time of death is only three or five years.

173
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,320
You mean the ghost of the Xu family is Yunying?

174
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,320
If Xu Qiyan and Yunying really love each other,

175
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,320
she was taken care of and died of illness.

176
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
I ask you,

177
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,320
why do you have such a big injustice

178
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
and become a ghost?

179
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,320
How do you know she died of illness?

180
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
