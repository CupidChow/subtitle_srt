1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Strange.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I've never seen this poison before.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Master, the powder on your body is the Yan Shi's powder.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The Yan Shi is the Yin Huang.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Zeng Sheng, here.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Follow me.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Zeng Sheng, go find a tree.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Here.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Don't shout out your name later.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I won't take care of you if you get married.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Give it to me.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll give you a life.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You'll be my foster father.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Blood poison, I've heard it all.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Now, it's just a temporary poison.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It won't spread all over the body in a short time.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But, this is just a temporary skill.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You can't follow it.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's okay.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll find the body behind it.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's go back.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll be gone if you don't leave.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't want to stay here.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's go.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Master, it's not good.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ghost!

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ghost!

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Ghost!

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Master!

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What's wrong, Master?

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What happened?

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Ghost!

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A shameless ghost.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ghost!

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Nonsense!

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Where did the ghost come from?

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
A shameless ghost.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He just came back.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is the ghost you said you didn't see?

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's weird.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I didn't see it just now.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's just a wound.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's been too many days since the death.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This body is different from other bodies.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Other bodies have been removed.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And this body

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
still has a lot of blood.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We left the hotel

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
for less than half an hour.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
In this way,

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
there's a new murderer.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This dead man is not easy to hurt.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But he can use his own skills

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
to get out of the Palace of the Deceased.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I've never seen such a skill in my childhood.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There are still people like him in the martial arts world.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The skill of Daoist Master is very good.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I heard that he has a daughter.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
She's a genius.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
She's a great skill.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They're out of the Maqiao.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Sir.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Virginia, we've got people.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's poison.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's poison.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They're all dead.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I heard everybody has a mother.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
They're alive.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's real.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:47,160
Really.

86
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,200
Elixir

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,200
chorus

88
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,640
chorus

89
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,260
Brother

90
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
It's a rare opportunity.

91
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
It's hard to explain.

92
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Mr. Hu,

93
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,160
this Chunyang Sword is my only

94
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
unique sword that can be used to make a sword.

95
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
It seems that they have passed the sword

96
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
to their daughter.

97
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
I'll go to the sword tonight.

98
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Sword?

99
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,160
Why don't you go to the White Sky?

100
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,160
The place where they live is a ghost world.

101
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
You can't go in the White Sky.

102
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Ghost world?

103
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
What kind of ghost world?

104
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Let's go together, okay?

105
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,160
I've never heard of this ghost world before.

106
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Have you been there?

107
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Where are so many flowers?

108
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Are you going to love it?

109
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,160
What's the situation?

110
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Brother Jin Jin, are you okay?

111
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
I'm fine.

112
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
I didn't expect it.

113
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Within a day,

114
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,160
you saved me twice.

115
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,160
I owe you a life.

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Mr. Hu,

117
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
maybe one day,

118
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,160
I'll really let you go.

119
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
I'll let you go.

120
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
I'll let you go.

121
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
I'll let you go.

122
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
I'll let you go.

123
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Okay.

124
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
As long as you don't betray Dao Yi and Yuan Ze,

125
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
you can make the conditions.

126
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Just kidding.

127
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Hu Dair doesn't need to be too suspicious.

128
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Okay.

129
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
This...

130
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Who is the one who wants to assassinate me?

131
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
This sword

132
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,160
is the same as the one that was shot down by Dali Temple.

133
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
This is the weapon of the Chue Ying.

134
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
The Chue Bird.

135
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,160
It's usually raised in the north of Chong Bei.

136
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
The old court of Jun Bei Temple.

137
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
I think

138
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
some of you

139
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,160
have long been unable to see the corruption of Dali Temple.

140
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
You must eliminate it.

141
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
It seems that

142
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,160
it's not a big deal to eliminate it in the court.

143
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
You're so smart.

144
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
You smell it.

145
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
I'm not a dog.

146
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
You said you'd smell it.

147
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
You're a dangerous man.

148
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
You've saved my life twice.

149
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
We're brothers.

150
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Smell it.

151
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
Hurry up.

152
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
Smell it and you'll be safe.

153
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Right?

154
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
It should be a painting.

155
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
A painting?

156
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Right.

157
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
The knife is on the other side.

158
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
This is the sword

159
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
of the Yang Zhou Army,

160
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
a five-year-old junior.

161
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Maybe that's

162
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
the one that was shot down by the Chue Bird.

163
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
You're overthinking.

164
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
You can't explain

165
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,160
that it's only a sword.

166
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Besides,

167
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
the arrow is already lost.

168
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
We don't know how many times we want to use it.

169
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
I understand.

170
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
But tonight,

171
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,520
There's something wrong with Moong Wei.

172
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,980
Words are uncannποιable from his death.

173
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,840
The one who took the throne is alive.

174
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,660
Is now holding us back.

175
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,500
Oh, lord.

176
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,060
Even you broke the rake,

177
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,520
you had no chance to win.

178
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,880
But suspension of Feng of式,

179
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,000
no matter how many problems you have,

180
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,020
you will have made great deal

181
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,980
after becoming a physician.

182
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Wait for me!

183
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
This is the ghost market.

184
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
It's a place for the homeless.

185
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Mr. Wu,

186
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
there are many people here.

187
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
They can be found anywhere.

188
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Be careful.

189
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
No wonder.

190
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,160
This place is a great place.

191
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
By the way,

192
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
why do you know so much about this place?

193
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,160
I don't know much about the court.

194
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,160
But I know you are a good match for the whole world.

195
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Is that so?

196
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Of course.

197
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
If you don't have me,

198
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,160
you will never find a good match for this ghost market.

199
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,160
You are the one who taught me this.

200
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
You know me well.

201
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
You are so kind.

202
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
This way, sir.

203
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
Excuse me.

204
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Where do you live?

205
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,160
You are the two masters of the world.

206
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Mr. Wu,

207
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,160
I won't tell you.

208
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
I tell you,

209
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
these are all the things you can't see.

210
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,160
They are all the enemies.

211
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
You can't go anywhere.

212
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
You are the one who killed me.

213
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
If it's for the revenge,

214
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
it will be a big deal.

215
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,160
It seems that you are the mastermind here.

216
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
What?

217
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Who is that?

218
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
I'm sorry.

221
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
I'm sorry.

224
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
I'm sorry.

233
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
I'm sorry.

235
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
I'm sorry.
