1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:57,120
Yeah.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

3
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,520
Yeah

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah

5
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,680
Yeah

6
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,240
A

7
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,520
No

8
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,480
C

9
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
You

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:54,240
A

11
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,260
You've used enough food to escape and gone in so fast?

12
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,040
Yes!

13
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,200
Lord Hu,

14
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,560
maybe you got sick after doing something good.

15
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,360
Don't you think so?

16
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,240
I saw it!

17
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,260
Stop!

18
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,420
Mr. Xu!

19
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,280
Give it to me!!!

20
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,680
It was all because of you

21
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,880
who used the evil outs Pandora Spear to destroy me.

22
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
I can't let Yunying...

23
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Mr. Xu, you misunderstood me!

24
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I did this

25
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,240
to make Yunying feel at ease!

26
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
You...

27
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
How dare you!

28
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Stop!

29
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
What are you doing?

30
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Madam Xu!

31
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
Madam Xu, you're finally here!

32
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,240
If you let Ling Lang continue to do this,

33
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,240
I won't be able to live anymore!

34
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Just now,

35
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,240
I heard the sound of the singing opera

36
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,360
from the

37
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,240
other side of the mountain.

38
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
I heard it.

39
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
Look!

40
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
I heard it too.

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Then,

42
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,240
it's the ghost of Yunying's wife who is in the way!

43
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,240
The other ladies in front of her were all killed by her!

44
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
You're so cruel!

45
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Stop fighting!

46
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,240
How long are you going to be obsessed with that woman?

47
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
She won't let go of your newly married wife

48
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,240
because she wants to make our Xu family a family of sons and grandsons!

49
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
You don't understand.

50
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
You don't understand.

51
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Yunying cares about me.

52
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Because Yunying cares about me!

53
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
You're not allowed to see Fu Zhou again!

54
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
You...

55
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Madam Xu, look at this!

56
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
This is all my money!

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
You...

58
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
This...

59
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
How can I pay you back?

60
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
I'll pay you back.

61
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
I'll pay you back.

62
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
I'm not a saint at all.

63
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
This...

64
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
This...

65
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
Miss Qiao Er,

66
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,240
what kind of person is Xu Qi Yan's wife?

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Madam Yunying passed away before I came to the Xu family.

68
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
But ever since then,

69
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
someone in the house has heard her voice.

70
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
Our young master has never forgotten her.

71
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,240
The stage was also the stage where she sang in her previous life.

72
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
That's why I built it.

73
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
She can't forget her?

74
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
And she's still marrying?

75
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
She's not the one who wants to marry.

76
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
It's the old lady.

77
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Our young master can't live without her.

78
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,240
But if he marries a dead person,

79
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
everyone will say that

80
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
it's Madam Yunying's ghostly spirit.

81
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
She can't let her husband marry a new person.

82
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Young Master Xiao,

83
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
this house is indeed very strange.

84
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,240
I advise you to leave the temple as soon as possible.

85
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,240
Then I won't bother you any longer.

86
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,240
The sky is the witness, the moon is the match.

87
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Now the bride and groom will be married.

88
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,240
The bride and groom will be married.

89
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,240
The bride and groom will be married.

90
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
First, bow to the heaven and earth.

91
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
Second, bow to the high hall.

92
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Sir, it's a wedding.

93
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Look at these people, all crying.

94
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,240
It's because the couple is always bowing.

95
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Why didn't I hear that strange sound during the day?

96
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,240
What's wrong with the ghost during the day?

97
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,240
I think the ghost went to the underground to rest.

98
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
The ceremony is done.

99
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Tonight is destined to be an sleepless night.

100
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Don't drink too much.

101
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,240
I'll wait for the night to pass.

102
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
I want to see who she is.

103
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Good boy.

104
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Miss Qiao Er.

105
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Miss Qiao Er.

106
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Miss Qiao Er.

107
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
I lost the key to my room.

108
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Do you have spare keys?

109
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Yes.

110
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Thank you.

111
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Thank you.

112
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
I have something to do.

113
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
I'll go first.

114
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Miss Qiao Er.

115
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
May I ask you a question?

116
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,240
Did you know my brother?

117
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,240
I saw you two talking and having fun.

118
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
It seems to be a coincidence.

119
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
No, we just met.

120
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,240
You two just met and you're so close.

121
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
It's so enviable.

122
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,240
I was angry with Brother Hu Tu a few days ago.

123
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
I don't know how to apologize to him.

124
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,240
I've been observing that he likes sweet food, especially osmanthus cake.

125
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
If you want to apologize to him,

126
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
you can give him a box of osmanthus cake.

127
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
That would be great.

128
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Miss Qiao Er.

129
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Miss Qiao Er.

130
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Why are you still here?

131
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Lady Yuzhan is looking for you.

132
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Hurry up.

133
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Miss Hu, I'll go to work.

134
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Okay.

135
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,240
She even knows osmanthus cake, her favorite.

136
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
She said she didn't know him.

137
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
She's hiding something from me.

138
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Raphael Corop wins.

139
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
I only drink sake where the water is clear.

140
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,320
This

141
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
will be my bucket.

142
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Please use it.

143
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
What are you looking at?

144
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
Yun Yin is coming.

145
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Don't be afraid, it's okay.

146
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
He's always like this.

147
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
He's not a bad person.

148
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
It's just that...

149
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
There are some things that I can't forget about you.

150
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Madam, don't be afraid.

151
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
I drank too much.

152
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
I'm a little tired.

153
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Then I'll help you take off your ring.

154
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Okay.

155
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Life is full of happiness.

156
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Madam, today we are so happy to have a wedding.

157
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,240
The more we drink, the more we feel the taste.

158
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Cheers!

159
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
Madam, may I ask if you are well?

160
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Look at what you said.

161
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
You're joking.

162
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
I'm already this old.

163
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
What kind of wedding ring is that?

164
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
I'll go get the key.

165
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
I'll go too.

166
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Where are you two going?

167
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Aren't you a guard?

168
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
You drank too much.

169
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Leave it here.

170
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
I...

171
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Sir, I...

172
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Leave!

173
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Okay.

174
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Mr. Xu.

175
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Here, let me give you another toast.

176
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
