Episode 7

2
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,220
Where is she?

3
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,000
You bastard!

4
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,500
Come back here!

5
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,680
Oh,ITA!

6
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,960
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

7
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,320
Hannibalffen 그러면

8
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,600
To the first judge and lawyer in plot b

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,700
Zheng Yi

10
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,080
Witch Third

11
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,540
Herank papa

12
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,520
Watch me

13
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,760
Be ready

14
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,520
To learn

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
From this

16
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Tris

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,380
Little

18
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,360
Little

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,860
Wood

20
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,780
One

21
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,860
18 kinds of torture

22
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,860
are used on him.

23
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,860
If he feels painful,

24
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,860
he will take the medicine.

25
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,860
What?

26
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,860
Go.

27
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,860
Yes.

28
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,860
It's lucky for him

29
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,860
to take the three-leaf-ring-soul-pellet

30
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,860
of Lord Hu.

31
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,860
He can't even

32
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,860
get out of the ghost gate.

33
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,860
After he's brought back to Huanyang,

34
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,860
he will never stop

35
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,860
his painful life.

36
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,860
He'd rather die.

37
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,860
Who else wants to commit suicide?

38
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,860
Together.

39
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,860
It's good

40
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,860
to take the medicine together.

41
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,860
I...

42
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,860
I...

43
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,860
You traitor!

44
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,860
You took my godly sword!

45
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,860
You...

46
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,860
You traitor!

47
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,860
You can't die!

48
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,860
You...

49
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,860
Tell me.

50
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,860
Why did you kill him to get blood?

51
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,860
Blood fish magic

52
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,940
can keep people alive forever.

53
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,940
The Pope said

54
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,940
when blood fish magic is practiced,

55
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,940
everyone will have a share in saving the dead.

56
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,940
Then why did you

57
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,940
send the dead back to the Fulai Restaurant?

58
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,940
The people above told us

59
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,940
to send a new female corpse

60
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,940
every hour.

61
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,940
We just followed the instructions.

62
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,940
I don't know anything else.

63
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,940
Since you want so many new female corpses,

64
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,940
then

65
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,940
the Blood God Sect's main camp

66
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020
is probably

67
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,020
the only survivor.

68
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,020
Jin Xing,

69
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,020
Zeng Sheng,

70
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,020
keep searching.

71
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Yes.

72
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,020
Wait.

73
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,020
What's wrong?

74
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,020
The secret room is over there.

75
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
How do you know?

76
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,020
Trust me.

77
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,020
Let's go.

78
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,020
Let's go.

79
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
Help.

80
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,020
Tell me.

81
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,020
What are you doing?

82
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,020
Help.

83
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,020
They are not the blood fish.

84
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,020
They are the blood of Pope Lulai.

85
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
You...

86
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,020
But it has nothing to do with me.

87
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,020
You bastard.

88
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,020
Guards.

89
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,020
Yes.

90
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,020
Take them back to the Dali Temple

91
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,020
and release them.

92
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,020
Yes.

93
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
It's okay.

94
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,100
Zeng Sheng, what's wrong?

95
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
Be careful.

96
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Thank you.

97
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,100
Thank you.

98
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Are you okay?

99
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
Where is Jin Xing?

100
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,100
He was here just now.

101
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,100
Zeng Tao,

102
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,100
the Blood God is not home.

103
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,100
I knew something was wrong with Li.

104
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,100
Come with me.

105
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,100
Go.

106
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Come.

107
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,100
Master,

108
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,100
I'm kind and kind.

109
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,100
But you don't listen.

110
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,100
So I can only invite you to this place

111
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,100
and have a good talk.

112
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,100
I won't say anything.

113
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
Listen carefully

114
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
to the sound of the wind.

115
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,100
The sound of the wind.

116
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
Does it sound like the sound of a dead man crying?

117
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,100
I don't know how many lives

118
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,100
are on your back.

119
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,100
But I can tell you for sure

120
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,100
that I will bury you here tonight.

121
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,100
The tomb

122
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
is ready for you.

123
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,100
Of course,

124
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180
the head is out.

125
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,180
I think how many souls

126
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,180
will come to you

127
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,180
in this dark night.

128
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,180
How dare you!

129
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,180
How dare you touch me!

130
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,180
The Blood God has three thousand disciples.

131
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,180
I won't spare you.

132
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,180
Your sect is suspected of murder.

133
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,180
Soon the court will pull them out.

134
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,180
Think about it, Master.

135
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,180
Do you think your disciples

136
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,180
and those behind you

137
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,180
will really come to save you?

138
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,180
Why don't you answer my question

139
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,260
and let me go?

140
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,260
I'm in a good mood.

141
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,260
I can spare your life.

142
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,260
What do you want to know?

143
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,260
Listen.

144
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,260
The case of Li Zuo's house

145
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,260
was told to me 12 years ago.

146
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,260
What?

147
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,260
You are a member of the General's family?

148
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,260
Stop it.

149
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,260
I'm asking you now.

150
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,260
I really don't forget

151
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,260
the case of Li's family.

152
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,260
That day

153
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,260
was a tragic day.

154
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,260
Even General Li,

155
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,260
who could stop the King of the One Thousand Troops,

156
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,260
died in a terrible way.

157
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,260
It was a happy death.

158
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,260
That night,

159
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,260
all the people were dead.

160
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
The killers

161
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,260
were covered in blood.

162
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,340
That day,

163
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,340
I found my God

164
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,340
in the blood.

165
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,340
Wait.

166
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
You are the killers of the Twin Moon?

167
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,340
You know a lot.

168
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
Yes.

169
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,340
Before I was in the Blood Sect,

170
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,340
I was a killer of the Twin Moon.

171
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,340
Why did you attack Li Zuo's house?

172
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,340
Who ordered it?

173
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,340
It's ridiculous.

174
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,420
You are also a member of the General's family.

175
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
We are killers.

176
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
How could we ask you?

177
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,420
Let me ask you

178
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,420
a question that you must know.

179
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
Where did the blood come from?

180
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,420
You asked me.

181
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,420
Who is the master?

182
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,420
You want to know who the master is?

183
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,420
I can't tell you.

184
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
It doesn't matter if you don't want to say it.

185
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,420
It's dangerous.

186
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,420
If you don't want to say it now,

187
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,420
you will want to say it later.

188
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,420
You are crazy.

189
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,420
There are 206 bones in total.

190
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,420
I have plenty of time to play with you.

191
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,420
Say or not say.

192
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,420
Blood...

193
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,420
Blood is from the East.

194
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,420
And other sects

195
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,420
are using it secretly.

196
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,420
The Blood Sect can protect the youth.

197
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,420
I can give you the formula.

198
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,420
But you have to spare my life.

199
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
I am asking you a question.

200
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,420
Who is the master?

201
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,420
The criminal in this matter

202
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,420
is not me

203
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,420
or the Blood Sect.

204
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,420
The one in the court

205
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,420
is also told by the Blood Sect.

206
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
The one in the court?

207
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Who?

208
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Hu Zhengyi.

209
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Li Jianxing.

210
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Don't resist.

211
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Stop the music.

212
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Are you mistaken?

213
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
I am here to help with the investigation.

214
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Do you need to tie the criminal

215
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
to the wildland?

216
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,580
You are already a victim.

217
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,580
How dare you make excuses?

218
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,580
Don't try to fool me.

219
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,580
Take him back to Dali Temple.

220
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
I will go.

221
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,660
Have some tea.

222
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,660
Thank you.

223
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,660
What's wrong, Mr. Hu?

224
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,660
Do you feel hot?

225
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,660
The saint is wise.

226
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
The person involved

227
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,660
should be killed

228
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,660
and investigated.

229
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,660
Even if this person

230
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,660
has a high position.

231
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
What did you find out?

232
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,540
The

233
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,540
blood sect

234
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,540
is a place

235
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,420
where the

236
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,420
blood sect

237
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,420
is located.

238
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
The blood sect

239
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,420
is a place

240
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,420
where the

241
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,420
blood sect

242
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
is located.

243
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,420
The blood sect

244
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,420
is a place

245
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,420
where the blood sect

246
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,260
are located.

247
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,260
It is broad.

248
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:46,740
Don't go

249
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,740
out of your body.

250
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,060
Can't they

251
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,060
take affections

252
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,300
I could get уг

253
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
the new-cke famously

254
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,360
you
