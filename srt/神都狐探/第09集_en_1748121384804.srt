1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Will Cong kindly make a comment on her陽另外他放忙?

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hu Zhiyin, Hu Zhiyin!

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,920
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,320
Are you okay?

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,360
Check the file.

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,440
Why did you block the file for him?

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,640
What a great opportunity!

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,800
I'll kill him now.

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,960
It's not the time yet.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,320
Hu Zhen also wants to help me

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,560
find out the case of Li Jia.

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,720
I want to see

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,840
what kind of mystery he can find.

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,480
He did it.

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,600
What else can he find out?

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,600
You're trying to get him to come here

30
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,800
to avenge him, right?

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,440
That's right.

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,960
I remember this.

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,520
But I don't know who he is.

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,120
We finally found out the clue.

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800
When I first saw him

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,200
in the restaurant,

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,640
I didn't want his life

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,600
but the truth behind it.

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,800
Why did he do that?

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,760
Who was the mastermind behind it?

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,800
Did my father have any troubles?

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,320
He needs to investigate everything.

43
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,760
I know.

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,400
But this dog is so cunning.

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,920
You're a fox now.

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,640
You must be careful.

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,600
Don't worry.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
I'll take care of him.

49
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,800
It's you.

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,640
Don't act rashly.

51
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,000
I know.

52
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,120
I'll listen to you.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,200
I've seen a fox before.

54
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,120
When I was competing with Hu Zhenyi,

55
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,320
he was really good at martial arts.

56
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,320
He was good at it.

57
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,680
Hu Zhenyi is very sharp and sharp.

58
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,120
He's not like a martial artist.

59
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,040
You asked him to come here

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,480
to test him from Yaozhou?

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,320
If he's a martial artist,

62
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,480
he can't hide his identity from a fox.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,760
If he was in a fight,

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,920
Hu Zhenyi would be in a fight.

65
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,080
Then don't fight with him anymore.

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
His life will end in this ghost world.

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,280
Mr. Hu.

68
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,320
Mr. Hu.

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Mr. Hu, come to the court.

70
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

71
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,760
What's going on?

72
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,880
Mr. Hu is very angry.

73
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,840
He's not good at speaking.

74
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,960
What's the result?

75
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,000
Brother Jianxing is worried about me.

76
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,360
Thank you.

77
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,840
I'm not worried about you.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm afraid you'll die here and get me involved.

79
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,360
Don't worry.

80
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,880
I'll live.

81
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
It's a pity that I'm dead.

82
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,240
I don't know how long I can live.

83
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,960
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,240
I'll leave now.

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,480
What did I tell you?

86
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,600
I'm the first god of Luoyang.

87
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,200
I'm a little crazy.

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,760
Sir.

89
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,760
What's wrong?

90
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,560
Sir, I've caught him.

91
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,840
I've caught a crazy man.

92
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,440
What kind of crazy man is he?

93
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,320
Crazy man?

94
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,320
He's a machine.

95
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,040
He's a crazy man.

96
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,880
Xiao Zeng.

97
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,920
I think you're a crazy man.

98
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't be a crazy man.

99
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,360
Sir, you're clear.

100
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,040
I'm a machine no matter how clear I am.

101
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,520
Let's have a meal later.

102
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,000
Sir, the one you like the most is a machine.

103
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,440
Yes.

104
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,360
Good one.

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,080
Good one.

106
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,480
Sir,

107
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,920
it tastes good.

108
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,320
You're the highest god of Luoyang.

109
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,040
You're interesting.

110
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,120
You're beingul thickness.

111
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,360
Now I've liked it.

112
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,280
I'll do it.

113
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,800
Tian Tian.

114
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,440
When you were making this chicken,

115
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,840
what skill did you use?

116
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,920
This one.

117
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,800
Isn't this a cutting-edge knife?

118
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,680
You're right.

119
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,880
Chicken is a cutting-edge knife.

120
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,240
It's better than my knife.

121
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,600
It's better for cutting-edge.

122
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,600
That makes sense.

123
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,520
Let's eat.

124
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
Eat.

125
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,320
Brother Jingxing,

126
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,920
this chicken is for you.

127
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,520
You can eat more if it's delicious.

128
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,320
I'll have a clean tea when it's done.

129
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,880
Thank you.

130
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,360
You can't even find the big one.

131
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,440
How can you find it?

132
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,440
I'll have a clean tea when it's done.

133
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,720
Don't pick it up quickly.

134
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Here, take this.

135
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,480
Tian Tian,

136
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,520
Tian Tian,

137
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,720
don't live up to your expectations.

138
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,440
So the chicken wings are mine.

139
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,200
The mill won't pass the fire

140
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,160
with a dish like this.

141
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,560
Thank you.

142
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,080
Yes, yes, yes.

143
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,920
You're the hardest.

144
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,880
What can I do

145
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,840
to be different from Luo Yang Cheng?

146
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,240
I'm experienced.

147
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,640
I've worked for a day.

148
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,920
I have time to play with the kitchen.

149
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,280
You're amazing.

150
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
But Zeng Sheng,

151
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,840
you lost a lot of money.

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,360
You're just a fool.

153
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,680
Do you have any evidence?

154
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,560
Did you see it?

155
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm not sure.

156
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,800
Your hair is

157
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,520
very similar to that of Luo Le Ye.

158
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,680
Luo Le Ye?

159
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,720
But the owner of the kitchen

160
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,720
is trying to make the guests

161
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,840
look more like they're from the same family.

162
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,680
Come on!

163
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Come on!

164
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Come on!

165
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Come on!

166
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Come on!

167
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
Come on!

168
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Come on!

169
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Come on!

170
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Come on!

171
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
Come on!

172
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Come on!

173
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Come on!

174
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Come on!

175
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
Come on!

176
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Come on!

177
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Come on!

178
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Come on!

179
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,400
There's a lot of sweat on the clothes.

180
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,720
The sweat on the clothes

181
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,840
means I don't like to take a shower.

182
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,480
I love Luo Le Ye.

183
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
You're right.

184
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Look.

185
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,360
The bottom of the foot is

186
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
the wind-like wind.

187
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
Come on!

188
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Come on!

189
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Come on!

190
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,000
The hand

191
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,720
is the tear from the palm of the hand.

192
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,000
It doesn't mean

193
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,840
you went to the kitchen at midnight

194
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,200
and then

195
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,480
forced yourself into the palace.

196
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,920
Even if you're right,

197
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,120
how can you prove I lost?

198
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,440
I guessed it.

199
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,600
You're so big.

200
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,200
I guess you're a man with a strong temper.

201
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,080
Why are you laughing again?

202
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,160
You're laughing again?

203
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Come on!

204
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,960
Sir, I...

205
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,960
My stomach is a little long.

206
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,160
I'll go to the kitchen.

207
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
You guys eat first.

208
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,440
You guys eat first.

209
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,640
How do I feel

210
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,280
that this taste is a little strange?

211
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,960
What's strange?

212
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Look.

213
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,680
This is the sesame seed and the palm of the palm

214
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,240
that hasn't been digested yet.

215
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Try it.

216
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,160
It hasn't digested yet.

217
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,080
Fan Tian!

218
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,000
This is Hahfl.

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,320
Hahfl.

220
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,800
Velocity drink.

221
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,640
цôme sh detecting.

222
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,480
I've got friends

223
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,280
through everything.

224
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,280
I was looking for the way to the Zeshan Fang.

225
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,280
The back of the Zeshan Fang is the Fu Shan Fang.

226
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,280
The warehouse in the middle of the night is in the Fu Shan Fang.

227
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,280
And the painting room is very close to the Fu Shan Fang.

228
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,280
There are leaves in the middle of the night when the warehouse is in the cloud.

229
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,280
And these leaves will be in the warehouse.

230
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,280
I'm lucky to be in the cloud again.

231
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,280
So the fake Fenghuang Xiang is the same leaf in the middle of the night.

232
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,280
The whole Luoyang City has only this warehouse.

233
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
I know this fake Fenghuang.

234
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,280
His name is Chi Ling Ji.

235
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
He is a chicken.

236
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
He is a bird.

237
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
The appearance resembles Fenghuang.

238
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
The Fenghuang Xiang Rui before,

239
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,280
I'm afraid he used the same method.

240
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,280
But now he has killed people.

241
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,280
And he has become the fake Fenghuang Xiang.

242
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,280
He can make the chicken into Fenghuang.

243
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,280
When did he use this person?

244
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
A few years ago,

245
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,280
there was a knight in the capital who was in the red.

246
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Everyone, watch.

247
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Now it's time for our magic show.

248
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Good.

249
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,280
The magic show.

250
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
The magic show?

251
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
What is magic?

252
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Everyone, watch it.

253
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Don't look at it.

254
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Awesome.
