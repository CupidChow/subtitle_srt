1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Episode 12

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The result of the murder of Feng Huang and the mother of the master of the Yan family

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
reminds me of the old case.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What case?

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
12 years ago, Li Zuo's house was closed.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
12 years ago, General Li Zuo was executed.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He was in the Holy Grail.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The family had four of them.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The whole family was killed.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
At the beginning, the Holy Grail was killed.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It was a serious murder.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But the Holy Grail was still under arrest.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The victim's death was almost the same as the original case.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If we can find out the truth,

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
we might be able to find out the truth of the old case 12 years ago.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Holy Grail was used as a special weapon.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It was like a snake that pierced the neck of a snake.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Brother Jian Xing, why are you so clear?

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm not sure.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But I haven't been in peace for more than 10 years.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't you think it's a shame?

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's a shame.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't you worry that the Lord won't break the promise?

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He won't break it.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Brother Jian Xing, since we've reached the end,

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
let's open up the window and talk.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Brother Jian Xing,

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
would you like to help me investigate this case?

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Sure.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But I need something.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Good.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What do you need?

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I need a pig's head.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Look, I told you.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The wound will be healed in advance.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There's only this much left.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
How much is a hundred gold?

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Eight or nine gold.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's broken.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's broken.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's about one hour.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The murderer killed the victim and sent her to the crime scene.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He used one hour to kill her and release her.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He then took her to the hospital.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The whole city used half an hour.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The murderer either didn't make it or made a carriage.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
According to the speed,

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the murderer's scene is not more than five miles from the nine-story building.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Zeng Sheng, you take a team of people and carefully investigate

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
where the nine-story building is suspicious.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The murderer's scene is definitely quite close.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The blood will be very strong.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Sir, it's bad.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Sir, Zeng Teng, it's bad.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The murderer killed the victim again.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Zeng...

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I just found two bodies in Luoyang's command room.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The victim is a young woman.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I haven't found any of her.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm afraid she's still alive.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't think so.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't think so.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't think so.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't think so.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't think so.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't think so.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm afraid there will be a dead person next.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We need to be more active.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But there's no rule in the abandoned city.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I can't predict where the abandoned city will be.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Catch Phoenix.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
map.

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
After Phoenix appears,

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
it will disappear in a minute.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The abandoned city will not be too far away.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, according to the two closest sources,

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the murderer will be active.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And search the whole city.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We will separate the people and form a network.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Once Phoenix appears,

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
someone will arrive immediately.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Before tonight, we must catch the murderer.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm in charge.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Zeng Sheng, there are two bodies.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's go back to the big room.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's wrong?

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't go to the room.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Go to the yard.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Brother Jianxin,

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
your method of investigation is really

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
very natural.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's open the eyes.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm afraid I can't see.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can't see.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't see.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can't see.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can't see.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I can't see.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I can't see.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I can't see.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I can't see.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I can't see.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's natural.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's open the eyes.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So impure.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't think so.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Brother Jianxin

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
seems like a real fan.

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You...

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You...

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You call him Brother Jianxin?

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You two met for several days.

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You call him brother?

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Call me...

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What's wrong with you?

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What's wrong?

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is so strange.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What's wrong with it?

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There is General Zhang Moon-H butter room.

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,280
The first day, that we have sent her,

132
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,240
without causing Bite King.

133
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,960
Yes, she was banned.

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,760
It is stated as a installation of vows.

135
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,600
An additional number was planted

136
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,960
in the room in front of the principle building.

137
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,160
Therefore, risks are created

138
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,760
in just the 5 remaining items.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
That's also a good idea.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,600
I am finally ready.

141
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,440
But...

142
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,520
We both smell like bamboo shoots.

143
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,880
Is that so?

144
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,960
This dish used all the type of the rhythm tangerines

145
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,880
with Nordic showsae?

146
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,960
It has a different taste from the Zhangmu.

147
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,480
And the Zhangmu smell on the dead is the same.

148
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,040
I'll go and wash it.

149
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,560
Brother Jianxing.

150
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,280
That girl didn't even say hello to me.

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,800
Sir, she's not good at you.

152
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,760
I'm really...

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,080
Don't worry.

154
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,960
I know where she's going.

155
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,120
I'm better than her in the capital.

156
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,880
When I told you,

157
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,600
you were using this technique.

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,400
He didn't want this method?

159
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
No!

160
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,560
Yes, yes.

161
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,200
This skill is ready for you and now,

162
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,840
a clever,

163
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,040
fun trick.

164
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,680
Then lets try.

165
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,160
This is her bait.

166
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,160
These girls are in a place with a strong taste of wood.

167
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
And they're big leaders.

168
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
They're not as good as the woodpecker.

169
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
The woodpecker...

170
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
It's him.

171
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,660
Damn it!

172
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,660
That's thanks to you!

173
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
I was scared.

174
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,660
ReallyIOUSLY!

175
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,160
That's thanks to you!

176
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,660
Can I go upstairs?

177
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,160
No, you're not!]

178
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,660
What?

179
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Wake up, Christian!

180
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Can I go?

181
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
How can you not wake up?

182
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,160
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

183
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,160
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

184
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,160
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

185
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,160
