1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Dan Jie.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Here.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The medicine is ready.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thank you.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll be back.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Here.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Today is the first day of the festival of the flower-dried moth.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's a festival of the flower-dried moth.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If we can meet again, we'll never forget the fate of the rain.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's a good thing.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come on, drink a cup.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Here.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sir, here are some signature dishes.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Sure.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This little brother, do you want to be alone?

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hurry up.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You don't mind if we have a seat?

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Thank you.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Here comes the food.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Is it good?

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is this dish not fresh or cold?

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm really sorry, sir. I'll change it for you.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Sorry, sir.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Sir, please.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We're here to meet.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No matter you're a small person, you're all customers.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Little brother, let's eat together.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Here comes the food.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Sir, I really couldn't resist the fact that you came here.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
These are all my signature dishes.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Here is the medicine.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Little brother, here.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Here comes the food.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Here comes the drink.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Two hands.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sir, we finally found the blood phoenix.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The phoenix is the Xiangrui that I've been looking for.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I didn't expect that there are so many people in the world.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm so sorry, sir.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I didn't expect that there are so many phoenixes in the world.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Isn't phoenix gold?

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
How does this phoenix look so red?

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Dear customers.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The flower stone is here.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The dance is about to begin.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The phoenix is dead.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The phoenix is dead.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't move.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll show you who the Lord of the Lake is.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll see who dares to do this.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Mother, wake up.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Mother, you can't die.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You know how much I spent on you.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Step back.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Why did you call me phoenix killer just now?

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I saw...

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I saw phoenix passing through the phoenix.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I put it on my neck.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The phoenix is flying in the sky.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The phoenix is flying in the sky.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes, I heard it too.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But the phoenix killer is a brother.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Guzhen is now a traitor.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The people are going to be killed.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Shut up.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You saw it just now.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The phoenix is dead.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If the phoenix is a murderer,

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
why isn't the body of the phoenix

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
burned to the ground?

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's obvious that he's been dead for a while.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So the murderer must be a man.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So everyone here has suspicion.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But what does it have to do with me?

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Especially you.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What do you mean?

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You think I didn't notice your sleeves?

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You mean this?

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're not too much

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
to see the phoenix's body in the martial arts world, right?

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I think you're trying to assassinate Master Hu.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm the chief, right?

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You officials

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
can't just run to the place

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and drink wine here.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The most suspicious one is you.

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Little brother.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Little brother.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Are you okay?

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The ingredients are a bit...

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Maybe it's the right thing to do.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're so full of your own blood.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're here to find the murderer.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're kidding me.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm a man of the mountain.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The phoenix in Luoyang

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
was left half a month ago.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I saw it this morning.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,920
The

129
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,000
roadside car accident in Luzhou

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
was also left.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You need at least 200 miles per day

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
to take the flow here.

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You have no doubt.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The 100 miles per day

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
is not just for the fun of the capital, right?

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I guess the trouble you're looking for

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
is right here.

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If I can prove it,

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
the murderer is someone else.

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
If you can kill him,

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the capital will not be your relative.

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's a deal.

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Please help me get the sword.

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The phoenix in Luoyang

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
was left half a month ago.

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're kidding me.

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm a man of the mountain.

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

156
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

158
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Water.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Lime.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Blood wine.

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Wood.

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Mountain.

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Blood.

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Blood wine.

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What are you looking at?

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you can break the case,

167
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
don't make a fuss about it.

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Little brother,

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
what's the matter?

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Since they're all here,

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
let's take the opportunity

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
to cure the disease

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and change the situation.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

177
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

181
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm not a man of the mountain.

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
