1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
Time for the battle!

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,000
Do both children play the game?

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,000
YES

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,300
The kids have already played in the shop.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,360
I'm glad.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,240
If kids play the game, there's gonna be some peace.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,180
Unigungvik is a bit different.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,460
So, this one has no Rackets.

9
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,960
Episode 14

10
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,460
So Yun Yin was burned to death.

11
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,960
If she was burned to death,

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,460
she would be relieved.

13
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,960
But she didn't die.

14
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,460
She was burned to death.

15
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,960
She was also ill.

16
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,960
She was even in a bad mood.

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Even had a hard time eating.

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
She was burned to death for a few months.

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,960
So how did you know about this?

20
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,960
Sister found me.

21
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,460
She has been with me for a year.

22
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,460
About her,

23
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,460
you didn't know about her from the letter.

24
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,960
There is another part.

25
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,460
It was the mother of Sister's father.

26
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,960
She told me about it.

27
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,460
So you chose to be a maid.

28
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,460
To avenge her.

29
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
She was my sister.

30
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,460
For her,

31
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,460
I gave up on my freedom.

32
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,460
But why did you hurt those innocent mothers?

33
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,960
I was helping them.

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,460
I was helping them.

35
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,960
That day, Xu Qi Yan

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
found a knife and went to the library.

37
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,460
He wanted to save five girls to revive her.

38
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,960
The first bride he married was called Wu Shi.

39
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,460
To help Wu Shi leave,

40
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,460
I tried to drag Xu Jiaren out of the house.

41
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,460
I didn't expect Xu Qi Yan would be so happy.

42
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,460
He thought my sister was dead.

43
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,460
If my sister really was dead,

44
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,460
the first one to kill her was Xu Qi Yan.

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,460
But how did Wu Shi die?

46
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,460
When he escaped,

47
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,460
the Prince of Jin was in the wrong.

48
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,460
I was so angry.

49
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,460
I was the one who killed him.

50
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,460
No.

51
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,460
No.

52
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,460
I was helping him.

53
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,960
I was saving him.

54
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
I was saving all of them.

55
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,460
He could only suffer when he was alive.

56
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,460
Just like my sister.

57
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,460
But I had no other way to let them go.

58
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,460
I was also helping them.

59
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,460
I was the one who died.

60
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,460
I was the one who died.

61
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,460
He said I could revive her.

62
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
You asked them about the situation.

63
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,960
What's the difference between you and Xu Qi Yan?

64
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,460
Qiao Er.

65
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,960
I'll go to the dungeon and apologize to them.

66
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,960
I don't want Xu Qi Yan to come near them.

67
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Gu Ci.

68
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
You know.

69
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,960
The happiest day for me in my youth is the day when I was the happiest.

70
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
I wish I could have a good life.

71
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,960
I want to have another piece of food.

72
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,460
Qiao Er, listen.

73
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,460
I'll take you to the dungeon.

74
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,460
I'll take you to the dungeon.

75
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,460
I'll take you to the dungeon.

76
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
I'll take you to the dungeon.

77
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,460
So, Xiao Yao Zi was killed by Qiao Er?

78
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,460
Xiao Yao Zi found out that he killed someone.

79
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,460
He threatened to kill her.

80
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Why didn't he kill Master Xu?

81
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Maybe it's because Mrs. Xu brought him to the dungeon.

82
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
He can't do anything.

83
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
That makes sense.

84
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
It's you.

85
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,960
What are you doing here?

86
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Mrs. Xu.

87
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,460
I'm here to ask you something.

88
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
I hope you can be honest with me.

89
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Go ahead.

90
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Back then,

91
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,960
all officials were involved in the general's rebellion.

92
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Master Xu was involved.

93
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,460
Yes.

94
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,460
I've told him.

95
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
But he was bewitched by the old man.

96
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,460
He didn't listen to the old man's advice.

97
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,460
He didn't know whether it was a letter or not.

98
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,460
General Li was killed by the Tan He.

99
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,460
He didn't get the holy wealth.

100
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,460
He was killed by the Nianmen.

101
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,460
Although he was dead,

102
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,960
he was still a hero.

103
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Who else can Tan He be?

104
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
I'm a woman.

105
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
He never let me get involved.

106
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
But...

107
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
But what?

108
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
I remember someone.

109
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,460
When they were talking about General Li,

110
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,460
I saw him.

111
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,460
Who?

112
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,460
Mr. Hu, who came with you.

113
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,460
Brother Jian Xing.

114
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,460
Did you have anything to tell me?

115
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,460
No.

116
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,460
I just remember a lot of strange things.

117
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,460
I also remember many things I didn't expect.

118
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,460
It's you, Mr. Hu.

119
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,460
You're so capable.

120
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,460
You've already made the world famous.

121
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,460
Today, you're not going to be a legend.

122
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,460
That's right.

123
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,460
I killed Xin Niang.

124
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,460
The government of Ling Zhou will handle this case.

125
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,460
Send me to the government.

126
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,460
You admit it's so simple.

127
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,960
I'm sure you've already known the truth.

128
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Now that you're dead,

129
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,960
even if you're sent to the prison,

130
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,960
you won't be able to wait for the day you'll be punished.

131
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,960
I'll just leave it to Xu Fu.

132
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Why do you need it?

133
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Fine.

134
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
I still want to ask you.

135
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
General Li and Mrs. Li,

136
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:01,460
did they have any enemies before they were born?

137
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,460
Or did they have any discord with anyone before they were born?

138
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,460
Do you have any doubts?

139
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,460
I was 7 years old then.

140
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
But back then,

141
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
I was in the cell.

142
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
It seemed to have been a coincidence.

143
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
It seemed to have been a coincidence.

144
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
It seemed to have been a coincidence.

145
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
It seemed to have been a coincidence.

146
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
What?

147
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,960
It seemed to have something to do with the Holy Man.

148
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,960
But I can't remember the exact details.

149
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,460
I was really scared at that time.

150
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,460
So,

151
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,460
what did you feel?

152
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,460
Feel?

153
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,460
I felt a lot.

154
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,460
I learned a lot from Mr. Hu.

155
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,460
I wanted to go to the prison

156
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,460
and take some money.

157
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,960
I wanted to go to the prison.

158
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
You're a real bad guy.

159
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,960
You must have been a bad guy.

160
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
But this time,

161
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
the Holy Man will be held.

162
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
It's said that

163
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
there will be more than ten countries

164
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
who will come to the market

165
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
and have fun.

166
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
What will happen in the future?

167
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,960
I'm really looking forward to it.

168
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,960
Okay.
