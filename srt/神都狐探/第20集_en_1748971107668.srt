00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Episode 1

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Have all the members of the police of Xu's Mansion been here?

9
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,600
I have transferred all the cases to the government

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
as a member of the Italian police.

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
In these cases,

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,600
there are those who committed suicide,

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
who were burned to death,

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
who were killed by the police,

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
and those who were killed in the garden.

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
These deaths are not the same.

18
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Is it really suicide?

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
It's not a coincidence.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,600
If someone really killed him,

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,600
he wouldn't have changed the way he did it.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
That's not necessarily true.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
There was a time when he would have changed the way he killed people.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
He would have killed them all.

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
In these cases,

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,600
the dead are different,

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,600
but they are all the daughters of the poor.

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Xu Qi Yan's bride is young and beautiful.

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
And...

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
And from the picture,

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,600
these two are similar in nature.

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Isn't that normal?

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Xu Qi Yan likes Yun Yin,

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
so the others are substitute.

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,600
The murderer is also looking for Duan Zijue's grandson in the old Xu family.

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
So he is going to kill one of them.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Oh, right, sir.

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
When I went to the government office to see the director,

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
a man was holding a candle.

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
He said that there was an important task to be done.

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I made an appointment with him.

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
I will meet him at the study room today.

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
It's already late.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
We'd better leave now.

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Prepare the horse.

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Thank you, sir.

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
It's been a few days.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
This is the commander of the division.

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
It's almost done.

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
I've seen a few officials.

51
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I have a few things to report about Xu family.

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Tell me what they are.

53
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
What?

54
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,600
The first wife of the Xu family is very well-known in the Lin Zhou Holy Faction.

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,600
But the rumor seems not accurate.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
How is that possible?

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
A few years ago,

58
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Mrs. Yun Yin was still in the city.

59
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
She asked me to help her with the letter.

60
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
What letter?

61
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I can't remember the exact details.

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I just know that it's a small note.

63
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
It's all about the warmth of Xu family.

64
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
If it's safe,

65
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
there's nothing to be ashamed of.

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Why do you stop me if there's nothing to be ashamed of?

67
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Maybe she's right.

68
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Yun Yin's letter is all about the normal things.

69
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,600
She can find her husband to take some of it.

70
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
But she didn't have it.

71
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,600
She went to the street to find a letter from Mr. Xu.

72
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
It proves that Yun Yin and Xu family's relationship

73
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
are not so good in the legend.

74
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
It's Master Guan's fault.

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
He's right.

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
But what's your relationship with him?

77
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Are you having a grudge with Xu family?

78
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Or do you want to get a reward for your report?

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Don't drink anymore.

80
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
I'm not used to drinking.

81
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
I'm also being bullied by Chengchun.

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
You're Li Zuo's wife.

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
That family died.

84
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
You know what?

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Now, the Taoism of the Qu family is all his family's fault.

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Xu family is so strange.

87
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
They even bought the ghost house.

88
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
It's so strange.

89
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Let's not talk about it.

90
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Let's go back home.

91
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Let's go back.

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Let's go.

93
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,600
The one who killed the door was still there.

94
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
He was still there.

95
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
He knew all the details.

96
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
It was so hard.

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Let's go.

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Let's go.

99
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
It's a problem.

100
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
It's not a problem.

101
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
There were so many things going on in the house.

102
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
It was a mess.

103
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
I hope I can have a solution.

104
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
But...

105
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Is it a bad thing?

106
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Or is it a bad thing to do?

107
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Mrs. Yun likes roses.

108
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Mr. Qi Yan is the garden he built.

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Mrs. Yun likes singing.

110
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Mr. Qi Yan is the stage he built.

111
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
And this Miaoying Fortress.

112
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
It was because of her that he called Miaoying Fortress.

113
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Qiao, how did Yuan Yin die?

114
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
When I came to the mansion,

115
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
he had been dead for a long time.

116
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Although the people outside said

117
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
he was a soul-dead,

118
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
the old people in the mansion said

119
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
he was sick.

120
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Do you know what kind of disease it is?

121
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
It seems to be a lung disease.

122
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Lung disease?

123
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
How long after Yuan Yin passed away,

124
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Xu Xi Yan started to get angry.

125
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,600
It's been about three or four years.

126
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Three or four years?

127
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,600
It seems to be not too much.

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
It's said that when Mrs. Yun passed away,

129
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
she was sad.

130
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
She was obsessed with the people she built.

131
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
One day, she didn't know why.

132
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,600
She destroyed all the people.

133
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,600
She left only one thing that was similar to Mrs. Yun's.

134
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
She left it in this Miaoying Fortress

135
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,600
to take the people's hope.

136
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,600
The funeral of the master must be tomorrow.

137
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Mr. Qi, you don't know.

138
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
The old lady has sent a message.

139
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,600
The funeral of the master is over.

140
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,600
It's going to be a funeral tonight.

141
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,600
The dead are in great danger.

142
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
The cause is the way up.

143
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
The people are gone.

144
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,600
The dead are in great danger.

145
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
The cause is the way up.

146
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
The people are gone.

147
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
What are you doing?

148
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
The coffin is broken.

149
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Can you keep it?

150
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
How would I know?

151
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
It's so dark.

152
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
It's okay.

153
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Just close it.

154
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
What's going on?

155
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Get out!

156
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Get out!

157
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Get out!

158
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Sir, did you find the body?

159
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
I couldn't find it.

160
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Now, the Lingzhou Pugai

161
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
can't be used anymore.

162
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Can't be used anymore?

163
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Why?

164
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
What are you doing?

165
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
The Lingzhou Pugai

166
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
has just been attacked by a bandits.

167
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
The government has gone to the Dali to search for the fish.

168
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
We can't just leave it here.

169
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Exactly.

170
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
To them,

171
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
this is a small body of a bride and a corpse.

172
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
There's nothing to reward in the city.

173
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
The drug dealer who went to the emergency room

174
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
caught it and was rewarded.

175
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
These bastards.

176
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
That's too much.

177
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
What about the coffin?

178
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Did you see it?

179
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
We went to see the coffin.

180
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
There was no body in it.

181
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
And there was no trace of the nail.

182
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
This means

183
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,600
it must have been dropped before the seal.

184
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
So,

185
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
the corpse of Liu Shi

186
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
should still be in the house.

187
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
How about this?
