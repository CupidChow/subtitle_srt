I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

Dali Temple?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Do you have a token to prove it?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So you are the first god of Luoyang, Zeng Teng.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm so envious.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Zeng Mantou, please.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Dali Temple is in the process of the memorial.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Here comes the box.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Coming.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You are Zeng Shang?

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes, I am.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You are Zeng Shang?

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Who are you?

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Of course, it's me.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You dare steal my token?

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll give it to you.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Zeng Teng, you are here.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Since you don't like me, I'll take you as my friend.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Next time, I'll take you as my friend.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Go to the warehouse.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Please, sir.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
In the capital, where else do you have a big-time business?

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In the capital, there is no big-time business.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Chongxie Liang is the people.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There is Zhang Mujiao in the family.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He can be the heir.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You know that.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
From the south, it's my business.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then I'm in the branch.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm the first-in-command.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Who else will enter this warehouse besides us?

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
These white-haired workers.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Please, sir.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Sir, here is the place.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All the good Zhang Mu in the family are here.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hu Zhenyi is quite mature.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Since you know the location of Zhang Mu,

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
why didn't you tell me just now?

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You can guess what Mr. Hu is thinking.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What's up?

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's been a long time since I've been in this warehouse.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Look at you.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
According to the rules, we clean the warehouse every month.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Do we have the map of Zhang Mu's operation route and the location of Tingfang?

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes, sir.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Zhang, the map.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Go, go.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The big night is not the same as the day before.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Look, sir.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The saint wants to build a great fortune.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Look, sir.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The saint wants to build a great fortune.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Zhang Mu will go to Luoyang, the king of Yueyue,

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and then to the warehouse.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Then he will go to the great fortune.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The great fortune?

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All right, leave it to me.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Wait for me at the night.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why are you leaving again?

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Zhang Sheng.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Zhang Sheng.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's so true.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What do you think?

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What are you looking at?

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You look good in this dress.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Did you find anything?

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I didn't go to any of the places,

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
but I've been to the place where I've been checked.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It smells good and it's rich.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It doesn't smell like blood.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is it possible that these girls

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
are all looking for the place where I've been checked?

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Write it down.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The smell between new Zhang Mu and old Zhang Mu

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
is different from that of the drama.

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The one thing that's very certain

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
about the great fortune and the warehouse

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
is the smell of new Zhang Mu.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I believe in your theory of smell.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
In the case of the first episode of the ninth floor,

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the money is about half a body.

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We will cut it to the end to use for blood.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's a very good idea.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sure you can understand.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We cut it to the end to use for blood.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There are three more left.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Are you sure that you can get a good one

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
in the third episode?

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The ninth floor is the great fortune and the warehouse is the smell of new Zhang Mu.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The ninth floor is the warehouse.

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's the smell of the transport.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's impossible.

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When the transport is sent to the body,

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the body must be wrapped up.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Even if it's a bath,

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
it's hard to cover it up.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you say so,

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
there are three places

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that can be the place to kill people.

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
How did the murderer do it?

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He used half an hour to finish the killing and release the blood in these three places.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's strange.

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Where did the problem come from?

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I know.

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You're mistaken.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Who is mistaken?

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You are.

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Anyway, I will tell you this.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We should go to the ninth floor.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
After all, that's the first case.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Maybe we lost some clues.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He is a little clever.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's go.

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Manager.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why are you alone?

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We won't open the gate these days.

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's okay.

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We just came here.

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We came here.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This place is famous in Shendu.

148
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Now, it's so cold.

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You know, sir.

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
There are so many things happening.

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The guests are not willing to come.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The firemen have gone.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Now I'm alone.

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm here to fight.

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Zaiyi.

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is there any suspicious person these days?

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't say that.

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No one has come.

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Where is the manager?

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He said he was sick.

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He is resting at home.

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That night, when Fenghuang came,

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
did anyone run out of the house?

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm not sure.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I have to think about it.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Xiangchun?

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Sir.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This is the new product from Shifat.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's strange.

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We only used it once.

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Why are there two boxes missing?

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Someone secretly changed Xiangchun.

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's right.

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
On the day of the accident,

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
we all saw Mudan.

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
At that time, the Tang government reminded us

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
that Mudan was a kind of Xiangchun.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So, in the previous ceremony,

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
we passed Xiangchun and came to Mudan.

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But we didn't know that someone secretly changed it.

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And burned half of Xiangchun.

182
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So, in the previous ceremony,

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
we lost Mudan.

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So, the future is difficult.

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's about the same every hour.

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If so,

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
the Cangku and Dafu are dead.

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's possible that it's the first scene.

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But I still don't understand

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
why they have to send the corpse back to the Qiong Long?

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Because they want to drag me down the water.

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It seems like they are really against the sacred throne.

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Actually, I'm the one who's going to take the main responsibility.

194
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Sir, how can we take the responsibility?

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
As long as I'm here,

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I can only hand it over to the Dali Temple.

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This case is still under the sacred throne.

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's a phoenix-like appearance.

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If I investigate it,

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I will definitely find out

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
the past of the sacred throne.

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If I don't investigate it,

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the military order will be in danger.

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The future will be the end.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This case is a double-dead sword.

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It seems that it's a man of the past.

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The corpse will be removed by me.

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Sir, the court is against you.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Only Sun Cheng can take it.

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But if he really did it,

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
he wouldn't be afraid of dragging you down the water.

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Instead, he would bring his own wealth back.

213
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Maybe there's something more important.

214
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Even if he loses his wealth,

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
he will drag me down the water.

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Sir.

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Tell me.

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Who has the key to the warehouse?

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Only Zai Xiao Guo.

220
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is it possible for him to give it to someone else?

221
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's impossible.

222
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I've already told him at the beginning.

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If he gives the key to someone else,

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I will definitely not be able to spare him

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
for that.

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Will he lend it to that Tang Guan?

227
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He definitely won't.

228
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Although that Tang Guan is usually quite quick,

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
his hands and feet are not clean.

230
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
We all know that.

231
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Where did he start

232
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
before the Muda Yan began?

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He was probably busy with the back yard.

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He usually does some transportation.

235
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
When did he start working here?

236
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Probably a month ago.

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Sir, you've also found out

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that Tang Guan was also a month ago.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's why he started working here.

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes.

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Is there anything strange about Zai's daily routine?

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
He likes to go to some flowers and plants.

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And he loves to clean them.

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Flowers and plants?

245
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Mr. Zhang,

246
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
it's convenient for you to take us to the back yard.

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This is the room where you can see the dead.

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If someone wants to move the body from here,

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
he must be sure that there is no one in this yard.

250
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And he can't tell us about the dirty business.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's go.

252
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
If this matter is absolutely undeniable,

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
everyone,

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
this person is actually the dirty business.

255
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You killed Muda Yan!

256
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll kill you!

257
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Brother Jianxi, are you okay?

258
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm fine.

259
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Don't move!

260
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But I'll go back to Dalin Temple.

261
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He's poisoned.

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What I'm going to do is to spare you!

263
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,000
The God of Hell works!

264
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Don't blind Zang Qin!

265
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Who shall burn this place?

266
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Power Spirit of Elder평 is lost!

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,400
I'm not sure if I can get the

268
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm not sure if I can get the

269
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,400
I'm not sure if I can get the
