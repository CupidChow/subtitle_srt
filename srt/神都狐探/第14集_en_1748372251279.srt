00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 14

2
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,460
Blood God Sect is in ruins.

3
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,540
As the leader of the original brother,

4
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,820
he also betrayed Zhan Lijue.

5
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,220
Why can't he solve the case?

6
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,940
How can he be considered as Cao Cao?

7
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,460
But you know

8
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,660
there's something more behind this.

9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,220
It's because there's something more behind this.

10
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,540
So, we

11
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,780
announced the case.

12
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,620
We let him relax and be alert.

13
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,200
So, we can reveal the truth.

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,520
At present,

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,720
the enemy is always on our side.

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,920
We can't find anything.

17
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,680
What do you think, Holy Master?

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,360
That's what he meant.

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,480
That's what he meant?

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,280
Don't you think it's strange?

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,800
A man in the martial world

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,720
practices martial arts to get the trust of the people.

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,800
He insists on doing evil in the capital.

24
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,740
It's the court's attention.

25
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,460
Unless

26
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,460
he wants to

27
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,820
make a big

28
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,900
blood storm in the capital.

29
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,700
The imperial heir,

30
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,860
compared to him,

31
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,340
he's far from qualified.

32
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,260
You're suspecting Sun Chengjing.

33
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,660
After Fellowshipанти hasn't played this game.

34
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,660
Any idea

35
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,020
why you took him hostage here?

36
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,780
It's not a big deal.

37
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,860
The Boss was actually

38
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,300
present earlier

39
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,260
that day

40
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,660
and took him as a third person.

41
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,960
examples

42
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,260
after based on

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,620
the false theories

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Yes.

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,140
Here.

46
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,860
Come on.

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,360
There is a fool

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,920
in the Purple Code cell.

49
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,720
Glad to meet you,

50
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,880
Taoist.

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,400
Jin Lian...

52
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,040
What?

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,200
I know who Degu Taoist

54
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,280
is.

55
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,440
But thisật

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,140
controls his mental state.

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,680
You made such a mistake.

58
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,120
to destroy all the related information

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,840
about Li's case.

60
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,880
So,

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,720
whether it's the books of Zhong Qingtan and General Li,

62
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,560
or the investigation records of the death of Li's family,

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,400
they were all replaced with white paper.

64
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,720
You were already in Dali Temple.

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,600
You knew it.

66
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

67
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,240
The person who assassinated me a few days ago

68
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,600
was a killer from the Net Trap Organization.

69
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,600
His name is Shen Xuan.

70
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,920
He and the Fox King broke into the martial arts world together.

71
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,480
When I mentioned the fact that the martial arts store was lost,

72
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,440
you knew it was done by Net Trap.

73
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,040
You also knew

74
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,200
the person who wanted to assassinate me was Shen Xuan.

75
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,880
You said

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,760
you told me

78
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,840
you lied to me to save Hu Mo.

79
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,640
Don't breasts anymore.

80
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,840
I please suppose

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,640
we'll be free together.

82
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
I won't make줬

83
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,960
By the way,

84
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,560
According to some ri Cave s,

85
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,400
we should go.

86
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,240
I hope you can

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,720
feel as safe as you can.

88
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Lao Han.

89
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,760
Wuzheng Yicheng,

90
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,320
you shouldn't have

91
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,440
been so mean to him.

92
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,120
You should have let me kill him.

93
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,160
I've asked around.

94
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,280
The Court of Judicial Review

95
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,280
hasn't started to send someone to pursue his wife.

96
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,120
Maybe he really wants to

97
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,680
make a mistake.

98
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,120
You call this a mistake?

99
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,280
Now the notice is posted all over the city.

100
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,480
I'll be in a hurry

101
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,880
to get out of the house.

102
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,720
Don't worry.

103
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,120
As long as I'm sincere in Luoyang,

104
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,880
even if you're caught by someone,

105
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,040
I can protect you.

106
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,560
The Western Regions!

107
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,920
Why are you going to the Western Regions?

108
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,160
Just now,

109
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,000
the Saint summoned Lord Hu

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,200
to open the Western Regions.

111
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,520
He's in charge of the Court of Judicial Review.

112
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,160
He asked us to go to the Western Regions

113
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,320
to talk to the foreign envoys.

114
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,400
Lord Hu asked me to inform you

115
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,960
that you should go with him.

116
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,880
It seems that this time

117
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,120
it's not that easy.

118
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,600
If I guess it right,

119
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
it's arranged by Sun Cheng, right?

120
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,920
Yes.

121
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,920
He asked us to go to the Western Regions,

122
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,520
which is unfamiliar to us.

123
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,080
They can either

124
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,640
isolate us from the case of the Blood God

125
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,440
and Phoenix

126
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,840
that has not been investigated yet,

127
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,860
or make some

128
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,960
natural disasters on the way.

129
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,120
It's really a good deal.

130
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,200
Do you think

131
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,080
Lord Hu didn't think of these?

132
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,480
A month later,

133
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,920
there is a Lantern Lighting Conference in Liangzhou.

134
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Although it was proposed by the governor of Liangzhou,

135
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,640
it concerns the friendly relations

136
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,440
between our state and the Western Regions.

137
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,520
The Saint entrusted such a heavy task

138
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
to our Dali Temple.

139
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,440
We have no strength to resist.

140
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,720
Right.

141
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,280
Okay.

142
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,280
Pack up your things.

143
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
We'll set off tomorrow.

144
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,680
Is he acting out of the blue?

145
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,600
Who are you talking to?

146
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,120
You're not a big deal.

147
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,120
See you from the beginning.

148
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,240
Hurry up.

149
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,480
Follow up.

150
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,880
Put the box over there.

151
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Mrs. Liu,

152
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,920
when did you come?

153
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,000
Why haven't you come out yet?

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,600
Sir,

155
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,160
come and have a look.

156
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,000
It's so lively.

157
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,120
Look.

158
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,040
Which family is making the heart?

159
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,600
Sir,

160
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,080
it's a good sign

161
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,320
to go out and make a wedding.

162
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
It's a wedding,

163
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,800
but why

164
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,920
do they hang this?

165
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,080
It's bad luck.

166
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,600
What a bad custom in Lingzhou.

167
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,320
You have to

168
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,400
cry all the time on a good day.

169
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,920
Mom.

170
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,520
Look at the flowers.

171
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,600
Look at the flowers.

172
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,400
Mom, let's go.

173
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,440
Mom, let me go.

174
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,640
You're a bad woman.

175
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,520
Cui'er is going to marry.

176
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,880
You're going to be mourning in the yard.

177
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,040
You've brought my daughter into the fire.

178
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,640
Mom.

179
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,240
Go.

180
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,360
The General's house is not a place

181
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,440
for the soul to rest.

182
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,000
According to the master,

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,160
Cui'er is a man of the word.

184
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
He's a good man.

185
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,560
He's a monster.

186
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,440
Liar.

187
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,680
You're a rich man.

188
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,800
I don't believe you

189
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,080
if you call him a bad old man.

190
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,960
I don't believe you.

191
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Mrs. Liu.

192
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,880
You've received the money from the Xu family.

193
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,240
I have to take him away today.

194
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,760
Mom.

195
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,360
Go.

196
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,880
Mom.

197
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,480
Stop it.

198
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,200
Mom.

199
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
Cui'er.

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
Enough.

201
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,080
Aunt.

202
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Let me ask you.

203
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,320
Is the General's house in Lingzhou

204
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,240
a mansion for General Li?

205
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,400
It's his house.

206
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,640
Xu Yuan's family lives in it.

207
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,080
Since it's a rumor,

208
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,360
why didn't the Xu family move out?

209
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,120
When Master Xu was in trouble,

210
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,000
he met bandits.

211
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,520
The bandits were saved by General Li.

212
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,160
After General Li died,

213
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,480
he bought the house

214
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,680
as a guard for General Li.

215
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,520
Such a loving family,

216
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,360
General Li is blessed.

217
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,440
He won't harm him.

218
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Let's go.

219
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,640
Sir.

220
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,520
Something's wrong.

221
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,320
Let me ask you.

222
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,680
I'm guilty.

223
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
Old man.

224
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,240
Madam.

225
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,160
You don't want to marry your daughter

226
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,120
because there's a ghost

227
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,480
in Lingzhou?

228
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,920
When General Li's house

229
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,480
was flooded,

230
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,120
the ghosts were so fierce.

231
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,400
Everyone in Lingzhou knew it.

232
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,120
What did I do?

233
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,880
Madam.

234
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,720
Did the ghosts harm people?

235
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,120
If not,

236
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,120
how could they be fierce?

237
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,120
How many wives did the Xu family marry?

238
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Which one died of the ghost?

239
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,040
Enough. Let's go.

240
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,240
Go back.

241
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,080
I'm guilty.

242
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Jin Xing.

243
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
What do you think?

244
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,880
The Li family is a loyal family.

245
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,000
Even if they are in danger,

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,400
they can't be killed.

247
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,600
They can't be killed.

248
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,680
They can't be killed.

249
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
They can't be killed.

250
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,120
Even if they are in danger,

251
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,400
I believe they won't be killed.

252
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,560
Well said.

253
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,040
You're right.

254
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,720
Everyone.

255
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,240
Since we're innocent,

256
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,040
we, the people of Dali,

257
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,400
can't just sit around.

258
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,000
We can't do nothing

259
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,120
to humiliate General Li.

260
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,920
But we're on duty.

261
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,000
We have to hurry.

262
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,760
There's more than a month.

263
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
From Lingzhou to Liangzhou,

264
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,120
we have enough time.

265
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,560
If we don't have enough time,

266
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,680
we can just go.

267
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,800
Yes, sir.

268
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,120
It's obvious that they're trying to steal my daughter.

269
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,320
Yes, sir.

270
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,080
That girl is so poor.

271
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
You must help her.

272
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Good.

273
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,880
Since you're all right with this,

274
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,120
we'll go to her house

275
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,560
to find out the truth.
