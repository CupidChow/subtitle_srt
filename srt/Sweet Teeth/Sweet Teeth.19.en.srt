[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,400
Do you really plan

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,440
to bring him to meet your parents?

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,440
I think he was right.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,360
I will grow old too.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,000
No matter how long I wait,

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,200
I'm still older than him.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,250
It's now or never.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:24,810
What about you?

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,580
Are you not planning to introduce

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,460
Dr. Ai to your mom?

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,900
I think we should
wait a little longer.

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,370
My mom had a slight

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,740
misunderstanding
towards Mr. Ai before.

16
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,060
How about this?

17
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,370
Let's schedule it on the same date.

18
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,010
After meeting the parents,

19
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,260
we shall drink up immediately.

20
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,260
What do people call that?

21
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,060
You only live once.

22
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,650
I don't think I'm up for it.

23
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,810
Mr. Ai and I haven't dated

24
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,740
for long.

25
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,930
Meeting the parents abruptly

26
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,380
would make him think
I'm being impatient.

27
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,490
Aren't you?

28
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,020
Not at all.

29
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,340
We're dating already.

30
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,530
He can't possibly run away.

31
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,850
That's uncertain.

32
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,660
Dr. Ai is very popular.

33
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,460
I trust him.

34
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,380
Dr. Ai has always been popular,

35
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,380
but he was never

36
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,930
caught in a scandal with anyone.

37
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,420
I remember on that day,

38
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,060
Yi Yi made him look
for me the whole day.

39
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,060
Not only he wasn't mad,

40
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,570
he confessed his feelings to me

41
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,420
sincerely.

42
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,850
Are you listening to me?

43
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,900
Check this out.

44
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,340
I think I just found

45
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,930
something unbelievable.

46
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,260
This...

47
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,850
This belongs to Yi Yi, right?

48
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,370
Back when we started with the launch

49
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,650
of the cafe,

50
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,570
everyone brought over

51
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,450
some books.

52
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,140
It was always here.

53
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,620
No one was interested to flip through.

54
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,289

Make me a cup of coffee.

57
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,979
The traffic was congested.

58
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,180
I'm exhausted.

59

Ma Yi Yi.

60
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:52,930
There was traffic.

61
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,140
I wasn't late on purpose.

62
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,340
I'm getting changed.

63
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,340
Look at what this is.

64
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,210

[Sweet Teeth]

66
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,260
I'll send you

67
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,010
the list of stocks to buy.

68
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,289
Just trust me and go for it.

69
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,009
Will I make a huge profit

70
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,450
like before?

71
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,820
Well, there's no guarantee,

72
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,930
but

73
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,420
I'm 70% confident.

74
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,900
You're asking me to go for it.

75
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,170
What happens if I make a loss?

76
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,010
Well, I've extra money in my pocket.

77
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,260
I bought the stocks with them.

78
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,140
Like I always say,

79
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,220
you don't know a thing.

80
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,450
Either you follow my lead
and buy these,

81
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,770
and sell them off when
I tell you to,

82
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,980
or stop trusting me entirely.

83
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,980
I don't want you to come for me

84
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,500
when you make a loss.

85
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,500
No, I trust you.

86
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,700
Something isn't right.

87
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,050
Why are you being so kind to me?

88
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,610
You came when I asked you out.

89
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,730
You recommended stocks

90
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,540
when I asked you to.

91
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,140
Are you reminded of how great I am

92
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,220
that your feelings for me rekindled?

93
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,140
You're being paranoid.

94
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,170
How is

95
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,700
Chris doing recently?

96
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,980
Why are you asking about him again?

97
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,770
Are you altering your sexuality?

98
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,100
I was casually asking

99
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:00,850
and making conversation.

100
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,890
We don't have anything
else to talk about.

101
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,940
My brother told me

102
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,770
Chris has been depressed recently.

103
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,890
He finally

104
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,850
found someone he likes,

105
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,140
yet the girl was cold.

106
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,820
In my opinion, for someone

107
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,010
as great as Chris,

108
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,770
the girl

109
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,140
is probably blind.

Let's get back together.

135
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,700
You slapped me previously

136
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,329
and said,

137
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,769
you shouldn't have
wasted your time on me.

138
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,420
I gave it some thought.

139
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,660
One's youth is meant

140
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,540
to experience adversities.

141
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,300
Ever since we broke up,

142
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,530
I haven't met

143

I kind of miss you.

I'm still young anyway.

146
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,380
Wasting two years of my life

147
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,770
isn't a big deal.

148
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,740
It is a big deal to me.

149
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,500
My principle is to never look back.

150
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,090
That's impossible.

151

Besides, my brother

154
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,260

No way.

159
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,620
Honestly though,

160
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,210
am I that unreliable?

161
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,740
Extremely unreliable.

162
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,770
You're easily bored.

163
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,770
Your thoughts are erratic.

164
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,820
You do not provide
a sense of security.

165
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,180
It's fun to date someone like you,

166
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,180
but if one were to settle down,

167
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,650
you show many red flags.

168
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,650
Nope.

169
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,890
It seems like I do have a little

170
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,140
feelings for Deng Hao Ran.

171
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,740
Don't worry.

172
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,940
I think it's because

173
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,970
I do not have a great man

174
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,940

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,620
shows up,

177
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,140
I'll be able to control myself

178
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,770
from falling into

179
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,650
the fiery pits known
as Deng Hao Ran.

180
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,620
Don't worry.

181
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:33,970
Don't worry.

182
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,820
Don't stare at me.

183
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,940
The fiery pit is my brother.

184
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,890
I'm unable to voice

185
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,700
my opinion objectively.

186
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,010
In regards to your feelings,

187
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,500
you shall call the shots.

188
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,530
If you'd really
throw yourself into it,

189
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,140
all we have to do

190
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,260
is put out the fire.

191
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,330
[I'm downstairs at your apartment.]

192
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,500
[Wu Ying]

193
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,570
[Where are you?]

194
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,300
Check out the building here.

195
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,860
The entire property and its unit

196
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,090
face southward.

197
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,300
It's north-south oriented.

198
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,940
It's a great place.

199
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,650
Not to mention,

200
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,450
the lighting

201
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,700
here is sufficient.

202
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,740
During the day,

203
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,620
from morning till evening,

204
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,570
sunlight would reach the units.

205
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,740
It'd make the place comfortable.

206
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,530
Wu Ying!

207
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,010
Yes.

208
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,409
Why are you dressed this way?

209
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,090
What's wrong?

210
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,010
Do I look mature?

211
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,409
Do I look reliable?

212
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,300
Yes,

213
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,409
you sure do.

214
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,740
You also look like you've
an interview to attend.

215
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,180
I spent a lot of effort to dress up.

216
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,060
This doesn't work.

217
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,140
Ying Ying.

218
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,500
Mom.

219
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,340
We cannot afford to buy a house.

220
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,620
You should approach someone else.

221
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,140
No, mom, he is...

222
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,770
Hello, auntie.

223
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,970
I'm Wu Ying's boyfriend.

224
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,090
My name is Liu Yu Cheng.

225
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,820
Auntie, allow me.

226
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,890
You address me as an auntie.

227
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,500
I feel guilty.

228
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,970
It feels like I'm old enough
to be your grandmother.

229
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,300
Young people

230
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,820
shouldn't be caught up with weight.

231
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,090
Eat more.

232
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,700
What happens if you
lose too much weight?

233
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,500
Here, Xiao Liu.

234
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,300
It's your first time visiting us.

235
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,090
Don't feel restrain. Here.

236
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,740
Thank you, uncle.

237
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,500
Wu Ying told me

238
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,450
you're from Malaysia.

239
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,890
[I forgot to mention to mom and dad]

240
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,570
[that Liu Yu Cheng doesn't]

241
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,500
[like greasy food.]

242
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,409
You must be

243
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:43,820
rather conservative for your age.

244
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,860
Not at all.

245
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,010
I was studying

246
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,890
engineering in Malaysia.

247
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,940
Afterward, I grew interested
in the Chinese Medicine

248
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,740
of China.

249
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,210
That's why I came to China
to restart my education.

250
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,770
My friends told me

251
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,300
I'm being rebellious.

252
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,700
You sure are opinionated.

253
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,570
Which aspect of the Chinese Medicine

254
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,330
are you mastering in?

255
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,090
I'm particularly interested in

256
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,860
health and diet.

257
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,940
I hope to be able to

258
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,890
combine diet therapy

259
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,450
and modern nutrition

260
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,380
together in the future,

261
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,530
contributing to the field.

262
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,940
Are you studying the eating habits?

263
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,380
Right?

264
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,060
Yes.

265
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,380
Check out the

266
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,260
dishes I made.

267
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,570
Are they healthy enough?

268
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,650
Give me some suggestions.

269
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,010
I'll be honest then, auntie.

270
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:24,890
Sure.

271
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,820
Firstly, red braised pork belly

272
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,650
is extremely high in fat content,

273
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,380
and low in protein.

274
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,890
It's not very suitable
for senior citizens.

275
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,770
It will lead to

276
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,650
an increased risk of
cardiovascular diseases.

277
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,500
These stuffed fried lotus roots.

278
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,450
Actually, lotus roots

279
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,650
are not considered vegetables.

280
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,530
They are carbs.

281
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,860
Consuming mere carbohydrates

282
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,740
or fat

283
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,530
is completely fine.

284
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,289
However,

285
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,140
if mixed together,

286
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,260
they are a combination
of oil and sugar.

287
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,220
Its calories are five times higher

288
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,010
than single carbs or single sugars.

289
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,460
It will cause a spike
in your blood sugar level.

290
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,460
Is that so?

291
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,860
Mom and dad.

292
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,500
Ignore him.

293
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,460
He's dim-witted.

294
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,410
I understand.

295
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,810
Going on about these

296
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,460
the first time we met

297
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,690
might irritate you a little.

298
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,650
However, if I do not

299
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,810
point it out as I notice,

300
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,220
I'm being irresponsible

301
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,340
towards the both of you.

302
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,050
Don't worry.

303
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,530
It's only natural.

304
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,890
I've never heard such

305
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,580
a detailed explanation before.

306
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,580
Give me a second.

307
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,410
I'll grab a notebook.

308
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,690
I'll take notes.

309
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,140
Don't be impatient.

310
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,500
Xiao Liu isn't going anywhere.

311
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,340
Let's just enjoy

312
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,650
our meal for now.

313
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,100
Afterward, let Xiao Liu

314
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,010
explain everything

315
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,220
in detail to us.

316
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,290
All right.

317
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,460
White rice

318
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,220
should be eaten with mixed grains.

319
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,530
That is the most healthy diet.

320
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,140
Xiao Liu.

321
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,500
It's great that you're here.

322
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,890
Allow me to

323
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,770
add both of you on WeChat.

324
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,860
I collected many

325
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,690
healthy recipes.

326
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,010
I can send them to you.

327
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,010
When Ying Ying has time
during the weekends,

328
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,380
I could come by and
make you some food.

329
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,530
That sounds lovely.

330
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,290
All right.

331
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,340
I don't know to add you on WeChat?

332
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,100
Me too.

333
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,140
I'll do it.

334
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:53,980
This one.

335
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,980
Mine too.

336
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,980
This one.

337
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,260
Here.

338
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:00,890
I got you.

339
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,260
All right.

340
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,690
It's convenient. Look.

341
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,530
Well,

342
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,890
do you enjoy

343
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,500
playing games as well?

344
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,410
I do,

345
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,340
but I'm a

346
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,500
health-based player.

347
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,740
Playing games

348
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,890
aren't beneficial.

349
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,050
According to researchers,

350
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,140
the best way to allow
one's brain to rest,

351
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,500
isn't through sleep,

352
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,290
it is to change one's perspective.

353
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,620
Take Ying Ying for an instance.

354
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,340
She spends all her time
at the Emergency Ward.

355
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,010
She has to deal
with a lot of patients.

356
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,290
Her mind is

357
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,580
constantly in the state of

358
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,980
processing information quickly.

359
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,980
At this point,

360
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,170
switching her thoughts

361
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,100
by playing two rounds of games,

362
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,980
is the best way to relax her mind.

363
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,650
That's for the best.

364
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,930
Look at him.

365
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,530
He even has research

366
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,050
to support his claims.

367
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,810
You're right.

368
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,220
However, uncle, don't worry.

369
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,580
I'll control
Ying Ying's gaming duration

370
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,500
strictly.

371
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,690
I'll not allow her head

372
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,380
to work double time.

373
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,860
Old man, don't worry.

374
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,620
Look at our Ying Ying.

375
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,810
After dating Xiao Liu,

376
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,050
her lifestyle is much
more disciplined.

377
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,740
Her diet would be healthy too.

378
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,170
Yes.

379
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,220
Most importantly,

380
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,650
she chose a great doctor.

381
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,740
Exactly.

382
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,890
That means

383
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,140
the both of them

384
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,100
are indeed better

385
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,140
together.

386
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,260
We're better together.

387
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,380
Mom and dad.

388
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,530
Stop praising him.

389
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,860
He's becoming smug.

390
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,050
You brat.

391
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:19,530
It's only necessary.

392
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,010
That's good enough.

393
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,890
Of course we're great.

394
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,650
Band-aid. Bandage.

395
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,890
I don't have to bring you along

396
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,340
on dates anymore.

397
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,260
[What are you doing?]

398
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,580
Hold on.

399
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,620
I already

400
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,380
texted Mr. Ai three times asking

401
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,650
what is he doing.

402
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,890
Zeng Li, what are you doing?

403
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,010
He's working.

404
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,690
You're being too clingy.

405
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,460
I'm probably infected by Ma Yi Yi.

406
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,860
[Ai Jing Chu]

407
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,650
[What are you doing?]

408
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,170
[I'm reading.]

409
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,380
[Aren't you at work?]

410
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,620
[Zeng Li]

411
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,740
I just handled a patient.

412
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,290
[I wanted to know what you're up to.]

413
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,940
[Ai Jing Chu]

414
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,530
[I'll come to you after work.]

415
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,580
[Sure.]

416
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,220
[Zeng Li]

417
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,860
[Ai Jing Chu]

418
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,340
[See you in two hours.]

419
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,380
It feels great to be in love.

420
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,980
We met the day before yesterday,

421
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,220
we met yesterday,

422
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
and we're meeting today.

423
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,650
I no longer have to

424
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,260
wait 28 days for my next appointment.

425
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,810
Who's crying?

426
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,140
The maintenance of the community

427
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,140
is slacking on their job.

428
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,770
The water tank on
the roof has been leaking

429
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,170
for days.

430
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,460
They couldn't care less.

431
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,930
If you did not file a complaint,

432
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,050
they'd leave it unattended
as long as possible.

433
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,410
It should be fine.

434
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,290
I'll talk to maintenance

435
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,580
to have the leak cleaned up

436
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,930
and acquire some cement

437
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,890
to get it mended.

438
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,500
Mended?

439
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,170
Look.

440
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,740
Be careful.

441
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:20,860
Safety first.

442
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,770
This can't do.

443
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,770
I must reason with maintenance.

444
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
They are bullies.

445
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,050
Are we over exaggerating?

446
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,890
The landlord is right.

447
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,620
It's threatening your well-being.

448
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,010
I should get someone

449
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,050
to get this fixed.

450
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,290
It's not that serious, right?

451
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,410
Imagine yourself

452
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,620
sitting on the couch

453
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,340
while texting me.

454
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,500
All of a sudden, the chandelier...

455
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,140
Repair this.

456
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:04,890
We must get this repaired.

457
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,170
We should stand over here

458
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,260
and keep a safe distance.

459
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,170
Okay.

460
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,580
The ceiling repairs

461
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,650
isn't a minor construction.

462
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:16,890
Does that mean

463
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,690
I will not be able stay here?

464
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,260
It's going to take at least half a month.

465
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,500
Even if we used eco-friendly paint,

466
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,170
it requires ventilation.

467
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,980
Should I stay over

468
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,930
at Ying Ying's or Yi Yi's

469
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:29,460
for a few days?

470
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:30,810
No.

471
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,770
Their quarters are messy.

472
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,140
I've to clean up after
them every time I'm there.

473
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,100
I could barely keep up

474
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,810
with how fast they make a mess.

475
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,740
Forget it. I'll stay at the hotel.

476
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,500
Perhaps,

477
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,050
you could stay at my place.

478
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,050
Not my house,

479
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,740
I mean, my grandfather's place.

480
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,460
My grandfather

481
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,050
has a guest room.

482
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,500
Besides, I'm going
home for dinner tonight.

483
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,140
I can bring you along.

484
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,460
Does that mean I'm
meeting your family already?

485
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,890
Are you reluctant?

486
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,930
That's not it.

487
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,650
I'm inexperienced.

488
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,050
My grandfather and auntie

489
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,100
are easygoing.

490
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,170
Besides, I made this decision

491
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,580
because...

492
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,340
Look.

493
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,980
We haven't been together for long.

494
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,620
You were caught in an accident

495
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,460
and went missing for a few hours.

496
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,980
Leaving you out there alone,

497
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,860
I'm worried.

498
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,890
Besides, in one month,

499
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,930
I'll be heading to
Africa on medical aid.

500
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,860
I hope I'll be able
to see you every day

501
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,140
during this period of time

502
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,460
and take care of my family as well.

503
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,140
However,

504
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,810
it's alright if you're

505
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,010
unwilling to.

506
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,890
I'm not going to force you.

507
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,930
I'll think about it.

508
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,690
Think about it?

509
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,050
Sure. Go ahead and think about it.

510
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:57,690
I'm leaving.

511
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,930
Wait up. Give me a second.

512
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,460
I'll come with you, alright?

513
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,650
We're home.

514
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,220
Your family must have

515
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,220
high expectations

516
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,290
for your girlfriend.

517
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,050
I suddenly feel unprepared.

518
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,530
I need to go.

519
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,290
You're here already.

520
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,260
Where are you going?

521
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:22,980
Wait.

522
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,290
I'm visiting your home abruptly.

523
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,500
Would your family be taken aback?

524
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:26,460
No.

525
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,890
They'd be elated.

526
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,810
They have always anticipated

527
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,460
that I'd

528
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,860
bring my girlfriend home.

529
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,770
This time,

530
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,740
I finally brought home

531
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,140
a chubby and adorable girlfriend.

532
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:35,810
They'd be surprised.

533
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,140
Chubby and adorable?

534
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:37,580
Wait.

535
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,140
I'm chubby and adorable?

536
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,690
In what way am I chubby?

537
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,930
I'm not chubby.

538
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,530
Look. Did I gain weight?

539
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
No, you see properly.

540
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,100
Stop laughing.
Where did I gain weight?

541
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,170
When did I gain weight?

542
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,380
Look at me properly.

543
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,010
Your house is so posh.

544
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,339
Dr. Chen.

545
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,740
I've always wanted you

546
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,410
to get to know Xiao Chu.

547
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,010
You're finally here.

548
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,410
Here. Enjoy some snacks.

549
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,010
Yes, feel free.

550
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,890
Dr. Chen, treat yourself at home.

551
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,250
Xiao Chu, you're home.

552
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,210
Hurry over.

553
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:17,690
Come.

554
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,780
Get to know Dr. Chen.

555
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,780
She's from your hospital.

556
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,540
Xiao Chu.

557
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,650
Dr. Chen is participating

558
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,060
in the medical aid to Africa.

559
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,650
Come and get to know her.

560
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,170
Xiao Chu.

561
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,730
Dr. Chen is a lady.

562
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,450
You should take care
of her once you're there.

563
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,410
Hello, Dr. Ai.

564
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,650
I'm Chen Ling of
respiratory medicine.

565
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,340
Hello.

566
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,060
Look at Dr. Chen.

567
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,780
As a doctor, she kept her figure

568
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,380
as well as a model.

569
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:39,890
You're right.

570
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,140
Not at all.

571
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,210
Normally, I enjoy

572
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,140
working out.

573
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,300
I tend to watch my diet as well.

574
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,780
It's no wonder.

575
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,140
Xiao Chu, quit standing over there.

576
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,540
Come on in. What are you doing?

577
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:49,860
Come on in.

578
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,730
Dr. Chen.

579
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,100
As I recall,

580
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,930
your father was a student of mine.

581
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,020
Yes, he brought it up.

582
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,020
You used to take
great care of him in the past.

583
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,020
Xiao Chu.

584
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,410
Who's this?

585
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,380
Allow me to introduce

586
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,580
my girlfriend,

587
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,250
Zeng Li.

588
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,020
Mr. Ai.

589
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,100
Let me introduce you.

590
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,690
This is my grandfather.

591
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,820
My auntie and my uncle.

592
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,450
This is Dr. Chen from

593
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,540
the respiratory medicine
of the hospital.

594
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,340
I just got to know her just now.

595
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,410
Hello, grandfather.
Hello, auntie.

596
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,620
Hello, uncle.

597
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,450
Hello.

598
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,780
Hello, Dr. Chen.

599
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,380
Hello.

600
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,620
It's all Xiao Chu's fault.

601
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,250
He didn't mention
about bringing you here.

602
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,140
I didn't prepare enough food.

603
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,300
There's more than enough.

604
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,540
You prepared

605
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,580
Dr. Chen's share as well.

606
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,020
Save it, mister.

607
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,820
Xiao Chu isn't a fool.

608
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,690
Your intentions

609
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,860
are blatant.

610
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,250
We should be open
and honest about it

611
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,340
so that Xiao Zeng wouldn't mind.

612
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,450
Xiao Zeng.

613
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,780
Dr. Chen is

614
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,930
a distant relative of ours

615
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,780
introduced her to us.

616
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,300
They thought Xiao Chu was single

617
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,250
and wanted to matchmake them.

618
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,540
Your auntie thought

619
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,620
since Dr. Chen is

620
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,730
heading to Africa as well,

621
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,930
she invited her back for a meal

622
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,780
to get to know her.

623
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,490
It wasn't me.

624
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,300
It was grandfather.

625
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,060
He said Dr. Chen's dad

626
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,540
was a student of his.

627
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,060
He said it'd be great to
strengthen old ties.

628
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,820
I did not say that.

629
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,820
I just explained objectively

630
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,170
that I knew her father.

631
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,620
You said

632
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,860
Dr. Chen was

633
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,140
pleasant and elegant
with a good figure.

634
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,140
She'd be a good match

635
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,210
with Xiao Chu.

636
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,860
Yes, it's my fault.

637
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,540
Not exactly.

638
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,060
It's all Mr. Ai's fault.

639
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,540
He wanted to give
all of you a surprise,

640
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,300
but it became a scare instead.

641
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,620
This isn't a scare.

642
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,250
We mentioned previously,

643
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,410
no matter who Xiao Chu brings home,

644
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,650
as long as she's a girl,

645
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,690
no matter what it is,

646
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,780
we'd be contented.

647
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,450
Yes.

648
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,970
We had no idea

649
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,930
he'd bring such a

650
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,490
pretty girlfriend home.

651
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,540
Xiao Zeng.

652
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,020
We met at Dongshan once.

653
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,690
Do you still remember?

654
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:03,970
Yes.

655
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,410
Back then,

656
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,300
I thought you were

657
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,140
Mr. Ai's sister.

658
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,580
You're one sweet talker.

659
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,580
That's what people always say.

660
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,100
Hurry up and eat.

661
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,890
In my family,

662
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:16,860
besides me,

663
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,490
they have large appetites.

664
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,730
Don't be ridiculous.

665
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,930
I'm a small eater.

666
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,580
Really?

667
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,100
That's a good habit. Keep it up.

668
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:27,730
Here.

669
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,620
Xiao Xiao.

670
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,100
What are you looking at?

671
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,620
Do you find

672
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,890
sister pretty too?

673
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,970
I know who she is.

674
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,210
She's Sister Star

675
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,690
in brother's phone.

676
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,020
Sister Star?

677
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,580
After launching WeChat,

678
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,620
the one who has a star labeled.

679
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,730
I saw brother has set her picture on it.

680
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,860
None of you got it.

681
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,060
She was the only one.

682
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,780
That's the story.

683
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,340
Xiao Xiao.

684
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,020
You're not allowed to

685
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,820
go through my phone anymore.

686
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,020
Why not?

687
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,650
Because I've

688
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,580
a girlfriend now.

689
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,860
My phone is only

690
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,890
available for my girlfriend.

691
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,890
I hate you.

692
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,300
All right. Don't be mad.

693
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,930
Here.

694
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,540
Are you sure you don't want to eat?

695

00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,140
The car is towed away.

864
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,250
I'll send you home in a while.

865
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,930
Thanks.

866
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,650
Do you still remember this place?

867
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,620
We used to come here
all the time four years ago.

868
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,930
The bridge was just constructed then.

869
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:03,690
Many couples

870
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,580
enjoyed taking photos here.

871
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,450
I was 22 years old then.

872
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:07,820
I'd describe

873
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,860
my life plan to you all the time.

874
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,820
This spot is beautiful.

875
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,820
Let's take our wedding photos

876
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,020
here in the future. What do you think?

877
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,450
You're being silly.

878
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
We're still young,

879
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,140
yet you already have
our wedding photos planned.

880
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,340
Look. I've it all figured out.

881
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,410
I'm 22 years old now.

882
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,970
I'll get married at 26.

883
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,300
I'll give birth to
my first child at 28.

884
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,820
By 30 years old,

885
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,490
I'll have a son and a daughter.

886
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,580
These are things in the future.

887
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,690
Planning them down to every detail

888
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,860
is pointless.

889
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,620
I'm already 22 years old.

890
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,620
I'm four years apart from

891
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,210
26 years old and 18 years old.

892
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,540
18 years old felt like yesterday.

893
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,820
26 years old

894
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,020
would happen tomorrow.

895
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,210
Are you out of your mind?

896
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,580
Stop thinking so far ahead.

897
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,650
Let's eat.

898
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,060
In a blink of an eye,
I'm already 26.

899
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,300
I'm barely

900
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,930
fulfilling half of my life's plan.

901
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,620
How are you and Chris doing?

902
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,780
He isn't bad, right?

903
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,820
I did not agree to

904
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,730
go on a date with him.

905
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,860
It was just a joke

906
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,890
to tease you.

907
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,540
Ma Yi Yi.

908
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,020
Are you still in love with me?

909
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,580
You shouldn't.

910
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,540
I'm unreliable.

911
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,620
Find someone else.

912
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,820
Perhaps, your life's plan

913
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,210
would be fulfilled in two years.

914
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,450
If you'd try it out with me again,

915
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,620
you might end up as an old lady.

916
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,860
What are you talking about?

917
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,170
I would never

918
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,540
return to an ex.

919
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,970
Not to mention, an
ex-boyfriend as dated as you.

920
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,690
Why are you asking
about Chris for no reason?

921
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,340
I'm afraid you'd get
yourself deceived again.

922
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,340
What are you doing?

923
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,380
Sending you to the hospital.

924
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,410
Are you trying to kill yourself?

925
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,060
Ma Yi Yi, what are you doing?

926
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:37,970
What is your relationship with him?

927
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:38,690
You let him kiss you?

928
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,170
You're allowing

929
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,540
him to take advantage of you.

930
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:43,970
She reminds me of

931
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,410
Ma Yi Yi.

932
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,340
I realized

933
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,100
you've a type.

934
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,380
Not at all.

935
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,490
Please. She's completely different.

936
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,340
I'm unreliable.

937
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,340
I tend to lose self-control.

938
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,300
[My mind tells me]

939
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,930
[I should have given up long ago,]

940
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,650
[but I'm extremely sure]

941
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,380
[that I still love him.]

942
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,170
[True love]

943
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,580
[isn't a momentary attraction.]

944
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,020
[It is when you know
nothing will come out of this,]

945
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,650
[yet you still possess
the urge to hold on.]

946
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,940
[CAROL'S]
[We're closed.]

947
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,620
[Have you read the]

948
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,170
[proposal I sent you?]

949
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,410
[Are you interested
in working together?]

950
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,210
I read it.

951
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,170
It does fit the
requirements of the market

952
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,890
and suits my image well.

953
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,100
I'm pretty interested.

954
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,100
[That's great.]

955
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,580
[Let's schedule a date]

956
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,730
[to discuss the details
of the cooperation.]

957
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,580
[I'm heading to
Switzerland in a few days.]

958
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,890
[I'm only free at 11 pm]

959
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,820
[the night after tomorrow.]

960
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,410
[You may come by my office then.]

961
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,020
[We can talk personally.]

962
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,580
11 pm on the night
after tomorrow.

963
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,140
The office?

964
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,340
Sure.

965
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,860
I'll see you in two days,

966
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,250
11 pm at your office.

967
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,340
[Okay.]

968
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,060
Who is that?

969
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,410
Chris.

970
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,650
Since when has Chris

971
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,690
started discussing work with you?

972
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,210
It happened last week.

973
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,540
He said, a romantic
relationship may have failed,

974
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,650
but we may still discuss

975
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:58,300
the cooperation.

976
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,060
He recently invested in

977
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,970
a livestreaming platform.

978
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:01,540
The company

979
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,060
is looking for a broadcaster like me.

980
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,690
Meeting at his office at 11 pm?

981
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,650
It doesn't sound like
a business meeting,

982
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,410
or a date,

983
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,250
it sounds more like

984
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,620
he's trying to sleep with you.

985
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,780
That's unnecessary.

986
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,620
A successful businessman like Chris

987
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,100
has an extremely tight schedule.

988
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,300
There's another possibility.

989
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,890
He wants to sleep with you

990
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,300
and discuss work with you.

991
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,490
There is no conflict in interest.

992
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,730
That's enough.

993
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,140
I know you're concerned about me,

994
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:28,730
but

995
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,540
it doesn't matter what he thinks.

996
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,300
My intentions

997
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,300
are to discuss work.

998
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,060
Besides, we're all adults.

999
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,380
Occasionally hovering around the

1000
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,410
boundaries

1001
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,410
is a way of survival

1002
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,300
for adults.

1003
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,540
Even if it's true

1004
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,380
that he harbors

1005
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,410
any vile intentions for me,

1006
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,380
I'd never yield.

1007
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,650
There's nothing he can do anyway.

1008
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,780
You're too naive.

1009
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:50,780
They could be

1010
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,930
forcing themselves on you.

1011
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,210
I really

1012
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,620
don't want to miss this opportunity.

1013
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,380
How about this?

1014
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,380
After you arrive,

1015
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,620
if anything happens,

1016
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,410
give us a call.

1017
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,860
Should we agree on a

1018
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,490
secret code before that?

1019
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,060
♫ What I want ♫

1020
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,650
♫ What I want to give ♫

1021
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,489
♫ You know better than anyone ♫

♫ I know it all ♫

1025
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:15,889
This song is so familiar.

1026
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,900
♫ Missed call ♫

1027
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:16,730
What is it called?

1028
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,020
♫ You didn't leave a text ♫

1029

♫ This is our secret code ♫

1032
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,210
[This is the wonders of a friendship.]

1033
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,139
[One glance]

1034
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,370
[and we'd know
what each other is thinking.]

1035
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,500
[One song lyric,]

1036
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,210
[and we'd come to an understanding.]

1037
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,290
[We'd dance around without]

1038
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,210
[a care for the world.]

1039
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,900
[The three of us]

1040
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,620
[are each other's support.]

1041
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,580
[Of course I know]

1042
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,940
[that we're not perfect.]

1043
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,810
[We're covered with flaws,]

1044
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,620
[but none of these would stop them]

1045
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,020
[from standing by me,]

1046
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:53,100
[and I'll always stand by them.]
