The earth will be destroyed in two minutes

3
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:17,000
Every hero movie needs a chosen actor

4
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,250
As the most handsome man in the universe

5
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,500
I am Yang Sihuo

6
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,916
Survived with my buddy

7
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,750
From small to large

8
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,166
my dream is

9
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,083
go to outer space

10
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,500
in that universe

11
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,333
My dad is not a seafood tycoon.

12
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,333
But the President of the Galaxy

13
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,916
Only worship me

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,333
My mother became his beautiful accomplice

15
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:39,500
She loves to say

16
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,666
What school are you going to?

17
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,833
go out and play

18
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,583
No more looking like a robot

19
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:45,750
Only engaged in learning

20
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,500
It’s not that I have bad grades

21
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,250
My excellent mathematics, physics and chemistry are enough to fly a spaceship

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,250
An adventure across the galaxy

28
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,250
To prevent the world from being destroyed

29
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:01,416
our mission

30
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:02,500
our mission

31
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:02,583
Just fight monsters

32
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,500
Just fight monsters

33
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,250
finally

34
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,916
at the end of the story

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,583
We found the ultimate answer to the universe

36
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,916
That is

37
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,166
teacher

39
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,250
I&#39;ll send you to roam

Takeshi Kaneshiro

00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,666
Xinyue likes him

42
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:46,500
yes

43
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,416
Happy

44
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,916
This TV can&#39;t be turned on

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,250
Shenzhou 6 is about to begin

collector&#39;s edition

50
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:56,833
You have this

51
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:57,833
This isn&#39;t right either

52
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
He has finished copying it. I took it away.

53
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:02,916

55
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:04,083

Mode

57
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:04,250
Give it a try

58
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:04,500
try it

59
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,750
Is it stupid?

60
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,000
003

61
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,583
Who would use the school’s name as a password?003

62
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:07,916
right

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,750
study well

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,750
monitor

65
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,833
003 Today’s live broadcast is different from usual

66
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,416
0003 Can we put studying aside for a while?

67
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,250
Get off

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
are you stupid

69
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,583
I said learn the password well

70
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,166
caught up

71
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:25,916
six

72
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:26,333
five

73
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:26,416
force

74
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:26,666
five

75
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:26,916
five

76
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:27,083
five

77
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:27,166
force

78
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:27,250

79
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,250
Four

80
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:28,500
three

81
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:31,833
Oh, what are you doing? This is

82
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,000
Oops - what is this?

83
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:32,250
Oh, what are you doing? This is

84
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,250
What are you doing

85
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,333
That&#39;s your result

86
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,916
Do you still have time to care about the Rockets?

87
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,416
People&#39;s rockets are flying into the sky

88
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,416
Your problem is to go underground

89
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,583
Ability

90
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,333
Why don&#39;t you come over?

91
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,333
come over

92
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,500
Let me introduce to you

93
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,000
This is classmate Xu Niannian who just transferred here

94
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,666
Everyone applauds and welcomes

95
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,000
Introduce yourself

96
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,166
Hello everyone

97
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,666
My name is Xu Niannian

98
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,416
Maybe I will never forget it

99
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,000
Gone

100
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
There&#39;s an empty seat in the back

101
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,916
You can sit there for now.

102
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:29,166
102

103
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,583
Take a look at your own papers

104
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,000
You don’t want to learn English anymore, do you?

105
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,750
especially some people

106
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,000
A test paper with a full score of 150 points

107
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,416
I didn&#39;t get even a fraction of the test.

108
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,166
Even if you choose C, you won’t get this point.

109
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,250
Already a sophomore in high school

110
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,750
The college entrance examination will be held next year

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,583
I still want to read a novel about little people

112
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,916
four fires

113
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:51,916
What about you?

114
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:53,916
Yang Yi

115
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,333
Another little trick

116
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,333
Read test papers with new classmates

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,166
Judging from the test paper

118
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,500
Let me tell you what reading comprehension is

119
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,750
How to read

120
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,500
Reading ability is divided into two aspects

121
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,000
One is reading speed

122
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,166
One is the ability to understand

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,583
Reading speed is the most basic ability of reading

124
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,500
Mom, I went to school

125
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:53,583
sorry Sorry

126
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,916
I did not do it on purpose

127
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,000
Can you drive?

128
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:06,833
How do you drive?

129
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:07,833
Can I drive?

130
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,333
I asked you, can you stand still?

131
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,750
Can&#39;t you just stay away from me?

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
AL

133
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:25,750
Can it be opened?

134
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,250
What&#39;s going on?

135
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,916
Everyone, stand on the side of the road and pay attention to safety.

136
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,750
What should I do? I&#39;m going to be late.

137
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,166
stop

138
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,333
What time is it?

139
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,333
Yang Yi

140
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,000
If you really don’t want to go to school

141
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,416
you can tell me

142
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,583
I&#39;ll call your parents right away

143
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,750
Can I take you home?

144
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,250
Special situation today

145
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,416
The bus had a flat tire

146
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,166
The bus had a flat tire

147
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,500
Why didn&#39;t you say the bridge collapsed?

148
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,083
real

149
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,000
right

150
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,250
The new classmate who arrived yesterday

151
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,750
She is also on the bus

152
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,083
When she comes she can testify

153
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,750
There is no truth in his mouth

154
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,250
Just stand here

155
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:30,666
daily routine

156
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,750
homework homework

157
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,416
Hand in homework

158
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,666
I skipped the entire morning reading

159
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,916
Four fires are okay

160
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,250
Hand in homework

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,416
Have you finished writing?

162
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,000
It&#39;s pretty fast

163
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,666
Take a taxi?

164
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,416
Have you ever seen a human running?

165
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,000
Operation

166
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:51,000
Did not bring

167
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:51,500
Did not bring

168
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:51,833
Did not bring

169
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:52,666
Sue the teacher

170
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,166
Fellow students

171
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,166
A notification will be broadcast below

172
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,666
In response to the call of the Municipal Education Bureau, our school

173
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,583
Will be organized this year

174
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,083
ten kilometers

175
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,750
Who wants to run?

176
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,750
All high school sophomores must participate

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,750
Students are quiet

178
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:16,166
Quiet

179
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:16,333
Nvjing

180
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:16,416
Quiet

181
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:16,583
Quiet

182
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:16,666
Shoes

183
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:16,833
Quiet

184
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:16,916
cloud shoes

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Quiet

186
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,916
Don&#39;t whisper to each other

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,083
Open the English book

188
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,333
Today we are going to talk about intricate conditionals

189
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,750
Please look at the blackboard

190
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,750
ten kilometers

191
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,000
Come as you say

192
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,250
Why didn&#39;t he let the freshman in high school go?

193
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,583
Is it easy for us when there are old people on top and young people on the bottom?

194
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,583
Feng shui takes turn

195
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,416
Last year&#39;s city choir competition

196
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
Didn’t you also participate in the freshman year of high school?

197
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,416
Then I strongly recommend

198
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,666
This will happen again next year

199
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,916
The senior year of high school must be allowed to go

200
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,416
that is

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
2

202
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,333
What are you laughing at?

203
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:44,833
yes

204
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,500
Isn’t that all us?

205
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:48,833
Everyone, listen up

206
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,000

00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,083
Choose C

212
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,666
This is a fill-in-the-blank question.

213
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:11,916
A0027

214
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,333
I think you look just like C

215
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:13,416
A0027

216
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:13,583
Roller

217
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,833
Why didn&#39;t you choose W?

218
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,916
Come and make you laugh the most

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,833
Come up

220
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:22,583
Answer the question

221
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,583
I won&#39;t

222
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,833
Next week the school will organize us to participate in a health run

223
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,083
-If you finish first - buy it

224
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:29,666
foot

225
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:32,916
Come daddy

226
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,583
Eat this, eat this

227
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,500
The price of that prawn cannot be increased

228
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,250
Why is mom eating seafood again?

229
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,083
Can we change to something lighter?

230
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:41,833
seafood

231
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,250
High quality protein

232
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,500
strong brain

233
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,166
Son

234
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,500
You just need to eat more now

235
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:46,833
Come

236
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,916
Then you can&#39;t eat every meal, right?

237
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,916
Mom watches you eat it

238
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,166
Open your mouth

239
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,416
No, don&#39;t worry

240
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,416
Open your mouth

241
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,166
I mean

242
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,416
Is it delicious?

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,333
Mom specially put in a lot of abalone juice today

244
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,333
Delicious

245
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,166
Eat quickly, son

246
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,750
hurry up

247
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,583
You said if we increase the money

248
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,250
Do others say that our business is unethical?

249
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,500
All are old customers

250
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,333
I didn’t say there would never be an increase in money in the future.

251
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,083
Good evening, listeners.

252
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,500
How big is the universe

253
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,250
How small we are

254
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,583
The following is played for you

255
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,833
&quot;Sounds of the Earth&quot; album

256
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:40,416
It is composed of fifty-five human languages ​​and various sounds

257
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,583
1977 with the Voyager 1 space probe

258
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,250
launched into outer space

259
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,833
&quot;Voice of the Earth&quot; is about humans and extraterrestrial life

260
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,333
bridge of communication

261
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,500
Expressing greetings from humans to other alien life forms

262
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:06,833
Hundred

263
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,833
Hello everyone

264
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,250
Dapeng rises with the wind in one day

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,833
Skyrocketing to ninety thousand miles

266
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,583
classmates

267
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,583
What greets you today is not just a ten-kilometer runway

268
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,083
It’s also a long journey

269
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,750
Don&#39;t be afraid of strong opponents

270
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,583
Your only opponent is yourself

271
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,833
Go forward bravely

272
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,916
for your own class

273
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,250
add glory

274
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:45,833
Okay, classmates

00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:09,916
you

280
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:11,916
How about it

281
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,333
I see you don’t have to run away today

282
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,000
You can win the award directly

283
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:16,916
My dad said

284
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,583
As long as I can get the first place this time

285
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,250
Just buy me an astronomical telescope

286
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,250
times

287
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,250
It&#39;s also a sports school

288
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,750
Who are you trying to scare?

289
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:29,833
Who are you scaring?

290
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:30,583
Who are you trying to scare?

291
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:30,750
Who are you scaring?

292
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:30,833
Who are you trying to scare?

293
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,083
Stretch more to prevent injuries

294
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,250
Run as soon as possible and go back to do the questions

295
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:44,750
come on

296
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,250

298
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:48,166
monitor

299
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:48,416
monitor

300
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,333
give you this

301
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,916
You can replenish your energy when you are tired from running

302
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,583
No need, I&#39;ll lose weight

303
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,250
Not fat

304
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,166
thank you

305
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,000
Everyone is in place

306
00:12:59,166 --> 00:12:59,500
preparation

307
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,000
preparation

308
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:00,500
Tang Sports School

309
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,666
Move faster

310
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,000
come on! Come on

311
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,083
Move faster

Yangzao

314
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:52,166
Yang body tea

315
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,500
What’s wrong with you

316
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:53,666
What’s wrong with you

317
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,166
I seem to be allergic

318
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,250
Come on Yangli

319
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:57,416
male body oil

320
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:57,750
come on

321
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:58,750
come on

322
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,083
come on

323
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,166
Come to the back classmate

324
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,000
faster

325
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,416
come on

326
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,250
four fires

327
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:07,916
where are you going

328
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:08,916
road watch

329
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,166
What are you doing

330
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,833
I

331
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,250
Keep up the rhythm and take big breaths

332
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,083
Come with me

333
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,833
Next time, don’t believe these remedies in magazines.

334
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:19,583
Useless

335
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:20,500
Moreover

336
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,083
You are not fat

337
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:21,916
What weight should I lose?

338
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,250
thin back to thin

339
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,000
There is meat in my belly

340
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,166
Stupid or not?

341
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,583
External use of slimming cream does not participate in metabolism

342
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,250
This plastic wrap is not breathable

343
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,083
Still running like this

344
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,250
Can you get rid of the rash?

345
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,416
Oh, right

346
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,916
You don’t need to apply it until the itching stops.

347
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,416
There are hormones

348
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,500
Will leave a seal

349
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,250
How do you know so much?

350
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,250
My dad said

351
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,166
Formal introduction

352
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,166
My name is Xiang Yuan

353
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,000
Then let me introduce it too

354
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:45,583
Then let me introduce it too

355
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,250
Lei Feng

356
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,750
Thank you Xu Leifeng

357
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,083
come on

358
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,250
come on

359
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:05,916
come on

360
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:06,666
come on

361
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:07,583
come on

362
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:08,583
Well done

363
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:09,916
good

364
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,333
four fires

365
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
look here

366
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,250
Healthy run

367
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,083
First place Yang Yi

368
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,166
I know you have to be first

369
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,916
Thousand-fold high-definition astronomical telescope

370
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,833
Arriving this Saturday

371
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,166
Do you want to go to my house and see me?

372
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,083
I can see Sister E

373
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,250
more than

374
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,083
Then don&#39;t let me discover aliens

375
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,416
This health run comes just in time, right?

376
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Otherwise the telescope

377
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,250
You have to wait until after the college entrance examination

378
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,916
The taxi will arrive in a more timely manner, right?

379
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
What&#39;s the meaning

380
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,500
Who are you talking about?

381
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,250
Who recognizes whom I am talking about?

382
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,750
If you don’t want others to know, don’t do anything unless you do it yourself

383
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:01,333
Right

384
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,083
Slower

385
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,000
Come

386
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,416
This thousand-magnification telescope is different.

387
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:24,250
<i>LADAM.</i> <b>LADAM.</b> <i>ARNAS</i> <b>ARNS</b>

Go watch the stars at night

401
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,166

00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,166
stop

405
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,500
Your school organizes a health run

406
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,416
You won first place

407
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,666
How did you get it

408
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,083
How else can I get it?

409
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,583
The school gave it to me

410
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,916
Given by the school

411
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,500
Your teacher Zheng

412
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,750
Just called me

413
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,250
Yang Yi, you are really capable.

414
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,000
Why don&#39;t you go to heaven?

415
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:19,583
I&#39;ll let you

416
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,083
Did you give it to the school?

417
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,500
I asked your school to give it to you

418
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,000
I&#39;ll let you

419
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:23,833
Uncle, you made a typo

420
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,750
While others are jogging, you take a taxi.

421
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,166
Why haven&#39;t I noticed that you are so smart?

422
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:28,916
If you educate, educate

423
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,750
What are you doing?

424
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,333
Not four fires

425
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,333

I&#39;m in a very good mood today

460

dad

461
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:19,750
very good

462
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,083
Has it been discovered?

463
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,916
I asked you to take a taxi instead of calling me

464
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:29,666
correct

465
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,833
Lao Zheng rode back and forth that day

466
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,500
I never left the main runway.

467
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,500
How did he know you took a taxi?

This bus is full. Wait for the next bus.

481
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,500
Let Xu Niannian explain to everyone

482
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,666
P is momentum equal to mass times velocity

483
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,083
Since velocity is a vector

484
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,666
So momentum is equal to vector

485
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:42,833
Very nice, please take a seat

486
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:46,083
?

487
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,083
Come classmates

488
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,500
Please see question 11

489
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,666
Don&#39;t you think you get tired easily?

490
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,333
Who can translate?

491
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,083
Unbelievable

492
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What English song are you singing blindly?

493
00:19:59,166 --> 00:19:59,833
Memorize words

494
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:00,916
Just keep sleeping

495
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,750
This is how the joke must be to be funny

496
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,583
Awesome enough

497
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:33,666

you two

500
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,500
It&#39;s none of your business

501
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,833
The joke was a little too much.

502
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,166
Are you sick?

503
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,416
Have you watched too much Meteor Garden?

504
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,250
Do you think you are Daoming Temple?

505
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,833
Find a sense of existence by bullying others

506
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,666
Why are you so mentally unsound?

507
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,250
I ignore you

508
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,833
I&#39;m too lazy to waste my brain cells playing with you

509
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,916
As a result, you became more and more seductive every time.

510
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,083
And you look forward to the road

511
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,666
What else would you do besides following him all day long?

512
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,250
Do you think you are Twins?

513
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,833
I want to be the next queen of heaven.

514
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,416
Looks like a dog

515
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,416
The result is full of headaches

516
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,083
The flies bite me and my feet are sprained

517
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,833
I&#39;ll leave it here today

518
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,416
Who will touch me again in the future?

519
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,166
I&#39;ll make you regret being born

520
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,250
she

521
00:21:58,916 --> 00:21:59,416

Again

525
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,583
Didn&#39;t you scold me enough last time?

526
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,333
My eldest sister is not very good at basketball.

527
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,666
If I did it on purpose

528
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,500
You have already been admitted to the hospital

530
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,500
Since you can&#39;t stand me

531
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,666
Just stop doing little things behind your back.

532
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,333
If you have the ability, let’s compete openly and honestly.

533
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,416
I don’t know who is behind the scenes.

535
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,666

00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,166
Don&#39;t say that I bullied you then.

541
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,583
What if you lose?

542
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,250

You know shit

586
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:45,750

00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:56,916
What did I say?

594
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:04,750

Xinxin

605
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,083
Come on Niannian

606
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,166
Score one more goal and win.

607
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:40,250

Four

612
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:54,333
Are you okay?

613
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:56,333
keep coming

614
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,000
Forget it, you&#39;re already like this

615
00:24:58,833 --> 00:24:59,916
Don&#39;t talk nonsense, I can do it

616
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,833
Okay, you won’t lose this time

617
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,416
I didn’t lose, okay?

618
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:04,916
No one has reached nine points.

619
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,750
Why don&#39;t we wait until you&#39;re well-raised before we compete?

620
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,583
No need to raise

621
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:09,750
XX

622
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,416
Let&#39;s change it to something else

623
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:11,500
XX

624
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,666
You decide the project

625
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,833
Whoever wins three games first wins

626
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:15,500
OK

627
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,333
XX

628
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,000
XX

629
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:20,083
Xx

630
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:20,916
XX

631
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:26,916
Brother Huo

632
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,000
What I twisted this afternoon was my right foot.

633
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,750
You&#39;ve been pretending all night

634
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,583
Are you tired of acting?

635
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:37,666
I&#39;m tired of watching

636
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:40,500
Coca-Cola Coca-Cola

637
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,166
Why are you pretending to be injured?

638
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,833
Lost to Xu Niannian in basketball

639
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,833
It&#39;s better to just wear a skirt

640
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,166
you say

641
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:54,916
Did anyone notice that I was pretending to be injured?

642
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,166
no

643
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Your acting skills are better than this football skills

644
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:00,750
What do you say

645
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,583
Did Xu Niannian see it?

646
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,000
It seems that she can let you go

647
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:07,250
boss

648
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,916
This is where you put the money

649
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,666
Why didn&#39;t you sleep?

650
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,916
I told your father when he bought this jade

651
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,500
Wearing jade is worse than wearing gold

652
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:30,250
You&#39;ve been very active since you were a child.

653
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,583
Sooner or later, jade will fall apart in your hands

654
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,500
You were right, right?

655
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,416
Now I know Wen Jing

656
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,000
If it had been like this, it would have been fine

657
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,416
I don’t know who I followed.

658
00:26:55,416 --> 00:27:02,583
I wish you a happy life

659
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,833
A birthday gift from Niannian to you

660
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:32,583
Flash left

661
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,500
Flash right

662
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:34,583
Take a step sideways

663
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:35,583
Come rush

664
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I miss my dad

665
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,083
I think dad still doesn’t know how to be careful

666
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:17,916
I didn&#39;t do this

667
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,583
If it&#39;s not you, who is that?

668
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,666
a classmate

669
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,666
Someone really dares to bully you?

670
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,916
But those are all the leftovers from my play

671
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:32,750
Don&#39;t worry, mom

672
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:33,500
Not a big problem

673
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,583
Cut him

674
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,416
Come on Niannian

675
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:45,416
Four fires come on

676
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,583
Xu Niannian is also so good at table tennis

677
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,083
Her father used to be a sports school coach.

678
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,083
Niannian has grown up on the court since she was a child.

679
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:00,916
EMERGENCY

680
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:15,750
This is worse than a ball

681
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,583
No more ball games

682
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,416

If it fails, the minister will be punished.

691
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,166
To tell the spirit of the late emperor

692
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,000
Sihuo is already five sentences behind

693
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:51,250
And wait for it

694
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,000
Stay away now

695
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:57,583
Tears in tears

696
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:58,666
Don&#39;t know what to say

697
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,416
I&#39;ve won two games in a row

698
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,750
Why don&#39;t you choose something you&#39;re good at?

699
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,750
That&#39;s what you said

700
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,000
If you don&#39;t want to be embarrassed

701
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,916
It&#39;s not too late to admit defeat now

702
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:14,250
hurry up

703
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,750
I still have to go home and cook.

You are too handsome, right?

724
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:39,833
Congratulations to your classmate

725
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:41,583
This is your first prize

726
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,333
Thanks

727
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:51,833
I forgot

728
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:53,500
Balloons are also balls

729
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:54,583
congratulations

730
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,333
The special prize is yours

00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:58,083
What

733
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,000
All of this is fine

734
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,000
Sihuo, you have won.

735
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:07,000
I&#39;m sorry

goodbye

740
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,416
goodbye

741
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:19,333
Xu Niannian is going to Tsinghua University and Peking University

742
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,833
It’s okay if you don’t want to study.

743
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,250
I can take over your father&#39;s seafood restaurant in the future.

744
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,166
But you can&#39;t influence others

745
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:27,666
She wants to compare herself to me

746
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:29,166
Are you still making excuses?

747
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:31,833
Just forget about the two of you making trouble at school.

748
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,500
Is the game arcade a place where students like you should go?

749
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:35,333
That is

750
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:36,583
video arcade

751
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,333
Stop playing this word game with me

752
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:41,083
I see you have really lost your mind now.

753
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,000
I&#39;ve lost my student ID card for so long and there&#39;s no reaction at all.

754
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,750
Why is my student ID card with you?

755
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,333
If it weren&#39;t for this student ID card

756
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:53,000
I didn’t even know that you came first in the health run by taking a taxi.

757
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,083
The driver will make a special trip to deliver it to you.

758
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:57,833
what are you looking at

759
00:32:58,583 --> 00:32:59,583
Go back and reflect

760
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,083
A 3,000-word review can’t be used for a single word.

761
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:14,416
Miss you, she&#39;s back

762
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,333
Niannian is back

763
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:19,083
Nian Nian

764
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:20,166
Xinxin

765
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,750
You should take it apart and take a look.

766
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:42,583
Xu Niannian

767
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,166
You don&#39;t think so fondly

768
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:46,583
This is a love letter, right?

769
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:50,166
How can it be

770
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,166
I&#39;m not crazy

771
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:54,583
You should dismantle it

772
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,500
Take it apart and take a look

773
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,250
Where&#39;s your cheerleading team?

774
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:08,666
I didn&#39;t let them come

775
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,500
Just the two of us competing

776
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:12,500
Better than doing belly curls

777
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:13,583
no

778
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,500
Than this

779
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:15,833
no action

780
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:16,666
right

781
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:21,583
Xu Niannian

782
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:24,333
I know

783
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,500
Taking a taxi is wrong

784
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,750
But I really want an astronomical telescope

785
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,583
I originally thought it was you who told the secret

786
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:33,666
Xu Niannian

787
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:35,666
I wrongly blamed you

788
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,083
have you ever thought about

789
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
the world we see

790
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:43,916
Why is it like this now?

791
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,416
I asked my dad when I was little

792
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,083
What do you think my dad said?

793
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:52,916
He said study hard

794
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:54,833
Don&#39;t always think about these useless things

795
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:56,666
Get into a good university in the future

796
00:34:57,916 --> 00:34:58,916
I asked this question

797
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,333
Newton gave me the answer

798
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:01,666
The conclusion is

799
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:03,916
Gravity holds us to the Earth&#39;s surface

800
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,583
if we got rid of gravity

801
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,500
You can fly out of the earth

802
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,500
If it were faster

803
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,666
You can fly to space

804
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,666
The monitor told me about the jade pendant.

805
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,166
sorry

806
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:27,333
I believe that all relatives who have passed away will return to the universe

807
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,750
They are all watching us from heaven

808
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:32,583
Xu Niannian

809
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:34,416
I lost

810
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,666
Willing to admit defeat

811
00:35:58,916 --> 00:35:59,416
Huo Meier

812
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:01,500
If you are so promiscuous, who knows?

813
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:02,166
Don&#39;t talk nonsense

814
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:18,583
?

815
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:18,750
?

816
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:25,083
four fires

817
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:25,166
Son

818
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:25,333
four fires

819
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Fourth Young Master

820
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:01,000
Do not laugh

821
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,250
Follow me to the office

822
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,000
Walk

823
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:05,333
hurry up

824
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:06,750
I&#39;m not good at talking, right?

825
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:07,666
hurry up

826
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:09,250
Do not laugh

827
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:11,583
19

828
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,333
Miss your zodiac sign

829
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:19,500
There will be unexpected love luck this week

830
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:21,166
You have to take care of yourself

831
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,333
Fate around you

832
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,333
What about me?

833
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:26,166
Aries

834
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:28,250
you will be in this month

835
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,000
second weekend

836
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,000
Feel the power of God of Love

837
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,500
You&#39;ve met someone you really like

838
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:35,083
To treasure it well

839
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,083
Why are you looking at me like this?

840
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:40,333
No

841
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,250
&quot;Boys and Girls&quot; I&#39;m going to buy a copy too

842
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,333
Old Zheng, Old Zheng, Old Zheng is here

843
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:50,083
casually

844
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,750
The results of this monthly exam have come out

845
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,333
Classmate Xu Niannian

846
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,583
Not only the first in the class

847
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,083
And he is the first in the whole grade

848
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,333
A002

849
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:02,416
Amazing

850
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:05,833
Unlike some classmates

851
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,083
Not only did I not focus on studying,

852
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:09,583
After the teacher reminds

853
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:10,750
Not only did it not correct

854
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,166
And it gets worse

855
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:12,916
grandstanding

856
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:15,250
Yang Yi

857
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:18,083
I know you have good grades in physics and math

858
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:21,083
But your English score cannot always be the last in the class.

859
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,916
If someone else is partial to science, it’s a leak.

860
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,666
This is a direct hit.

861
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:27,250
okay

862
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,583
I don’t care about other subjects.

863
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:29,833
starting today

864
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:30,666
English lesson

865
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,000
Implement one-to-one assistance

866
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:34,750
Help someone with poor grades

867
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,083
every day after school

868
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:37,916
Stay in school for tutoring

869
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,583
An hour

870
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,583
Strive for everyone to make progress together

871
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:42,833
Classmate Xu Niannian

872
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:45,166
Your English score is the best

873
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:45,666
Yang Yi

874
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,333

876
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:49,666
you do not need

877
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Then what use do you have?

878
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:54,500
Teacher Zheng

879
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,000
Yang Yi&#39;s left and right brain development is completely unbalanced

880
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,166
Even if I send him to stay abroad for a month

881
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,833
Foreigners can all speak Chinese now

882
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,166
He can&#39;t learn English either

883
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,166
I wasn&#39;t serious before

884
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,250
If I get serious

885
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,166
Do you think you can still keep your first place in the final exam?

886
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,750
I feel confident wearing hairpins

887
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,416
I just like how you feel

888
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,833

This super moon is older than us

890
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:27,416
That must be very different.

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,583
Walk

964
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:04,833
telescope

965
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:05,416
Can&#39;t care anymore

966
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:05,916
Walk

967
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:14,916
Come

968
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:17,083
Don&#39;t run

969
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:18,583
i see you

970
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:20,916
This way

971
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,083
go inside

972
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,666
Where are the people?

973
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,750
I even pried open the rooftop door.

974
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:47,083
You are brave enough

975
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:11,250
Don&#39;t move here

976
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:16,250
scared me

977
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,500
why is it you again

978
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:21,083
Follow me to the Academic Affairs Office

979
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:23,416
hurry up

980
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:25,500
The telescope was confiscated

981
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,166
I&#39;ve heard of the Four Fires

982
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,750
Someone is a hero and saves the beauty

983
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:33,000
I wrote another 5,000 words of self-criticism

984
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:33,666
What do you know

985
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,750
I finally passed the test in English

986
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,333
My dad was about to give me the telescope back

987
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:38,000
This is just great

988
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:38,916
Confiscated again

989
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,250
Not some people

990
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:43,000
I want to take Xu Niannian to see the super moon

991
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:46,583
You clearly promised to take me there before

992
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:48,000
man

993
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,083
Didn’t I treat you to a big dinner?

994
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:51,833
MAM

995
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:53,166
This is your store

996
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:54,583
At most, my uncle invites me

997
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,083
MHI

998
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:01,916
I heard you yesterday

999
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,583
Confessed to the squad leader

1000
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,083
How about it

1001
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:08,333
Did it touch her little heart?

1002
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:09,916
Didn’t this bring you?

1003
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,250
We agreed that the God of Love would come this month

1004
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,583
Be brave enough to express your feelings

1005
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:14,750
have to

1006
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:15,083
have to

1007
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,750
All the chocolates were returned to me.

1008
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:17,500
No, brother

1009
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:18,416
Everyone gives you filled chocolates

1010
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,333
You gave me wine

1011
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:21,666
Why don&#39;t you express your love for me now?

1012
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:24,083
MA

1013
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,000
It&#39;s alright

1014
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:28,083
MAM

1015
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,500
There is ample time

1016
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,666
We two brothers

1017
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,583
chocolate cheers go

1018
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,000
MA

1019
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:41,666
Open?

1020
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:42,083
Lift

1021
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:42,250
open

1022
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:54,416
This is our country’s socialist modernization drive

1023
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,500
a major achievement

1024
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,250
jointly realize the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way

1025
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:01,250
flowers will bloom in spring

1026
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:04,166
Birds are free

1027
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,000
What&#39;s wrong with you

1028
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,583
This can&#39;t stay any longer

1029
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,083
I haven’t finished drinking yet. Here are some more

1030
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,333
Heshi is the human world with experience

1031
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:09,416
It is a blessing for the human world to have a calendar and a unified world

1032
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:09,500
The United World is the beneficial history of human beings.

1033
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:10,000
Experience in the human world

1034
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,083
what are you doing

1035
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,583
You scared me to death

1036
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:15,500
Heshi is the human world with experience

1037
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:17,500
Why don&#39;t you accept my chocolate?

1038
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:17,583
cloud

1039
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:17,666
JJ public LX

1040
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:17,750
TZLX

1041
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:19,916
My mother won’t let me fall in love early

1042
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,250
How can we arrange seats according to grades?

1043
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:21,750
right

1044
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:22,833
This is simply discrimination.

1045
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:24,333
so far away

1046
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,416
How inconvenient is it to help me make up lessons?

1047
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,500
What about the one-to-one support we promised?

1048
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:31,333
Can you move it?

1049
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:32,416
I&#39;ll help you move

1050
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:35,250
Moving a table is not moving a mountain

1051
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:36,000
excuse me

1052
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:36,250
let

1053
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:36,666
excuse me

1054
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,000
I&#39;ll come and I&#39;ll move

1055
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:40,583
Give me

1056
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:41,333
I come

1057
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:42,166
Just give it to me

1058
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:42,916
Give me

1059
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:45,500
Are you okay?

1060
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,416
Are you okay?

1061
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:46,666
Oh my god

1062
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,416
Where did it hit?

1063
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,000
Where did it fall?

1064
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:50,916
Help me, help me

1065
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,583
mom

1066
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,166
I said it&#39;s okay

1067
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:54,750
You can be discharged from the hospital today

1068
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:55,583
Can&#39;t

1069
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:57,500
The doctor said

1070
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,166
You just put the plaster on

1071
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,166
try not to move

1072
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:02,500
good son

1073
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,416
Let&#39;s just stay in the hospital and take good care of ourselves for a few days.

1074
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:06,833
Wait until your bones are reattached.

1075
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,333
What should I do during this period of time when I study?

1076
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,083
You&#39;re right

1077
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:12,916
Learning is the most important at all times

1078
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,416
especially you now

1079
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,000
body is most important

1080
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:17,750
Ah yes

1081
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:18,916
Moreover

1082
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:19,583
good son

1083
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,166
You have made great progress recently

1084
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,666
We are not short of these days.

1085
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,916
Mom, you don’t understand

1086
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,333
Who will be responsible if I don&#39;t do well in the exam at the end of this semester?

1087
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:27,000
I&#39;m responsible

1088
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,250
Hello uncle and aunt

1089
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:32,833
Ah, are you Xu Niannian?

1090
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:35,750
Thank you, Niannian

1091
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:38,083
During this time, I am helping our Yang Yi with his homework.

1092
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:40,666
Our family is small, you see

1093
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:42,083
Looks like his mother

1094
00:49:42,416 --> 00:49:43,416
But my mind follows me

1095
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,750
No language talent

1096
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,083
Thank you for helping him

1097
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,750
Bring up English

1098
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
You are to our whole family

1099
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:50,750
They are reborn parents.

1100
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,083
For example

1101
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:55,250
You two are the same age

1102
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:56,333
How old are you?

1103
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:58,166
Yang Hongfa, are you hungry?

1104
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:58,750
I&#39;m not hungry

1105
00:49:58,833 --> 00:49:59,916
Yang Hongfa, are you hungry?

1106
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,083
No

1107
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:00,666
hungry

1108
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,666
A little hungry

1109
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,833
We went to have a meal

1110
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:10,416
eat this

1111
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,750
Hungry

1112
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:16,000
hungry

1113
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:24,083
hungry

1114
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,250
How did you come

1115
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:28,500
I&#39;m here to laugh at you

1116
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,750
Since the founding of the school

1117
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:32,083
The first warrior whose leg was broken by a desk

1118
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,166
Every injury a man gets is a medal

1119
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,250
But now the whole school knows

1120
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,250
The man who wore a skirt last time

1121
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,833
And osteoporosis

1122
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,416
Today&#39;s homework

1123
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:48,250
after

1124
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:49,916
Do you come every day?

1125
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:51,583
Come if you can&#39;t die

1126
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,500
embryo embryo embryo

1127
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:52,750
Bah embryo bah

1128
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:55,750
If you die, who should I compete with in the final exam?

1129
00:50:58,166 --> 00:50:59,083
I&#39;ll give you a pen

1130
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,416
Come on tell it

1131
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,166
Never talk again

1132
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,583
It&#39;s getting dark

1133
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:18,000
Britain

1134
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,083
I miss you so much

1135
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:35,166
Britain

1136
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,166
why are you going

1137
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:41,083
Nian Nian

1138
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:41,250
Nian Nian

1139
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:41,416
Nian Nian

1140
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:41,583
Nian Nian

1141
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:44,666
you you

1142
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:47,916
what&#39;s up

1143
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,916
Why did you come?

1144
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:50,916
Lao Zheng dragged the court again today

1145
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,083
It&#39;s okay, don&#39;t run around

1146
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:54,000
What to do if you encounter danger

1147
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:54,583
because

1148
00:51:54,666 --> 00:51:54,666
Um

1149
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,000
Let&#39;s go

1150
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,333
You like them so much

1151
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:27,250
You said this

1152
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:28,250
pharynx

1153
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,333
of course

1154
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:33,250
How happy I am to be able to listen to Ashin singing for the rest of my life.

1155
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:35,833
So what?

1156
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,583
If you don&#39;t find me annoying

1157
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:38,750
I can also sing to you

1158
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:42,416
Crazy n can

1159
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:46,000
Are you still learning?

1160
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,500
If you don’t learn, it will be dark

1161
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,833
Rotating in a uniform magnetic field

1162
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:56,333
The alternating current generated

1163
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:56,833
pass

1164
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:57,083
Nian Nian

1165
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:57,250
Nian Nian

1166
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:58,833
The ratio of one turns is N1

1167
00:52:58,916 --> 00:52:59,750
after

1168
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:02,583
Can we go to the same university?

1169
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:06,750
Why do you suddenly want to ask this?

1170
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:10,083
I will work hard

1171
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:11,416
I want

1172
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,666
Went to the same university as you

1173
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:18,583
Then this is not just talk

1174
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,916
When did I, Yang Sihuo, mean that what I said didn’t count?

1175
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:27,916
That

1176
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:29,500
It&#39;s agreed

1177
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,416
Known voltmeter

1178
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,666
But you wait

1179
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:44,833
I&#39;ll get there

1180
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:46,416
I&#39;ll definitely catch you soon

1181
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:52,166
catch up with you

1182
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:53,833
score

1183
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,500
oh

1184
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:10,083
Good school uniform, neatly dress, wear neatly, line up neatly

1185
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:33,916
Xinxin

1186
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:36,416
Can you help me with this geometry problem?

1187
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:38,166
Ask for the two angles

1188
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:38,833
right

1189
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,666
These two corners

1190
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:44,166
Look at this

1191
00:54:44,416 --> 00:54:45,833
point A point B

1192
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,000
C point D point

1193
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:48,416
Look at this plane first

1194
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,166
and the relationship between this plane

1195
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,083
The plane where BDEF is located

1196
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:53,083
What&#39;s the question?

1197
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:53,583
Let me see

1198
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:54,333
Come, come, come

1199
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,166

Come

1201
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:01,000
Mathematics

1202
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:02,666
I&#39;m good at math

1203
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,083
Why don&#39;t you look for me

1204
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,000
Come and let me explain it to you

1205
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:08,083
look

1206
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:09,833
Firstly

1207
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:11,166
and then again

1208
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:12,666
and then again

1209
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:14,583
have you understood

1210
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:18,833
I asked you if you understand, why are you so stunned?

1211
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:21,083
Got it, got it

1212
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,666
Tell me

1213
00:55:25,916 --> 00:55:25,916
Talk

1214
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:26,833

1217
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:32,750
show me

1218
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:37,500
Look at this

1219
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:40,333
Intersect BD at point O

1220
00:55:40,416 --> 00:55:40,666
no

1221
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:42,333
How classic is my solution?

1222
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:44,416
you shut up

1223
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:46,500

AC pays BD to

1227
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,250
Then what

1228
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:12,666
Why didn&#39;t you come to the recess exercise just now?

1229
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:17,333
What&#39;s wrong with you

1230
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:24,250
Ah

1231
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,250

1236
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:03,666
Don&#39;t go too far

1237
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:06,333
If you&#39;re so sleepy, go sleep in the back row.

1238
00:58:12,416 --> 00:58:13,750
fly to the universe

1239
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,000
It&#39;s worth it, right?

1240
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,666
We haven’t gone in yet

1241
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:25,333
Walk

1242
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:29,500
Showcasing the perseverance of mankind since ancient times

1243
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,916
The importance of exploring the universe

1244
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:33,416
It&#39;s so big

Venus

1255
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,500
do you know

1256
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,666
Venus is in the solar system

1257
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:07,916
the brightest planet

1258
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:13,500
Nian Nian, look over there

1259
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:15,666
dome theater

1260
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:21,000
Come

1261
00:59:23,916 --> 00:59:24,583
several rows

1262
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,166
Eight rows of one

1263
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:29,166
here here

1264
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,416
fly to the universe

1265
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:39,250
There is a theory that

1266
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:41,666
every atom in our body

1267
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,583
All came from an exploding star

1268
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:46,833
do you know

1269
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:49,916
My dad only cares about restaurants

1270
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:51,583
And my mother only pays attention to me

1271
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:56,583
I used to always feel like I couldn&#39;t breathe

1272
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,666
when you see infinity

1273
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:05,666
You will find the troubles in front of you

1274
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,333
is approximately equal to zero

1275
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,000
four fires

1276
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:14,500
you say

1277
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:19,833
If each of us were made of exploding stars

1278
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:25,416
I&#39;m lucky to have met you

1279
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,583
My dad left early

1280
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:30,833
My mother&#39;s job is constantly being transferred

1281
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:33,250
I just kept transferring schools.

1282
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:35,583
Now

1283
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:39,000
I only have her

1284
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:43,000
How happy it is to grow up with parents

1285
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,416
They actually want us to be happy

1286
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:53,500
Come

1287
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:54,500
This way, this way

1288
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,333
Put on the helmet first

1289
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:03,583
fasten your seatbelt

1290
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,083
Really ready to take off

1291
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:09,000
Will you have to sit still?

1292
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:16,833
This is what I specially recorded yesterday

1293
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,000
Put it on

1294
01:01:18,666 --> 01:01:19,583
We&#39;re going to space together

1295
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:23,916
close eyes

1296
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,416
Then let me act with you once

1297
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:51,833
Xu Niannian successfully exited the cabin

1298
01:02:51,916 --> 01:02:52,583
complete

1299
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,250
We are passing over the moon

1300
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,000
This is the super moon

1301
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,083
we&#39;re right next to it

1302
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,000
Isn&#39;t it amazing?

1303
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:05,750
Isn&#39;t it amazing that I can bring you here?

1304
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:07,833
It&#39;s better to turn around

1305
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:10,250
Let&#39;s fly to the moon

1306
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:13,583
Do you still want to be E?

1307
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,250
Don&#39;t you want to go?

1308
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,500
Okay, then I&#39;ll take you to touch the crater

1309
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:21,916
Full speed ahead

1310
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:28,916
You came here yourself

1311
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,166
Your bones are too hard

1312
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:36,250
No wonder I always have nightmares

1313
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:42,416
keep

1314
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,750
Every time you see it from now on

1315
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:46,416
You all have to praise me

1316
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:47,833
How about it

1317
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,333
Isn’t today’s trip particularly perfect?

1318
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:54,583
I&#39;m listening to a song for you, can you stop talking?

1319
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,083
Perfect

1320
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:40,250
it&#39;s me

1321
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:41,833
The last lesson for you

1322
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:44,916
Before class, let me make a digression

1323
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:49,583
Do you all know the password for this remote control?

1324
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,416
study well

1325
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,083
You all said it wrong

1326
01:04:59,250 --> 01:04:59,750
should be

1327
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:01,000
have a good rest

1328
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,083
Is that wrong?

1329
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:05,833
The people around you

1330
01:05:06,166 --> 01:05:07,666
I will definitely advise you to run faster.

1331
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,583
But when you feel tired?

1332
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:12,166
stop for a while

1333
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,500
It is also a kind of wisdom

1334
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:15,166
Only understand

1335
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,666
temporary pause

1336
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:16,916
road

1337
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:17,666
road

1338
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:19,250

Don&#39;t think that I have embezzled money for you.

1341
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:32,583
Whose thing is it?

1342
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:34,500
Just take it back after class

1343
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:39,250

1363
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:16,916
Ah, I also write essays

1364
01:06:17,833 --> 01:06:19,500
I haven&#39;t done an on-the-spot investigation yet.

1365
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:21,583
Thank you, Teacher Zheng

1366
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:22,416

What&#39;s wrong

1373
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:03,333
fine

1374
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,250
The last thorough examination

1375
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:17,250
I got third place in the class

1376
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:18,916
I know

1377
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,333
You don’t want to take away half of this military medal

1378
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,250
That&#39;s because you work hard

1379
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:27,333
It has nothing to do with me

1380
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,583
Happy Children&#39;s Day

1381
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:42,000
It&#39;s the last day of class

1382
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,250
You&#39;re not going to punish me again, are you?

1383
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,750
How can it be

1384
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,500
Am I that kind of person?

1385
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,583
No more Children&#39;s Day cards

1386
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:00,750
I can only use this instead.

1387
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:03,083
Go forward indomitably

1388
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,750
Are you stupid?

1389
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,833
Do you know what a double rainbow represents?

1390
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,750
May all your wishes come true

1391
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:18,500

The consumer&#39;s Ding Shisheng is wired to a low voltage AC power source.

1452
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:17,916
A. Fix the dotting timer on the iron stand and use it to conduct low-voltage AC power.

1453
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Low voltage AC power lifts the paper tape and weight to a certain height

1454

01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:15,500
Never reply to messages

1522
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,833
Don&#39;t answer the phone either

1523
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:20,416
I want to visit her house

1524
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:36,833
Yang Yi

1525
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,000
Hello aunt

1526
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,083
Miss her

1527
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:41,750
Please come in

1528
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:48,166
It’s said that my essay score was a bit low.

1529
01:11:48,416 --> 01:11:50,750
But 607 points is not bad

1530
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:53,416
Your teacher Zheng also said that

1531
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,583
Shangzhoushan University is no problem

1532
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:57,666
That&#39;s also a national priority.

1533
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:00,083
where does she go to school

1534
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:01,666
I&#39;m all happy

1535
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:25,750
Even if you don&#39;t come out

1536
01:12:27,416 --> 01:12:28,583
It&#39;s okay to have a word with me, right?

1537
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:14,083
Is there anything to discuss?

1538
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:15,750
The teachers at the high-tech recruitment site all said this

1539
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:17,666
That&#39;s the best university

1540
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:18,833
It’s no problem to go to Beijing

1541
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:19,666
Yang Yi&#39;s father

1542
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:20,916
Don&#39;t get excited, don&#39;t get excited

1543
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,166
Is this Yang Yi’s performance counterattack?

1544
01:13:23,416 --> 01:13:25,833
I am also very, very happy to be the head teacher.

1545
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:28,000
But we go behind his back to change his will

1546
01:13:28,166 --> 01:13:29,083
I think

1547
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:30,250
It&#39;s wrong

1548
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:31,333
what&#39;s wrong

1549
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,416
What if I change it for him?

1550
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,583
He just wants to piss me off to death

1551
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,166
Can I get this score?

1552
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:38,833
How difficult it is for this child

1553
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,166
teacher

1554
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,583
You just said that

1555
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:43,000
Just this wish

1556
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:45,250
It&#39;s due soon

1557
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,666
This issue

1558
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:49,833
Hello, Teacher Zheng

1559
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:50,916
Hello uncle and aunt

1560
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:52,583
I&#39;m here to volunteer

1561
01:13:55,666 --> 01:13:57,333
Sihuo is usually careless, so forget it.

1562
01:13:57,416 --> 01:13:59,333
Why did you even fill in the wrong application form?

1563
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:00,833
uncle aunt

1564
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:02,416
Just help him change it.

1565
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,250
Xu Niannian, come out

1566
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:19,666
Xu Niannian

1567
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,416
Nian Nian

1568
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,416
Xu Niannian, I know you are inside

1569
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:26,333
You come out

1570
01:14:27,416 --> 01:14:29,500
Didn’t we make an appointment to go to the same university together?

1571
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:32,500
Ignore me, right?

1572
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:35,166
I will change my choice back now.

1573
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:41,416
Why are you so ignorant?

1574
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:45,000
No matter what agreement you make, you can&#39;t make fun of your own future.

1575
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:46,666
So what?

1576
01:14:47,333 --> 01:14:49,333
Do you think anyone can score such a high score?

1577
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:51,250
Are you worthy of these two years of hard work?

1578
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:53,416
I work so hard just to get closer to you

1579
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:55,000
But I also tried my best

1580
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:56,500
What have you tried so hard for?

1581
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,500
Will I change my choice with them?

1582
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,000
Even if they don’t go to the same university

1583
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,416
You can still contact me

1584
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,083
If you can&#39;t go to the same school

1585
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:12,750
Let’s just stop contacting each other in the future.

1586
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,166
good

1587
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:25,583
Xu Niannian

1588
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:27,583
Why are you making decisions for me?

1589
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:29,000
who do you think You Are

1590
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:35,916
who am I not

1591
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,333
Don&#39;t you understand yet?

1592
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:45,583
I am a classmate who is competing with you

1593
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:48,833
my greeting card for you

1594
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:50,833
Did you take a good look?

1595
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:52,750
Saw it

1596
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:58,083
congratulations

1597
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:00,250
I also wish you great success

1598
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:04,166
So what are these two years?

1599
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:06,333
You help me with tutoring

1600
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:08,000
Go to the hospital to see me

1601
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,000
What does this mean when we go to the planetarium?

1602
01:16:12,416 --> 01:16:13,166
pity

1603
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:45,333
good son

1604
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,833
I&#39;d better buy a ticket and go with you.

1605
01:16:48,083 --> 01:16:48,833
OK

1606
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:49,916
No need mom

1607
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:50,750
OK OK

1608
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:52,666
A good man has ambitions everywhere

1609
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,666
He has to learn to take care of himself

1610
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:56,583
What should I do if I don’t have breakfast?

1611
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:57,750
What to do if it&#39;s frozen?

1612
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:00,500
It’s not like you don’t know how big you are

1613
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:02,666
I’ve never been away for such a long time

1614
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,916
How old is he?

1615
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:08,916
Do not worry

1616
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,916
he can take care of himself

1617
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:11,750
son

1618
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:15,250
Remember to wear autumn clothes and autumn trousers, you hear me?

1619
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:16,666
parents

1620
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:17,833
I am leaving

1621
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:41,666
Not eating

1622
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:44,250
You can always have some soup.

1623
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:13,083
THONNE

1624
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:14,083
THOMME

1625
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:14,416
ITHONNE

1626
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,750
ITHOMNE

1627
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:16,000
NO. STAY THROUGH

1628
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:20,500
cheers cheers

1629
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:26,916
We came here specially this time

1630
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:27,666
Do not misunderstand

1631
01:19:27,916 --> 01:19:28,750
Not to see you

1632
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,166
is to make you

1633
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:31,750
look at us

1634
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:33,333
No

1635
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:34,583
Please come back

1636
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,583
It&#39;s not been easy for me these years

1637
01:19:36,666 --> 01:19:37,500
you all know

1638
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:40,250
Tell the monitor quickly

1639
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:43,500
I&#39;m no longer the monitor

1640
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:43,750
8

1641
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:44,916
here with me

1642
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:46,250
you are always the leader

1643
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:48,916
eat yours

1644
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:50,333
You two are almost done

1645
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,500
The Civil Affairs Bureau turns left when you go out and doesn’t send you there.

1646
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:55,000
And you

1647
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:56,833
Is there anything new at the university?

1648
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,083
No

1649
01:19:58,833 --> 01:19:59,500
four fires

1650
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:01,250
You and Niannian

1651
01:20:01,916 --> 01:20:03,166
No contact really

1652
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:09,083
has been rejected

1653
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,166
Just stop pestering people.

1654
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,500
I just want her best

1655
01:20:19,833 --> 01:20:21,083
keep going forward

1656
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:29,083
came back

1657
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:36,000
Close the door quickly

1658
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,833
Came at the right time

1659
01:20:38,916 --> 01:20:39,833
Just set it up

1660
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:43,666
This is too fragrant, right?

1661
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:45,833
The hot pot base this time?

1662
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:47,666
It was sent by my aunt from Chongqing.

1663
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:48,583
Tastes amazing

1664
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:50,583
Your clothes

1665
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:51,666
Looks really good

1666
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:52,666
fine

1667
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:54,333
It&#39;s important to eat

1668
01:20:56,916 --> 01:20:57,916
The firepower is quite strong

1669
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Newly bought pot

1670
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:00,333
The seller said

1671
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:02,583
When the stove is turned on in the dormitory, it will never trip

1672
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:03,166
Yeah

1673
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:04,750
That&#39;s great

1674
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:12,666
Which dormitory is firing up the stove here?

1675
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:13,583
Aunt

1676
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,000
Can I still go to school well?

1677
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:28,250
Give you food

1678
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:29,166
Hurry up

1679
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:31,583
pot

1680
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,250
Is it your house?

1681
01:21:37,666 --> 01:21:38,750
That&#39;s the house in front

1682
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
This is the house

1683
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:46,000
Which house is it, aunt?

1684
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:47,083
Auntie, which room is it?

1685
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:48,250
I obviously smell a hot pot smell

1686
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,750
You smelled it wrong, auntie

1687
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:51,916
We will accompany you to pick up the switch and go to Auntie

1688
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,416
We&#39;ll hold a flashlight for you

1689
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:54,916
You little girls

1690
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:56,750
I just love eating these heavy oily and spicy foods.

1691
01:21:56,916 --> 01:21:58,000
Aren&#39;t you afraid of acne?

1692
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:40,500
R

1693
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,166
Xu Niannian Yang Sihuo

1694
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:51,333
072

1695
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:51,583
Yang Sihuo

1696
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:26,250
Dear Comrade Xu Niannian

1697
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:29,333
As comrades who were once at odds with each other

1698
01:23:31,166 --> 01:23:32,416
If you can see this letter

1699
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,666
Then I pay high respect to your intelligence.

1700
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:38,333
sometimes i think

1701
01:23:39,416 --> 01:23:41,083
We choked each other even though we met

1702
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:43,583
I especially hate seeing people who are good to each other

1703
01:23:44,916 --> 01:23:46,416
Why can&#39;t I wait now?

1704
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:48,750
I want to find you in the crowd

1705
01:23:52,583 --> 01:23:52,666
you hung up

1706
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:04,166
Actually, you don’t have to look for it.

1707
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:08,583
I can see you at a glance

1708
01:24:11,166 --> 01:24:12,500
There are some things I won’t say now

1709
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:15,416
Maybe later

1710
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:17,416
There&#39;s no chance

1711
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,416
Although I, Yang Yi, have four fires

1712
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,000
But it&#39;s never been hot

1713
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:26,333
after meeting you

1714
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,500
you gave me a lot of motivation

1715
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:33,666
Give me the courage to say these words to you today

1716
01:24:35,166 --> 01:24:36,750
I want to be by your side all the time

1717
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:38,750
Older than ever

1718
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:40,416
Noisy till old

1719
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:46,583
I have to run to see you every day when I go to school

1720
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:48,416
Not even a second late

1721
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:50,916
certainly

1722
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,500
After you read this letter

1723
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:54,250
You can also ignore me forever

1724
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:57,000
I&#39;m mentally prepared

1725
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:58,583
I won&#39;t blame you

1726
01:25:00,166 --> 01:25:01,083
my greeting card for you

1727
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:02,916
Did you take a good look?

1728
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:04,416
Saw it

1729
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:11,000
I will leave wisely

1730
01:25:12,083 --> 01:25:13,666
As long as you are comfortable being yourself

1731
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:14,916
That&#39;s good

1732
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:20,583
Dear Comrade Xu Niannian

1733
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:22,416
I like you

1734
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:27,916
The revolution has not yet succeeded

1735
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:29,916
Four Fires still need to work hard

1736
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:46,416
Four fires

1737
01:26:46,666 --> 01:26:47,916
Look what you&#39;re doing

1738
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,583
You must choose this rectifier bridge for research

1739
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,416
This experiment needs to be done.

1740
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:52,833
We can all graduate

1741
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,083
If you have to choose, choose the hardest one

1742
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I don’t know who said it in the first place.

1743
01:26:58,083 --> 01:26:58,916
two eldest brothers

1744
01:26:59,166 --> 01:27:00,833
I have maintained this posture for a long time

1745
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:02,500
Could you please look at your watch?

1746
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:03,333
stop stop stop

1747
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:05,000
The natural phase change point comes out

1748
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:06,083
Where is it?

1749
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:07,333
Twist it and come back a little bit

1750
01:27:08,666 --> 01:27:09,250
Come out, come out

1751
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:09,916
teacher

1752
01:27:10,416 --> 01:27:11,083
We are done

1753
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:12,666
we are number one

1754
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:14,250
Really? Let me see

1755
01:27:14,416 --> 01:27:16,500
W

1756
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:17,750
Phase transformer N L-331C MCL-001 9 expansion board NMEL-18/3 NMCL-038

1757
01:27:20,666 --> 01:27:21,333
Yang Sihuo

1758
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,416
What are you doing

1759
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,250
If this is cleared, you have to start from scratch.

1760
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:31,750
Yang Sihuo, I will electrocute you and me to death

1761
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:15,500
bear it

1762
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:15,666
Xinxin

1763
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:15,833
Ren Xin

1764
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:17,416
haven&#39;t seen you for a long time

1765
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:23,666
Nian Nian

1766
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:24,000
、

1767
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:24,250
、

1768
01:28:32,083 --> 01:28:32,333
Hi

1769
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:32,416
Ocean

1770
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:36,166
coming

1771
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:41,500
you

1772
01:28:45,416 --> 01:28:46,500
Hair has grown

1773
01:29:05,583 --> 01:29:06,416
the same

1774
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:11,166
Wearing shirts

1775
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:12,000
Yes

1776
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:17,750
Let&#39;s go

1777
01:29:29,416 --> 01:29:31,250
Is this your first time watching a rocket launch?

1778
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,833
The last time I saw you was when you transferred schools.

1779
01:29:35,666 --> 01:29:36,333
If you hadn&#39;t come

1780
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:38,916
Can Lao Zheng destroy TV so quickly?

1781
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:41,250
It&#39;s my fault

1782
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,416
Didn’t I also save someone’s partiality when I came here?

1783
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:48,166
I, Yang Sihuo, am no longer what I used to be.

1784
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:51,083
Our experimental topic this semester

1785
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:52,500
There is a long paragraph of English explanation

1786
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:53,333
I wrote them all

1787
01:29:54,583 --> 01:29:56,416
So what other great achievements do you have?

1788
01:29:56,916 --> 01:29:57,750
Can be much

1789
01:29:58,250 --> 01:29:59,750
I also met my favorite

1790
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:06,916
I&#39;m studying ultrasonic levitation.

1791
01:30:07,416 --> 01:30:09,416
The start signal cannot be transmitted no matter what.

1792
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:11,000
I discovered it later

1793
01:30:11,416 --> 01:30:13,000
There are so many ultrasound probes connected

1794
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:14,583
Master control Arduino board

1795
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:15,916
There must be insufficient energy supply.

1796
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:17,166
later

1797
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:19,416
I just bought a booster device and installed it.

1798
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:25,416
how

1799
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:25,833
What&#39;s wrong

1800
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:30,250
Why are you walking so fast?

1801
01:30:39,666 --> 01:30:40,666
Think about it here

1802
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:53,333
Nian Nian

1803
01:30:53,416 --> 01:30:53,833
four fires

1804
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:54,833
You speak first

1805
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:58,000
how do you

1806
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:00,416
Suddenly you remembered to ask me out

1807
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,250
I want to apologize to you

1808
01:31:05,333 --> 01:31:06,416
It&#39;ll be after graduation, right?

1809
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:08,333
I said a lot of angry things

1810
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:10,000
I

1811
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:12,250
It&#39;s been so long ago

1812
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,500
In fact, I am too impulsive

1813
01:31:17,916 --> 01:31:19,500
If you don’t tell me, I will forget everything

1814
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:20,833
Forgot everything

1815
01:31:22,333 --> 01:31:23,583
I have forgotten everything before

1816
01:31:24,416 --> 01:31:25,083
forget

1817
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:26,333
Forgot everything

1818
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:27,833
Who are you

1819
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:31,000
rest assured

1820
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:32,166
We are all in college

1821
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:33,583
It&#39;s time to move forward

1822
01:31:35,083 --> 01:31:35,750
Middle school things

1823
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:36,833
Just let it turn over

1824
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:40,083
The days to come will be exciting

1825
01:31:42,583 --> 01:31:43,750
What you just wanted to say

1826
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:45,750
It can&#39;t be just these, right?

1827
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:49,833
There are three minutes left

1828
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:50,916
180

1829
01:31:51,666 --> 01:31:51,666
79

1830
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:53,500
It&#39;s too early for you to count.

1831
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:55,250
Just 109

1832
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,083
what

1833
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:04,333
Put it on

1834
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:05,583
The rocket is about to launch

1835
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:06,916
You come again

1836
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:08,000
This time is different

1837
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:09,166
this time

1838
01:32:09,416 --> 01:32:10,583
It&#39;s a real rocket launch

1839
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:13,916
O

1840
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,000
C

1841
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:05,500
Why is there silence?

1842
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:15,166
The gust of wind blows the kite into the sky

1843
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:20,916
I pray for you, bless you and feel moved

1844
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:27,333
Finally your figure disappeared at the end of the crowd

1845
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:33,250
I just realized that it hurts the most to laugh and cry

1846
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:39,166
That day you and I were on that hill

1847
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,083
Singing the song of that year like that

1848
01:33:47,583 --> 01:33:48,750
How is my heavenly voice?

1849
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:50,583
I promised to sing it for you

1850
01:33:51,416 --> 01:33:52,166
Knew it

1851
01:33:52,416 --> 01:33:53,916
People don&#39;t change

1852
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:56,166
and you

1853
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:58,416
Has it changed?

1854
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:05,333
what i said is

1855
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,166
you are in college

1856
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:08,750
Have you become better?

1857
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:12,916
You are already excellent

1858
01:34:13,166 --> 01:34:14,333
I mean

1859
01:34:15,666 --> 01:34:16,333
you should

1860
01:34:16,416 --> 01:34:17,583
Are you in love?

1861
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,833
There must be many people chasing you

1862
01:34:20,166 --> 01:34:20,666
No

1863
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:23,166
Long live single

1864
01:34:33,666 --> 01:34:34,583
Nine

1865
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:38,000
five

1866
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:38,666
five

1867
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:39,250
Son

1868
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:39,750
Four

1869
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:24,416
Xu miss me

1870
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:25,333
I like you

1871
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,916
Youth often starts with liking someone

1872
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:41,083
The look when I turned around during recess

1873
01:35:45,583 --> 01:35:46,416
Followme (Follow me)

1874
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:50,416
Follow him and act stupidly

1875
01:35:56,166 --> 01:35:56,166
crown crown

1876
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:56,250
work

1877
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:56,500
work

1878
01:35:56,583 --> 01:35:56,583
Nian Guan

1879
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:56,666
Gong Niannian

1880
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:57,833
You did well in the exam this time

1881
01:35:58,583 --> 01:35:59,583
Not only the first in the class

1882
01:35:59,666 --> 01:36:00,833
And he is the first in the whole grade

1883
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:02,750
Don&#39;t be proud and keep working hard

1884
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:08,083
Little thoughts that only you know

1885
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:09,500
Teacher Zheng

1886
01:36:10,416 --> 01:36:13,000
I have a suggestion for the whole class to make progress together

1887
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:15,583
Okay, come and listen

1888
01:36:15,666 --> 01:36:18,083
A person with good grades helps one with poor grades

1889
01:36:18,666 --> 01:36:19,250
Classmate Xu Niannian

1890
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:20,333
Yang Yi

1891
01:36:20,416 --> 01:36:21,166
Just bring it to you

1892
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:32,833
What was the name of the book you read last time?

1893
01:36:33,416 --> 01:36:35,166
The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy

1894
01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:37,166
I&#39;ll take a look when I get back

1895
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:39,000
Really

1896
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:41,666
like

1897
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:43,500
his like

1898
01:36:47,416 --> 01:36:47,833
mom

1899
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,333
The alarm clock really needs to be replaced.

1900
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:51,500
Crazy, I’m late on the first day of transferring school

1901
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,333
Aren&#39;t I late for work too?

1902
01:36:53,416 --> 01:36:54,916
Let us, mother and daughter, advance and retreat together.

1903
01:36:59,333 --> 01:37:00,916
In fact, many times

1904
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:03,666
They all want to openly declare to the world

1905
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:05,416
My youth

1906
01:37:06,166 --> 01:37:07,833
long before he knew me

1907
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:09,583
It started

1908
01:37:30,833 --> 01:37:33,083
This is classmate Xu Niannian who just transferred here

1909
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:34,666
There is a seat in the back

1910
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:36,666
You can sit there for now.

1911
01:37:38,666 --> 01:37:41,000
Where did the spaceships that roamed the galaxy go?

1912
01:37:42,083 --> 01:37:42,916
I do not mind

1913
01:37:45,666 --> 01:37:45,666
TO THE

1914
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:45,750
10

1915
01:37:45,916 --> 01:37:45,916
102

1916
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:46,083
02

1917
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:48,333
The ultimate answer to the universe is

1918
01:37:49,833 --> 01:37:50,833
me and the world

1919
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:52,750
Only you are missing

1920
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,083
This is all the stories of my youth

1921
01:37:58,666 --> 01:38:00,166
it may be over

1922
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:02,000
but it&#39;s also possible

1923
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:05,416
just began
