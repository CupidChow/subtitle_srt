Xuanji, did you really remove my mask?

19
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,572
Yes.

26
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:21,481
Sifeng, what's wrong?

27
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:23,641
Do you feel uncomfortable?

28
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,203
It's nothing.

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,572
Don't worry.

30
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,839
The mask has been removed.

31
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:48,933
It's not important whether it's smiling or not.

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,422
What's more important now is that we should leave this place.

33
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,418
Let's go.

34
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:58,018
Let's have a look at the staff you talked about.

35
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,279
I...

36
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,039
Let's go. Why are you standing there?

37
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,534
Let's go.

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,686
Sifeng, it's this staff.

39
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:18,773
When I touched it last time, it struck me with lightning.

40
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,518
This barrier is formed according to the Eight Trigrams.

41
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,004
I think the staff is the eye of the formation.

42
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:49,065
I'll see if I can break the formation from the top.

43
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,276
Sifeng! Sifeng, are you okay?

44
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,740
Let go of Sifeng!

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,019
Sifeng! Sifeng!

46
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,800
Xuanji, don't go over there!

47
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,640
Sifeng, I want to save you!

48
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,746

71
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,967
Sifeng?

72
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,680
- Why are you hurt? <br> - I'm fine.

73

What just happened?

74
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,380
What happened?

75
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,599
The earth was trembling just now.

76
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,940
This is not a staff. It's a divine sword.

77
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,200
I saw the general calling its name

78
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,639
within the Mirror of Origin.

79
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,478
Its name was...

80
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,382
Dingkun Sword.

81
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:54,784
What's going on?

82
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,660
Seems like the barrier was used to seal away the sword.

83
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,159
But you broke the seal by accident,

84
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,360
and you became the owner of the divine sword.

85
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,508
The sword is immensely powerful.

86
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,629
Seems like it doesn't belong to the human realm.

87
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,699
Maybe it's connected to you somehow.

88
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:19,288
Every time when I obtain a shard of the Mirror of Origin,

89
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:22,239
I see a vision of a general dressed in armor.

90
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,367
But this time, when I held the sword in my hand,

91
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:28,866
I saw her face clearly.

92
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:31,127
She looked just like me.

93
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:35,985
I always thought this was only a dream.

94
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:38,606
But now, it seems different from what I expected.

95
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:43,579
I feel familiar holding the sword in my hand.

96
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:49,971
And... I felt like her experiences were my own experiences.

97
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:52,757
It seems that she suffered from injustice.

98
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:56,112
Sifeng, what exactly is going on?

99
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:57,939
Who's that general?

100
00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:00,270
Why does she look just like me?

101
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,128
And why does she keep appearing in my mind?

102
00:12:02,128 --> 00:12:04,489
I can't figure out any of this.

103
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,396
Xuanji, don't be afraid.

104
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,053
No matter what happens, you'll always be Chu Xuanji.

105
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,284
But... Ting Nu said,

106
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:28,079
"I am me, yet I am not."

107
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,259
Who exactly am I?

108
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,247
Since the Mirror of Origin shows all origins,

109
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:41,236
maybe those visions were you in your past life.

110
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:44,530
Maybe your lack of six senses

111
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,390
has something to do with your past life as well.

112
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,530
Xuanji, don't worry.

113
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,305
Everything will be explained once we collect all the shards.

114
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:56,356
Believe me.

115
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,215
Sifeng!

116
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,828
Sifeng!

117
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,302
Sifeng!

118
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,652
Sifeng?

119
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,306
Where's your mask?

120
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:21,367
It came down by chance.

121
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,500
Congratulations.

122
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,561
So, we have to congratulate someone when their mask is removed?

123
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,944
Ruo Yu, I need to congratulate you as well.

124
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,577
My mask is different from Sifeng's.

125
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:43,441
- Sifeng is... <br> - This is not the time.

126
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:45,602
We need to leave.

127
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,324
Xuanji, go and check if there are any demons around here.

128
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:03,839
We'll travel to Fuyu Island later.

129
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,858
- Okay. <br> - Be careful.

130
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,851
Sifeng, I lost my mask.

131
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:12,660
I need to return to Lize Palace and receive my punishment.

132
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,017
I'm afraid I can't accompany you anymore.

133
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:17,719
It's lucky that your mask wasn't destroyed.

134
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,028
You just lost it.

135
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:21,319
And you don't have a person you fancy.

136
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,921
If you go back and apologize,

137
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:25,662
maybe you'll be able to avoid the 13 Punishments.

138
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,836
Take care.

139
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,167
Master.

140
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:35,372
Little Silver Flower, I need you to do something for me.

141
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:36,589
You're not a human.

142
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,248
You can sneak into Tianxu Hall and find out about the location of the shards.

143
00:14:40,248 --> 00:14:42,124
You mustn't act rashly if you find out anything.

144
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,959
Just return and report to me.

145
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,220
Master, are you still trying to help Chu Xuanji find the Mirror of Origin?

146
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,592
I'm not going. I'm your spirit beast.

147
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:52,180
I'll follow you wherever you go.

148
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,831
Besides, you may hide the truth from others,

149
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:56,909
but you can't hide it from me.

150
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,900
Master, Chu Xuanji removed your mask, but she didn't dispel the curse.

151
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,799
What's going on?

152
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,220
This wouldn't have happened if she had you in her heart.

153
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,900
I don't know what went wrong,

154
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,900
but the Lover's Curse hasn't acted up yet. No need to fear.

155
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,359
Why are you lying to yourself?

156
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,291
If she hurts your heart or lures you to become emotional, the Lover's Curse will trigger.

157
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:23,860
When the feather marks from your wrist disappear and travel to your chest,

158
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,399
it'll be too late by then.

159
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,759
- Master! <br> - Why are you cursing me?

160
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,999
I'm your master. If I die, you'll be homeless.

161
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,780
- Master— <br> - Don't worry.

162
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,620
This is my body. I know my body the best.

163
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,352
And I think this has something to do with her lack of six senses.

164
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:42,325
I asked you to find the shards because of my own interest.

165
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,820
I have no choice. She's the one who put the curse on you.

166
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,519
Master, if she dares to hurt you or betray you,

167
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,100
- I won't forgive her. <br> - Little Silver Flower,

168
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,020
I don't like the way you speak.

169
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,807
Fine.

170
00:15:57,808 --> 00:15:59,660
I'll go.

171
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,039
Be careful.

172
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,480
Greetings, King Bailing.

173
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,620
Didn't I ask you not to look for me in the human realm?

174
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:27,119
Did something happen in the heavenly realm?

175
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,460
It's not that.

176
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,313
A moment in the heavenly realm is a few decades in the human realm.

177
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:33,061
About your visit to the human realm...

178
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:38,100
No one in the heavenly realm knows about it yet.

179
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,280
Of course, it's because I was great at hiding things.

180
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,240
Why are you here then?

181
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,999
My King, I'm writing this book called, "Tales of the Three Realms."

182
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,894
But I hadn't obtained new materials ever since you came down here.

183
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,159
I've put it aside for decades.

184
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,580
But today, there are some changes happening.

185
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,835
I'm here to ask about your thoughts on them

186
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:08,676
so that my story would be more interesting.

187
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,630
What changes?

188
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,797
I forgot that you can't use your power once you're in the human realm.

189
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:19,490
That's why you're in the dark.

190
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,079
She... She escaped your grasp again.

191
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,580
And she managed to unseal the Dingkun Sword again.

192
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,139
<i>After such a long time, you managed to find the Dingkun Sword again.</i>

193
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,065
<i>Seems like it's fate.</i>

194
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,081
This is my script.

195
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:51,461
My King, do you want to read it?

196
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,573
My King, you were the one who brought up the God of War.

197
00:17:57,574 --> 00:18:00,159
And she became famous in the heavenly realm.

198
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,748
I was thinking that if you two became an item,

199
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,879
everyone would be envious.

200
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,296
It's a pity that both you and her are too calm and collected.

201
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,930
I was anxious.

202
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:15,088
That's why I made the decision to make the story between you and her

203
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:18,860
the most important chapter in "Tales of the Three Realms."

204
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,927
But before I wrote my story,

205
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:24,788
the God of War was punished and sent to the human realm.

206
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:44,517
<i>You're awake?</i>

207
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:46,840
<i>Who are you?</i>

208
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,799
<i>I'm King Bailing.</i>

209
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,529
<i>Who am I?</i>

210
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,352
<i>You're my God of War.</i>

211
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,619
<i>I saved you.</i>

212
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,020
<i>I gave you life.</i>

213
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,431
<i>Your entire life belongs to me.</i>

214
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:15,092
<i>You will fight for me and the heavenly realm.</i>

215
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,919
<i>God of War!</i>

216
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,786
<i>I won.</i>

217
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,619
<i>I told you before. I trust you the most.</i>

218
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,580
My King!

219
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,769
God of War? God of War?

220
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:08,641
I'm too late.

221
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:13,399
I've been guarding the Dingkun Sword for 1,000 years.

222
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,000
Yet she took it away just like that.

223
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,860
She didn't even stay here to fight with me.

224
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,278
She's despicable! This won't do.

225
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,762
I need to find her.

226
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:25,383
I need to fight her to my heart's content.

227
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,485
Who are you?

228
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,823
This stench is so familiar.

229
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,852
Green Dragon, let me go. I have business to attend to.

230
00:21:34,852 --> 00:21:38,053
Someone removed the Dingkun Sword used by the God of War.

231
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:45,260
Green Dragon, let's talk over this.

232
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:47,687
Guarding the Dingkun Sword is my responsibility.

233
00:21:47,687 --> 00:21:50,039
I need to retrieve it.

234
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,481
No need for that.

235
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:53,319
King Bailing has a message for you.

236
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,942
No one is to ever ask about or involve themselves with the God of War.

237
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,394
You don't have to go.

238
00:21:59,394 --> 00:22:00,799
But why?

239
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,999
How dare you question King Bailing's order?

240
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,560
Green Dragon, let go of me.

241
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,149
You!

242
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,439
That was close.

243
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,235
It's lucky that you marked yourself with the Mark of Concealment.

244
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,759
Even immortals can't see you.

245
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,840
If not, trouble would arise if that Flying Snake saw you.

246
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,530
I've expected Flying Snake to create trouble.

247
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:28,991
That's why I locked him up.

248
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,371
I didn't expect him to sneak into the human realm.

249
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:34,540
That's right.

250
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,959
That's right. Flying Snake doesn't even know the God of War.

251
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,719
But he's stubborn in pursuing the God of War.

252
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,902
Does he think he can pursue the God of War?

253
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,801
Does he think he's you?

254
00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:45,294
He's overestimating himself.

255
00:22:45,295 --> 00:22:47,595
I didn't come down to pursue her.

256
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:49,876
I'm here for the three realms.

257
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,319
The king descended into the human realm for the God of War.

258
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,540
If you write nonsense like that, I'll burn your book.

259
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,329
I mean for the three realms.

260
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,994
My King, it's a pity. You've done so much just to come here.

261
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:10,278
But the God of War still managed to retrieve the Dingkun Sword.

262
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,174
The Dingkun Sword is an ominous sword.

263
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:16,329
The God of War had slain countless demons using it.

264
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,356
It's filled with anguish.

265
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,076
Seems like your wish will not be granted again.

266
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:29,208
<i>My King, God of War will face another trial today.</i>

267
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,600
<i>So what?</i>

268
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,749
<i>She has failed the previous nine trials.</i>

269
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:43,027
<i>This is the tenth trial.</i>

270
00:23:43,027 --> 00:23:46,964
<i>If she fails again, she'll never return to the heavenly realm.</i>

271
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:49,465
<i>I've received another news as well.</i>

272
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:52,949
<i>Some demons are trying to locate the God of War.</i>

273
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,733
<i>You've failed every trial you faced.</i>

274
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,894
<i>Why can't you just get over your mental block?</i>

275
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,774
<i>My King, you're the ruler of our realm.</i>

276
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,156
<i>How could you ignore everything and descend into the human realm?</i>

277
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:10,000
<i>If I ignore the God of War any longer, she'll fall on the demonic path forever.</i>

278
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:11,302
<i>I knew it.</i>

279
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:14,321
<i>My King, you cherish her so much. It's impossible for you to ignore her.</i>

280
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:17,089
<i>You still have her in your heart.</i>

281
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,559
<i>This is too touching.</i>

282
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,398
<i>No, I must write this down in my book.</i>

283
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:25,558
<i>I'm not concerned about her.</i>

284
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,361
<i>I'm just concerned about the three realms.</i>

285
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:31,444
<i>As long as her hatred doesn't overflow</i>

286
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:33,450
<i>and she leads her life in peace,</i>

287
00:24:33,451 --> 00:24:36,231
<i>the three realms will be saved from another disaster.</i>

288
00:24:36,673 --> 00:24:39,132
<i>And I can guide her to become an immortal again</i>

289
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:40,839
<i>so that she can return here.</i>

290
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,192
<i>But, My King,</i>

291
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:43,896
<i>this...</i>

292
00:24:43,897 --> 00:24:46,293
<i>Immortals mustn't interfere with human affairs.</i>

293
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:49,699
<i>If you descend into the human realm, Heavenly Emperor will find out</i>

294
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,538
<i>and he'll blame you.</i>

295
00:24:52,888 --> 00:24:54,947
<i>That's why I'm here at the Altar of Banishment.</i>

296
00:24:54,948 --> 00:24:57,794
<i>To hide your tracks, you're skipping the Path of Reincarnation.</i>

297
00:24:57,794 --> 00:25:00,034
<i>You're trying to become a human by force.</i>

298
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,751
<i>My King, you're a ruler of the heavenly realm!</i>

299
00:25:04,751 --> 00:25:07,626
<i>You'll be punished by Nature's law if you do so.</i>

300
00:25:07,627 --> 00:25:10,514
<i>Not only will you suffer tremendous pain,</i>

301
00:25:10,514 --> 00:25:12,675
<i>you can't use any of your powers as well.</i>

302
00:25:12,675 --> 00:25:15,919
<i>And it'll be hard for you to practice any spells as a human.</i>

303
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,678
<i>How are you going to protect yourself?</i>

304
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,057
<i>I don't care even if I have to use ten years in the human realm</i>

305
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:25,037
<i>to change her destiny.</i>

306
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,866
<i>If I want to do it, I will do it.</i>

307
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,660
<i>My King.</i>

308
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,399
<i>My King! My King!</i>

309
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,467
<i>Your skills have improved tremendously.</i>

310
00:25:43,467 --> 00:25:46,508
<i>I'm very relieved.</i>

311
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:51,679
<i>Master, it's all thanks to your guidance.</i>

312
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,500
<i>If you hadn't helped me when I was seriously injured</i>

313
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,397
<i>and taken me as your disciple, I wouldn't have accomplished this.</i>

314
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,199
I told you before.

315
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,340
If I want to do it, I will do it.

316
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,727
No matter what happens, I'll lead her back to the heavenly realm.

317
00:27:10,518 --> 00:27:13,434
My Lady, how's it going?

318
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,962
Let me out.

319
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,935
Let me out.

320
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:22,364
You can't stand it anymore?

321
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:24,309
I told you before.

322
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,081
There are many things scarier than death itself.

323
00:27:27,082 --> 00:27:29,999
Now, you can only choose the path I give you.

324
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,500
You can either stay here and suffer,

325
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:37,413
or kneel down and beg me.

326
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,752
In your dreams.

327
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,016
Great.

328
00:27:48,017 --> 00:27:51,500
I knew it. You're more interesting than the others.

329
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,749
You've been trying to go against me ever since we met,

330
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,230
and you've tried to offend me in every way possible.

331
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:00,669
I knew you were different from them.

332
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:05,417
Of course, you won't submit.

333
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:09,638
The young lady from Shaoyang Sect is precious and proud, right?

334
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:14,821
I still have many things waiting for you.

335
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,893
I will definitely kill you.

336
00:28:22,894 --> 00:28:24,592
What did you say?

337
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,896
Say it louder.

338
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:30,455
I will definitely kill you.

339
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:33,269
I will definitely kill you!

340
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:34,983
Let go!

341
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,204
You lunatic!

342
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:39,865
How dare you bite me when you're in this situation!

343
00:28:41,082 --> 00:28:44,382
I'm liking you more and more.

344
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,839
Don't touch me! I'm going to search for the Dingkun Sword.

345
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,820
- I promise I won't do anything else. <br> - You're just trying to fight!

346
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,460
Stop fooling around! Stay put.

347
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:56,591
Old Guy?

348
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:03,684
Old Guy, you're acting weird.

349
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,159
Lord Flying Snake, I saw you two fighting just now.

350
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,999
I wanted to stop the fight, but you know I'm timid.

351
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,644
My skills are limited and I'm afraid to take a beating.

352
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:13,851
That's why I didn't go and help.

353
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,420
- My Lord! <br> - Stop it.

354
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,507
What is this?

355
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,926
It's—

356
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,896
Tales of the Three Realms, Lord Snake and his beloved Phoenix.

357
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,737
My Lord, you should return it to me.

358
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,999
What is this?

359
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,321
He, Flying Snake,

360
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:44,389
is the handsome king of fighters in the heavenly realm.

361
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,074
A fateful encounter has reduced his tough demeanor into gentleness.

362
00:29:49,075 --> 00:29:51,580
And he was willing to ignore everything else.

363
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:57,351
He, Green Dragon, is the charming immortal.

364
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:03,359
A fateful encounter has caused him to have difficulties choosing between love and friendship.

365
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,135
It's all because of Ling Qin of the Phoenix Tribe.

366
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:10,615
She was elegant and gorgeous.

367
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:12,613
She was a true beauty.

368
00:30:12,613 --> 00:30:16,112
Hold it right there. Why do I feel disgusted?

369
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:20,399
The handsome king of fighters, I'm sure that's me.

370
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,959
Yes.

371
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,340
The charming immortal.

372
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,360
You're talking about him.

373
00:30:28,232 --> 00:30:31,273
But who's the beauty? Ling Qin?

374
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,599
Ling Qin inherits her skill from Lord Xuan Huo.

375
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,727
She's a relative of Lord Phoenix.

376
00:30:38,728 --> 00:30:41,119
She's young and talented.

377
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,593
She became the leader of the 28 stars when she first ascended to this realm.

378
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,260
She's amazing.

379
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,900
I've heard of her before.

380
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,052
But I heard that she stays in the Southern Star Palace

381
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,167
and she rarely goes out.

382
00:30:57,168 --> 00:31:00,088
How is she connected to us?

383
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,952
Lord Flying Snake, seems like you were too busy to remember this.

384
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:10,456
Don't you remember? You saved a sparrow once.

385
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:12,084
That sparrow was Ling Qin.

386
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:14,838
She couldn't forget you.

387
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,639
But Lord Green Dragon couldn't forget her.

388
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,870
Please don't think that my stories were all made up.

389
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,480
I have evidence.

390
00:31:22,486 --> 00:31:24,567
Just now, it seemed like you two fought for no reason.

391
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:27,046
But in reality, it's because of love.

392
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:28,799
Wait.

393
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,999
You're saying it's a one-sided love on my part, and I even lost to Flying Snake?

394
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,723
- No. <br> - Change it!

395
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:37,631
My Lord!

396
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,734
Si Ming, I think your story was well-written.

397
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:47,759
Keep up the good work.

398
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,184
Sure.

399
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,567
Pian Pian, Yu Ning, please plead with Master on my behalf.

400
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:59,844
We did nothing wrong. We don't know what's going on.

401
00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:02,905
But why is he chasing us off the island?

402
00:32:02,905 --> 00:32:04,844
Senior, calm down.

403
00:32:04,845 --> 00:32:07,825
We'll try to understand the reason behind his rage.

404
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,860
And we'll plead with him after that.

405
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,242
Thank you.

406
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,540
Everyone, calm down. We should return for now.

407
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,580
- Let's go. <br> - Let's go.

408
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,278
I'm Yu Sifeng.

409
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,559
This is Chu Xuanji from Shaoyang Sect.

410
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,145
We need to meet Island Master Dong Fang.

411
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:37,253
Please notify him for us.

412
00:32:37,254 --> 00:32:40,359
I'm Pian Pian from Fuyu Island. This is Yu Ning.

413
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,959
If you two want to enter the island, you two can follow us.

414
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,492
Please.

415
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,552
<i>Senior Hao Chen.</i>

416
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,539
<i>I haven't written my reflections lately.</i>

417
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,358
<i>Please don't be angry. But I have good news.</i>

418
00:32:57,358 --> 00:33:00,449
<i>I have mended my relationship with Sifeng.</i>

419
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:02,959
<i>I think that is the most exciting news.</i>

420
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,801
<i>Sifeng changed his plans and followed us on our journey.</i>

421
00:33:06,802 --> 00:33:09,679
<i>Sifeng's skills have improved tremendously.</i>

422
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,213
<i>He knows a lot as well.</i>

423
00:33:11,214 --> 00:33:13,999
<i>It's lucky that he's with us on our adventures.</i>

424
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,919
<i>Senior, you don't need to worry.</i>

425
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,349
<i>I forgot to tell you this. Minyan and Linglong have patched up as well.</i>

426
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,669
<i>Actually, they like each other.</i>

427
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,092
<i>It's not me.</i>

428
00:33:24,093 --> 00:33:25,877
<i>It's not me. I made a huge joke out of myself.</i>

429
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,337
<i>It's lucky that Sifeng was around.</i>

430
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,157
<i>I managed to understand these things under his help.</i>

431
00:33:30,158 --> 00:33:32,081
<i>Sifeng is amazing.</i>

432
00:33:32,082 --> 00:33:34,882
<i>He helped us a lot on our journey.</i>

433
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,774
Yu Sifeng.

434
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,776
<i>Senior Hao Chen, this is the most important news.</i>

435
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,779
<i>Please pass this message to Father.</i>

436
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,979
<i>We suspect that Xuanyuan Sect was harmed by Tianxu Hall.</i>

437
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,469
<i>Sect Leader Zhu Shi handed the Destiny Pearl to me.</i>

438
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:11,711
<i>After that, we were ambushed by them and got separated.</i>

439
00:34:11,712 --> 00:34:15,417
<i>Sifeng and I are trying to enter Fuyu Island right now.</i>

440
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:18,976
<i>Linglong and Sixth Senior should be on the island now.</i>

441
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,345
Before Elder Ling Shi passed away,

442
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:34,254
he said Tianxu Hall had taken control of Xuanyuan Sect.

443
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:36,063
Wu Tong said that as well.

444
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:38,782
But we haven't confirmed that for ourselves.

445
00:34:38,782 --> 00:34:42,537
That explains it. Although the Xuanyuan Sect is getting weaker and weaker,

446
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,248
it is still one of the Five Great Sects.

447
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:48,839
There's no way Tianxu Hall can destroy a sect like that without alerting others.

448
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,500
I think Elder Ling Shi must've consumed too many demon pills

449
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:53,841
for him to utter something like that.

450
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,901
I know our words have no weight. You may not believe in us,

451
00:34:57,901 --> 00:35:01,613
but Sect Leader wouldn't have given us the Destiny Pearl

452
00:35:01,614 --> 00:35:05,719
if he had a choice.

453
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,533
The Destiny Pearl?

454
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,547
Uncle Dong Fang, this is the Destiny Pearl Sect Leader Zhu Shi secretly gave me.

455
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,202
It is the Destiny Pearl indeed.

456
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,040
This is the sacred item of the Xuanyuan Sect.

457
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:44,039
Seems like we need to investigate this.

458
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,063
Xuanji, can I hold on to the Destiny Pearl for now?

459
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:50,282
Of course you can, Uncle Dong Fang.

460
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:54,879
Tianxu Hall wanted this Destiny Pearl because of the spirit key.

461
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,939
They want to revive the Devil Star.

462
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,479
Devil Star?

463
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,264
I don't know what it is, either.

464
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:05,800
But I heard that it has the power to dominate the three realms.

465
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,672
Dominate the three realms? What a joke.

466
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,608
The Devil Star was vanquished 1,000 years ago.

467
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:16,881
How could they revive it?

468
00:36:16,881 --> 00:36:18,892
If they could revive the Devil Star,

469
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:21,930
then I could revive the immortal, Pan Gu.

470
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,759
My Lord, Tianxu Hall is harboring such ambition, indeed,

471
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,802
and they're trying to execute their plans now.

472
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:29,660
Xuanyuan Sect is just a start.

473
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,700
I'm afraid they will go after Lize Palace,

474
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,359
Dianjinggu Sect, Shaoyang Sect, or even Fuyu Island.

475
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,199
They can come then! I'm not afraid of them!

476
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,839
Relay my orders! Activate the Sword Formation!

477
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,000
I want to see if the demons can penetrate my formation!

478
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,580
My Lord, Madam's birthday will arrive soon. All the other sects will be here as well.

479
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,491
If we activate the formation, everyone will panic.

480
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:56,008
Moreover, we still need to investigate the Xuanyuan Sect.

481
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:58,220
Just activate the formation! No excuses!

482
00:36:58,221 --> 00:37:00,839
How dare Tianxu Hall try to create trouble!

483
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,780
I'll vanquish all of them!

484
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,100
- Uncle Dong Fang, wait— <br> - What?

485
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,549
Youngsters have no right to interfere with this!

486
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,696
It's late now.

487
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,657
Ask someone to clean up their rooms and bring them to rest.

488
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,559
Uncle Dong Fang, can you ask someone to escort us off the island?

489
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,713
- I want to go look for Linglong and Sixth Senior. <br> - Of course not!

490
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:28,339
Tianxu Hall is looking for you. It's not safe for you to be outside!

491
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:29,607
Xuanji, it's fine.

492
00:37:29,608 --> 00:37:31,958
Don't worry. I'll send someone to Mount Gao

493
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,999
in order to find Linglong and Minyan.

494
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,116
- But I want to go there— <br> - Such impudence!

495
00:37:36,116 --> 00:37:39,185
I have the same rank as your father! How dare you disobey me!

496
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:44,015
I can't bear the responsibility if something happens to you, you know?

497
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,871
I'm sorry. I'm tired.

498
00:37:56,872 --> 00:37:58,309
You should rest now.

499
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,330
I'll set up a feast for you tonight.

500
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,656
Xuanji, you don't need to worry.

501
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:06,602
We will find Linglong and Minyan.

502
00:38:06,603 --> 00:38:08,969
Go now.

503
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,297
The houses here are empty. They're fully-furnished as well.

504
00:38:30,297 --> 00:38:32,359
Just pick a house you like.

505
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,039
Just tell me if you need anything else.

506
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:37,918
My master is not acting like his usual self.

507
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,919
You must've been shocked.

508
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,001
It's fine.

509
00:38:41,001 --> 00:38:45,586
Did Island Master go somewhere or encounter something strange recently?

510
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:47,768
It's been half a year since my master left the island.

511
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:49,301
Besides his normal training,

512
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:52,087
he'll accompany his wife and do some gardening.

513
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:54,568
There's nothing strange going on.

514
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:57,860
So, Madam Dong Fang is responsible for the beautiful scenery on this island.

515
00:38:57,861 --> 00:38:59,401
It's such a wonder.

516
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:01,399
Where does she come from?

517
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,828
She came from Mount Zitong.

518
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:05,816
After that, my master—

519
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,549
My master has activated the Sword Trap.

520
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,897
You need his permission if you want to leave the island

521
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:20,238
so that you wouldn't be hurt by the trap.

522
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,505
Sifeng, Uncle Dong Fang was acting strange.

523
00:39:27,506 --> 00:39:29,473
I can't get through him at all.

524
00:39:29,474 --> 00:39:33,093
We can't find Linglong and Sixth Senior since he has locked us in.

525
00:39:33,094 --> 00:39:34,530
Calm down.

526
00:39:34,531 --> 00:39:36,817
Island Master has sent someone to search for them.

527
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:38,799
Linglong and Minyan are chivalrous.

528
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,160
Maybe they were delayed because they were helping others out.

529
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:47,441
But this Island Master is strangely anxious.

530
00:39:47,442 --> 00:39:48,799
Something's wrong.

531
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,293
Seems like he was bewitched.

532
00:39:50,294 --> 00:39:52,989
- Bewitched? <br> - I'm not too sure, either,

533
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,497
but there were red rashes on his arm

534
00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:58,438
and it gives off a sweet scent.

535
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,199
Those were the same symptoms I saw in someone who was bewitched.

536
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,140
Regarding the truth, we'll find out in the feast tonight.

537
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:43,912
He activated the Sword Formation. Everyone is panicking.

538
00:40:43,912 --> 00:40:46,197
Just forget about all the joyous occasions.

539
00:40:46,198 --> 00:40:50,031
Steward Ouyang, our Island Master has been acting strange lately.

540
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,759
What do you think?

541
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,623
I'm just a steward.

542
00:40:54,623 --> 00:40:58,072
It's better for me not to ask questions like these.

543
00:40:58,073 --> 00:41:01,198
But it's good for us to act more cautiously.

544
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,508
It's hard to say. Maybe Tianxu Hall will invade the island.

545
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:12,160
If they dare to come, they will die under the Sword Trap.

546
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,820
<i>Today, you two get to try the special Flower Wine on Fuyu Island.</i>

547
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,720
They're freshly brewed. It's the best time to try them.

548
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,758
Go and find out where Madam is.

549
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:27,134
Yes.

550
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,239
How's the taste?

551
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,343
It's fragrant and sweet.

552
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:33,719
It's delicious.

553
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,042
Youngsters have no worries indeed.

554
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:38,844
That's why you can taste the wine.

555
00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:43,385
If we have too many troubles on our mind,

556
00:41:44,225 --> 00:41:46,865
we can't taste the wine.

557
00:41:46,865 --> 00:41:50,199
My Lord, I'm impressed. You're an expert in wine tasting.

558
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,715
I brought some special wine from Lize Palace as well.

559
00:41:52,716 --> 00:41:54,279
My Lord, please try it.

560
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,201
Bring it to me.

561
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,800
Why doesn't it taste like wine?

562
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,020
It tastes like water.

563
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,620
- Because— <br> - Seems like I'm late.

564
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,215
My Dear!

565
00:42:30,191 --> 00:42:33,759
<i>[QIYU HALL]</i>

566
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,510
My Dear, you're here.

567
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,996
- My Dear. <br> - Greetings, Madam.

568
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,832
Is she the daughter of Sect Leader Chu?

569
00:42:41,832 --> 00:42:42,939
Yes.

570
00:42:42,939 --> 00:42:46,120
She's such a beauty now.

571
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,038
So, he's the favorite disciple of Lize Palace?

572
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:55,860
It's rare for me to see a disciple of Lize Palace without his mask.

573
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,599
This is very rare indeed.

574
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,959
Qing Rong, did you drink again?

575
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,398
What? Can't I drink?

576
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:03,580
Of course you can.

577
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,386
Did you drink by yourself or did you drink with someone else?

578
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:08,385
Why should I tell you?

579
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:10,181
Come, My Dear.

580
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,540
What wine is this?

581
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,040
This is the wine Hero Yu brought from Lize Palace.

582
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,051
Why don't you try it?

583
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,927
How's the taste?

584
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,720
Although it's bland, it has a delicate scent.

585
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,920
It's much better than the wine on Fuyu Island.

586
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,320
Good! You can drink more if you like it.

587
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,629
I heard that Xuanyuan Sect was in trouble.

588
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:59,432
Although Xuanyuan Sect is one of the Five Great Sects,

589
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:02,196
it's corrupted inside.

590
00:44:02,197 --> 00:44:06,380
They deserved everything that happened to them.

591
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,442
Qing Rong, that's enough. You should drink less.

592
00:44:12,443 --> 00:44:15,632
It's not suitable for you to say that, right?

593
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,138
Xuanji, Hero Yu. Don't just sit over there.

594
00:44:19,138 --> 00:44:22,134
Enjoy the food and wine as well.

595
