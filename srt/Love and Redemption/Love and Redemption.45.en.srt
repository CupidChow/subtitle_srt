18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,460
Where are you going?

19
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,860
To Lize Palace.

20
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,900
I'm going to correct my past mistakes.

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,183
Lize Palace is the nest of the demon clan.

22
00:01:46,183 --> 00:01:50,879
Even if you have the powers of the God of War, you mustn't go there alone.

23
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,900
Moreover, you don't need to go to Lize Palace

24
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:57,261
if you want to vanquish your inner demon.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,628
Where should I go then?

26
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:03,209
The 15th day of the month is coming soon.

27
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:05,980
Fenru City's gate will open by then.

28
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,579
Yu Sifeng will surely head to Fenru City in order to save Wu Zhiqi.

29
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,822
Only his 12 Feathers bloodline and the powers of the God of War

30
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:19,046
can withstand the malignant aura within the Demon Citadel.

31
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:25,205
So, you'll meet him if you go to the Demon Citadel.

32
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:30,700
By then, you will know that he's a devious demon

33
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,994
that's trying to revive the demon clan.

34
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,160
Fine. I'll meet him in the Demon Citadel.

35
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,320
Wait. Yu Sifeng is devious and cunning.

36
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,150
Getting rid of him would be the best-case scenario.

37
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,270
But in the event that you can't bear to kill him,

38
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:56,106
you should bring this with you.

39
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,450
What is this?

40
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,980
This is the Cleansing Bottle.

41
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,520
Master acquired this item while he was traveling around the world.

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,140
It can get rid of one's anguish.

43
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:12,360
If you cannot bear to kill him,

44
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,674
you should use the Cleansing Bottle and get rid of his anguish.

45
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,492
Although it won't kill him, it may help him to get his conscience back.

46
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:25,670
It's up to you whether to kill him

47
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,738
or use the Cleansing Bottle on him.

48
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,930
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Destined ♥ Love Team @ Viki</i>

49
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,620
I understand.

50
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,406
Xuanji, you're the only person I care about in this world.

51
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:50,477
You mustn't be soft on him.

52
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:53,000
If you let Yu Sifeng save Wu Zhiqi,

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,290
the demon clan will have a huge boost in their morale.

54
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:59,320
They'll be hard to deal with by then.

55
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,131
I won't do so.

56
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,546
<i>Xuanji, I hope you will cherish this last chance I'm giving you.</i>

57
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:13,495
<i>I hope you can get rid of your inner demon.</i>

58
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,500
Father.

59
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,499
Linglong? Please wait for a while.

60
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:26,359
I have something to tell you after I'm done with this.

61
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,520
It's all right. I'll leave after I finish my words.

62
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,873
Tell me then.

63
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:38,681
I think it's time for me to leave.

64
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm here to bid farewell.

65
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,940
You two are leaving?

66
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,896
Did Minyan find a suitable place for you two?

67
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,393
This time, I'm leaving alone.

68
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,640
You're leaving alone? What about Minyan?

69
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,740
Did that silly child make you angry again?

70
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,720
No. It has nothing to do with him.

71
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,940
I wanted to leave on my own.

72
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,180
I want to find a quiet place and spend the rest of my life there.

73
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,420
Linglong, do you know this?

74
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,580
Minyan came to me today.

75
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,419
He came to me in the afternoon.

76
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,220
He told me that he wanted to marry you.

77
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,698
You two, one of you wants to propose,

78
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:47,940
and one of you wants to leave.

79
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,700
What are you two up to?

80
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,782
He wants to marry me?

81
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:54,300
Impossible. He–

82
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,400
Nothing is impossible.

83
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,014
I want to marry you.

84
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,815
Master.

85
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,940
Why are you doing this?

86
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,620
Because you don't believe my feelings for you.

87
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,440
Because you're paranoid.

88
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,820
That's why I need to marry you.

89
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,200
So that you won't suspect my feelings,

90
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,641
I want to marry you.

91
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:31,186
You're the only girl I will marry in this life.

92
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,460
I'm not the old me anymore.

93
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,480
I am unworthy to marry you.

94
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,600
The past you?

95
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,094
Do you think the old you is better than the current you?

96
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:47,100
You acted like a princess.

97
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,500
You were willful and you didn't care about the feelings of others.

98
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,560
That was the old you. You were not that great at all.

99
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,265
Why do you want to marry me then?

100
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:59,686
Because I like you.

101
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:03,963
No matter if it's the old you, current you, or future you.

102
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:08,340
I like you no matter who you become.

103
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,780
Nobody can take you away from me.

104
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,320
I, Zhong Minyan, have been loving Chu Linglong for 14 years.

105
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,140
I didn't prepare the Three Letters and Six Etiquettes,

106
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,040
and I didn't hire any matchmaker.

107
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:31,220
I only have my true heart for her.

108
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,900
Master, please allow me to marry Linglong.

109
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:41,025
Here, I swear that I will never let Linglong cry or suffer again.

110
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,403
Master, please grant my wish.

111
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,379
Sure. My child, you may rise now.

112
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,460
I'm happy to see you two tie the knot.

113
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,894
But now, the Shaoyang Sect will soon face our biggest threat.

114
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:15,500
I have no time to hold your wedding.

115
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,719
How about this? You two should stay here for a little longer.

116
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:24,580
After everything is over, I'll hold a glorious wedding for you two.

117
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,060
What do you think?

118
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,110
Master, I don't want to wait anymore.

119
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,889
Linglong will suffer if we wait.

120
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:40,180
I want to marry her as soon as possible so that she can feel relieved,

121
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,779
but I'm afraid as well.

122
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:48,760
I don't want Linglong to suffer because of a hasty wedding.

123
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,559
Not at all. You suffered because of me in the past.

124
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,814
I'm happy if you can marry me right now.

125
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,193
Have you two decided?

126
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,570
- Please give us your blessing. <br> - Please give us your blessing.

127
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,279
Sure! This is great!

128
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,328
After five days,

129
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:33,361
I will... I will hold a wedding for you two and Xuanji, okay?

130
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,419
Thank you, Master.

131
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,294
<i>- This is? <br> - It has a malignant aura.</i>

132
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:46,774
<i>Such strong malignant aura.</i>

133
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:48,435
<i>- Be careful. <br> - Be careful.</i>

134
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,680
Save me!

135
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,559
This is the border of the Demon Citadel.

136
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,420
I'm afraid the malignant aura will be stronger up front. Yuan Lang,

137
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,860
are you still not willing to hand over the spirit keys?

138
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,744
You should enter the place with me then.

139
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,959
I don't dare to do so. The rest of us will wait here.

140
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,140
Here are the spirit keys.

141
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,919
I'll take care of Ting Nu and Liu Yihuan on your behalf.

142
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,560
We'll celebrate together after you save Wu Zhiqi.

143
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,910
Are you threatening me?

144
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,990
I don't dare to do so.

145
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,510
I just didn't want you to be worried.

146
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,700
<i>Ting Nu's medicine is protecting me from the malignant aura.</i>

147
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,115
<i>As the shadowy overlord, it descends in terror.</i>

148
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:30,979
<i>The heavenly calamity, here lies the Asuras.</i>

149
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,260
Senior was right, indeed.

150
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,340
You still came in the end.

151
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:16,749
God of War, aren't you getting married with your senior soon?

152
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:21,100
You still have time to interfere with our matters?

153
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,934
I'm here to kill you.

154
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:28,396
We'll see about that.

155
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,800
I won't remove the barrier before the entrance closes.

156
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,450
Yu Sifeng, show me what you have.

157
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,680
You're so clingy.

158
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,860
God of War, are you missing me as you've not mastered the Sentimental Tactics with your senior?

159
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,120
You still can't get over me?

160
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,920
Shut up!

161
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,101
Yu Sifeng!

162
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:21,999
<i>Demon Lord, welcome back.</i>

163
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,881
Yu Sifeng!

164
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,929
Where are you?

165
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,710
Come out!

166
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,353
Yu Sifeng!

167
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,600
You better know what's good for you. I'm trying to save you.

168
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,900
The vengeful spirits of the Asuras follow the sounds they hear.

169
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,940
You'll only wake them up if you keep shouting.

170
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,520
Even the God of War can't do anything against them.

171
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,583
Yu Sifeng, what are you up to now?

172
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,333
It's up to you whether to believe it or not.

173
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:40,094
You can keep shouting if you wish to die.

174
00:14:40,094 --> 00:14:42,024
Show me what you have.

175
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,437
What if I don't?

176
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,200
I'll force you to show me then.

177
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,519
Don't think that you'll be safe just because you saved me. I won't let you off.

178
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,418
Look at your foot.

179
00:15:56,347 --> 00:16:01,178
<i>This painting depicts the Demon-Immortal War of 1,000 years ago.</i>

180
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,020
<i>Devil Star, Devil Magnificent were the strongest Asuras.</i>

181
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,980
<i>And the God of War was the strongest immortal in the heavens.</i>

182
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:17,100
<i>But why isn't there a painting </i>

183
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,410
<i> about the fight between the Devil Star and the God of War?</i>

184
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,820
<i>The reflection of the God of War is actually an Asura?</i>

185
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,380
<i>The God of War and the Devil Star is the same person indeed.</i>

186
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,730
<i>If Yuan Lang unlocks the Crystal Lamp, Xuanji will transform into the Devil Star</i>

187
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,348
<i>and it'll be too late by then.</i>

188
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:54,730
<i>I mustn't let Xuanji see them.</i>

189
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,760
<i>You even destroyed the God of War in the painting.</i>

190
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:07,197
<i>Seems like it has really come to this.</i>

191
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:19,970
<i>Yuan Lang said the locks for the Dimension Chain are located beside the Pool of Bones.</i>

192
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:22,280
<i>Where exactly are they?</i>

193
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,599
God of War, are you really going to point at me with your sword?

194
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,980
Senior Hao Chen was right. You're devious and cunning.

195
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,119
Who knows? Maybe everything here is a part of your ploy.

196
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,940
You really believe in your senior, right?

197
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,740
Fine. I saved you because it was part of my ploy.

198
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,980
You want to kill me? Do it now.

199
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,740
You want to die here? No way.

200
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,380
I'll bring you back to Mount Shaoyang so that you can give us an explanation!

201
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,628
Fine. But now, we have no way to return.

202
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:08,037
We can only proceed.

203
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:11,954
God of War, may I move now?

204
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,800
You better move slowly. Don't try anything funny.

205
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:42,500
This malignant aura around here is strong indeed.

206
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:50,162
You wouldn't need to suffer like this if you didn't come in the first place.

207
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:54,140
You deserve everything.

208
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,117
You're right.

209
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,382
This is all my fault.

210
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,420
I told you I would get to the bottom of your mother's murder.

211
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,359
This is the list of rewards that our clan received after the Demon-Immortal War.

212
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,879
The malignant aura within the Demon Citadel belongs to the Asuras.

213
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,460
As stated within the list, Yuan Lang was the only Rose Gold Bird

214
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,009
who received the malignant aura from King Asura.

215
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:34,097
So, Yuan Lang is your mother's murderer.

216
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:39,239
It's useless for you to show me this piece of evidence at this current moment.

217
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,500
You promised to bring Yuan Lang to me.

218
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,394
But now, he's still enjoying himself in Lize Palace.

219
00:19:43,394 --> 00:19:48,740
And you? You colluded with him and tried to save Wu Zhiqi.

220
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,820
You even hide your identity from me.

221
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,620
This list is meaningless to me!

222
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,020
Xuanji, the one I wanted to save

223
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,240
wasn't Wu Zhiqi.

224
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,959
Forget it.

225
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,911
One day, you'll understand my pain.

226
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:25,699
Your pain? We're enemies now.

227
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:27,641
What more are you hiding from me?

228
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:30,322
Tell me!

229
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:43,900
<i>The gate of Fenru City will only open when the full moon rises.</i>

230
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,280
<i>Wu Zhiqi can only escape if you go in and free him by then.</i>

231
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,448
In the future.

232
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:53,820
I will tell you if I have the chance.

233
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,411
Now, the full moon has appeared.

234
00:20:56,411 --> 00:21:00,020
The last time we saw a full moon together was in Qingmu Town–

235
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,000
Stop saying useless things.

236
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,960
If you have nothing else to say,

237
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,173
return with me right away.

238
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,382
Sifeng!

239
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,079
My injuries were too grave.

240
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,020
The malignant aura is seeping through my injuries.

241
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,624
I need to recuperate.

242
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,420
Look over there.

243
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,664
That lotus actually bloomed in a desolate place like this.

244
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:42,300
I'm sure it could cleanse my body from the malignant aura.

245
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,630
Maybe it could heal my injuries.

246
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:49,720
Can you pick it for me?

247
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,920
I've helped you just now.

248
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,720
Don't tell me you want me

249
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,140
to pick that when I'm in this state?

250
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,249
You're in no condition to play tricks.

251
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:11,835
You better stay here.

252
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:13,916
Don't try to escape.

253
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,659
<i>Xuanji, I'm sorry.</i>

254
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,700
Senior was right.

255
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,900
You did change.

256
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,780
- Behind you. <br> - I won't fall for your tricks again!

257
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,877
I'm not tricking you.

258
00:23:11,877 --> 00:23:13,694
Be careful!

259
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,479
Hand over the spirit keys.

260
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,420
- Xuanji. <br> - Hand over the spirit keys!

261
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,711
Purple Fox! Save Wu Zhiqi!

262
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,960
You!

263
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,059
These four damned chains!

264
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:36,640
One day, I'll stuff them inside the mouth of you immortals!

265
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,273
Did you hear me?

266
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:41,734
I'm going to stuff them inside your mouth!

267
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,419
They broke?

268
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,720
They actually broke!

269
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:01,849
It's been over 1,000 years!

270
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:05,374
My powers have finally been restored!

271
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:07,601
Which one of you saved me?

272
00:25:07,602 --> 00:25:10,442
I will express my gratitude!

273
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:20,260
Little Fox? It's you?

274
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,160
Wu Zhiqi.

275
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,080
I-I did it.

276
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,162
It's me.

277
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,860
I saved you!

278
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,589
Little Fox, are you okay?

279
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:39,059
I'm fine.

280
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,282
I'm doing well.

281
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,659
Wu Zhiqi, you...

282
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:48,159
Are you okay?

283
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,499
I'm fine!

284
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:51,479
Little Fox, I'm doing very well now.

285
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,863
I've broken free of those chains.

286
00:25:52,863 --> 00:25:55,450
I'm brimming with energy now.

287
00:25:56,324 --> 00:25:59,627
Little Fox, you did all this to save me.

288
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:02,132
It must've been tough.

289
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:04,238
How about this? When we get out later,

290
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:07,580
I'll pluck some grapes for you. Okay?

291
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,846
Stupid Monkey, who cares about your grapes?

292
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:17,482
I want you to never abandon me again.

293
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,143
Little Fox, this is not the time for talks like this.

294
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:28,190
We'll talk about it after we leave.

295
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,520
By the way, where did you come from?

296
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,839
I... The Demon Citadel.

297
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,599
Wu Zhiqi.

298
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,453
Sifeng.

299
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:41,159
It's Sifeng.

300
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,839
He and I unlocked the chains together.

301
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,739
- You need to help him. <br> - Okay.

302
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,510
I'll help him.

303
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,450
It's good to see you.

304
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,908
Little Fox!

305
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:59,248
Little Fox! Little Fox!

306
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,980
You're as useless as you were before.

307
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,660
Sifeng?

308
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:17,106
I'll meet you right now!

309
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,639
<i>- Look. <br> - What's going on?</i>

310
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,340
<i>- Look. <br> - That's strange.</i>

311
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,630
<i>[Shaoyang]</i>

312
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,019
What's going on?

313
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:38,728
The Dimension Chain was broken

314
00:27:38,728 --> 00:27:40,869
and it alerted our land.

315
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,586
They've saved Wu Zhiqi.

316
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,313
<i>Xuanji, Wu Zhiqi has been saved.</i>

317
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:52,052
<i>So, will you go soft on him?</i>

318
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,640
Wu Zhiqi is saved? Wu Zhiqi is saved!

319
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,060
Now, the demon clan will dominate the three realms!

320
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,770
We'll dominate the three realms!

321
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,699
Yu Sifeng, do you think I can't kill you?

322
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,559
You can kill me, but I need to tell you something before you kill me.

323
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,220
I'm not the Devil Star.

324
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:23,610
I have good reasons for everything I do.

325
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:25,855
When will you stop lying to me?

326
00:28:25,855 --> 00:28:27,757
I'm not lying!

327
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:30,040
You want to know my bitter reasons?

328
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,439
It's a fact that

329
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,399
I will risk myself and do anything in order to protect the person I love.

330
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,079
I just wanted her to live in peace.

331
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,899
It's fine even if I have to pretend to be the Devil Star.

332
00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:41,493
It's fine even if the world misunderstands me.

333
00:28:42,448 --> 00:28:45,428
I just hope that one day,

334
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,120
we will be together again.

335
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,679
Xuanji, please give me some time.

336
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,094
I will surely explain everything to you.

337
00:28:59,094 --> 00:29:03,497
I don't believe a single word.

338
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:09,959
I hate myself for thinking that

339
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,520
my Sifeng might be able to turn over a new leaf and return to his original self.

340
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,194
That would've been great.

341
00:29:17,194 --> 00:29:22,020
But now, I have only realized that my Sifeng has changed.

342
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,480
He will never return.

343
00:30:09,802 --> 00:30:11,540
Sifeng, hang in there.

344
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,160
You'll be fine after a while.

345
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:19,199
Sifeng, it's hard for you to get rid of your anguish.

346
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,036
Hang in there. We'll be able to return to the past when your anguish disappears!

347
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,614
Sifeng!

Sifeng!

356
00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:57,024
Sifeng, what's wrong?

357
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,802
Sifeng!

Sifeng!

- Sifeng! <br> - Little Beauty!

375
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,108
Little Beauty, do you have a deep feud with this guy?

376
00:32:17,108 --> 00:32:20,280
Why are you torturing him with the Vermilion Bird Bottle?

377
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,859
Vermilion Bird Bottle?

378
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,419
Isn't this the Cleansing Bottle?

379
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:26,339
Senior said this Cleansing Bottle can get rid of one's anguish.

380
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:27,479
Get rid of one's anguish?

381
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:30,499
Listen, the Vermilion Bird Bottle contains the most anguish in the world.

382
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:33,299
It would even turn immortals into water.

383
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:36,360
Your senior lied to you.

384
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,039
<i>If you can't bear to kill him,</i>

385
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:44,479
<i>you should use the Cleansing Bottle and get rid of Sifeng's anguish.</i>

386
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:47,260
<i>It may help him to find his conscience.</i>

387
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,061
This can't be.

388
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:51,104
This can't be. This can't be!

389
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,879
Sifeng!

390
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,260
Sifeng is my savior.

391
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,474
I can't just let him die!

392
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:06,037
Yuntian Hoop! Chehai Hook!

393
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,267
Break!

394
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,520
Sifeng!

395
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,500
Sifeng! Sifeng! Sifeng!

396
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,117
Little Beauty, you almost killed him just now.

397
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:29,982
But now, you're concerned about him?

398
00:33:29,982 --> 00:33:31,678
It's lucky that I saved him in time.

399
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,999
If not, he would've been covered with pus.

400
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:38,399
Never mind. I won't hold it against you since we're old friends.

401
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,359
But he needs to leave with me.

402
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,139
Sifeng! Wake up!

403
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:44,340
Sifeng!

404
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,613
The Demon Citadel is a detestable place indeed.

405
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,490
Little Beauty, see you next time.

406
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,743
Sifeng! Sifeng!

407
00:34:03,743 --> 00:34:05,640
Sifeng!

408
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,322
Sifeng!

409
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:25,800
The Juntian Hoop and Chehai Hook are amazing indeed.

410
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,370
It ripped apart the very fabric of space.

411
00:34:27,371 --> 00:34:30,330
It even connected the Demon Citadel with Mount Buzhou!

412
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,880
I thought it was someone else. Yuan Lang, it's you?

413
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,381
You're still alive?

414
00:34:44,381 --> 00:34:46,779
My brother.

415
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:49,451
I've tried my best to rescue you over the past 1,000 years.

416
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:52,232
I've finally succeeded today.

417
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,029
But Little Fox told me that this Sifeng was the one who rescued me.

418
00:34:57,029 --> 00:34:59,941
What? Were you involved as well?

419
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,700
I put in much effort to obtain the four spirit keys.

420
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,750
As for Younger Brother Yu Sifeng,

421
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,492
he did give me some minor assistance.

422
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:14,089
So, going to the Demon Citadel is only considered as minor assistance?

423
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:16,560
My brother, since you've put in so much effort,

424
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,760
why didn't you come and save me personally in the end?

425
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,908
Do you miss me?

426
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:29,768
Or do you miss my Juntian Hoop and Chehai Hook?

427
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:31,439
My brother, you're so humorous.

428
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,542
I just think that your divine weapons are truly amazing.

429
00:35:35,543 --> 00:35:39,243
Can you show them to me?

430
00:35:39,243 --> 00:35:41,788
My brother, are you kidding me?

431
00:35:41,788 --> 00:35:43,363
There's nothing for you to see.

432
00:35:43,363 --> 00:35:47,040
What if you lose them by accident?

433
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,829
Return!

434
00:35:52,726 --> 00:35:56,413
By the way, Sifeng has sustained some serious injuries because of me.

435
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:58,236
Where are you staying? I'll treat his injuries there.

436
00:35:58,236 --> 00:36:00,047
Lize Palace over the West Sea.

437
00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:02,919
But this is not urgent, right?

438
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,238
Of course, it's not urgent to you when you're not the one dying.

439
00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:08,379
I'll go to Lize Palace for now. See you there.

440
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,287
This Wu Zhiqi doesn't appreciate us at all.

441
00:36:16,288 --> 00:36:18,508
He's the Left Lieutenant.

442
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:22,877
He's more powerful than me. It's normal for him to be arrogant.

443
00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:24,371
Relay my orders.

444
00:36:24,371 --> 00:36:31,520
Set up a feast and welcome Wu Zhiqi.

445
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,004
Yes.

446
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,327
- Who's there? <br> - Who's there?

447
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,630
<i>[Lize Palace]</i>

448
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,751
Two hours have passed since then.

449
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:32,910
Why isn't Wu Zhiqi here yet?

450
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,340
We set up a feast just for him.

451
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,350
The food will be cold if we wait any longer.

452
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,505
Elder Feng, that's enough.

453
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:40,662
Let's take a look outside.

454
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,479
Don't trouble yourself.

455
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,124
I'm here.

456
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,054
My brother, you've made us wait.

457
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:05,355
Come, have a seat.

458
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,640
I didn't expect the demons to be so disrespectful

459
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,054
and cold-blooded after my absence.

460
00:38:17,054 --> 00:38:19,455
What do you mean by that?

461
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,948
The palace master is the reincarnation of the Devil Star.

462
00:38:24,948 --> 00:38:27,319
He's my savior as well.

463
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:30,759
Now his life is in danger, yet you are throwing a feast?

464
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,419
What do you mean by this?

465
00:38:32,419 --> 00:38:35,740
Listen! If Yu Sifeng doesn't survive today,

466
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,960
if you dare to drink or eat,

467
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,220
I will make you pay!

468
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,280
We did this out of good intentions.

469
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,155
Why are you so angry?

470
00:38:52,156 --> 00:38:53,751
Yuan Lang, save your breath.

471
00:38:53,752 --> 00:38:57,112
- Go and save him right now. <br> - Save him?

472
00:38:57,112 --> 00:38:59,900
I'm not a medical expert. How could I save him?

473
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,060
It's fine. I know someone who's a medical expert.

474
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,603
Ting Nu!

475
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,118
Ting Nu, tell him the things that you've told me just now.

476
00:40:37,118 --> 00:40:39,408
Sifeng was struck with the malignant aura of the Demon Citadel

477
00:40:39,408 --> 00:40:41,118
and the blood fog of the Vermilion Bird Bottle.

478
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,874
Either one of them is hard enough to treat on its own.

479
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:47,575
Now, there's only one way to save him.

480
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:51,711
We need two demons who are more powerful than him.

481
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,819
They must have equal levels of power and use their powers together

482
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,151
in order to force out the malignant aura in his body.

483
00:40:57,152 --> 00:40:58,259
You hear him?

484
00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:00,419
Powerful demons, equal levels of power.

485
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:02,794
What a coincidence. You and I are the right candidates.

486
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:04,407
Let's go.

487
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:24,040
Yuan Lang, what do you mean by this?

488
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,477
Are you not willing to save the Devil Star?

489
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:30,633
If Yu Sifeng was the reincarnation of Devil Star, I'd save him.

490
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:34,013
But he was seriously injured by the malignant aura and the Vermilion Bird Bottle.

491
00:41:34,014 --> 00:41:38,422
I suspect that he's not the real Devil Star.

492
00:41:38,422 --> 00:41:40,659
Let me ask you this then.

493
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:43,319
Who else can endure the power of the Vermilion Bird Bottle

494
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,471
and the malignant aura besides the Devil Star?

495
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:51,026
Moreover, his soul hasn't returned to his body yet.

496
00:41:51,027 --> 00:41:52,799
He has less than half of his powers.

497
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,825
Your logic doesn't work at all.

498
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,340
Don't tell me you're plotting something, just like what you did 1,000 years ago?

499
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,280
Are you trying to betray the demon clan?

500
00:42:13,612 --> 00:42:15,519
What do you mean by that?

501
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,294
I mean nothing.

502
00:42:17,295 --> 00:42:19,687
I just heard some rumors about you.

503
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:21,385
Don't be so nervous.

504
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:23,602
1,000 years ago, our Right Lieutenant

505
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:27,583
wanted to become a spy in the heavens for the sake of our clan.

506
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:30,460
I think he wouldn't betray our clan.

507
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:36,558
According to my understanding, he's most concerned about our clan.

508
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:38,538
Am I right, old friend?

509
00:42:39,285 --> 00:42:41,525
You're right.

510
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:47,231
Brother, since you said that, I'll listen to you.

511
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,331
That's great.

512
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,370
Where is it?

513
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,801
I've been here for so long,

514
00:43:42,802 --> 00:43:45,922
but I haven't seen someone who suffered this much.

515
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,740
Stinky woman, you have a pitiful life.

516
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,267
Teng She, I've forgiven you many times.

517
00:43:54,267 --> 00:43:56,607
I didn't expect you to be so impudent!

518
00:43:56,607 --> 00:43:58,059
How dare you sneak into King Bailing's chamber!

519
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:01,159
Wait, Green Dragon. Listen to me.

520
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:03,380
- I'm not... <br> - Shut up! Still trying to deny it?

521
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,379
Listen, you've broken the rules of the heavens.

522
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:09,800
This time, you'll be put behind bars.

523
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,979
It's good that you're awake.

524
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,320
Seems like your condition is stable.

525
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,692
Sorry to trouble you again.

526
00:44:39,692 --> 00:44:41,963
I only played a minor role.

527
00:44:41,963 --> 00:44:47,140
You were saved because of Wu Zhiqi's and Yuan Lang's power.

528
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,500
Yuan Lang didn't want to save you at all.

529
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:56,000
You would've been dead if Wu Zhiqi didn't force him to do so.

530
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,239
It's good that you're safe.

531
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,888
I'll make some tonic to help you recover your strength.

532
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:11,600
Look at your lifeless face.

533
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,200
You narrowly escaped death once again.

534
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,429
Chu Xuanji is vicious indeed.

535
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,492
Maybe...

536
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,842
it's because I've hidden too many secrets from her.

537
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:36,948
That's why Chu Xuanji did that.

538
00:45:37,512 --> 00:45:41,152
One day, when she finds out the truth,

539
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,940
she'll appreciate my effort.

540
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,429
She used the Vermilion Bird Bottle, you know?

541
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:50,256
Even if she didn't know the truth,

542
00:45:50,256 --> 00:45:52,247
it's obvious that she wanted to kill you

543
00:45:52,247 --> 00:45:54,084
when she uses something like that!

544
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:58,711
Yu Sifeng, Chu Xuanji is trying to kill you!

545
00:45:58,711 --> 00:46:03,895
She wouldn't resort to that if she still had feelings for you.

546
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,848
That girl is too vicious.

547
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,162
I would have never taught you how to court her

548
00:46:09,162 --> 00:46:12,263
if I knew this was going to happen in the first place.

549
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,098
Now that Wu Zhiqi has been saved,

550
00:46:19,098 --> 00:46:21,782
my plan will succeed soon

551
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:24,930
and everything will be clear by then.

552
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:29,660
I saw Xuanji's background in the Demon Citadel.

553
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,044
She's the God of War

554
00:46:32,044 --> 00:46:34,160
and the Devil Star.

555
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:44,050
