18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,165
Zhong Minyan, do you acknowledge being guilty?

19
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:38,718
I am guilty.

20
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,140
Since you admit you are guilty, tell me about your crimes.

21
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,220
I, Zhong Minyan,

22
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,439
disobeyed Master's orders, acted recklessly,

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,000
worked with demons, and embarrassed the sect.

24
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,190
I even...

25
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:56,760
Who killed Minjue?

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,980
It was me.

27
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,407
Father, Sixth Senior did it because he was charmed by demons.

28
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:08,586
He didn't do it on purpose.

29
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,179
- You can't blame it on him. <br> - Shut up!

30
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:11,539
But...

31
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,460
No one can plead for him today!

32
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,220
Xuanji...

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,019
I, Zhong Minyan, killed my fellow apprentice.

34
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:30,058
I've committed treason. I have nothing to say.

35
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:33,522
Zhong Minyan, if you know you are guilty,

36
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:37,640
tell me how you should be punished yourself.

37
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:42,440
I should kill myself.

38
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,560
No! Sixth Senior!

39
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,559
Linglong, your hand...

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,740
<i>- Who asked you to do that?</i> <br> - You wanted to die so badly?

41
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,336
It's my fault.

42
00:02:56,337 --> 00:02:57,774
Nonsense.

43
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:00,150
I remember everything back at Tianxu Hall.

44
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:02,820
- Everything at Tianxu Hall was my— <br> - It was me!

45
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,119
I did everything!

46
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:08,080
Don't lie to protect me.

47
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:11,048
Linglong...

48
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,062
Remember,

49
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:16,580
you are unrelated to this.

50
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,874
I'm already in deep trouble.

51
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:24,060
If you get involved as well, Master will be so sad.

52
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,606
No.

53
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:30,559
Linglong, I came to Shaoyang when I was eight.

54
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,820
When I first saw you, you welcomed me in a red dress.

55
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,159
You were proud like a rose.

56
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,280
I'd never seen such a beautiful person before.

57
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,740
After that, I found out that you were the sect leader's daughter.

58
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,959
Meanwhile, I was just an orphan.

59
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,239
I swore at that time to practice hard because that was the only way

60
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,939
I could protect you by your side.

61
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,000
I want to see you being proud.

62
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,140
Linglong,

63
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:06,020
please don't snatch my final dream away.

64
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,560
No.

65
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,660
I, Zhong Minyan, committed a huge crime.

66
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,620
I beg you, Master,

67
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,340
give me the death penalty.

68
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,619
Father, Sixth Senior was cheated because he valued the important bonds.

69
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:46,187
You can't put all the fault on him.

70
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:48,901

Zhong Minyan,

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,180
you were charmed by demons and committed a grave crime.

78
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,660
You should be heavily punished.

79
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,998
Seeing that you didn't do it on purpose, you may escape the death penalty,

80
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:27,698
but you will still have to be punished.

81
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:29,980
Someone!

82
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,280
Expel Zhong Minyan from the sect.

83
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,279
Father, getting expelled from a sect is an embarrassment for life.

84
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,837
Please reconsider it.

85
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:46,280
Xuanji,

86
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,119
Master is already being lenient.

87
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,160
Don't trouble him anymore.

88
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:58,466
Zhong Minyan, from now on, you will no longer be a disciple of Shaoyang.

89
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:00,900
Hand over your name plaque.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,093
I, Zhong Minyan, embarrassed my master and embarrassed Shaoyang.

91
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:17,222
I'm handing over the Shaoyang plaque today

92
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:21,560
and will not address myself as a disciple of Shaoyang anymore.

93
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,160
Father, I have something to say.

94
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,421
I, Chu Linglong, a disciple of Shaoyang, will leave Shaoyang today.

95
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:57,040
Linglong...

96
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,357
You...

97
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:00,820
What are you talking about?

98
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,310
What happened today was because of me.

99
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,020
Minyan entered Mount Buzhou to save me and was charmed by demons.

100
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,920
I am ashamed to be a disciple of Shaoyang any longer.

101
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,918
Linglong, you were born and raised in Shaoyang.

102
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:16,494
Where else can you go?

103
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:17,843
Take back what you said.

104
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:19,395
The world is so big.

105
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:21,587
I'll follow you wherever you go.

106
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:24,480
Since you like to see me being proud,

107
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,280
allow me to be willful for you again.

108
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,879
All of you are leaving.

109
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,035
Starting today, I won't be a disciple of Shaoyang as well.

110
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:37,403
We will all stay together.

111
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:39,999
Xuanji! That's nonsense!

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,543
You think of Shaoyang as a joke?

113
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:44,959
Xuanji, don't cause any troubles.

114
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,248
I'm not.

115
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:49,159
We promised to always stay together.

116
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,638
What are you doing now? If you are leaving, let's leave together!

117
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,080
Xuanji, I didn't do it on impulse.

118
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,318
Don't act rashly.

119
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,920
It will seem like you are threatening Father.

120
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,438
But I don't want to separate from you.

121
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:03,959
Xuanji,

122
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,997
we are not kids anymore.

123
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:07,870
We won't be together forever.

124
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:09,719
If we have to separate,

125
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,000
you just have to choose to guard the most important person to you.

126
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,020
Shaoyang and Minyan are the most important parts of my life.

127
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,859
If I have to make a choice now, I can only choose Minyan.

128
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:29,705
If I don't have Shaoyang, I might still live.

129
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:32,120
But if I don't have Minyan,

130
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,560
I will die.

131
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,137
Why?

132
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:41,320
Why do you have to make this choice?

133
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,220
Silly Xuanji.

134
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,990
Not everything will go as planned in this world.

135
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,860
We have to make different choices.

136
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,020
I hope that you won't have to make any choices in your life.

137
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,980
All right. Don't be rash.

138
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,782
I'm still your sister even if I'm no longer a disciple of Shaoyang.

139
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:05,820
Minyan will still be himself.

140
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,980
Father is old.

141
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:11,620
Can you be filial for me?

142
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,920
I, Chu Linglong, beg for the sect leader's approval.

143
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,020
Linglong,

144
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,300
you've really decided?

145
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,998
I've made my decision to leave.

146
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,359
I am unfilial.

147
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,240
I disappointed Shaoyang's guidance and Father's upbringing.

148

<i>[Shaoyang Sect Zhong Minyan] <br> [Shaoyang Sect Chu Lingong]</i>

Disciples of Shaoyang, Zhong Minyan and Chu Linglong

150
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,660
violated the sect's laws.

151
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,380
Starting today, they will be expelled from Shaoyang.

152

Although both of you are no longer disciples of Shaoyang,

153
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:49,020
you must remember, Shouyang Peak

154
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,160
will always be your home.

155
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,160
Thank you, Master.

156
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,122
Stay at the base of the peak with Sixth Senior for now.

157
00:11:52,122 --> 00:11:57,460
When Father has calmed down, I will help you persuade him again.

158
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,017
It's all right.

159
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:03,260
If you miss me, just come and visit me.

160
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,794
What's wrong?

161
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,860
You will miss me?

00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,680
ever since I woke up,

164
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,940
my mind has been full of the flower demon's memories.

165
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,942
It felt like I killed all the people she killed.

166
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,660
It felt like her wrongdoings

167
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,980
were done by me.

168
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,345
Even the nasty things that she did with Wu Tong

169
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:38,119
felt like I was the one who did them.

170
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,699
I feel disgusted about myself.

171
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:42,360
Linglong,

172
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,113
those are the flower demon's memories.

173
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:46,859
They are not yours.

174
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:49,257
You didn't do any of those things.

175
00:12:49,257 --> 00:12:51,274
Those were what she did.

176
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:53,257
You don't have to shoulder her crimes.

177
00:12:53,257 --> 00:12:56,278
But she looked exactly like me.

178
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,266
She even had half of my primordial spirit.

179
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:00,946
Can you say it's totally unrelated to me?

180
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,499
That's because she tried to be similar to you.

181
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,738
Your primordial spirit was seized by her as well.

182
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:09,617
You are the victim. They were not your fault.

183
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:14,021
You and Sixth Senior have to leave here and stay away from these troubles.

184
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:16,920
You will be happy.

185
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,700
Right, Xuanji.

186
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,819
This...

187
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:38,259
- What is this? <br> - This is a Memory Pearl.

188
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,336
You lost your six senses when you were young.

189
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:42,880
This is an object that recorded the times when mother

190
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,754
taught you about identifying items and feelings.

191
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:49,899
After I leave, if Father feels sad in front of Mother's grave,

192
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:54,160
you have to accompany him for me and talk to him.

193
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:00,460
Let's go.

194
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,280
Sixth Senior,

195
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,420
take care of my sister.

196
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,419
Let me send you off.

197
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,699
Don't.

198
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:17,540
It'll be bad if everyone ends up coming.

199
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,780
We are leaving.

200
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,000
There are no lamps or candles here.

201
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,899
I'll go out and buy one.

202
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:19,920
It's all right.

203
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,619
The moonlight is nice tonight.

204
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:23,740
It's enough to light up this place.

205
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,622
How are your injuries?

206
00:16:57,623 --> 00:16:59,280
I'm fine.

207
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,499
My room is right next door.

208
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:04,720
Call me if you need anything.

209
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,600
I'll be going back.

210
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:17,090
♫ <i> Sigh, in the world there's only lovesickness <br>that has no solution </i> ♫

211
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:26,040
♫ <i> Lingering on the day we parted </i> ♫

212
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:33,400
♫ <i> On the rugged road, the wind is blurred </i> ♫

213
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:40,720
♫ <i> Only ask for every twinkle, every smile, just only you </i> ♫

214
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,620
♫ <i> If your heart knows my feelings </i> ♫

215
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,501
Why are you so foolish?

216
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,439
You are saying that?

217
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,599
Aren't you more foolish than me?

218
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,140
From now on, you will become a sectless wanderer

219
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,280
just like me.

220
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:04,320
I don't mind going anywhere as long as I'm with you.

221
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:08,695
Linglong, I will never disappoint you.

222
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,059
Xuanji, don't be sad.

223
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,013
Aren't Linglong and Minyan fine?

224
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:34,939
It's a good thing to live together in peace.

225
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:38,220
If you miss them, you can visit them often.

226
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:45,319
Sifeng, I have something I've been wanting to ask you.

227
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,320
If there's one day where

228
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,820
we have to make a choice between two important things,

229
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,920
what should we do?

230
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,411
Didn't Linglong say that?

231
00:18:56,411 --> 00:19:00,019
You just have to choose to guard the most important person to you.

232
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:02,816
I only know that I won't give you up.

233
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:04,219
What about you?

234
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:06,460
I won't give you up, either.

235
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,499
Do you know?

236
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:10,899
I actually envy Linglong and Minyan.

237
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,960
You envy them?

238
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,799
Xuanji, after we settle everything in this Flower Session,

239
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,939
will you be willing to find a quiet place

240
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:25,580
and live a relaxed and secluded life with me?

241
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,040
<i>[THE MEMORIAL TABLET OF HE DANPING]</i>

242
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,380
Father.

243
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,380
It's both of you.

244
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:58,660
I was feeling troubled because many things

245
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,279
have happened recently.

246
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,400
That is why I came to speak with your mother.

247
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,859
Your mother has been gone for many years in the blink of an eye.

248
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:11,299
You two sisters have all grown up, too.

249
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:15,179
I just hope that both of you will be safe

250
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,919
without any accidents in the future.

251
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,502
Father, don't worry.

252
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:24,139
I already have the ability to protect myself.

253
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,399
I will also take care of you and Linglong

254
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:28,539
and not allow anyone of you to be in danger.

255
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:30,299
You naughty girl.

256
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:33,780
You did worry me a lot in the past.

257
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,979
Unexpectedly, after you went out to get experience,

258
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:39,340
you've improved a lot.

259
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,319
You got the Dingkun Sword and even got the Flying Snake as your spirit beast.

260
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,552
I am very happy.

261
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:50,399
But my mind constantly feels disturbed.

262
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,880
Xuanji, do you feel there's something special about yourself?

263
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,659
<i>Oh no. Does Father suspect my identity?</i>

264
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,940
<i>If everyone finds out I'm the God of War,</i>

265
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,899
<i>will they see me as a monster and not be close to me?</i>

266
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:06,650
Xuanji?

267
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:14,823
Father, it's a coincidence that I got the Dingkun Sword and Flying Snake.

268
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:17,370
You are really not hiding anything from me?

269
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,500
No.

270
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:23,059
Forget it.

271
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:26,852
If you won't tell me, I won't force you as well.

272
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:30,839
I'm old. I can't stay by your side for life.

273
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:36,420
In the future, as long as Sifeng is with you, I will be relieved.

274
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,339
Father, you don't oppose Sifeng and me anymore?

275
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,059
How should I put it?

276
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:53,779
After what happened with Linglong and Minyan, I got over it.

277
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,659
Two people being together,

278
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:59,099
as long as they respect and love each other without leaving,

279
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:01,019
that's stronger than everything.

280
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,059
Sifeng is a good kid.

281
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:08,220
I can see that he is loyal to you.

282
00:22:12,688 --> 00:22:15,915
Sifeng, I know.

283
00:22:15,915 --> 00:22:18,419
There are many rules at Lize Palace.

284
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:23,035
I also know that your master is not too satisfied with you and Xuanji.

285
00:22:23,035 --> 00:22:28,200
Don't worry. I will find a suitable time to talk with your master.

286
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,560
Thank you, Sect Leader Chu.

287
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:39,099
I will never let Chu Xuanji down in my life.

288
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:43,340
Don't worry and leave Xuanji in my hands.

289
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:53,362
You, little brat, aren't trying to ask for marriage now. Right?

290
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,019
I know now is not the best time.

291
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:00,260
It might be a bit sudden.

292
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,500
But my feelings towards Xuanji have never changed at all.

293
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,800
Sifeng,

294
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,539
you brat!

295
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:13,900
It's hard to keep a lady when they grow up, right?

296
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,183
As cultivators wandering the lands, we can't be bothered about little things.

297
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:20,700
Fine.

298
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,578
After coming back from Dianjinggu, I will find an auspicious day

299
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:29,482
to help you and Linglong get married.

300
00:23:29,482 --> 00:23:34,520
From now on, I will never have to worry about both of you again.

301
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,092
Father, why are you talking about marriage...

302
00:23:38,092 --> 00:23:41,064
What's wrong? You think it's too fast?

303
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:42,180
- No... <br> - Fine.

304
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,499
I'll find another chance to trouble him again. How's that?

305
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:46,919
No, Sect Leader Chu.

306
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,420
I want that badly.

307
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,599
Fine. Xuanji,

308
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,580
have a good talk with your mother.

309
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,279
Sifeng, I told you I'll be responsible for you.

310
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,708
I kept my promise, right?

311
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:11,759
I can only get married to you then.

312
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,299
I...

313
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:16,820
Give me your mother's portrait.

314
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:31,559
Sifeng,

315
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,879
you once told me

316
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,199
that you don't know where your mother's memorial tablet is.

317
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,340
You can't even pay respects to her even if you wanted to.

318
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,059
Today, your mother's portrait is here.

319
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,979
Let's think of this as her memorial tablet

320
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:59,400
and tell her this good news together.

321
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,099
Both our mothers, I got engaged with Sifeng today.

322
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:17,080
I'm sure both of you feel happy in your afterlife.

323
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,140
Madam Chu,

324
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:27,240
I, Yu Sifeng, will definitely take good care of Xuanji.

325
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,960
♫ <i> Find back the lost colors of the scenery in your eyes </i> ♫

326
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,740
♫ <i> Accompany you to see all, proseperity if needed, <br>falling of the rubus coronarius flower</i> ♫

327
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,420
♫ <i> Unlock all the dusty memories sealed in your heart </i> ♫

328
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,159
Why are you smiling?

329
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,940
I'm smiling because we've bowed to our parents just like that.

330
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,273
You are now my fiancée.

331
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:00,740
That doesn't count.

332
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,179
You just bowed in front of my mother and you say that doesn't count?

333
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:05,771
My mother saw everything.

334
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:10,380
Since we went through the ritual, where are the betrothal gifts?

335
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,180
Isn't my hairpin enough?

336
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,259
How dare you ask for your betrothal gift?

337
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:19,100
Both our mothers, you have to seek justice for me.

338
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,035
No way. That hairpin was given to me by your mother, not you.

339
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:24,699
Fine.

340
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,940
Once I come back from Dianjinggu,

341
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,619
I will give you a grand wedding banquet.

342
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:31,179
No matter what you want to eat,

343
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:33,327
I will make them for you for a lifetime.

344
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:35,140
Is that enough?

345
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,780
That's better.

346
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,600
Flying Snake?

347
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,179
Sorry to interrupt your rituals.

348
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,300
Why are you here eating my mother's offerings?

349
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,039
Who asked you two to be lovey-dovey and forget about my meal?

350
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,380
Look at this stinky woman. She's so fierce.

351
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,785
Little Chef, if I had to say, why don't you reconsider it?

352
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:14,540
What are you talking about?

353
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,939
- Aunt Yinghong. <br> - Xuanji.

354
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:29,786
You went to visit Linglong and Minyan?

355
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:31,739
We will depart to Dianjinggu tomorrow.

356
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:33,938
I went to say my goodbyes.

357
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:36,211
This trip to Dianjinggu is not normal.

358
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:38,159
You have to be very careful.

359
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,380
I understand.

360
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,520
Hold on.

361
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,510
Xuanji, where did you get this hairpin?

362
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,400
Hairpin?

363
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,779
What's wrong with this hairpin?

364
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:52,739
This is a carving of the Rose Gold Bird Demon.

365
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:54,780
Your mother was...

366
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,338
It's fine if you don't remember.

367
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:04,059
These Rose Gold Bird Demons are cruel and evil in nature.

368
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:06,319
Your father hates them.

369
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:08,460
Hurry and take off this hairpin.

370
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,920
This is the Rose Gold Bird?

371
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,315
Yes. It's the Rose Gold Bird, indeed.

372
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:28,099
Back then, Rose Gold Birds were the allies of the demon clan.

373
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:31,631
After the Demon-Immortal War, they escaped to the mortal realm.

374
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:34,539
Hundreds of years ago, the righteous sects worked together to surround

375
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,259
and get rid of them altogether.

376
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:40,240
Unfortunately, some of them still escaped.

377
00:28:43,353 --> 00:28:44,739
Aunt Ying Hong,

378
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:47,859
you and Linglong said I'd forgotten about something.

379
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,360
What did I forget?

380
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,686
It's better if you don't remember.

381
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:55,420
You were still so young at that time.

382
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,330
Xuanji, all these years,

383
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,299
we've been looking for the whereabouts of the demon clan.

384
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,955
Tell me. Where did you get this hairpin?

385
00:29:02,955 --> 00:29:06,360
Maybe we can find some clues here.

386
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,379
<i>This hairpin was a gift from my father to my mother.</i>

387
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:14,400
<i>I'm giving it to you now.</i>

388
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,120
<i>Sifeng, this...</i>

389
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,899
<i>This hairpin is too precious.</i>

390
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,919
<i>You should keep it well. How can you give it to me?</i>

391
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,179
<i>I gave it to you because it's important.</i>

392
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:30,180
<i>I hope that you can understand my feelings.</i>

393
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,840
This...

394
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:39,883
I bought this hairpin when I was at Qingmu Town.

395
00:29:39,883 --> 00:29:42,739
No matter what, you better not wear this hairpin anymore

396
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,434
in case your father feels sad when he sees it.

397
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,719
<i>Xuanji, where did you get this hairpin?</i>

398
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:00,599
<i>This is a carving of the Rose Gold Bird Demon.</i>

399
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,239
<i>Your mother was...</i>

400
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,580
<i>It's fine if you don't remember.</i>

401
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,899
<i>These Rose Gold Bird Demons are cruel and evil in nature.</i>

402
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,200
<i>Your father hates them.</i>

403
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,139
<i>You better not wear this hairpin anymore</i>

404
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:13,556
<i>in case your father feels sad when he sees it.</i>

405
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,740
Xuanji.

406
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,320
Sifeng.

407
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:31,955
Sifeng.

408
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,840
You were spacing out. What were you thinking about?

409
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,059
I met Aunt Yinghong just now.

410
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:42,251
I have a feeling that she is hiding something from me.

411
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:48,619
Also, Linglong wanted to tell me something about my childhood.

412
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:51,220
She even gave me a Memory Pearl.

413
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:58,099
Sifeng, can you watch it with me?

414
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:01,000
Sure. I'm here, don't be afraid.

415
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,760
<i>Hurry up.</i>

416
00:31:24,556 --> 00:31:26,680
<i>Hurry up.</i>

417
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:31,631
<i>Xuanji,</i>

418
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:34,000
<i>can you see the faraway mountains?</i>

419
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:37,099
<i>Remember. Mountains are green.</i>

420
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:38,940
<i>I understand.</i>

421
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,699
<i>Look at that flower.</i>

422
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,099
<i>- Flowers are white. <br> - I understand.</i>

423
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:47,960
<i>Mother, what color do you like?</i>

424
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,036
<i>I like the color blue.</i>

425
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:54,200
<i>- Can you remember it? <br> - I remember.</i>

426
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,860
<i>Rose Gold Bird! Xuanji!</i>

427
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,100
Mother!

428
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,240
I remember now.

429
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:22,139
I remember everything.

430
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,756
It's the Rose Gold Bird Demon.

431
00:32:23,756 --> 00:32:27,500
Sifeng! The Rose Gold Bird Demon killed my mother!

432
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Xuanji, I'm sure there's a misunderstanding.

433
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,580
How could it be?

434
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,152
I remember now.

435
00:32:43,152 --> 00:32:44,459
When I was five,

436
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:47,019
I saw my mother getting killed by the Rose Gold Bird Demon with my eyes.

437
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:49,507
Although I don't know what pain was at that time,

438
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:52,291
I couldn't eat, drink or sleep after that day.

439
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:56,395
I fainted one day and forgot everything when I woke up.

440
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:59,195
When I saw the Memory Pearl, I...

441
00:32:59,195 --> 00:33:00,747
I remembered everything.

442
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:02,939
My mother was really killed by the Rose Gold Bird Demon.

443
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:07,019
No wonder Aunt Yinghong had a big reaction when she saw the hairpin.

444
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:10,259
Can you tell me how your father got this hairpin?

445
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:13,400
Maybe I can find some clues.

446
00:33:17,984 --> 00:33:24,619
Xuanji, I only know that this hairpin was given to me by my mother.

447
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:30,700
But in this world, not all Rose Gold Birds are bad.

448
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:34,040
That might be true.

449
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:40,323
But a Rose Gold Bird Demon killing my mother is the undeniable truth.

450
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:43,139
This time, I must catch the Tianxu Hall's demon at Dianjinggu

451
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:45,399
and ask them about the the Rose Gold Bird Demon.

452
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,940
I have to find the culprit and avenge my mother.

453
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,240
Fine.

454
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,555
Master,

455
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:20,320
you should've heard what Chu Xuanji said just now. Right?

456
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,316
It's still not confirmed yet.

457
00:34:24,316 --> 00:34:28,220
Little Silver Flower, help me investigate this immediately.

458
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,120
What if I find out everything is true?

459
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,700
If that is true,

460
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,300
I will help Xuanji in her revenge.

461
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:41,720
But this is unrelated to the other tribe members.

462
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,139
I believe in Xuanji.

463
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,979
She is someone who knows what's right and what's wrong.

464
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:49,299
Master, don't be foolish.

465
00:34:49,299 --> 00:34:51,700
Although I don't agree with you being with her,

466
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,518
if you insist and won't leave her,

467
00:34:54,518 --> 00:34:57,299
I think it's better to get back the Lugong puzzle.

468
00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:00,680
It's still not too late before she solves it.

469
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,619
I get it. I know you don't want to hide it from her,

470
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:09,100
but now you have this thing in between.

471
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,979
Do you think it's wise to tell her your real identity?

472
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:14,626
That's enough.

473
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:16,390
You may leave.

474
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,980
Master!

475
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:27,019
I'm just afraid that you fell for her but ended up getting nothing,

476
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:30,620
and fell to the Loveless Curse in the end.

477
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,559
Sect Leader, are you still worried about finding the spy from Tianxu Hall?

478
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,099
Yes. There'll be a fierce battle in the Flower Session at Dianjinggu.

479
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:03,595
If we can't uncover the spy from Tianxu Hall,

480
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:07,919
there's a big chance for them to work together and steal the last spirit key.

481
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:10,760
Don't worry, Sect Leader. I have an idea.

482
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,870
The demon who fought me at Mount Buzhou

483
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,890
extinguished one of Xuanji and the group's Birth Candles.

484
00:36:15,899 --> 00:36:17,939
He left a flaw there.

485
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,800
Look.

486
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,740
This bottle holds the merman blood I went to get from Donghai just now.

487
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:27,419
Once a merman's blood leaves its body, it will become colorless and scentless.

488
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:32,199
As long as it touches Merman's Tear, it will regain its blood characteristics and turn red.

489
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:35,339
The demon extinguished one of the Birth Candles.

490
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,434
His hands will have Merman's Tear on them.

491
00:36:37,434 --> 00:36:40,459
Luckily, Merman's Tear won't disappear once it's been touched.

492
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:45,250
You mean you want to use the merman blood to find out who the spy is?

493
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,780
That's right.

494
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,040
When the Demon Whip was destroyed by Xuanji, there were 12 elders there.

495
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,899
Why don't we use the merman blood to test every one of them?

496
00:36:53,899 --> 00:36:57,970
If anyone's hand changes to the color red after touching the merman's blood,

497
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,671
then that person will be the spy we are looking for.

498
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,239
However, we have to do it in Dianjinggu.

499
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,159
We still need Valley Master Rong's cooperation.

500
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,699
Valley Master Rong was there as well.

501
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:14,386
Your plan won't work if he is the spy.

502
00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:15,666
Don't worry.

503
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:19,259
When I came back from Donghai, I went to Dianjinggu specifically

504
00:37:19,259 --> 00:37:21,379
to test Valley Master Rong with the merman's blood.

505
00:37:21,379 --> 00:37:23,139
He isn't the person we are looking for.

506
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:26,739
He has also promised to cooperate with our plan.

507
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:28,379
Great.

508
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:33,300
We have to find the spy of the demon clan no matter what.

509
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,500
My Lord.

510
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,999
I said before that you were just a dog that I picked up.

511
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:10,660
Do you remember?

512
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,199
It was etched in my mind. I dare not forget.

513
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,820
That's great.

514
00:38:19,472 --> 00:38:21,480
Come.

515
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,640
Let me see which hand you used

516
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,420
to steal my Dragon Seal.

517
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,520
I have to reward you.

518
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,195
My Lord, no.

519
00:38:32,195 --> 00:38:34,060
Don't, My Lord.

520
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,620
Is it this hand...

521
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:43,540
- My Lord. <br> -...or this one?

522
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,781
No.

523
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,820
No, My Lord.

524
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,959
You fool!

525
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,760
This arm has been dismembered with my Reverse Pulse Smoke. It will not heal.

526
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,460
You have two hours to live before your blood runs dry.

527
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,159
My Lord!

528
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:15,759
I know my crimes cannot be forgiven,

529
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,936
but Tianxu Hall needs people at this time.

530
00:39:17,936 --> 00:39:20,059
I can still contribute to you, My Lord.

531
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:23,360
I will be loyal in the future with no other intentions.

532
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,920
How can a dog who bit his master

533
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,100
be of use to me?

534
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:41,719
My Lord, aren't you planning to hit Dianjinggu?

535
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:44,339
Diangjinggu is famous for its defenses.

536
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:45,859
It's even full of traps in the valley.

537
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:50,539
You will suffer heavy casualties if you don't know the area.

538
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:54,720
Are you saying you have a way to disarm the traps?

539
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:59,147
I used to be a disciple of Dianjinggu.

540
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,071
I saw the defense mechanism map of Dianjinggu.

541
00:40:02,072 --> 00:40:03,999
Only the Valley Master has the map.

542
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,900
He would never have imagined that someone else had seen it before.

543
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:11,899
If you can spare my life, I can guarantee that Tianxu Hall

544
00:40:11,899 --> 00:40:15,280
will be able to infiltrate every part of Dianjinggu.

545
00:40:19,272 --> 00:40:23,479
My Lord, I did it once so I dare not do it again.

546
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:26,160
Please give me a chance.

547
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:35,580
What a pity to kill a dog that is good at biting,

548
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,440
but I'm still angry at you.

549
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,280
All right.

550
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:51,419
If you can save yourself, I will give you another chance.

551
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:57,320
Although the wound cannot heal by itself, it's not totally impossible.

552
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,380
Here's a fire barrel.

553
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,940
If you can burn your wound

554
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,680
with this barrel of fire,

555
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,680
your bleeding will stop.

556
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,800
Do you want to give it a try?

557
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,755
I appreciate your attitude of being cruel to others

558
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:46,947
and crueler to yourself.

559
00:41:46,947 --> 00:41:50,180
I will give you another chance.

560
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,576
You have to remember.

561
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:55,540
If you have other ideas,

562
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,460
I will have tons of ways to torture you.

563
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,240
Vice Palace Lord.

564
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,479
What's wrong?

565
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:25,819
I was ordered by the Palace Lord to find the stalactite that grows every 3,000 years in Dianjinggu.

566
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:27,235
I finally found it recently.

567
00:42:27,235 --> 00:42:31,339
I was supposed to report to Palace Lord but I can't find him.

568
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:33,360
Palace Lord is missing?

569
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:36,830
I understand. You may leave.

570
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,320
Yes.

571
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,919
That lunatic.

572
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:47,680
Besides there, where else would he be?

573
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:02,040
Hao Feng,

574
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,820
after lying here for so many years,

575
00:43:06,361 --> 00:43:08,660
it's time to wake up.

576
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,707
Spring is here.

577
00:43:10,707 --> 00:43:15,940
I've planted many peach blossoms in Lize Palace.

578
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,599
You will be very happy when you

579
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,200
see something familiar when you wake up.

580
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,059
Senior,

581
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:27,439
you've been speaking to a corpse for more than 20 years.

582
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,680
What's the point?

583
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,323
Who let you in?

584
00:43:31,323 --> 00:43:35,579
If the disciples find out that the Palace Lord of Lize Palace

585
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:39,179
hides a female corpse in the inner hall, what will they think?

586
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:41,779
Shut up! Get lost!

587
00:43:41,779 --> 00:43:43,859
Don't be angry, Senior.

588
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:45,899
I'm here to give you good news.

589
00:43:45,899 --> 00:43:49,740
The stalactites in Dianjinggu have grown.

590
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:53,016
The stalactites have really grown?

591
00:43:53,016 --> 00:43:56,739
If you can get the stalactites at the Flower Session,

592
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,979
your Hao Feng will be revived.

593
00:43:58,979 --> 00:44:02,540
She will no longer be an ice-cold corpse.

594
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,479
Hao Feng, you hear that?

595
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,375
I've been waiting so many years for this moment.

596
00:44:10,376 --> 00:44:14,199
Once I kill all those righteous sects that killed you

597
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,740
and get the stalactites, we will be reunited.

598
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:22,867
Hao Feng, be patient and wait a few more days for me.

599
00:44:24,884 --> 00:44:28,180
I will definitely give you a hand.

600
00:44:29,748 --> 00:44:31,459
Give me a hand?

601
00:44:31,459 --> 00:44:34,619
Those are some glorified words.

602
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:39,799
Don't think that I don't know the underhanded things that you did behind my back.

603
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,819
You are just trying to use me and get the spirit key.

604
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:45,220
Am I right?

605
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,180
Getting straight to the point.

606
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,771
That's good.

607
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:53,179
Let's work together at Dianjinggu's Flower Session.

608
00:44:53,179 --> 00:44:55,679
You'll get your stalactites while I get my spirit key.

609
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,880
Killing two birds with one stone.

610
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,179
I don't know what you are trying to do,

611
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:08,440
but I'm just trying to save my Hao Feng.

612
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,380
The rest,

613
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,860
I'll leave it up to you.

614
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,140
Senior,

615
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,600
we are riding on the same boat.

616
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,980
I can't wait for the Flower Session.

617
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,923
Stinky woman, didn't you sleep well?

618
00:45:42,923 --> 00:45:46,619
Flying Snake, keep your eyes peeled once we reach Dianjinggu.

619
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,640
You can't miss out on any demon, understand?

620
00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:04,940
