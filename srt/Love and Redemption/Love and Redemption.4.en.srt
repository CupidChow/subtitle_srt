00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,786
Sifeng, leave with him!

00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:48,424
Hurry!

19
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,639
- Linglong! <br> - Xuanji!

20
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:00,040
Let go of my sister!

21
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,299
Xuanji!

22
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,999
Xuanji!

23
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,119
Troublesome girl.

24
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:13,520
Linglong! Linglong!

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,680
Linglong!

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,305
Linglong and Xuanji are in trouble!

27
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:32,767
Let's go!

28
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,799
Chu Linglong, show me what you're capable of.

29
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:47,682
If you're the reincarnation of the God of War or Devil Star,

30
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:49,919
you'll be able to escape this.

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,661
If you perish under this spell,

32
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:54,542
that means you're not the person we're looking for.

33
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,740
Linglong! Linglong!

34
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,380
Try and escape!

35
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,620
Linglong!

36
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,840
Try and escape this!

37
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,600
Linglong!

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,499
- Linglong, are you okay? <br> - I'm fine.

39
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,680
I was so scared!

40
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,060
It's Senior Brother Hao Chen.

41
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,955
Sifeng!

42
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:28,559
Are you okay?

43
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,253
We're fine.

44
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,034
What about the merman?

45
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:35,459
The merman...

46
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,007
The demons took him away.

47
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:42,679
Hero Yu, I know the Lize Palace has a different way of doing things,

48
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,599
and other sects didn't interfere as well,

49
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,520
but you brought my fellow juniors to save that demon.

50
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,722
I don't think that's suitable.

51
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,477
We wanted to save him ourselves.

52
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:51,927
The merman didn't harm anyone.

53
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:53,525
He even helped us in the cave.

54
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,134
How could you pity a demon?

55
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:57,135
You mustn't have thoughts like that.

56
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:58,379
I... But...

57
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:03,420
Seniors, thank you for saving me.

58
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,336
I know my fault now.

59
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:06,384
It's fine.

60
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:08,419
Maybe the demons left some tracks.

61
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:10,159
Hao Chen, let's scout the area.

62
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,664
Yes.

63
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,840
Sifeng, did the demons really take him away?

64
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,048
Follow me.

65
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,781
What spell is this?

66
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:53,319
This is Lize Palace's spell of deceit.

67
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,069
- It can hide any scent or figure. <br> - Are you okay?

68
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,119
That's why no one discovered him.

69
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:58,980
Hurry, bring him to the riverside.

70
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,680
Are you in pain?

71
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,020
I have some medicine here.

72
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,460
Why are you laughing?

73
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,780
Why are you looking at me like that?

74
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,847
Do we know each other?

75
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,060
We don't know each other in this lifetime.

76
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,560
But now, we know each other.

77
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,660
You know how to speak?

78
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,799
You were captured by the demons.

79
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,921
What did they want to do?

80
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:44,172
The entire demon tribe is gathering at Tianxu Sect.

81
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:45,759
They're trying to find the spirit keys.

82
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,034
Spirit keys?

83
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:48,919
What are those?

84
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,399
Your sect leaders will know.

85
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,860
I don't know about anything else.

86
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,419
You mustn't speak.

87
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:59,880
You're severely injured. You need to recuperate in the sea.

88
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,650
Regarding the news that you've told us,

89
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,165
I will send an anonymous letter in order to remind the Five Great Sects.

90
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,534
Do you feel better now?

91
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,220
He's crying?

92
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,900
Their tears do become pearls?

93
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,439
If you hold a Merman's Tear under your tongue, you'll cry.

94
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,239
And only a few people know about this secret.

95
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,380
They won't find out.

96
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,960
That's great! Xuanji won't need to stay in Mingxia Cave again!

97
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,462
You can try.

98
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,259
Linglong, look!

99
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:54,280
- I'm crying! I know how to cry! <br> - Xuanji!

100
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,420
This is great. Older Sister, this is great!

101
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,059
You two sisters are so silly.

102
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:03,900
Stop mocking us. You're the silly one here.

103
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,040
He's thanking us.

104
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,380
- That's beautiful. <br> - Xuanji.

105
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,613
This is just like how I felt after I ate some sweet snacks.

106
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:21,999
It's sweet. I feel happy.

107
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,052
Sifeng, thank you.

108
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:25,966
Thank you for the Merman's Tear as well.

109
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,119
You don't need to thank me.

110
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,580
It's a gift from the merman.

111
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,663
You said that everything happens for a reason.

112
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:35,519
You accumulated good karma after you saved him.

113
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,413
And this is your reward.

114
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,296
Chu Xuanji, if you want to recover your six senses

115
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:49,839
and acquire genuine tears, you should collect the shards.

116
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,660
What shards?

117
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,316
Shards of the Mirror of Origin.

118
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:57,839
Mirror of Origin is the immortal item of the immortal, Xi Wangmu.

119
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,246
It can reveal the origin of everything in the world.

120
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:04,479
Xi Wangmu shattered the mirror and scattered the shards in the human realm.

121
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,420
Collect all the shards and you'll recover your six senses.

122
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,989
I found one in the forbidden ground.

123
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,630
And I recovered my taste.

124
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,220
Is that the Mirror of Origin?

125
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,820
Did I recover my taste because of the Mirror of Origin?

126
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,919
Only the Mirror of Origin is capable of such a feat.

127
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,399
Not only that,

128
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,459
you'll know your true identity after you collect all of them.

129
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,059
My true identity?

130
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:34,622
I'm Chu Xuanji. Who else can I be?

131
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,279
You are you, yet you are not.

132
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,900
Maybe it's for the best if you don't know the whole truth.

133
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,080
But this is your fate.

134
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,479
Chu Xuanji, I wish you luck.

135
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,380
Maybe we'll meet in the future.

136
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,159
I think the merman can swim back to the sea from here.

137
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,380
Speaking of which, I haven't seen the sea before.

138
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,360
Sifeng, Lize Palace is located beside the sea. Right?

139
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,939
How about we meet up with Sifeng in Lize Palace next time?

140
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:12,699
Sure!

141
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:15,980
Women are not allowed in Lize Palace.

142
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,058
I only know that they don't accept any female disciples.

143
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:21,793
But women are not allowed inside?

144
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:24,719
Are you guys going to stay single forever?

145
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:28,240
We won't be able to marry anyone after we enter Lize Palace.

146
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,728
Is that why everyone in Lize Palace needs to wear a mask?

147
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:36,899
But Sifeng, your mask was removed.

148
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,879
We've seen your real face as well.

149
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,580
Don't tell me the people who had seen your face need to marry you?

150
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,539
- I'm done for. <br> - Marry?

151
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:46,524
I saw your real face.

152
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:50,140
- That means I need to... <br> - Little Six, you're overthinking.

153
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,159
All of us saw his real face, you know?

154
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,619
Besides, Xuanji was the first person to see his real face.

155
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:58,308
It has nothing to do with you. Sifeng, am I right?

156
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,279
Such a rule doesn't exist.

157
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,996
It's just that...

158
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,180
I'll owe someone a favor.

159
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,611
Owe someone a favor?

160
00:12:10,612 --> 00:12:12,739
Are you talking about the merman?

161
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:14,931
- We saved him of our own accord. <br> - That's right.

162
00:12:14,931 --> 00:12:18,600
We support each other through thick and thin.

163
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,780
Father told me that favors don't matter in friendship.

164
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,461
Only loyalty matters.

165
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,769
Friendship.

166
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,759
In the past, no one told me about these things.

167
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,600
It is my first time hearing these strange thoughts.

168
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,790
Why don't you join Shaoyang Sect?

169
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,780
That way, we won't be separated.

170
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,380
Maybe we can drink in secret every day.

171
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,120
Come! Check out this amazing wine.

172
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,100
The specialty of Mount Lutai: fruit wine.

173
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,226
Since we're going to be friends forever,

174
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:55,092
let's finish this drink together.

175
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:56,824
- Great! <br> - Great!

176
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,274
Sure.

177
00:13:01,274 --> 00:13:03,003
Cheers.

178
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,799
Xuanji, don't worry.

179
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,679
We will help you find the shards of the Mirror of Origin.

180
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,499
If we train hard enough and travel around the world,

181
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:19,340
I'm sure we'll find them.

182
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,438
By then, not only will you taste the wine, you'll enjoy the fragrance as well.

183
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:25,380
And we'll be able to see a Xuanji who's afraid of pain.

184
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,995
That's right. No matter what your true identity is,

185
00:13:29,995 --> 00:13:33,264
it's fine because we know who you are.

186
00:13:33,264 --> 00:13:36,735
After I find the Mirror of Origin, I'll be able to recover my six senses.

187
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:38,860
And I will become like everybody else.

188
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,132
No matter what happens in the future, I just want to

189
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:43,567
stay together with everyone and be happy.

190
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,428
That'll be great.

191
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,240
- Cheers! <br> - Cheers!

192
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,300
Chu Linglong wasn't the person we were looking for.

193
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,479
I will try to test the others who have the same birth date

194
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,279
as the reincarnations of the God of War and the Devil Star.

195
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,004
We wouldn't need to go through all these troubles

196
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:08,109
if you all didn't lose track of their reincarnations

197
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,110
at Fenru City 16 years ago.

198
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,056
It was our fault.

199
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:14,500
Hall Master, don't worry.

200
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,470
I'll find out the location of the spirit keys as soon as possible.

201
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,170
I'll find out where the Five Great Sects have hidden them.

202
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,689
We'll save Left-Hand Lieutenant and assist you in retrieving the Divine Weapon.

203
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:27,561
We'll summon the Devil Star

204
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:30,162
and dominate the three realms once again.

205
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,239
Sifeng, if we talk about fate,

206
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,039
it seems that you have an affinity with Xuanji.

207
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,020
You two were born on the same day.

208
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,620
Even I couldn't compare with that.

209
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:48,448
Since you're twins, why weren't you born at the same time?

210
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:51,119
We're twins.

211
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,860
But Xuan Ji was a lazy girl.

212
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,010
She didn't want to come out.

213
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:58,479
She stayed in our mother's belly for another night.

214
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,329
That's why I was born at 9 at night on the fourth day of the fourth month,

215
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,380
while she was born at 1 in the morning on the fifth day of the fourth month.

216
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,048
So that's the case.

217
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,820
You're hungry again?

218
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,519
You're hungry? I'll catch some fish and cook them.

219
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,359
Great idea. I'll join you.

220
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,107
Little Six, you better catch a big fish.

221
00:15:17,107 --> 00:15:18,357
Okay.

222
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,974
Xuanji, I thought you had just eaten?

223
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:24,495
I don't know what's going on, either.

224
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,430
Isn't this the book you used when Mother taught us how to write our names?

225
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,690
You kept it with you?

226
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,362
I knew our Xuanji wasn't emotionless

227
00:15:34,362 --> 00:15:36,850
even though you couldn't shed any tears.

228
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:41,599
Mother told me to write down the names of those who are important to me.

229
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,378
Can I see who's included?

230
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,298
Sure.

231
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,599
Father.

232
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:51,919
Mother.

233
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,841
Linglong.

234
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,239
That's all?

235
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,616
Who else do you want to be included?

236
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:04,617
You can write down the name of the person you like.

237
00:16:04,617 --> 00:16:06,686
These are all the people I like.

238
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:08,292
It's not that.

239
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:10,119
I'm not talking about our family.

240
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,536
If you like someone, you wish to see him every day.

241
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:16,799
And you want to be with him at all times.

242
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,959
You'll share your secrets with him.

243
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,402
And he'll directly affect your mood as well.

244
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,805
He...

245
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,780
Linglong, do you have someone you like?

246
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,200
I...

247
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,780
I-I-I... I'll check how they're doing!

248
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,980
<i>[Chu Xuanji]</i>

249
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,060
If I like someone, I'll share my secrets with him?

250
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,769
<i>I'm so hungry.</i>

251
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:14,000
<i>Why isn't Sixth Senior Brother here yet?</i>

252
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,638
<i>Xuan Ji, this is a secret between us.</i>

253
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,841
<i>You mustn't tell anyone else.</i>

254
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,289
So, the person whom I wish to meet and share secrets with,

255
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:26,999
that's the person I like.

256
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,420
I do have similarities with other people as well.

257
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,568
Linglong said I must write his name down.

258
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,153
<i>[Sixth Senior Brother]</i>

259
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,279
Xuanji.

260
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,791
- Sixth Senior Brother. <br> - We caught many fish.

261
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,372
- You'll be able to eat soon. <br> - Okay.

262
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,531
Oh right, I picked the same gift for you and Linglong.

263
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:01,528
But seems like Linglong doesn't like it.

264
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:03,441
I'll give them to you then.

265
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,082
Maybe it's because I'm too dumb.

266
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,403
I always give her something she doesn't like.

267
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,059
Maybe it's because other people don't like me as well.

268
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,420
Not at all. Sixth Senior Brother, I like you.

269
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,719
What?

270
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,119
You're the person that I like.

271
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,580
Silly girl, what do you know?

272
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,345
Little Six, come here.

273
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:33,066
- Help us grill the fish. <br> - Coming.

274
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,113
You can cook it with her.

275
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,396
Hurry up. Hurry.

276
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,600
- Sifeng. <br> - What is this?

277
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,824
Sixth Senior Brother gave me this.

278
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:54,560
Sifeng, what color is it?

279
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,644
It's blue.

280
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,760
This is blue?

281
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,863
My favorite color is blue then.

282
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:06,360
Is it fragrant and nice?

283
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,000
It's not, and it's hideous.

284
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,509
Really?

285
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:18,849
I'll be able to feel that for myself when I recover my six senses.

286
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,023
By the way, Sifeng, we'll return to Mount Shaoyang tomorrow.

287
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:27,389
After we meet Father, I'll tell you about how

288
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:31,010
we can avoid the Torch Dragon and retrieve your mask.

289
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:36,281
Xuanji, actually, this is dangerous.

290
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:38,442
Maybe Sect Leader Chu will find out.

291
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,121
You don't need to force yourself if it's too hard,

292
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:44,659
since I didn't manage to obtain Gudiao's horns for you.

293
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:48,159
It's no problem. Friends shouldn't be so calculative.

294
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,339
I promised you I'll do so.

295
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:53,280
That's why I'll do anything to help you retrieve your mask.

296
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,668
Silly girl.

297
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,420
It was hard for you to escape Mingxia Cave, you know?

298
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,039
Actually, it's fine even if I lose the mask.

299
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,120
You don't need to find it and you don't need to return there.

300
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
Is it really fine?

301
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,029
It's fine.

302
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,647
Xuanji,

303
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,957
thank you.

304
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,625
Sect Leader Uncle.

305
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,542
Master.

306
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,619
Father, we're back.

307
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:50,080
Who gave you permission to return here?

308
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:54,381
You're getting out of control.

309
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,918
Father, please don't blame Older Sister.

310
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,239
It's my fault.

311
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:13,354
I only understood many things after I left the mountains.

312
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:16,125
It was all my fault. I was disobedient.

313
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,062
Now, I know the reason you scolded me in the past.

314
00:21:19,063 --> 00:21:20,918
You did the right thing.

315
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,799
I won't act like this again.

316
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,860
Father.

317
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,431
Great.

318
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:29,159
Good girl.

319
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,881
Seems like you understood my intentions.

320
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:33,039
My effort was not in vain.

321
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,921
I'm sure your mother would be relieved to hear this.

322
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,028
So, Xuanji doesn't need to enter Mingxia Cave again.

323
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:43,309
I feel relieved.

324
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,020
Xuanji, this is great!

325
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,075
Xuanji, you should return and rest first.

326
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:58,051
Little Six and I will send some local specialties to the other members.

327
00:21:58,052 --> 00:21:59,919
We'll find you after that, okay?

328
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,865
- Okay. <br> - See you.

329
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:03,652
Little Six, let's go.

330
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,464
Merman's Tear is useful indeed.

331
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:11,850
Senior Brother Hao Chen.

332
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,420
Don't worry. I'm the only one who knows about this.

333
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,963
Xuanji, let me ask you this.

334
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:19,004
Do you really want to train yourself?

335
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,139
In the past, I had no reason to do so.

336
00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:25,143
But after the incident at Mount Lutai,

337
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:29,140
I realized that I need to train hard to protect those I want to protect.

338
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,699
That's good.

339
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:35,059
Xuanji, actually, you're as good as anyone else.

340
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,807
If there's a chance for you to learn great spells

341
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:41,039
and become a powerful cultivator, will you grab the chance?

342
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,055
Senior Brother Hao Chen, are you mocking me?

343
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:47,559
I don't even have the right to attend the Hairpin Tournament.

344
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,820
There's no rush.

345
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:50,159
Think about it for now.

346
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,879
We'll talk about that after the Hairpin Tournament.

347
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,071
Now, we should celebrate our return from Mount Lutai.

348
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,253
<i>Sifeng doesn't want me to retrieve the mask,</i>

349
00:23:03,254 --> 00:23:05,134
<i>but I've made a promise with him.</i>

350
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,500
<i>I must keep my word.</i>

351
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,380
<i>I can't enter the forbidden ground by myself.</i>

352
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,440
<i>If I use spells, the barrier will respond to them.</i>

353
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,393
Sifeng!

354
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
Sifeng!

355
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,866
Xuanji? Why are you here?

356
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,060
I'm here to help you.

357
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,740
Didn't I tell you not to help me?

358
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,840
You'll be punished by your father if he finds out.

359
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,326
But you'll be punished if you don't retrieve your mask.

360
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:36,961
Follow me.

361
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,792
The Torch Dragon is hiding here.

362
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,900
If we alert it, it'll activate the protection rock.

363
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,660
It's fine. There's a way we can sneak past it.

364
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,220
Look. We'll use this.

365
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,339
This Lightning Baton can only teleport one person at a time.

366
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,949
But there are two of us here.

367
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,270
Just treat the two of us as one individual then.

368
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,580
Don't move. I'm going to cast the spell.

369
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,160
Look! I told you it would work.

370
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,246
Sifeng.

371
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,880
Let's find your mask now.

372
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,320
Sifeng, your mask!

373
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,920
My mask.

374
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,906
Sifeng!

375
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,902
Sifeng, it's fine. We can come again tomorrow.

376
00:25:10,902 --> 00:25:14,580
We'll find the other half of the mask and glue it back together.

377
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,180
Maybe it broke

378
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,797
while we fought the Candle Dragon.

379
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,459
The masks in Lize Palace can't be fixed.

380
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,080
Fate has decided for my mask to be broken.

381
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,700
We'll just forget about it.

382
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,240
I need to meet my master now.

383
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,260
Do you still have respect for me?

384
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,279
Master.

385
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,460
Sifeng, you were distracted by your feelings.

386
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,280
You even forgot about the 13 rules of Lize Palace!

387
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,735
You should return and receive your punishment for your mistake.

388
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,680
What a great disciple indeed.

389
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,400
Master, I've let you down. Please punish me.

390
00:26:02,035 --> 00:26:03,281
Sifeng!

391
00:26:03,282 --> 00:26:05,362
Sifeng, are you okay?

392
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,838
Xuanji, this is their internal affair.

393
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,961
You mustn't interrupt.

394
00:26:09,961 --> 00:26:13,290
Sifeng, you only said you let me down.

395
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,060
But you didn't admit your mistake.

396
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,420
Do you know your mistake?

397
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,600
I removed his mask. You should punish me instead of him.

398
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:22,760
Xuanji!

399
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,174
Palace Master, Xuanji is young and ignorant.

400
00:26:27,175 --> 00:26:29,490
Please forgive her for her rudeness.

401
00:26:29,491 --> 00:26:32,237
Did I say anything wrong? He didn't remove the mask of his own accord.

402
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:35,598
Moreover, he almost lost his life trying to retrieve the mask.

403
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,340
Sifeng's life and the mask, which is more important to you?

404
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,321
Such audacity! This is the internal affair of Lize Palace!

405
00:26:44,322 --> 00:26:46,295
You have no right to say anything!

406
00:26:46,295 --> 00:26:48,733
Xuanji, this has nothing to do with you.

407
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:50,543
Hurry and apologize to Palace Master.

408
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:52,798
Lize Palace's internal affairs have nothing to do with me indeed.

409
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,260
But he's my best friend, and I will do something about this.

410
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,841
You can't answer my questions, yet you're trying to punish Sifeng.

411
00:26:58,841 --> 00:27:01,181
I'm just trying to seek an answer.

412
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,239
I'm envious of Sect Leader Chu for having a daughter like her.

413
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,937
Sifeng,

414
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,079
this girl is trying so hard to help you.

415
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,785
I'm very surprised.

416
00:27:15,786 --> 00:27:20,340
What? Have you made new friends after only a few days?

417
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,390
Yes. In the past, I never knew what a friend was.

418
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,957
But now, I understand the profound sentiments of friendship.

419
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:34,520
What? Profound sentiments of friendship?

420
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,423
Palace Master, the other sect leaders are waiting for you for the meeting.

421
00:27:52,424 --> 00:27:54,724
Please don't delay this any longer.

422
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,594
Palace Master, please.

423
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,820
Profound sentiments of friendship.

424
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,480
Sifeng, get up now.

425
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,959
Does it hurt?

426
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,806
I'm fine.

427
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,431
Why did you try to save me from my master's punishment?

428
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:27,420
You're reckless, indeed.

429
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,420
I'm fine. I'm just afraid that he'll punish you for my mistake.

430
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,960
Si Feng, will he punish you?

431
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,559
I'll be fine.

432
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,410
Don't worry.

433
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,029
That's good to hear.

434
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,479
<i>[Shouyang Hall]</i>

435
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,615
Everyone, these are the demon collars

436
00:28:51,615 --> 00:28:55,265
that we found on Gudiao and Celestial Dog.

437
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:59,199
Besides that, we've received an anonymous letter as well.

438
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,760
It states that the demon tribe is manipulating

439
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,278
both of the beasts mentioned.

440
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,949
And Tianxu Sect is the name of the demon tribe's organization.

441
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,560
Has anyone heard of this news?

442
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,140
Tianxu Sect?

443
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,998
It doesn't ring a bell.

444
00:29:15,998 --> 00:29:18,740
An anonymous letter without any proof or evidence.

445
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,900
Sect Leader Chu, you don't need to take it seriously.

446
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,439
That's right.

447
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,135
The demon tribe was defeated in the war 1,000 years ago.

448
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:29,559
Why should we be afraid?

449
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,600
I'm sure it's only some minor demons trying to cause a ruckus.

450
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,372
There's no need for us to worry.

451
00:29:35,372 --> 00:29:39,232
I'm afraid things aren't that simple.

452
00:29:39,232 --> 00:29:43,643
If the content of the anonymous letter is true, the demon tribe

453
00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:47,884
will try to obtain the Four Spirit Keys that the Five Great Sects are protecting.

454
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,080
Spirit keys?

455
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,459
What are you talking about?

456
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,038
Has anyone ever heard of that?

457
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,102
That concerns the very existence of our sects.

458
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:59,185
I don't think we should discuss it in public.

459
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:02,660
If the content is fake, I'm afraid it would cause us to turn against each other.

460
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,460
Valley Master Rong is right.

461
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,541
In my opinion,

462
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:09,940
Sect Leader Chu, you should focus on handling the Hairpin Tournament.

463
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,002
Farewell.

464
00:30:15,002 --> 00:30:16,453
Farewell.

465
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,695
<i>[Shouyang Hall]</i>

466
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,800
I didn't expect the sects to be divided among themselves

467
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,672
after I went for my training.

468
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,357
I hope the other sects will be ready for this

469
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:40,770
and act more cautiously.

470
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:45,440
I hope I'm the one overthinking here.

471
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,459
Sifeng! Sifeng!

472
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:11,456
Why are you here?

473
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:14,719
Sifeng, why are you here? Is he still insisting on punishing you?

474
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,639
But why? I'll argue with him.

475
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,079
You mustn't. My master has a bad temper.

476
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,500
He won't let you off.

477
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,319
There's nothing to fear. At most, he'll just give me a beating. Anyway, I don't know what pain is.

478
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,820
He's too brave for his own good. He broke our rules.

479
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,596
You should consider your position before you try to imitate him.

480
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,359
He's doing this because he has a strong backing.

481
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,120
Our Lord won't let others off that easily.

482
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,020
Return now.

483
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,740
I'm kneeling here of my own accord.

484
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,945
My master didn't punish me.

485
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,380
Why?

486
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:57,801
He'll only be appeased if I do so.

487
00:31:57,801 --> 00:32:00,440
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

488
00:32:01,478 --> 00:32:05,620
Oh right, Sifeng! I brought you some dried fruit.

489
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,500
They're very sweet. Since you're doing this,

490
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,010
you should have some sweet stuff in order to ease your pain.

491
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,540
Here.

492
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,207
Is it delicious?

493
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,660
I'll take this for now.

494
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,180
You should leave.

495
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,167
Remember to eat them.

496
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,170
Look. The Hairpin Tournament hasn't even started,

497
00:32:55,171 --> 00:32:58,220
yet Chu Lei is trying to show that he's the leader of the Five Great Sects.

498
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:01,201
Don't tell me Shaoyang Sect will be the champion again?

499
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,507
Ask Shi Feng to prepare himself.

500
00:33:03,508 --> 00:33:06,423
We need to be the champion, no matter what.

501
00:33:06,424 --> 00:33:10,246
The Xuanyuan Sect should be the leader of the Five Great Sects!

502
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:11,737
Yes.

503
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,937
Follow me!

504
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,606
- Master. <br> - Master?

505
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,820
Isn't friendship the only thing you need?

506
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,533
You don't need me anymore.

507
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:46,900
I don't dare to do so.

508
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,240
I've broken the rules. I'm willing to accept my punishment.

509
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:53,629
Those who can't keep their true nature in check

510
00:33:53,629 --> 00:33:55,586
will be judged by the elder council

511
00:33:55,587 --> 00:33:58,350
and receive the 13 tortures in the Tower of Oblivion.

512
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:01,786
I'm afraid you can't endure all of the punishments.

513
00:34:01,787 --> 00:34:04,820
As your head disciple, I should be a role model for others.

514
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,652
- I won't escape. <br> - You!

515
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,440
Look at you now.

516
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,472
You are the most outstanding disciple

517
00:34:22,473 --> 00:34:25,412
I had in Lize Palace for the past few hundred years.

518
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:27,401
You said you wanted to become a role model,

519
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:30,320
but have you ever considered my feelings?

520
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,023
Listen carefully.

521
00:34:33,024 --> 00:34:35,620
I won't allow you to give up on your future.

522
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,720
You must be the champion of the Hairpin Tournament,

523
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,819
and maybe I can protect you from the elder council.

524
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:49,430
In the future, if you embarrass me again,

525
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,450
I won't let you off.

526
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,460
Leave.

527
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,767
The Gudiao has massive wings,

528
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:17,758
and its claws are sharper than swords.

529
00:35:17,758 --> 00:35:21,719
I struck it with my sword and it cried for help.

530
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,983
Sixth Senior Brother is amazing, indeed!

531
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:25,039
We'll be the champion of the Hairpin Tournament this time!

532
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,759
- That's right! <br> - We'll be number one!

533
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,981
- Right. <br> - Linglong,

534
00:35:28,982 --> 00:35:32,820
who will win if Sixth Senior Brother and Sifeng fight each other in the contest?

535
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:38,532
If Sifeng's skill level is as high as this,

536
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:42,923
Sixth Senior Brother's skill level is as low as this.

537
00:35:42,923 --> 00:35:44,831
So low?

538
00:35:44,831 --> 00:35:47,439
Sifeng is that strong?

539
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,141
Linglong, aren't you partaking in the contest as well?

540
00:35:50,141 --> 00:35:52,079
What about your skill level?

541
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,879
Mine?

542
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,620
It's around... It's as high as that.

543
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,402
That high?

544
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,017
How could you partake in the contest when you can't even hold a sword?

545
00:36:08,017 --> 00:36:10,759
- Idiots will be idiots. <br> - You called me an idiot? You!

546
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:12,415
- Linglong. <br> - It's obvious, isn't it?

547
00:36:12,415 --> 00:36:14,664
Or is it because there are too many idiots in Shaoyang Sect?

548
00:36:14,664 --> 00:36:16,805
Is that why you don't understand?

549
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:18,199
We must be magnanimous.

550
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:22,093
No matter how loud a dog barks, it will always be an animal.

551
00:36:22,094 --> 00:36:24,634
We humans don't need to argue with animals.

552
00:36:24,634 --> 00:36:27,153
- That's right. <br> - You know how to speak, huh?

553
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:29,779
But that won't work in the Hairpin Tournament.

554
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:32,239
I'll make you kneel in front of me by then!

555
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,319
We'll make him kneel in front of us in the arena.

556
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:39,319
Don't worry. I'll turn him into a tortoise.

557
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:40,791
Great!

558
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,146
Let's wait and see.

559
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,419
Look. How about that spot?

560
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:58,906
It provides a clear view and it's windy as well. It's the best spot.

561
00:36:58,906 --> 00:37:02,099
Only your amazing Sixth Senior Brother can find a spot like that.

562
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,180
I noticed that spot long ago. We don't need you.

563
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,165
<i>The Dianjing Valley Sect has arrived!</i>

564
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,426
<i>[VALLEY MASTER OF DIANJING SECT]</i>

565
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:31,131
Linglong, it's the sect of the rude Wu Tong.

566
00:37:31,131 --> 00:37:35,180
Their sect won't be the champion since they have a disciple like him.

567
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,403
The Xuanyuan Sect has arrived!

568
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,420
Linglong, why are there so few people in the Xuanyuan Sect?

569
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,146
Xuanyuan Sect was the best sect 100 years ago,

570
00:38:09,146 --> 00:38:11,887
but their sect is getting weaker and weaker.

571
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,769
And their sect leader isn't here.

572
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,080
The Lize Palace has arrived.

573
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,416
It's Sifeng's sect.

574
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,340
Sifeng! Sifeng!

575
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,287
Quiet down. They hate to associate themselves with outsiders.

576
00:38:58,287 --> 00:39:00,399
You are causing trouble for him by shouting his name.

577
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:03,699
Unlike you, he's the sect leader's favorite disciple.

578
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:06,101
Hey, Master likes me as well.

579
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,580
The Master and Madam of Fuyu Island have arrived.

580
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,779
Linglong, what is everyone staring at?

581
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,633
- They... <br> - We're staring at Madam Dong Fang.

582
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:36,794
Madam Dong Fang is the most beautiful woman in the world.

583
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,119
Xuanji, you can't tell what is beautiful and what is not.

584
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,599
Look. His eyes are popping out.

585
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,880
I... That's not true.

586
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,835
The sect leader of Shaoyang Sect has arrived!

587
00:39:51,836 --> 00:39:53,976
- Father is here. <br> - Father.

588
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,300
The Hairpin Tournament has been held for a few hundred years.

589
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:28,088
The Five Great Sects held this event every year

590
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:31,789
in order to promote justice and righteousness.

591
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:35,099
The winner of this contest will be the leader of the Five Great Sects

592
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:40,520
for the next four years.

593
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,780
Everyone here must treat this as a spar and learn from others.

594
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:50,819
If anyone here disregards the rules and harms others on purpose,

595
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:55,200
the five sect leaders will have no mercy on them.

596
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,622
The Hairpin Tournament will begin now.

597
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,260
Yu Sifeng from Lize Palace will face Tu Ren from Fuyu Island.

598
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,499
- Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng! You can do it!

599
00:41:26,499 --> 00:41:28,405
Sifeng!

600
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,612
Who's that?

601
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:34,597
Looks like he's over 30 years old. Why is he in the contest?

602
00:41:34,597 --> 00:41:36,099
That's Senior Brother Tu Ran from Fuyu Island.

603
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:38,198
My sword skills are ruthless. I won't show any mercy.

604
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:40,799
You won't suffer if you surrender now.

605
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:44,060
Senior Brother, please show me no mercy.

606
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,654
Dear, you don't need to worry. Tu Ran will definitely win.

607
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,263
Seems like Senior Brother Tu Ran is quite strong. Can Sifeng defeat him?

608
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,399
It's more than that. Senior Brother Tu Ran was the favorite candidate four years ago.

609
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:18,179
But he missed the contest because he wanted to train his Lightning Sword.

610
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:22,886
Look at the lightning contained within his sword. I'm sure he has mastered it.

611
00:42:22,886 --> 00:42:26,959
Even an experienced warrior might not be able to win against him easily.

612
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:30,280
Sifeng is facing a tough opponent.

613
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,040
- Sifeng! You can do it! <br> - Sifeng! You can do it!

614
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,902
Yu Sifeng from Lize Palace is the victor!

615
00:43:09,902 --> 00:43:13,543
- Sifeng won! <br> - This is great!

616
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,437
- Sifeng, you're amazing! <br> - Yes!

617
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:24,340
That disciple from Lize Palace is outstanding, indeed.

618
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,978
It seemed like he didn't even give his best.

619
00:43:29,978 --> 00:43:35,146
Little Six, if you face Sifeng in the future, you should just give up.

620
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:37,039
You should surrender.

621
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:39,061
My Yaohua sword moves aren't that weak, you know?

622
00:43:39,061 --> 00:43:44,315
Next round, Wu Tong from Dianjing Valley Sect will face Lin Feng from Xuanyuan Sect.

623
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:42,449
I didn't expect him to be that powerful.

624
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,340
He's too much!

625
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,927
He doesn't need to destroy the weapon of his opponent!

626
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,568
Wu Tong from Dianjing Valley Sect is the victor!

627
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:21,940
