18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,366
Thanks to Eldest Brother Liu, Ting Nu came just in time.

19
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,926
No problem.

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,183
You...

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,119
You are lucky.

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,200
I almost broke my wings

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,950
in order to act out the show for you

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,966
to make them believe that you were caught by the golden demon.

25
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,554
Don't worry, they won't suspect you.

26
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:05,520
I wouldn't have known how things would end

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,990
if Hao Chen hadn't caught us this time.

28
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:15,764
<i>Yu Sifeng, why are you here?</i>

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,995
I didn't fight but ran away after casting a spell of deceit.

30
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:32,451
They couldn't get me then.

31
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:39,510
But, Little Phoenix, I made you suffer by casting poison into your soul.

32
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,909
We had no choice in order to make sure there was no mistake.

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,639
By the way, Xuanji has a terrible senior.

34
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,319
He even tested you.

35
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,699
Luckily, the poison blocked any further test.

36
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,559
Also, we reached just in time, so everything is fine.

37
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,460
We covered it up for you.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,020
I've troubled you all.

39
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:11,519
Yihuan, you wouldn't be frank if not for my medicine.

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,700
Lize Palace really kept the secret well.

41
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,399
I thought the Rose Gold Bird tribe vanished after the war a thousand years ago.

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,395
I've never thought they disguised as cultivators and survived till now.

43
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,376
Our ancestors who survived surprisingly discovered the Dragon Crystal Seal.

44
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,719
Thus, they thought of this way to hide and protect themselves.

45
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,881
I guess the mask worn by disciples of Lize Palace has the same function?

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,813
Brilliant.

47
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:43,159
You surely are a demon who has lived over 1,000 years and even went to the heavens.

48
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,999
You even noticed this.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,044
So, you have to keep this secret.

50
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:53,081
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

51
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:56,590
But, Sifeng, were you worried that Xuanji

52
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,510
might see you so you ran out and almost got caught?

53
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,200
If you two are to stay together in the future,

54
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,550
will you keep hiding from her?

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,222
I don't know...

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,452
how to tell her.

57
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:18,199
You don't need to open your mouth.

58
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,079
His identity will be revealed once he opens his mouth.

59
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,023
How does he tell then?

60
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,783
Also, is the old guy Xuanji's father?

61
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:30,533
You saw his attitude, too.

62
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:34,676
The biggest crime is the difference of identity for them.

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,819
In my opinion,

64
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:43,122
you just keep it to yourself first.

65
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,039
Sifeng, don't think too much.

66
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,119
The most important thing now is to recover well.

67
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,610
Don't push yourself too much. Hurry and sleep.

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,300
Thank you.

69
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,799
How is it? How is Sifeng?

70
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,195
Don't worry. Sifeng has great fortune.

71
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:12,199
He also got help from Ting Nu. He has overcome it well.

72
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,839
Sifeng's heart pulse has been revived, but he fell asleep because of exhaustion.

73
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,600
Don't worry. Sifeng will recover after resting well.

74
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,559
Great.

75
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,800
Thank you, Ting Nu.

76
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,267
Father.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,759
That demon cast poison into Sifeng's soul to drive him nuts without knowing

78
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,251
so he can harm him secretly.

79
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,098
What an evil trick!

80
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:40,599
Thanks to Sect Leader Chu for sending Hao Chen

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,889
to restore the flow of energy in Sifeng's body.

82
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,502
He would have been in trouble if nobody had noticed it.

83
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:48,310
I see. The demon is evil.

84
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,870
I can't believe he escaped and we failed to kill him.

85
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,410
What a pity.

86
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,418
Ting Nu, can I see Sifeng now?

87
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:56,019
Hurry and go.

88
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,619
The room is too small for so many people.

89
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:03,481
You needn't go and just let Sifeng rest.

90
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,156
Sect Leader Chu,

91
00:06:12,156 --> 00:06:15,619
my friend from the demon clan will only save people.

92
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:18,039
He saved your disciple today.

93
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:20,740
If you mean to make things hard for him,

94
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,870
you need to go over my dead body first.

95
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,700
I'm not an ungrateful person.

96
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,046
Thank you so much for helping out today.

97
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:36,090
From today onward, disciples under my sect

98
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,039
won't trouble you unreasonably again.

99
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,959
But if you help the demons,

100
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,460
Shaoyang will fight for righteousness.

101
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,570
Our promise will be invalid.

102
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,380
He draws the line clearly.

103
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,939
Only the cultivators are righteous but not the demon clan?

104
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,906
Yihuan, stop shouting.

105
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:08,870
Little Phoenix, this will be hard.

106
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,454
Sifeng,

107
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:30,095
do you know that I've never been so scared like today?

108
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:33,177
Five of us went to Mount Buzhou.

109
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:37,300
But now only two of us came back.

110
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,164
I thought in an easy and simple way.

111
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,800
I even troubled you to bleed so much and endure severe pain.

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,139
I didn't have six senses back then.

113
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:58,390
I was envious of Linglong who would cry and feel pain.

114
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,759
But now only I know that this feeling is horrible.

115
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,490
If I could choose, I would hope that I was the one who got stabbed.

116
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:12,610
Fortunately, you got through everything.

117
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,809
You are all right now.

118
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:19,298
Sifeng, don't you worry.

119
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,286
I'll become strong.

120
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:25,723
I'll protect you and everyone whom I love.

121
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:28,100
I won't let anyone of you get hurt anymore.

122
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,510
You all will work here from now on.

123
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:54,938
You'll stay here, too.

124
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,550
You'll have to clean hard although you're cooking at Sky Hall.

125
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:00,601
What do you mean? Aren't we following Wu...

126
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,827
I mean North Superintendent?

127
00:09:02,828 --> 00:09:06,535
You just came but wish for an easy life? Just work hard!

128
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,941
Who would have known that after coming to Tianxu Hall,

129
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,932
these incidents would happen?

130
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:30,654
Ruo Yu,

131
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,835
you stabbed Sifeng...

132
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,626
He is fine.

133
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:37,054
People from Lize Palace won't die easily.

134
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:38,607
Don't worry about him.

135
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:42,631
Did you really stay in order to survive?

136
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,639
Since I know you sneaked into Tianxu Hall against your master's wishes,

137
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,285
I can't do anything as your brother.

138
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:54,086
What did you say?

139
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,279
That night, your master ordered you to sneak into Tianxu Hall to get the spirit keys.

140
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,900
I heard it all.

141
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,925
<i>Are you really willing to save Linglong at all costs?</i>

142
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,639
<i>All right, you didn't disappoint me.</i>

143
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,059
<i>But it's not only about saving Linglong,</i>

144
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,119
<i>I have a more important task to give you.</i>

145
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,119
<i>I want you to take this chance and hide in Tianxu Hall.</i>

146
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,678
<i>Find the chance to get the spirit keys and bring them back to me.</i>

147
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,439
<i>I'm foolish. What should I do?</i>

148
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,179
<i>Tianxu Hall has always been humiliating the cultivators.</i>

149
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:38,179
<i>You go to Tianxu Hall and pretend to surrender.</i>

150
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,799
<i>Show that you're willing to work for them.</i>

151
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,159
<i>Only by this, will you have the chance to stay there and find the spirit keys.</i>

152
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,355
<i>I know that you might sacrifice your reputation.</i>

153
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:52,799
<i>But for the sake of our sect and people,</i>

154
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,977
<i>our sacrifice is nothing as a man.</i>

155
00:10:57,977 --> 00:11:02,820
<i>This is also the only way to save Linglong, am I right?</i>

156
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,399
<i>I'll forever remember your advice.</i>

157
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,123
<i>Your wish is my command.</i>

158
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,679
<i>Remember that this mission is dangerous.</i>

159
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,559
<i>I allow you to sacrifice the righteous way at the critical moment.</i>

160
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,447
<i>Or even sacrificing our own people.</i>

161
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,900
<i>Only then can you complete your mission.</i>

162
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,309
<i>I won't let you down.</i>

163
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,718
Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

164
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,359
I can't let you go alone since I know the truth.

165
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,919
I'll come with you.

166
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,486
Two of us is better than you struggling alone.

167
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:53,279
Actually, you don't need to do so.

168
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,825
You're from Lize Palace.

169
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:58,279
I'm afraid your master will blame you if you do so.

170
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,559
I don't mind.

171
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,686
Getting the spirit keys is good for the mortal realm.

172
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,646
It's not too late to explain in the future.

173
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:06,714
As for stabbing Sifeng,

174
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,919
I'll let him do the same next time.

175
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,805
No, Ruo Yu.

176
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:13,999
You are so loyal and helpful,

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,199
I shall bear all the consequences and responsibilities.

178
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,976
Sifeng got injured because of me.

179
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,920
My second senior, too.

180
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,279
Minyan, don't say that.

181
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,239
You were forced to do so. You kept him alive, too.

182
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,322
Let's rescue him once we get the spirit keys.

183
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,687
You're right.

184
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,292
Since we stay here,

185
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:39,286
there must be a way to find my second senior and the spirit keys.

186
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:42,211
Then, we shall bring all of them out to my master.

187
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,461
Chu Xuanji's power now is far worse than what I'd wanted.

188
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:54,959
It can't help me revive the Devil Star.

189
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,239
If I wasn't careless and let Wu Tong take advantage at Mount Buzhou,

190
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,836
we could still have helped to revive the God of War the moment Chu Xuanji entered.

191
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,910
What a pity.

192
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,677
Please allow me to attack Mount Buzhou

193
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:14,709
and bring Wu Tong back alive in order to bring you comfort.

194
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,039
Don't ever do that.

195
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,518
Wu Tong is just a maniac who bites.

196
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:22,439
If he is irritated and destroys the spirit keys inside the Dragon Seal,

197
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,266
all our hard work will be wasted.

198
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:25,798
Don't worry.

199
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,399
He doesn't have much time left in Mount Buzhou.

200
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,060
I've got an idea on how to deal with him.

201
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,693
You just need to get ready

202
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:37,943
to get the Seven Stars Disc from the Dianjinggu Sect

203
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:40,379
and the last spirit key during the Flower Session.

204
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:41,839
Yes.

205
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,001
Please forgive me for being incompetent

206
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,580
and still not being able to break through the poison,

207
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,380
thus failing to sneak into Dianjing Valley Sect.

208
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:52,886
We can only wait for the Hairpin Tournament.

209
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,479
It's still not too late.

210
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,429
Let's make use of the Hairpin Tournament

211
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:01,559
to create bigger problems and chaos.

212
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,940
This time, I must revive the God of War.

213
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,760
Sifeng...

214
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,639
Sifeng, you're awake. You...

215
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,220
Do you feel unwell? Let me call Ting Nu.

216
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,084
Don't panic.

217
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,612
I'm truly fine.

218
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,911
Does your wound hurt?

219
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,781
I'm really fine.

220
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,527
Why do you even cry?

221
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,400
Your red eyes make you look like a bunny.

222
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,198
No way.

223
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,333
Our Xuanji has become so good at crying.

224
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,599
She can't be having the Merman's Tear in her mouth,

225
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,079
thus she keeps on crying. Right?

226
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,095
Not at all.

227
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,150
Back then,

228
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,610
I thought crying was something fun.

229
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,570
But now I only know

230
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,990
it doesn't feel good at all.

231
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,742
Sifeng, it seems that I've known everything.

232
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:13,439
So this is the feeling of loving someone.

233
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,704
My heart will ache like this.

234
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:20,226
In the future, don't scare me anymore. Okay?

235
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:22,923
Don't leave me anymore. Okay?

236
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,342
Xuanji, I won't leave you. It's all fine.

237
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,898
I'll accompany you forever...

238
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:38,466
and ever.

239
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,768
I won't leave you forever.

240
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,500
Sifeng.

241
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,420
What is this?

242
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,380
I have seen this on your body, too.

243
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,005
Xuanji, actually, I...

244
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:13,598
I got it.

245
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,280
Ting Nu gave you this to heal?

246
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,752
You're right.

247
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,800
Xuanji,

248
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,988
actually...

249
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,602
Xuanji, is Little Phoenix...

250
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,861
Should I leave first?

251
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,107
Sifeng is alive but his body needs rest.

252
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,799
Father, go back to Shaoyang with Auntie Hong first.

253
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,879
It's important to revive Linglong's primordial spirit.

254
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,180
I wanted to talk about this with you all.

255
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:20,270
Hero Yu got injured because of Xuanji.

256
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:22,799
We should bring you back to Shaoyang to recover.

257
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,679
Sifeng needs rest now. He shouldn't go anywhere.

258
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,279
It's unfitting to bring him back to Shaoyang or Lize Palace.

259
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,039
Let me stay to take care of Sifeng then.

260
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,699
Father, Linglong's primordial spirit is the most important now.

261
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,125
Hurry and go back.

262
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:38,317
Moreover, I heard from Auntie Hong

263
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:41,541
that the condition of the secret ground isn't so good.

264
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:46,351
You needn't worry about the stability of the secret ground.

265
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,460
As for the rest of you...

266
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,079
Sect Leader Chu, don't worry about me.

267
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,200
Linglong is more important.

268
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,460
Xuanji, you're a grown-up now.

269
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,923
I won't interfere with your decision anymore.

270
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,839
But the Hairpin Tournament which happens once in four years is coming soon.

271
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,999
When Hero Yu gets better, hurry and return to Shaoyang then.

272
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,657
Think thrice before taking action.

273
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:20,091
Also, remember that you and...

274
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,979
Your relationship with a friend must follow etiquette, understand?

275
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:29,580
Father?

276
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,766
I know. Oh right! If Linglong wakes up,

277
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:36,702
you must write a letter to inform me.

278
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:38,782
Only then can I be at ease.

279
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:43,279
Please tell Older Sister that we will return as soon as Sifeng recovers.

280
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,174
Also, regarding Sixth Senior...

281
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:48,350
Father, you...

282
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,940
Don't worry about Linglong.

283
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,599
Also, there's no decision made regarding Minyan.

284
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,399
He betrayed the sect.

285
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,875
It's hard to tell if he's an enemy or friend.

286
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:04,742
Bring him back if he appears, then only we will decide

287
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:06,890
in order to avoid confusion.

288
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,537
Everyone, I shall bid farewell here.

289
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,992
Sifeng—

290
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:25,919
Your father has finally left. I was suffering all that time.

291
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,942
How is Yu'er now?

292
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,212
My good girl.

293
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:36,218
Why are you avoiding me?

294
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:41,284
Do you think I am not good enough and trouble you?

295
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,679
I thought you were bullied by the people of Tianxu Hall because of me,

296
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,706
and I had caused you troubles that you didn't care about me anymore.

297
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,517
Silly girl,

298
00:20:56,518 --> 00:20:58,526
why would I dump you?

299
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:04,356
I know I wasn't good enough back then and made you feel wronged.

300
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:06,760
I wish to make up for you now.

301
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,519
I saved you not to control and chain you up.

302
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,779
I wish you can cultivate your demonic core again

303
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,569
so that you can protect yourself better in the future.

304
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,659
Father, it's my fault.

305
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:24,639
I'll listen to you and be diligent.

306
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,557
By that time, not only can I protect myself, but you, too.

307
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,648
My good girl.

308
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,080
Oh, right!

309
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,059
Thanks to Uncle Sifeng and Auntie Xuanji this time.

310
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:44,337
They saved you. Hurry and thank them.

311
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,559
I'll remember the great kindness of Uncle Sifeng and Auntie Xuanji forever.

312
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,479
I'll pray for you two to get married,

313
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,200
have children, and

314
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,500
live happily forever.

315
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,839
Why does it sound off?

316
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,174
Yu'er, I think you've got your father's genes.

317
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,053
Does it sound off? I think that's not bad.

318
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,010
Since Yu'er is cultivating a demonic core,

319
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,199
I think she needs a safe and spiritual place to stay focused.

320
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,176
What about going to our merman's place in Donghai?

321
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,574
That's great! We'll get it done immediately.

322
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:27,959
Cultivating a demonic core should delay no more.

323
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,979
Ting Nu, I'll hand Yu'er to you then.

324
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:32,169
Sure, let's go now.

325
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,519
Well, I witnessed Yu'er and Eldest Brother Liu reunite.

326
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,018
Our journey back from Mount Buzhou is worth it then.

327
00:22:44,595 --> 00:22:50,419
However, I don't think Sixth Senior is a person like this.

328
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:52,793
He wouldn't betray the sect.

329
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,836
I trust Minyan as well.

330
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:03,714
When my wound gets better, we'll find them on Mount Buzhou.

331
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:09,190
I have a feeling that there's a reason behind Ruo Yu hurting me.

332
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,787
We must bring them back no matter what.

333
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,511
Sifeng, I think my father's words make sense, too.

334
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:21,199
I must think thrice before taking action in the future.

335
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,700
I can't let you take the risk with me.

336
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,826
I must be stronger.

337
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:30,606
Then I shall find Wu Tong and kill all those demons.

338
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,638
Xuanji,

339
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,433
do you really think that all demons

340
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:42,757
are unforgivable?

341
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,168
I guess not.

342
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:51,186
Purple Fox is much better than Wu Tong,

343
00:23:51,186 --> 00:23:55,818
but I must kill all demons who do evil.

344
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,279
Wu Tong's side is guarding against us. We have no idea where the spirit key is.

345
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,839
There's no way to find my second senior, either.

346
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,699
We've looked over places like the dark dungeon and colosseums where they captured slaves.

347
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:32,353
I'm afraid your second senior might be locked up individually.

348
00:24:32,353 --> 00:24:35,060
Don't worry. Let's find other ways.

349
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,806
<i>Here! That's great! Can you do it?</i>

350
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:09,215
<i>Take it! Do it again!</i>

351
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,410
♫ <i> If you are not the one I'm meant to be with </i> ♫

352
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,008
<i>She is really good!</i>

353
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,359
<i>I didn't expect Linglong to be so good.</i>

354
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,438
<i>She is indeed good.</i>

355
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:32,450
♫ <i> Even if you never given me a bit of your love </i> ♫

356
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,600
♫ <i> Even if destiny is cruel </i> ♫

357
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,530
♫ <i> I’m willing to use all my love in this lifetime </i> ♫

358
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:48,370
♫ <i> To exchange for a last hug and kiss from you </i> ♫

359
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,980
Give me my jianzi.

360
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,360
Minyan.

361
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,599
What are you looking at? Who allows you to look at me?

362
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,761
How dare you hide things?

363
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:23,160
<i>This is for my future wife.</i>

364
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,320
<i>We are reasonable and grounded.</i>

365
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,606
What hereditary treasure is this?

366
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:33,299
What did you say? Do you recognize this dagger?

367
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,980
What hypnosis spell did you cast on me?

368
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:38,852
Minyan!

369
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:47,579
Just keep this dagger for your future wife!

370
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:50,870
All of you beat him up!

371
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:52,772
Don't go!

372
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,059
How is it?

373
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:23,979
Her primordial spirit has been revived. Her pulse is stable and life is safe.

374
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:26,203
Don't worry.

375
00:27:26,203 --> 00:27:28,265
Great, then.

376
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,660
Why hasn't Linglong awakened?

377
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,959
Extraction of primordial spirit is forbidden.

378
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,014
It's my first time using this.

379
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:41,599
I guess it takes some time.

380
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,091
Let's observe for a few days.

381
00:27:43,092 --> 00:27:46,359
I shall go through the record again to check if I've overlooked anything.

382
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,011
Sure.

383
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:50,621
I'll ask Hong Luan to send Xuanji a letter.

384
00:27:50,622 --> 00:27:53,128
She must be worried.

385
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,119
Sifeng,

386
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,622
Ting Nu said you have recovered well these two days.

387
00:28:04,623 --> 00:28:07,423
You can walk after another two days.

388
00:28:07,423 --> 00:28:12,079
I specially cooked fish porridge for you to build up your body

389
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,253
so that you can recover fast.

390
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,503
What's wrong with your face?

391
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:20,595
My face?

392
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:22,285
What's wrong?

393
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,919
Try this first. I learned from the auntie next door.

394
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,500
Try if it's tasty.

395
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,159
Not bad. It's very tasty.

396
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,639
Really? It's my first time cooking this.

397
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,519
It's almost perfect for the first time.

398
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,817
You must be talented.

399
00:28:42,817 --> 00:28:46,599
Sifeng, are you being serious to praise me this way?

400
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,679
I can't bear to try such tasty porridge.

401
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,399
Try it for yourself then.

402
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,365
Why would I lie to you?

403
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,942
It's really delicious.

404
00:28:59,942 --> 00:29:03,850
I know that my Sifeng will never lie to me.

405
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:22,875
Minyan, are you sure that the flower demon is related to Linglong?

406
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,759
Her technique while kicking the jianzi,

407
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,739
I actually amended it from Yaohua sword moves and taught Linglong.

408
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:34,159
It's impossible to kick the exact same way if she were other people.

409
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,088
Moreover, she can recognize my dagger, too.

410
00:29:39,088 --> 00:29:41,373
Is all this coincidence?

411
00:29:41,373 --> 00:29:44,019
I heard there's sorcery in Beizhou which

412
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:47,179
extracts a person's primordial spirit and injects it into another person's body.

413
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:49,494
If Wu Tong is using this sorcery,

414
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:52,910
the lady that Xuanji brought along wasn't Linglong then.

415
00:29:52,911 --> 00:29:57,158
The primordial spirit of the real Linglong is inside the flower demon.

416
00:29:57,158 --> 00:30:00,839
I'm just saying, it might not be true.

417
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,060
No.

418
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,200
What you're saying might be true.

419
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,278
Wu Tong is always cunning.

420
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,840
- Wu Tong, watch out! <br> - Minyan.

421
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,559
We're now under control.

422
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,118
You're only inviting trouble if you look for Wu Tong now.

423
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:24,150
We must carefully identify Wu Tong's flaw now

424
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,020
in order to turn the table.

425
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:32,356
Our priority is to check if Linglong's primordial spirit is inside the flower demon.

426
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,578
These fragments from the Mirror of Origin might help us.

427
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:44,079
I'll find a chance to test her.

428
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,926
Thank you for helping me to recover.

429
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:56,587
Master, how has the secret ground been lately?

430
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:59,060
The closer the two stars,

431
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,239
the weaker the barrier.

432
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,320
We can't avoid this situation.

433
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,159
However, I can still maintain it.

434
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,460
So, don't you worry about this.

435
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,706
You need to slowly clear off the poison in your body.

436
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:17,170
Don't rush it.

437
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,520
Yes, Master.

438
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,660
This is the formation of truth you asked for previously.

439
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,639
Any demons which turned into humans,

440
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,119
as long as their skin gets in touch with this formation for some time,

441
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,597
they can't help but to expose their original form.

442
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,627
Thank you, Master.

443
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,999
<i>Even the power of the Love Flower can't heal your wound.</i>

444
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,719
<i>Unless your body has the energy to oppose the energy of the heavens.</i>

445
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,959
<i>I wonder if it's because of the poison or you're actually a demon.</i>

446
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,086
<i>Yu Sifeng, I won't end this matter easily.</i>

447
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,363
You've sent Yu'er safely?

448
00:32:22,363 --> 00:32:24,466
Why are you back so quickly?

449
00:32:24,466 --> 00:32:27,340
I was chased away.

450
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,768
Yu'er said I nag too much and disturb her cultivation.

451
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:36,565
But I can't really help her in cultivation.

452
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,190
Why haven't we started eating yet? Where are they?

453
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,657
Backyard.

454
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,504
I won't push you anymore. Come yourself.

455
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,620
Walk slowly, Sifeng. Be careful of the door sill.

456
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,519
Do you feel better?

457
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,740
Don't put pressure on your wound.

458
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,062
Tell me if you're dizzy, all right?

459
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,733
I seem to be a little dizzy.

460
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:21,639
You seem dizzy?

461
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,451
Come here.

462
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,709
Do you feel better resting on me?

463
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:30,639
- I can't bear it any more. <br> - You can't bear?

464
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,662
Don't use your strength. Come on.

465
00:33:32,663 --> 00:33:34,879
Hug me tight, is it all right?

466
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,399
- Hug tighter. <br> - Tighter?

467
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,376
What about this?

468
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:40,918
Is it all right?

469
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,320
Sifeng.

470
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,000
Xuanji,

471
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,679
I was just kidding. I'm all good now.

472
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,200
Ting Nu said my condition will be as good as the past after a few days.

473
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,399
We shall stroll around the altar then.

474
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,400
We'll then catch some demons to ask about the situation inside Tianxu Hall.

475
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,320
We'll also snatch some Black and White Rings before entering Mount Buzhou, okay?

476
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:15,518
But I still feel I'm not strong enough now.

477
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,839
Do you think I should find one spirit beast, too?

478
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:26,208
You and Little Silver Flower joining hands are so much better than me alone.

479
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:31,346
If you're destined to get a skillful beast, you will be like a flying tiger.

480
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:33,619
But you can't rush this thing.

481
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:36,385
It's all destined, so do it slowly.

482
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,890
Sifeng, let's take a look outside.

483
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,919
This is...

484
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,279
Is it nice?

485
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,119
This is a way for blessings taught by the auntie next door.

486
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:04,335
Hang the wind-chime on the tree after making a wish and it will come true.

487
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,042
I hope you will be safe in the future

488
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,108
without injury and pain.

489
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,439
She also said we can write on the wind-chime

490
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,799
if there's anything we're too shy to say out.

491
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,033
Then the wind will tell that person.

492
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,920
But I have nothing after thinking about it.

493
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,814
What about you?

494
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,300
I do have something to tell you.

495
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,518
But I can't write it on the wind-chime.

496
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,868
Because this is actually a secret I want to keep forever.

497
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,209
I don't want others to see it.

498
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,794
So, I sealed the secret inside this.

499
00:36:06,794 --> 00:36:10,662
Xuanji, if you unlock this Lugong puzzle,

500
00:36:12,143 --> 00:36:13,976
you can see it then.

501
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,000
Lugong puzzle?

502
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,540
Sifeng, it seems hard to unlock this Lugong puzzle.

503
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,399
You kept the secret inside, but want me to open it.

504
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,592
Do you actually want me to see it?

505
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,386
Forget about it if you don't want to know.

506
00:36:35,386 --> 00:36:36,830
No!

507
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,960
Let me try.

508
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:47,560
<i>Xuanji, you will eventually unlock and see it one day.</i>

509
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,865
<i>At this moment, I'm being timid.</i>

510
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:58,697
<i>I'm greedy that I can't let go of this moment.</i>

511
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,879
Sifeng kept his secret inside a Lugong puzzle.

512
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,919
He is cutting off all ways for Xuanji.

513
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,081
Won't you stop him?

514
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,189
Why should I stop him? If so...

515
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:18,180
Xuanji might be the way for Sifeng.

516
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,870
So, let's not do something useless.

517
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,440
Don't think of harming Xuanji.

518
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,300
How do you know if when Xuanji discovers Sifeng's identity,

519
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,005
she won't hurt him?

520
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:31,106
There are only two consequences for this matter.

521
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:33,540
It's either Xuanji accepts him

522
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,399
and his Lover's Curse is cured so everyone is happy,

523
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,163
or they totally break up and he will die from the poison.

524
00:37:41,163 --> 00:37:44,279
- Which would you choose? <br> - Of course, I'm choosing the first one.

525
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:46,134
That's right.

526
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,660
Little Silver Flower,

527
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,239
Little Phoenix's future depends on Xuanji no matter what.

528
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,359
It doesn't really have anything to do with you.

529
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,693
So, don't be obsessive.

530
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,000
I am not obsessive though.

531
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,379
What are you doing? What are you hiding?

532
00:38:24,379 --> 00:38:26,279
- Show me your hand. <br> - It's nothing.

533
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,860
What do you mean by nothing?

534
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,760
Let go of your hand.

535
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,085
- Don't look at my thing. <br> - What is it? I want to see.

536
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,440
<i>I like you. I only have you in my heart.</i>

537
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,700
What is this?

538
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,200
What Mount Shaoyang?

539
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,841
How do I know you?

540
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,482
You saw what happened on Mount Shaoyang?

541
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,800
- What did you see? <br> - Don't touch me!

542
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,774
What nonsense is this?

543
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:11,559
What is Bazhen cake?

544
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,770
Why do I have such weird memories?

545
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,679
Bazhen cake?

546
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,580
It's really you.

547
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,456
- I've found you, Linglong! <br> - Shut up!

548
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,470
I know it's your trick.

549
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:25,504
Just you wait.

550
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:29,839
I'll surely tell Brother Wu Tong so that he will teach you a lesson.

551
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,100
You!

552
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,740
- I've been waiting for a long time. <br> - What do you want?

553
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,399
Tell me how to open Wu Tong's secret chamber?

554
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,999
- I know he told you everything. <br> - I really don't know.

555
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,919
- Let me go! <br> - You won't tell without suffering.

556
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,739
Hurry and go!

557
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,283
Be careful!

558
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,782
Little Six!

559
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,590
What did you call me?

560
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,349
Go and die!

561
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,205
Older Brother Wu Tong.

562
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,504
I didn't expect your skill of stripping the soul had improved so much.

563
00:40:43,504 --> 00:40:46,359
Wolf, our lord has yet to agree.

564
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,787
You caused trouble.

565
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:51,827
If I'm unhappy and destroy the spirit keys, is it your fault?

566
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:56,399
Don't forget that when you were lost, our lord saved you.

567
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,014
Gratitude?

568
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,294
You're nobody to teach me!

569
00:41:00,295 --> 00:41:01,995
Just you wait!

570
00:41:03,343 --> 00:41:05,646
He's surely fast at escaping.

571
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:07,970
Older Brother Wu Tong, you're here finally.

572
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,480
I was so scared. Luckily, I was smart.

573
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:13,931
Yes, you're so smart.

574
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,599
This guy is silly. He has no skills but still stood out.

575
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,079
He put in effort to save you. He has done a deed of merit.

576
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,540
You can follow me in the future.

577
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,973
Go and clean your injury.

578
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,905
Older Brother Tong,

579
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,299
my master specially prepared the Bazhen cake for Xuanji.

580
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,360
It's a unique birthday cake.

581
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,886
If she isn't Linglong, there's no way she would know about it.

582
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:51,278
But why doesn't she remember a thing?

583
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:54,603
If you say so, I have a wild guess.

584
00:41:54,603 --> 00:41:57,539
Inside the body of the flower demon might have half of Linglong's primordial spirit.

585
00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:00,900
Thus, she has a personality like Linglong, but doesn't have Linglong's memory.

586
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,020
She can only see the past through the Mirror of Origin.

587
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,279
What Xuanji and Sifeng brought along

588
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,242
was the other half of Linglong's primordial spirit.

589
00:42:09,242 --> 00:42:11,094
I'm afraid this is true.

590
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,062
After so much hard work, we were still fooled by Wu Tong.

591
00:42:16,063 --> 00:42:18,983
It's hard to guard Wu Tong, who is cunning.

592
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:22,660
But Linglong has half of the primordial spirit as protection. She is safe now.

593
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,102
We still have a chance as long as we're in Tianxu Hall.

594
00:42:25,103 --> 00:42:30,335
But we have no idea how to get Linglong's primordial spirit back all of a sudden.

595
00:42:30,335 --> 00:42:32,315
The flower demon must know something.

596
00:42:32,315 --> 00:42:34,778
She has Linglong's personality.

597
00:42:34,778 --> 00:42:36,553
If she's willing to help...

598
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:41,090
But she doesn't remember a thing about Linglong.

599
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,150
Wu Tong has a great impact on her.

600
00:42:43,151 --> 00:42:45,560
You understand her the best.

601
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,300
If you can't bring her back, then who else can make it?

602
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,220
Wolf came today. Although we don't know what happened in Tianxu Hall,

603
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,719
there's a clue that is definitely right.

604
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,540
The spirit keys are hidden in Wu Tong's secret chamber.

605
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,419
I'm sure the flower demon knows the secret.

606
00:43:04,419 --> 00:43:08,653
It will be Wu Tong's biggest flaw if she's willing to help us.

607
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:10,450
<i>Zhong Minyan!</i>

608
00:43:10,878 --> 00:43:12,519
<i>Zhong Minyan!</i>

609
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,860
How are you? Wu Tong doesn't want me to get closer to you.

610
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,640
So, I couldn't thank you just now.

611
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,239
Take this medicine. It's quite good.

612
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,679
Your wound is probably severe. I saw it.

613
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,799
I didn't expect you to save me.

614
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,255
Of course, I'd save you.

615
00:43:40,255 --> 00:43:42,429
Though you don't remember most of our things.

616
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:44,190
I don't want to hear this.

617
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:48,250
I want to repay you since you saved me today.

618
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,639
Do you want to see your second senior?

619
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,639
You're willing to bring me there?

620
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,066
You're talking so much. It's all on you whether to follow me.

621
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,919
Second Senior.

622
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,784
His wound is infected.

623
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,263
He has a fever.

624
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,335
That's the medicine I gave you.

625
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,580
Second Senior.

626
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,560
You...

627
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,999
Second Senior, it's all my fault.

628
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,459
I am so sorry.

629
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,948
But you must endure it. I'll surely rescue you.

630
00:45:14,948 --> 00:45:17,719
I'll beg Senior Heng Yang after returning to Shaoyang.

631
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,375
I shall give you my arm by using his attachment skill.

632
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,358
Silly you.

633
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:30,039
- Do you really think we can go out? <br> - Yes, we can!

634
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,677
Second Senior.

635
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,919
It has been some time here. You can't stay for long. Let's go.

636
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,335
All right.

637
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,133
I trust you.

638
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:49,767
We should go now.

639
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:51,679
- Food. <br> - What?

640
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,559
Please get him food.

641
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:55,700
My second senior is very weak now.

642
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,839
You all didn't even provide food these days.

643
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,998
It's not me who cares for him. How would I know if he eats or not?

644
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,719
Take this.

645
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,685
This is my favorite glutinous rice cake.

646
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:11,120
Give it to him.

647
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,878
- Thank you. <br> - That's not too bad.

648
00:46:13,878 --> 00:46:18,704
But your favorite isn't glutinous rice cake.

649
00:46:19,815 --> 00:46:21,733
It's osmanthus cake.

650
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,211
Senior.
