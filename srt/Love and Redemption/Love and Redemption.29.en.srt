00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,440
Are you cold?

19
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:56,458
I didn't expect the night to be so cold.

20
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,320
It doesn't feel good to be cold, right?

21
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,720
Don't go there. I won't be able to see you.

22
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,360
It's warm like this, too.

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,959
Looking at the distance, the altar

24
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,350
should be located in a forest 100 li away from the west of Qingmu Town.

25
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:45,359
We will reach there soon.

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,198
The entrance to Mount Buzhou will appear on a full moon's night.

27
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,523
Today is the 14th.

28
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:51,227
It will be the 15th at midnight.

29
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:53,520
We will leave at midnight.

30
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:04,342
- Sect Leader. <br> - Hao Chen, how is it?

31
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:06,319
Did you find Xuanji and the rest?

32
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,843
You left a note asking us to wait at Qingmu Town.

33
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:10,240
Why did Xuanji...

34
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,300
This is the closest town to Mount Buzhou.

35
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,719
They have to pass this place to go to Mount Buzhou.

36
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,850
The time is near. According to my prediction,

37
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,879
Xuanji and the rest will be here.

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,140
In that case, since Qingmu Town is big, let's split up.

39
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,079
Yes.

40
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,759
- Hao Chen, both of you, go there. <br> - Yes.

41
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,340
Junior, you will go there.

42
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,140
<i>Linglong, I will definitely save you.</i>

43
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,000
Master.

44
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,760
Master.

45
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,620
You came here alone without telling me.

46
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,780
Do you still think of me as your master?

47
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:45,460
Master, I dare not.

48
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,140
I just want to save Linglong.

49
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,320
Please forgive me.

50
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,091
But now that I'm outside Mount Buzhou, I will not go back.

51
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,540
I have to save Linglong, no matter what.

52
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:02,558
You are my best disciple.

53
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,835
You also treat Linglong wholeheartedly.

54
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:07,359
How will I blame you?

55
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,100
Stand up.

56
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:15,719
I thought you were here to bring me back.

57
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,886
Why would I do that?

58
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:19,450
Minyan,

59
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,820
when I first met you, you were only eight years old.

60
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,210
You were cold and hungry out on the streets,

61
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,650
yet you still held on to the family heirloom dagger and wouldn't sell it.

62
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,810
I knew at that time

63
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,060
that you were a strong-minded person.

64
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,800
That is why I came to find you without anyone knowing.

65
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,667
Master.

66
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:51,860
Are you really willing to save Linglong, no matter the cost?

67
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,118
Fine.

68
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:54,940
You didn't disappoint me.

69
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,443
But this is not just to save Linglong's life.

70
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:03,000
I have a more important mission to give you.

71
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,420
I will not bring shame to you.

72
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,817
Why haven't we walked the 100 li distance after walking for so long?

73
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:52,705
The road is getting steeper.

74
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:56,340
- We can't climb anymore. <br> - No. I can't wait another month.

75
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,637
I don't want to wait, either. We have to find a way.

76
00:06:58,637 --> 00:07:02,146
Ting Nu's drawing is totally wrong. It's not detailed at all.

77
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:04,319
It's almost time.

78
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,399
If the entrance appears with a full moon,

79
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,180
I think the time is not yet right.

80
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,980
Don't be anxious.

81
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,560
Sifeng, look at that!

82
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,319
The moonlight of a full moon.

83
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,759
The road lit up by the moonlight. This is the road to Mount Buzhou.

84
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,340
That's right.

85
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,839
Yan Ran.

86
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,059
Sifeng.

87
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:45,860
Wait for us out here.

88
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,580
No, I'm your spirit beast. I will follow you.

89
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,598
If you have to go in, you won't have the protection of Birth Candles.

90
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,340
You will show your true form. You can't use any spells, either.

91
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,620
Isn't that trouble for you?

92
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,412
No.

93
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,820
Spiritual transport.

94
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:19,340
Opening dark clouds.

95
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,740
Energy grows.

96
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,380
Connecting to the underworld.

97
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,960
- The gate is open. <br> - Wait.

98
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,397
Since we have a limited time,

99
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:02,318
it's better to discuss how to use our time.

100
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:03,260
What do you want?

101
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,659
Let's find Linglong's primordial spirit before saving Yu'er.

102
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,400
After that, we'll go to Fenru City to find Wu Zhiqi.

103
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,365
We'll act according to the situation at that time.

104
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:13,024
I'm going to Mount Buzhou to save Wu Zhiqi.

105
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:14,260
Do you think I will delay you?

106
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,000
Fine. Let's move separately and not interfere with each other.

107
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:22,020
Let's light our candles.

108
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,640
I'll keep it, so I won't lose it.

109
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,760
Let's go.

110
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,420
Xuanji, Minyan.

111
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,301
- Master. <br> - Don't go in.

112
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,360
Listen to me.

113
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,179
Father, I have to disobey you.

114
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,420
I must go to Mount Buzhou.

115
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,900
Xuanji, no matter what you are thinking,

116
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,367
I'm begging you to think about the oath that you made when you left the sect.

117
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,851
I won't forget about the oath.

118
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,518
I will not change my mind, either.

119
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,500
Foolish children. You are gambling with your life.

120
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,079
I've made my decision. I promise to come back safely.

121
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,045
Father. Senior. Take care.

122
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,760
Xuanji!

123
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,600
Master.

124
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:09,120
Take care.

125
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,260
What is this place?

126
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,750
This is outside the mountain.

127
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,350
We've been shifted here.

128
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,190
Let's split up to find a way to go to the altar.

129
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,379
But now that the Birth Candles are lit. All of them went in to Mount Buzhou.

130
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:43,100
We have to be careful.

131
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,799
If we extinguish the candles rashly, they will be expelled by Mount Buzhou's law.

132
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,771
They will be in danger if that happens.

133
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:50,639
You are right.

134
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,280
Our main focus is to be quick on bringing them back safely.

135
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,160
Is this Mount Buzhou?

136
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,480
<i>You fools!</i>

137
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,800
<i>Your direction is wrong. Turn around!</i>

138
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,845
Mount Buzhou is reversed from the mortal realm.

139
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:25,780
Hurry and change our direction.

140
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,210
Look at you. Making such a mess in the air.

141
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,260
Useless.

142
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:46,340
This is Mount Buzhou.

143
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,300
So, this is how Mount Buzhou that connects the three realms looks.

144
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,801
As expected. I thought Tianxu Hall would be hiding somewhere in Mount Buzhou.

145
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:01,260
Seems like the Demon Citadel wasn't totally destroyed.

146
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,846
It became a chaos void that lingers on Mount Buzhou instead.

147
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:07,759
The demonic aura fills the shadows.

148
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,742
I think no one dares to get close except for demons.

149
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:13,584
No wonder Tianxu Hall placed their hideout here.

150
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,147
Normal people cannot enter easily.

151
00:13:15,147 --> 00:13:18,820
This demonic aura will surely increase the power of the demon clan.

152
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,440
We have to be very careful when we go in.

153
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,051
Defeating Tianxu Hall is your problem.

154
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:29,860
Look along the shadows if you want to find Tianxu Hall.

155
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,380
I'm going to Fenru City to save Wu Zhiqi.

156
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,460
Fenru City?

157
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,982
Oh. Remember not to use spells here.

158
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:42,700
Otherwise, you will be discovered by Shen Shu and Yu Lu who guard this place.

159
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,999
Don't say that I didn't remind you.

160
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,119
All right. Farewell.

161
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,580
You're leaving just like this?

162
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:53,350
Didn't you say I'm wasting your time if we stick together?

163
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:56,220
Why don't we split up then?

164
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,500
Do you want to stick together?

165
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,000
You have to be careful over there.

166
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,200
Look!

167
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,240
Shen Shu and Yu Lu?

168
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,319
It's bad. I forgot. It's the seventh month.

169
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:27,359
What's wrong with the seventh month?

170
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,874
Inside Fenru City, fallen gods who fail trials, unruly beasts

171
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,668
and all the demons are locked inside.

172
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:37,979
Every 15th of the seventh month, Shen Shu and Yu Lu will let them out of Fenru City.

173
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:40,320
Today is the 15th of the seventh month.

174
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,939
The numbers of fallen gods and spirit beasts are too big.

175
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:50,214
They've been locking them up since hundreds of years ago.

176
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:52,420
That's a given.

177
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,039
All right. Enough talking.

178
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,140
Remember. Never use your spells here.

179
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,998
Those who enter with Birth Candles will have their power weakened.

180
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,119
Don't get me involved in your troubles.

181
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,900
I won't be able to save you.

182
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,162
All right. I'll be leaving.

183
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:18,120
Let's go.

184
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,713
Whatever.

185
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:22,800
I will find Wu Zhiqi once I reach the bottom.

186
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,620
Purple Fox?

187
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,880
Wu Zhiqi!

188
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,960
Wu Zhiqi! Where are you?

189
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,440
Wu Zhiqi!

190
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,760
Wu Zhiqi!

191
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,480
Where are you?

192
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,701
Wu Zhiqi! Where exactly are you?

193
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,880
Who is it?

194
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,101
Someone's coming.

195
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:34,200
After a thousand years, someone is finally coming to see me!

196
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,430
Wu Zhiqi.

197
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,200
Pretty lady.

198
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,620
♫ <i> My hair turns white from yearning </i> ♫

199
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,970
♫ <i> Hope as little as dropping off the cliff </i> ♫

200
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:18,170
♫ <i> My prayers withered as flowers at the end of the show, let fate incite this mortal love affair yet firmly suppressing it </i> ♫

201
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,580
I finally found you.

202
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,999
Pretty lady, don't cry. Why are you crying?

203
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,439
Am I dreaming?

204
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,610
I didn't talk for more than a thousand years.

205
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,020
I don't know how to speak anymore.

206
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,020
Pretty lady. Here. Pretty lady.

207
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,538
Pretty lady, why are you crying?

208
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:41,820
Don't cry.

209
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,420
Did my look scare you?

210
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,270
Is this better?

211
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:49,811
Pretty lady, how old are you?

212
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:52,160
Are you single?

213
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,020
Stupid monkey,

214
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,380
I finally found you.

215
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,100
It's been more than a thousand years.

216
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:11,100
You've suffered.

217
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,980
♫ <i> Yet fate sealed up your eyes </i> ♫

218
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,159
This...

219
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,040
Pretty lady, you're just going to touch me?

220
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,534
Pretty lady, we're not in a hurry.

221
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:27,050
Let's take it slow.

222
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,220
Why don't we chat over a drink?

223
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,540
I scolded Shen Shu and Yu Lu for 300 years to get this wine cup.

224
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,880
Hold it carefully. Let's drink.

225
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,943
Oh. Grapes.

226
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:46,240
Pretty lady, here, have some grapes.

227
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Stupid monkey,

228
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,639
calm down.

229
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,220
Let me take a look at you.

230
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,200
What did you call me?

231
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,829
Darn monkey.

232
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:03,261
Stupid monkey.

233
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:04,907
What do you think I will call you?

234
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:06,880
You know me?

235
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,989
Why wouldn't I know you?

236
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:11,380
This...

237
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,600
You don't remember me?

238
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,840
You don't know who I am?

239
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,666
Look closely.

240
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,600
It's me.

241
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,300
We didn't know each other, right?

242
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,120
I know. Pretty lady, we've met in your dreams. Right?

243
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,966
Stupid monkey,

244
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:43,204
I've been waiting and looking for you for more than a thousand years.

245
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:44,912
Can't you recognize me?

246
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,220
I am...

247
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,900
Pretty lady.

248
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,580
Pretty lady!

249
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,420
Wu Zhiqi!

250
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:19,125
- Linglong? <br> - Xuanji, what's wrong?

251
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:21,200
I just saw...

252
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,340
Am I mistaken?

253
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,200
Look!

254
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,440
- Purple Fox? <br> - Why did Purple Fox come out?

255
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,460
- Danger! <br> - No! Xuanji, don't use spells.

256
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,340
- Xuanji! <br> - Xuanji!

257
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,620
- You will be discovered. <br> - No!

258
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,879
Don't mind me. You will be discovered if you use spells.

259
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:12,620
No way!

260
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,220
Don't mind me!

261
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,900
Purple Fox!

262
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,120
Xuanji! Xuanji.

263
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,915
<i>Who is it?</i>

264
00:22:45,915 --> 00:22:49,400
It's bad. Let's hide. Come on!

265
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,592
Who dares to enter the forbidden land of Fenru City?

266
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:01,740
You can't hide!

267
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,100
By the Heavenly Emperor's orders,

268
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,079
Fenru City is the place of punishments for the three realms.

269
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,020
Trespassers will be killed!

270
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,480
You are all mortals! Accept your punishment!

271
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,075
Dingkun, the godly sword?

272
00:23:26,075 --> 00:23:27,828
It's the God of War.

273
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:28,959
You know me?

274
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,945
Both of us have been guarding Fenru City for more 10,000 years.

275
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:33,677
The God of War was punished for nine lives and came by here.

276
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,820
Of course, we know you.

277
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,547
God of War should be currently punished in the mortal realm.

278
00:23:37,547 --> 00:23:38,940
Why did you trespass Fenru City?

279
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,123
I'm not the God of War. I am Chu Xuanji.

280
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:43,781
My sister's primordial spirit was captured. I'm here to save her.

281
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:45,400
We don't care about your name in the mortal realm.

282
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,182
You will always be the God of War. How dare you break the laws of gods

283
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:49,879
before you clear your own crimes?

284
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,540
God of War, are you trying to enrage the heavens again?

285
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,759
This is our duty.

286
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,725
No matter where you come from, you'd better return obediently.

287
00:23:59,726 --> 00:24:01,079
It will add to your crimes, otherwise.

288
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,620
We don't mind killing another god with the Zhuxie and Qumo swords.

289
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,760
Don't scare me with the heavens. I said I'm not the God of War.

290
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,549
Also, don't punish me for crimes that I've never heard of.

291
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:14,080
I'm here to save my older sister.

292
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:15,319
No one can stop me.

293
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,005
God of War is unmatched in the heavens.

294
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:21,020
Unfortunately, this is our turf.

295
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,746
You used illegal ways to trespass Mount Buzhou.

296
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:26,980
You don't even have 10% of your power.

297
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,000
Let us battle with the God of War.

298
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,340
Xuanji! Be careful!

299
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,170
Keep your spells and they won't see us.

300
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,500
Let's go.

301
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,720
- Where did they go? <br> - Where are they?

302
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,630
Sifeng. Xuanji. How are you?

303
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,667
We are fine.

304
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,700
Where are you? Come out!

305
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,220
Zhuxie and Qumo were shattered.

306
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,180
We can't locate them.

307
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,197
It's time. Fenru City's gate is opening.

308
00:25:12,198 --> 00:25:13,550
We have to go back.

309
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:16,200
Don't let me catch you again!

310
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,524
Purple Fox.

311
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:34,720
Purple Fox won't...

312
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:40,371
Purple Fox said it was worth it

313
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:43,182
to devote everything to a person she likes.

314
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:46,719
She did her best for Wu Zhiqi.

315
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,440
I believe she won't have any regrets.

316
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,199
If I meet Wu Zhiqi one day,

317
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,480
I will definitely tell him what she did for him.

318
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,522
He should know.

319
00:25:58,522 --> 00:26:00,558
After getting along on the way,

320
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,160
she was really not as bad as I imagined.

321
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,163
She was actually a genuine person who didn't mind sacrificing herself.

322
00:26:07,163 --> 00:26:10,556
I wanted to find a chance to reconcile.

323
00:26:10,557 --> 00:26:12,320
Unfortunately...

324
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,014
Let's not be sad for now.

325
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,302
A section of the Time Bracelet is lost again.

326
00:26:25,303 --> 00:26:28,280
We won't make it if we delay any longer.

327
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,598
The area below the Shadow Citadel that Purple Fox told us is big.

328
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,684
We have to find the location of Tianxu Hall.

329
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:36,240
Let's go.

330
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,145
- Did we beat the God of War? <br> - Of course.

331
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:44,748
When I said that her power is weakened,

332
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:48,840
it was just to embolden me. I didn't expect to be right.

333
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,979
Perhaps our powers have increased recently.

334
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,638
We have to talk about it in the heavens next time.

335
00:26:57,638 --> 00:27:00,000
Let's piss the Four Sacred Beasts off.

336
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,260
I'm still alive.

337
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,620
I'm still alive?

338
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,699
The candle.

339
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,300
Who touched my Birth Candle?

340
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,658
Who extinguished my Birth Candle?

341
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:54,842
I will kill him!

342
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:57,380
You sound confident.

343
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,587
You've lived a good fox life and lived well, too.

344
00:28:01,587 --> 00:28:04,900
You weren't dead after being beaten by Shen Shu and Yu Lu.

345
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,446
You did that?

346
00:28:07,446 --> 00:28:09,126
It was me indeed.

347
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:11,040
Was it fun?

348
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,919
It's been so long. Do you like the surprise?

349
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,940
Who are you?

350
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,586
It's you?

351
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:33,780
Yuan Lang, you didn't die!

352
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,350
How can I die when my brother, Wu Zhiqi, is still alive?

353
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:39,441
Nonsense.

354
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:41,821
Aren't you ashamed to speak of him?

355
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:44,171
Why are you still so fierce?

356
00:28:44,171 --> 00:28:46,199
You didn't change after so long.

357
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,084
I spent so much effort to build Tianxu Hall

358
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:52,362
just to save my brother, Wu Zhiqi.

359
00:28:52,362 --> 00:28:55,860
You were the one who built Tianxu Hall?

360
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,980
Yes.

361
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,460
I spent so much effort to save your Wu Zhiqi.

362
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,165
How could you interfere with me all the time?

363
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:06,639
Stop pretending.

364
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,120
If it weren't for you,

365
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,799
did you think Wu Zhiqi would end up in Fenru City?

366
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,340
You were just trying to get the Divine Weapon on him!

367
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,780
Little Fox,

368
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,680
you know many things.

369
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,967
Take a guess then.

370
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:27,100
What will I do to you next?

371
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,515
Now, all of you will know that

372
00:29:57,515 --> 00:30:01,079
Mount Buzhou is a place that's hard to enter

373
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,700
and even harder to leave.

374
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,940
Why is one Birth Candle missing?

375
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,480
A demon?

376
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,198
Demonic aura.

377
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:37,240
Who are you?

378
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,279
Xuanji,

379
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,501
aren't you curious about what Shen Shu and Yu Lu

380
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:18,239
told you, about committing crimes?

381
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,613
They are talking about the God of War, not me.

382
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:24,744
Furthermore, the heavens are so secretive.

383
00:31:24,744 --> 00:31:27,857
Even the God of War's memories are sealed.

384
00:31:27,857 --> 00:31:31,454
Why should I care about crimes I don't even know of?

385
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:34,499
Also, I have something important that I need to do now.

386
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:37,620
I have to save Linglong and

387
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,160
be together with you.

388
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,400
Oh, Sifeng.

389
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,488
Why do you think powerful gods like Shen Shu and Yu Lu

390
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:53,240
don't even know about Tianxu Hall's demon entering here?

391
00:31:53,240 --> 00:32:00,480
Tianxu Hall must have some spells or objects to hide their own identity.

392
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:04,278
The Black and White Ring?

393
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,418
Maybe.

394
00:32:05,418 --> 00:32:07,059
There's not even a rat here.

395
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,051
Maybe Tianxu Hall might not be here after all?

396
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:10,419
How could that be?

397
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:13,120
But I'm sure I saw...

398
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:16,206
Was I really mistaken?

399
00:32:16,206 --> 00:32:18,919
Since we're already here, we might as well believe that it's here.

400
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,700
- Let's find again. <br> - Let's go.

401
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,333
What should we do? We're running out of time,

402
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:35,780
but we still have nothing.

403
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,620
By the looks of it, is there a vision-blocking barrier around?

404
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,800
They are Xuanyuan Sect's disciples.

405
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,300
It's Linglong.

406
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,460
Why is Linglong here?

407
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,740
Look out!

408
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,640
Go there!

409
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,019
Linglong, are you all right?

410
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,453
Are you all right, Linglong?

411
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:32,520
Why are you here? Were you abducted?

412
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,919
You've recovered. You can move.

413
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,018
Are you really recovered, Linglong?

414
00:33:35,018 --> 00:33:37,439
What are you doing? Let me go.

415
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,125
- Linglong. <br> - Let me go.

416
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:40,680
Linglong.

417
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:44,984
Sifeng, what are you doing?

418
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:47,140
Where did you come from?

419
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,140
Linglong, you don't recognize us?

420
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,565
I'm telling you. I will slit his throat if you move closer.

421
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,479
Linglong, what are you doing?

422
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,799
- Linglong, what's wrong with you? <br> - I said not to move!

423
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,879
Linglong, I am Minyan.

424
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:03,221
I am Little Six.

425
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:05,439
Why do all of you know my name?

426
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,966
Are you the new human slaves?

427
00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:09,519
Human slaves?

428
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,639
Linglong, look closer. It's us.

429
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,084
If you aren't slaves, then you must be spies.

430
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,839
- You want to abduct me. <br> - We are here to save you.

431
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,499
What's going on?

432
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,564
Linglong, we grew up and practiced together.

433
00:34:21,565 --> 00:34:23,920
We caught Quru Bird and killed the Gudiao together.

434
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:26,022
You call me Little Six. You like to argue with me.

435
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,510
You like to force me to eat your dishes. Can't you remember anything?

436
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:30,446
I don't know what you're talking about.

437
00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:34,320
But it feels like... It feels like...

438
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,959
Linglong, I am your sister, Xuanji.

439
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,119
We are the closest people around you. Let go of Sixth Senior now.

440
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,880
All of you must be lying. Fine. I'll teach you a lesson.

441
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,220
Why don't we release her?

442
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,470
Minyan, don't be rash.

443
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:03,960
Something fishy is going on. Let's decide after we can be sure.

444
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,362
I've warned you. You better let me go.

445
00:35:07,363 --> 00:35:10,639
If Older Brother Tong comes back, he will definitely make you suffer.

446
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,719
Older Brother Tong?

447
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,222
- Don't tell me it's... <br> - Of course, it's Older Brother Wu Tong.

448
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:16,639
He is Tianxu Hall's most handsome

449
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,159
and powerful North Superintendent. Feeling afraid now?

450
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,600
You call him Older Brother Wu Tong?

451
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,839
Did you forget how Wu Tong treated you?

452
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,999
How dare you talk bad about Older Brother Wu Tong. I'll kill you!

453
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,739
What's going on, Linglong?

454
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:30,639
She keeps protecting Wu Tong. Don't tell me that

455
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,659
it was Wu Tong who abducted Linglong from Fuyu Island?

456
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:35,679
Besides the few seniors from Shaoyang,

457
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,799
the other sect leaders should still be on Fuyu Island.

458
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,109
It was impossible for Wu Tong to abduct Linglong.

459
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,440
Perhaps she isn't Linglong at all.

460
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,020
Here. Get up.

461
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:54,558
Please tell us honestly.

462
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,549
How did Miss Linglong come to Tianxu Hall?

463
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,039
I am just a human slave

464
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,062
who got picked to play with Miss Linglong half a month ago.

465
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:03,053
Half a month ago?

466
00:36:03,054 --> 00:36:05,262
Linglong was with us at that time.

467
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,077
I smelled a demonic scent.

468
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:10,229
I thought it came from Xuanyuan Sect's disciples initially.

469
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,399
Now that I smell clearly, it's her!

470
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,120
She isn't Linglong but a demon!

471
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,339
Impossible.

472
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:21,540
This is Linglong.

473
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,159
That's right. Linglong has a mole on her right wrist.

474
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,100
What are you doing? Let go of me!

475
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,820
It's really not there.

476
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,056
You are a demon. Who are you?

477
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:34,619
Why do you look exactly like Linglong?

478
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,989
Let me tell you! Older Brother Wu Tong loves me dearly.

479
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,410
If you still won't release me,

480
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:40,213
Older Brother Wu Tong will teach you a lesson when he returns!

481
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:43,600
- You– <br> - Minyan.

482
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,879
Minyan, this demon doesn't know a lot.

483
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,934
If we want to know the truth, we still have to enter Tianxu Hall.

484
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:56,598
Yes. Isn't that our goal of coming to Mount Buzhou?

485
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:59,342
Linglong doesn't have much time left. We have to think of a way quickly.

486
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,520
Don't worry. I have an idea.

487
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,720
Little Silver Flower.

488
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,199
What is this?

489
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,039
Take us to Tianxu Hall.

490
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,940
- Forget it! <br> - Forget it?

491
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,910
Little Silver Flower is extremely venomous.

492
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:18,944
If you don't agree, it's not very patient and will bite you.

493
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:23,240
You will immediately become a green venomous corpse.

494
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,005
This is the place.

495
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:36,917
Here? We came here before.

496
00:37:36,918 --> 00:37:38,840
Where is the entrance?

497
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,239
All right. You are here. I'll be leaving.

498
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,899
Hold on. Where is Linglong's primordial spirit?

499
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:09,410
Are you mad? Of course, it's with me.

500
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,860
You...

501
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,039
Aren't you killing me if you want Linglong's primordial spirit?

502
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,380
All of you are mad! What do you want anyway?

503
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,165
Wait. Don't bite her.

504
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:29,520
By the looks of it, she really doesn't know.

505
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,214
What should we do?

506
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:41,065
If you don't know about the primordial spirit,

507
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:43,190
do you know where Shaoyang Sect's Second Senior

508
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:44,579
is being locked up?

509
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:47,502
There's also a demon spirit. I'm sure you know about that.

510
00:38:47,503 --> 00:38:49,178
Shaoyang Sect?

511
00:38:49,178 --> 00:38:51,559
There are so many people. Why would I know?

512
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:57,104
But there's indeed a demon spirit called Yu'er or something.

513
00:38:57,104 --> 00:38:59,926
Yes. It's Yu'er. Where is she now?

514
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:01,560
Fine. I'll bring you there.

515
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:02,999
You have to release me.

516
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,359
Bring us to Yu'er first, and Second Senior later.

517
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,421
We'll talk about releasing you after that.

518
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:10,060
Let's go!

519
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,639
Miss Linglong, why did you come to the dark dungeon?

520
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,789
Why do you care if Older Brother Wu Tong doesn't?

521
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,900
Can't I bring my friends here? Get lost!

522
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,260
Open the door.

523
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,900
Get lost.

524
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,200
Yu'er, it's you.

525
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,368
- Save me! <br> - We will save you immediately.

526
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,359
It's fine now.

527
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,273
I won't be naughty anymore.

528
00:39:49,274 --> 00:39:53,474
I will listen to Old Fogey next time, and not play with these bad demons.

529
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,360
I'm bringing you back to your father now.

530
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,830
Be careful! She isn't Linglong.

531
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:02,999
She is a flower demon.

532
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,100
Don't be fooled by her.

533
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,679
I'm a flower demon and Linglong. What are you talking about?

534
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,123
You mistook me for someone else. Now, you say that I am not Linglong.

535
00:40:11,123 --> 00:40:14,059
Do you think there are two identical Linglongs in this world?

536
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:16,260
I'm not talking to you anymore.

537
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,873
Yu'er, have you seen or heard of any secrets around when you were here?

538
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:27,680
A place where Wu Tong never let anyone close.

539
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,345
I think it's Wu Tong's bedroom.

540
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:33,086
No one is allowed to enter beside this flower demon.

541
00:40:33,086 --> 00:40:36,552
I even heard that Wu Tong killed a small demon who entered

542
00:40:36,552 --> 00:40:38,520
without notifying anyone.

543
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,499
Linglong's primordial spirit must be in Wu Tong's bedroom.

544
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:45,138
Primordial spirit? There are indeed many of them there.

545
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:47,746
When Wu Tong used me to threaten Old Fogey,

546
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,779
- he brought me inside. <br> - What primordial spirit?

547
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:52,840
But I don't know if Linglong's primordial spirit is there.

548
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,615
- Bring us to Wu Tong's bedroom. <br> - You are really greedy.

549
00:40:56,615 --> 00:40:58,019
Didn't you agree to release me?

550
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:01,180
If you cooperate with us, we will definitely not harm you.

551
00:41:02,455 --> 00:41:04,873
Yu'er, hide your body, and follow us.

552
00:41:04,873 --> 00:41:07,040
Don't let anyone find out.

553
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,399
There are so many of them.

554
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,640
Which one is Linglong's?

555
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,760
The primordial spirits here are all the same.

556
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,210
We can't even differentiate which is which.

557
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,530
Linglong!

558
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,922
Can you hear me?

559
00:41:51,922 --> 00:41:53,820
Can you answer me?

560
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,019
What should we do?

561
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:00,745
Why don't we bring all these primordial spirits back?

562
00:42:00,745 --> 00:42:02,642
I'm sure my father will find it.

563
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:05,860
Let's do that. We can't be here for long.

564
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,091
Linglong!

565
00:42:33,091 --> 00:42:35,440
Linglong! Linglong!

566
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,620
It's Linglong's primordial spirit.

567
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,300
Older Brother Tong.

568
00:42:40,013 --> 00:42:41,700
Older Brother Tong.

569
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,180
The thing you're looking for is with me.

570
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,913
Old friends visiting me at Tianxu Hall, don't you have to inform me?

571
00:42:52,913 --> 00:42:56,019
How dare you be rude and search my place.

572
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:59,099
Just tell me if you want to find anything.

573
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:01,979
Linglong. Linglong's primordial spirit...

574
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,959
Calm down. This might not be Linglong's primordial spirit.

575
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,259
He is trying to provoke you.

576
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:08,499
Wu Tong, you've already got the spirit keys.

577
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:09,739
What do you still want?

578
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:12,000
Return Linglong's primordial spirit to us!

579
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,471
Linglong is only worth a few spirit keys in your eyes?

580
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:21,780
In that case, it's better if you serve me by my side.

581
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,560
- What do you think, Linglong? <br> - Shut up!

582
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,699
She is not Linglong.

583
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:28,739
I won't allow you to call her Linglong!

584
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,185
How is it?

585
00:43:30,185 --> 00:43:32,554
Is the Linglong I made lifelike?

586
00:43:32,554 --> 00:43:34,979
Did I confuse all of you, too?

587
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,782
Older Brother Wu Tong, what are you saying?

588
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:39,160
Why don't I understand you?

589
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,200
- Linglong. <br> - Shameless.

590
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,280
So, didn't you say you want to rescue Linglong?

591
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,277
Fine. I'll grant your wish.

592
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:57,689
- You can take Linglong. <br> - Older Brother Tong, what are you doing?

593
00:43:57,689 --> 00:44:00,240
I want to stay by your side.

594
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,580
Now what?

595
00:44:05,758 --> 00:44:08,007
I had my eyes on Chu Linglong a few years ago.

596
00:44:08,007 --> 00:44:11,537
Surprisingly, Linglong belongs to me now.

597
00:44:11,537 --> 00:44:13,720
I can't even chase her away.

598
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,870
Stop dreaming.

599
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:20,981
Linglong will not like someone like you.

600
00:44:20,982 --> 00:44:22,270
No.

601
00:44:22,271 --> 00:44:24,479
Someone who's neither a human nor a demon.

602
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,633
You should know clearly that you will never capture Linglong's heart.

603
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:33,719
That is why you found this flower demon to fool yourself.

604
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,557
What a joke.

605
00:44:35,558 --> 00:44:39,140
You are a joke and a pitiful person.

606
00:44:41,236 --> 00:44:42,177
Sixth Senior!

607
00:44:42,177 --> 00:44:45,720
If you dare move, I will smash his head with this.

608
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,120
Even if you kill me, you will still not get Linglong forever.

609
