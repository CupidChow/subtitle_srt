Brother Tong!

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,930
If you dare hurt Minyan,

20
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,204
then I'll kill your beloved flower demon.

21
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,210
She's just a flower demon. You can take her life.

22
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,113
If I can create one Linglong,

23
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,998
then I can create many copies of her.

24
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:59,160
Brother Tong, save me!

25
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,599
Sixth Senior!

26
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,210
This is bad! Our Birth Candles were used up!

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,940
You know how to enter this place by using that item?

28
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,563
You are quite capable as well.

29
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:22,519
It's a pity that you don't have much time.

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,885
Now, half of your soul is in Mount Buzhou

31
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:26,433
while half of it is in the human realm.

32
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,810
Let me see how much power you have left.

33
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,436
Take them down!

34
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:05,907
<i>This demon actually has a malignant aura?</i>

35
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:07,734
<i>It has tremendous power.</i>

36
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:09,825
<i>It isn't an ordinary demon.</i>

37
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,539
<i>He's aiming for Xuanji,</i>

38
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,896
<i>but he didn't extinguish Xuanji's Birth Candle.</i>

39
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:18,167
<i>What is he plotting?</i>

40
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,157
Stop!

41
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,912
Let's stop fighting.

42
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,694
I admit my defeat.

43
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,875
Sixth Senior?

44
00:04:33,117 --> 00:04:34,748
We don't have much time.

45
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:36,426
I want to exchange conditions with you.

46
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:38,434
Tianxu Hall wants the spirit keys, right?

47
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:40,919
As long as you're willing to give me Linglong's primordial spirit,

48
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,746
I'm willing to betray the Five Great Sects

49
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,897
and become your subordinate in Tianxu Hall.

50
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,623
I'll help you obtain all the spirit keys.

51
00:04:46,623 --> 00:04:49,359
No! Sixth Senior, you mustn't do that!

52
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,000
Linglong wouldn't want you to do this!

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,151
What else can we do?

54
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:55,611
She can't afford to wait any longer.

55
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,139
Wu Tong, you're just angry over what happened in the past.

56
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,839
I'll stay here, and you can do whatever you want.

57
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,909
If you want me to be your dog,

58
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:08,713
I will.

59
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:15,999
Linglong, this man really loves you.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,319
He loves me that much even though this is our first meeting.

61
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,330
Why don't you dig out his heart to see

62
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,433
if he's sincere or not?

63
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:27,644
That's a great idea.

64
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:32,466
I'll make you pay for your threats in the past.

65
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,237
Stop!

66
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,357
Brother Wu Tong?

67
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,952
Seems like he's sincere.

68
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:06,416
Why don't we let him stay and let him witness our love?

69
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,106
Isn't that more interesting?

70
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:10,718
I'll do anything for you as long as you return

71
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:12,589
Linglong's primordial spirit to us.

72
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:17,359
It's not that easy to get what you wish.

73
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,229
You want her primordial spirit? Fine.

74
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:21,880
Exchange it with another life.

75
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,550
Someone!

76
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,332
Second Senior!

77
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,472
Wu Tong, you scum! Do you think I'm afraid of you?

78
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:38,319
Kill me if you dare!

79
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,350
Fine. I'll grant you your wish.

80
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,429
Zhong Minyan, if you want to retrieve Linglong's primordial spirit,

81
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,980
you need to show some sincerity.

82
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,646
Kill him in front of me.

83
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,810
Sixth Senior, you mustn't do so.

84
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,090
If you can't kill him,

85
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,045
you won't be able to retrieve Linglong's primordial spirit.

86
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,999
Zhong Minyan, I'm an impatient man.

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,699
Minyan, it's a trap.

88
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,079
Don't believe him.

89
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,830
You mustn't do so.

90
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,870
I will surely save Linglong and Second Senior.

91
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,619
Do you think you can go back alive?

92
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,910
Look at how much time you have left.

93
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,707
Zhong Minyan, this is the Black and White Ring.

94
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:35,991
It's made from Xuanyin Steel and Mingyang Stone.

95
00:07:35,992 --> 00:07:40,601
We need to wear this in order to stay in Mount Buzhou.

96
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:44,719
Will you be my dog in exchange for Chu Linglong's primordial spirit?

97
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,204
Or will you let both Chu Linglong and your second senior die together?

98
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:50,115
You make the choice.

99
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,210
- I'll stay. <br> - Sixth Senior!

100
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,993
Second Senior,

101
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:34,579
I'm sorry.

102
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,734
I can't save anyone

103
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:38,910
if I don't do this.

104
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,990
No.

105
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,018
No!

106
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,255
Second Senior!

107
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,810
Second Senior!

108
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,063
You want me to kill my senior?

109
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:07,937
I can't bear to do so.

110
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:11,004
But I had cut off one of his arms.

111
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:12,955
That's enough, right?

112
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:14,539
I've hurt my senior.

113
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:17,030
I can't turn back now.

114
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,273
You believe in me now, right?

115
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,970
Fine.

116
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:24,121
I see your sincerity.

117
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:27,010
Here's Linglong's primordial spirit.

118
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,703
Xuanji!

119
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,636
Second Senior!

120
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,399
The Birth Candles are dying out. We should return soon.

121
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,199
What's going on?

122
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,500
Brother Wu Tong!

123
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,519
<i>So, their Birth Candles were bound by the Binding Formation.</i>

124
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,893
<i>Their Birth Candles have extinguished,</i>

125
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,447
<i>and they can't enter or leave the place.</i>

126
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:31,663
<i>They will perish in Mount Buzhou.</i>

127
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,361
<i>If Xuanji dies there, it means she will fail her tribulation.</i>

128
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:38,892
<i>I mustn't let her die in Mount Buzhou.</i>

129
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,119
God of War, you're powerful indeed.

130
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,179
It's a pity that you can't use your powers here.

131
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:58,250
You won't be able to escape, no matter how hard you fight.

132
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,736
What did you do?

133
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:01,627
I didn't do anything.

134
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,659
Someone else didn't want you to escape.

135
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:05,296
He has cut off your means of escape.

136
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,879
The Birth Candles have been extinguished.

137
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,995
Mortals can't last long in Mount Buzhou.

138
00:11:08,995 --> 00:11:13,369
You can only stay here until you perish.

139
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,527
Zhong Minyan is smart.

140
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,838
He made the right decision to survive.

141
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,108
No.

142
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,911
I mustn't die here.

143
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,965
I'm willing to surrender to Tianxu Hall as well.

144
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:32,279
- Ruo Yu! <br> - Ruo Yu.

145
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,299
Don't try to persuade me.

146
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:35,535
I've lost my mask.

147
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:38,840
If I return to Lize Palace, I will face death.

148
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,439
Staying here is a better option.

149
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,570
At least I can still survive.

150
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,439
This is pretty interesting.

151
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,225
You want to stay? Fine.

152
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:48,605
You need to follow his steps.

153
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:51,296
Kill your own to show us your sincerity.

154
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,486
Kill them and retrieve the primordial spirit.

155
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,911
Ruo Yu, don't fall for it!

156
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:00,616
They want us to kill each other!

157
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,199
You are on the verge of death.

158
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,130
You should play your last act for me before you die.

159
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,390
Here.

160
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,140
Every man for himself.

161
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,590
Don't blame me for this.

162
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,239
Ruo Yu.

163
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,879
Sifeng! Sifeng!

164
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:37,427
Sifeng!

165
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:38,960
- Sifeng! <br> - Xuanji.

166
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,540
Sifeng!

167
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,160
Sifeng! Sifeng!

168
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,530
Don't scare me, Sifeng!

169
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,639
You'll be fine, Sifeng!

170
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,382
Sifeng!

171
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:52,799
We'll definitely escape alive!

172
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,616
Sifeng!

173
00:12:55,728 --> 00:12:57,264
Sifeng!

174
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,359
Sifeng!

175
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,188
I will kill everyone who dares to hurt you!

176
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,581
Sifeng!

177
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,417
Sifeng!

178
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:51,154
Sifeng!

179
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,447
Sifeng!

180
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,623
Sifeng!

181
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,095
Sifeng!

182
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,359
Sifeng!

183
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:04,494
Sifeng, wake up! Look at me, Sifeng!

184
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:05,839
Sifeng!

185
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,779
Sifeng, this can't be!

186
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,783
We're home now, Sifeng!

187
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:12,230
We're out, Sifeng!

188
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,740
Don't cry.

189
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,190
Sifeng!

190
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,534
Sifeng! No!

191
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,130
I'm here!

192
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:30,607
No!

193
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:32,410
Sifeng!

194
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,146
No!

195
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,036
Please don't scare me, Sifeng!

196
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,529
Sifeng.

197
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,870
Sifeng.

198
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,390
Sifeng!

199
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,700
Sifeng! Sifeng!

200
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,393
Please don't scare me, Sifeng!

201
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:15,267
Sifeng.

202
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,390
Sifeng!

203
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,230
Sifeng!

204
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,390
Sifeng!

205
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,030
No!

206
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,370
Look at me! Please don't scare me!

207
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,879
Senior Hao Chen? Please save Sifeng!

208
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,239
Senior, please save him!

209
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,290
Senior!

210
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:54,578
I beg you!

211
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,279
Xuanji, what exactly happened?

212
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,303
Where's Minyan and the rest?

213
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:20,810
Father.

214
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:23,559
Sifeng!

215
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,639
- Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng!

216
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,139
Sifeng!

217
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:29,670
Aunt Hong, how's Sifeng?

218
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,208
How is he?

219
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:35,000
The person who struck him clearly wanted him to die.

220
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,586
The sword pierced his heart meridian.

221
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:39,239
Ordinary people would've been dead.

222
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,479
Sifeng survived due to his many years of training.

223
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,418
But he's just a human.

224
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:47,089
His heart meridian was pierced. It'll be hard for him to survive.

225
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,936
Now, the qi in his body is dissipating.

226
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:50,559
We can't stop that.

227
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,279
I'm afraid that he can't last for long.

228
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,290
This can't be. Sifeng, that can't happen.

229
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,559
Sifeng, this is not real.

230
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,581
- This can't be! <br> - Don't touch him!

231
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,847
You were the reason behind this!

232
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:03,445
Sifeng would never take the risk

233
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:06,239
in Mount Buzhou if it weren't for you!

234
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,838
He would've never been injured if he hadn't blocked the attack for you!

235
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,239
If you can't save him, I'll bring him back to Lize Palace.

236
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,520
- Sifeng! <br> - No!

237
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,488
He mustn't move in this condition.

238
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:18,168
Sifeng!

239
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,803
What should we do?

240
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:24,193
Don't tell me I can only watch him suffer like this?

241
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,478
What if I reverse my Yang Jue Skill and use it to protect his heart meridian?

242
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:31,079
Will he be saved if I do so?

243
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,759
You mustn't!

244
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,500
You can activate the Nine Cycles Spell

245
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,239
by using the Heartless Tactics in conjunction with the reverse Yang Jue Skill.

246
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,214
But it is very risky.

247
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:42,879
If anything goes wrong, your blood will flow in reverse.

248
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,813
Not only will you not be able to save him, but you'll also die as well.

249
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,666
What do you mean?

250
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:52,319
Sifeng is in this condition because of Chu Xuanji!

251
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,290
Why aren't you letting her do so when she has a way to save him?

252
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,639
Xuanji, our fate is predetermined.

253
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,866
- You mustn't force it. <br> - I will force it!

254
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:03,879
I will save him! Even when the possibility is close to nothing!

255
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,959
It's best if I can save him,

256
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,190
but if I can't save him, I'll die together with him.

257
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,079
Xuanji, stop messing around!

258
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,806
Don't stop me!

259
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,599
I'll do it.

260
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,928
I'll use the Nine Cycles Spell to save Yu Sifeng.

261
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:19,499
Hao Chen, you–

262
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,839
I'm better at Heartless Tactics and Yang Jue Skill compared with Xuanji.

263
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,890
It's more stable if I do that.

264
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,190
Senior Hao Chen, you don't need to do this.

265
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,919
You don't want me to save him?

266
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,090
Are you asking me to witness your death?

267
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,931
Yu Sifeng, it's fine if just you die like this.

268
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:03,641
But you've caught Xuanji in your love web.

269
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:05,239
If anything happens to you

270
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,570
and Xuanji harbors anguish because of this,

271
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,562
even a million deaths are not enough for you to atone for it.

272
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:13,358
Today, I may save you,

273
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:17,390
but next time, I'll show you my true colors.

274
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,566
Senior Hao Chen, how's Sifeng?

275
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,919
You've sustained internal injuries.

276
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,179
Why didn't you tell us before you did that?

277
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:37,249
Senior Hao Chen, when did you get hurt?

278
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,657
While I was searching for you, I saw a suspicious demon at the altar

279
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:42,959
and I was struck by his malignant aura.

280
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,465
But it's fine. I know my own condition.

281
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:51,458
Xuanji, Hao Chen was hurt because of your reckless actions.

282
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,164
- Sorry, Senior. I— <br> - I said it's fine.

283
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:57,041
You don't need to worry.

284
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,810
It's just that the attributes of

285
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,430
Lize Palace and Shaoyang Sect are different.

286
00:20:03,014 --> 00:20:06,940
The Yang Jue qi that I've sent to him can only stay inside his heart meridian.

287
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:09,100
It can't travel through his entire body.

288
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,140
I can only continue this when his body accepts it on its own.

289
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,752
Wait? We still need to wait?

290
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:15,549
How long can Sifeng last?

291
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,240
Will this method work or not?

292
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,877
Xuanji, if my qi can't travel through his entire body,

293
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:24,308
then there really is no other way.

294
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,509
If a strong spirit energy is protecting his heart meridian,

295
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,441
we may be able to force the qi to travel through his body.

296
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:31,825
There are Pagoda Trees at the base of this mountain.

297
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:34,848
If we can find a 10,000-year-old Pagoda Tree

298
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,639
and create medicine out of its roots,

299
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,140
Sifeng will be fine after he consumes it.

300
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,952
Yes. Xuanji, take care of Hero Yu.

301
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:45,748
You need to transfer your qi to protect his heart meridian every five minutes.

302
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:47,360
I'll follow you.

303
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,239
Hao Chen, you need to recuperate.

304
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,359
You mustn't hurt your own vitality because of this.

305
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,997
I won't be able to give an explanation

306
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:57,748
to Senior Heng Yang if anything happens to you.

307
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:59,879
Xuanji, take good care of your senior.

308
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:01,770
Let's go.

309
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,322
I'll go as well!

310
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,850
Yu Sifeng isn't that great.

311
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,610
He's not worth sacrificing your life for.

312
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,222
Xuanji, I told you before.

313
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:19,519
You don't know much about relationships.

314
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,110
How could you entrust your future to a stranger like him?

315
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,361
Senior, I may not know much, but I know enough.

316
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:35,374
Sifeng is the person that I want to spend my life with and never part in this lifetime.

317
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,450
If he leaves me behind, I would rather die.

318
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,170
You're trapped by your relationship.

319
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,854
No class at all.

320
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:50,964
This is the most despicable

321
00:21:50,964 --> 00:21:52,818
and ignorant act.

322
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:12,099
<i>Sifeng is the person that I want to spend my life with and never part in this lifetime.</i>

323
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,038
So stupid!

324
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,940
It's no wonder you fail your tribulations every time.

325
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,090
If I don't help you,

326
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,282
this will continue forever.

327
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:35,550
Sifeng, please hang in there. I beg you.

328
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,266
The medicine is here!

329
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:40,001
The medicine is here!

330
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:42,972
Chu Xuanji, help him up!

331
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,435
We didn't find any 10,000-year-old Pagoda Tree.

332
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:54,066
We'll see what a 1,000-year-old Pagoda Tree can do.

333
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,850
How is it? Is it working?

334
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,795
No.

335
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:11,112
The spirit energy is weaker than Senior Hao Chen's qi.

336
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:13,300
We can't protect his heart this way.

337
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,082
No. I must find it.

338
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,213
Even if there's no 10,000-year-old Pagoda Tree,

339
00:23:17,214 --> 00:23:20,344
I'll find a 10,000-year-old immortal fruit or something.

340
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,086
Sifeng.

341
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:30,050
Sifeng, hang in there.

342
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,820
What if they can't find anything useful?

343
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,201
What should I do then? Should I submit to fate?

344
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,530
No, I don't want that.

345
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,739
Sifeng, you have to overcome this.

346
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:45,827
Sifeng, I believe you can overcome this.

347
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:47,945
Please get better soon.

348
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,570
I didn't expect my Love Flower to have so much spirit energy.

349
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,845
Maybe it can save Sifeng.

350
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,060
Its spirit power has protected your heart meridian.

351
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,739
Sifeng, you must hang in there.

352
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:48,970
You must get better soon.

353
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,676
My King, according to my observation,

354
00:25:22,676 --> 00:25:25,954
there is spirit energy from the heavens surrounding Chu Xuanji.

355
00:25:25,955 --> 00:25:27,344
I wonder what happened?

356
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:30,895
It's because Xuanji used the Love Flower to save Yu Sifeng.

357
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,610
Yu Sifeng wasn't supposed to live.

358
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,159
I gave the Love Flower to Xuanji in order to get rid of her anguish,

359
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,313
but she actually used it to save an outsider.

360
00:25:39,314 --> 00:25:41,697
Doesn't she understand the purpose of Love Flower?

361
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:45,740
She doesn't understand, indeed.

362
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,780
My King, are you angry because she used an immortal item?

363
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,470
Or are you angry because she used the Love Flower that tied your fates?

364
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,630
What a load of nonsense.

365
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,441
Are you still trying to joke around?

366
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:02,420
What tied fates?

367
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,650
I'm just angry because she's stupid, and she doesn't know what's good for her.

368
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:08,901
That's why Yu Sifeng is able to lead her by the nose.

369
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:13,910
But Chu Xuanji has recovered her six senses

370
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,260
and she fancies another person.

371
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,154
My King, if you let her continue her peaceful life,

372
00:26:20,155 --> 00:26:22,365
if her anguish doesn't develop then there's a huge possibility that

373
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:25,830
she may be able to return to the heavens.

374
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,670
Are you asking me to let them be together in this lifetime?

375
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,255
No! I mean, that isn't suitable at all.

376
00:26:37,255 --> 00:26:41,821
But My King, mortals have a short lifespan.

377
00:26:41,821 --> 00:26:45,069
Even if she is to be together with Yu Sifeng in this life,

378
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,319
it will only be temporary.

379
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,259
When she returns to the heavens,

380
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:53,260
she'll understand that life is but a dream.

381
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,252
By then, she can stay by your side

382
00:26:57,252 --> 00:27:00,660
and continue her relationship with you.

383
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,195
How dare you say that!

384
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,520
You want me to let Xuanji and an outsider decide her fate?

385
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,884
Impossible!

386
00:27:10,885 --> 00:27:12,700
She belonged to me in the past,

387
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,719
and she'll only belong to me and the heavens,

388
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,912
no matter if it's the present or the future!

389
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:19,519
Since I've come down to guide her,

390
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,790
I will make sure nothing goes wrong in this lifetime of hers!

391
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,151
Xuanji has disobeyed me many times because of this Yu Sifeng.

392
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,821
I mustn't let him stay by her side.

393
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:37,475
I need to sever

394
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:39,872
this ill-fated relationship for her!

395
00:27:40,824 --> 00:27:42,306
Father,

396
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,930
this is Linglong's primordial spirit.

397
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,143
We managed to save her.

398
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,982
Where's Minyan?

399
00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:20,670
Sixth Senior?

400
00:28:21,905 --> 00:28:23,082
He...

401
00:28:23,082 --> 00:28:25,560
Sixth Senior was left behind in Mount Buzhou

402
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,340
and he became Wu Tong's subordinate.

403
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,420
Father, did you give Sixth Senior a secret mission?

404
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,735
He... He severed Second Senior's arm

405
00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:37,159
and he wants me to tell you that he'll accomplish his missions.

406
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,260
What? What do you mean by that?

407
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,510
I didn't say anything like that to him! Why is he...

408
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,090
Why did he do that then?

409
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,660
Xuanji, don't you believe in me?

410
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,320
I-It's not that.

411
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,810
It's just that... just that, he...

412
00:28:58,658 --> 00:29:00,128
he...

413
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:11,996
Maybe Minyan was used by Wu Tong and the demons.

414
00:29:11,996 --> 00:29:14,219
That's why he betrayed our sect.

415
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,473
Or maybe...

416
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:22,554
that demon who brought you there was the traitor.

417
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:26,740
The demon worked together with Tianxu Hall to deceive you.

418
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,218
Impossible. Purple Fox died in Mount Buzhou.

419
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:32,060
It's impossible for her to deceive us.

420
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,730
What about the disciple of Lize Palace who entered Mount Buzhou with you?

421
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,488
What about him?

422
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,289
Ruo Yu?

423
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,771
Sifeng!

424
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,647
It's him.

425
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,570
He was the one who hurt Sifeng.

426
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,552
He was the one who hurt Sifeng!

427
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,599
I told you before.

428
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,416
I told you not to act recklessly.

429
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:14,860
But you wouldn't listen.

430
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,777
Mount Buzhou is a place unknown to mortals.

431
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:21,599
But you insisted on going there.

432
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,090
In the end, everything has become a mess.

433
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,420
It's fine.

434
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,970
It's a lesson for you all.

435
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,812
Now, you know you should think twice before you act.

436
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,892
As for Sifeng, you don't need to worry about him.

437
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:53,070
Hao Chen has never boasted his abilities.

438
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,420
He won't do things that he's not confident in.

439
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,679
Do you know that your Senior Hao Chen only risked himself

440
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,440
to help an outsider for your sake?

441
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,919
Hao Chen is passionate about you.

442
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,467
And you two were a perfect couple.

443
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:14,478
But you insist on...

444
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,976
Father, Sifeng and I love each other,

445
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:21,421
and we promised to never leave each other.

446
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:26,600
So, I will never marry anyone except for Sifeng.

447
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,174
I've told Senior Hao Chen about my feelings.

448
00:31:29,174 --> 00:31:32,985
Father, I hope you can understand me as well.

449
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,218
Fine.

450
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,567
Get up now.

451
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,734
I know that Yu Sifeng is your benefactor.

452
00:31:57,734 --> 00:32:00,805
We'll talk about this in the future.

453
00:32:00,805 --> 00:32:03,375
I need to patrol the area

454
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,159
and set up the Thousand Bells Formation in order to detect demons.

455
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,990
By doing so, the demons won't be able to create trouble.

456
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,690
Sifeng, how do you feel?

457
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,734
Sifeng.

458
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,940
Does it hurt?

459
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,478
Sifeng!

460
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,670
Sifeng!

461
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,730
Sifeng!

462
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,677
<i>The mortal's method doesn't work indeed.</i>

463
00:32:56,677 --> 00:33:00,350
<i>It will only cause him harm as the spirit energy is too strong around his heart meridian.</i>

464
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,440
Sifeng, I'll undo two of your seals below your rib-cage.

465
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,439
If not, you will die.

466
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,693
Little Silver Flower, no!

467
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:15,079
Sifeng. Sifeng!

468
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,539
Are you afraid that Xuanji will know that you're a demon

469
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,139
after I unseal them?

470
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:23,006
But if I don't unseal them, your blood won't flow.

471
00:33:23,006 --> 00:33:25,997
And they won't be able to save you no matter what they do.

472
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:27,299
Don't worry.

473
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,299
The spirit energy inside your heart is very powerful.

474
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,310
It will suppress your demonic nature.

475
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,379
Listen to me, okay?

476
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:35,153
Please listen to me!

477
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,690
Sifeng!

478
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,309
Sifeng, how do you feel?

479
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,160
Do you feel better?

480
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,863
Sifeng! Why is this happening?

481
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:09,074
Why couldn't it suppress your power?

482
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,510
The thing that Xuanji gave me

483
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,050
clashes with the spirit energy

484
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,440
within my body.

485
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,889
Why is this happening?

486
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,060
Sifeng, you mustn't force yourself!

487
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,044
Oh right, Palace Master once told me that

488
00:34:29,044 --> 00:34:32,869
I need to undo your Dragon Crystal Seal when you're in danger,

489
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:34,339
and let you consume human's primary essence.

490
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:37,768
Sifeng, I'll bring you some humans.

491
00:34:37,768 --> 00:34:39,419
Wait for me!

492
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:42,499
Little Silver Flower! Come back!

493
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,778
Sifeng, don't overexert yourself!

494
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:51,782
I know you don't want to do this, but I have no choice.

495
00:34:51,782 --> 00:34:53,174
Sifeng!

496
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,305
Give me the Dragon Crystals.

497
00:34:57,793 --> 00:34:59,010
I won't give them to you!

498
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,420
Your life will be in danger!

499
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,952
Go and find...

500
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,930
find Brother Liu.

501
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,250
Hurry and find Brother Liu!

502
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,045
Sifeng.

503
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,740
Aunt Hong, I'll bring this medicine to Sifeng.

504
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:43,811
Be careful. It's hot.

505
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,730
Why is the door sealed with a spell?

506
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,139
Sifeng?

507
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,016
<i>Sifeng!</i>

508
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,323
Sifeng, are you awake?

509
00:36:06,323 --> 00:36:08,212
Sifeng!

510
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,791
Sifeng!

511
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,303
Sifeng!

512
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:20,718
Sifeng, talk to me!

513
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,414
<i>Sifeng, open the door!</i>

514
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:24,600
<i>Sifeng!</i>

515
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,739
<i>Sifeng!</i>

516
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,100
<i>Sifeng!</i>

517
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,283
I smell a demon! Why is there a demon here?

518
00:36:51,932 --> 00:36:53,572
Sifeng!

519
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,631
Father!

520
00:37:02,632 --> 00:37:03,719
A demon has captured Sifeng!

521
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:06,281
I caught its scent! It's heading toward the forest!

522
00:37:06,281 --> 00:37:07,841
Let's go!

523
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,720
Where's the demon?

524
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,870
Xuanji, do you know where they're located?

525
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,889
It has a faint scent. It's hard for me to locate it.

526
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:28,969
Let's split up and search.

527
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:31,140
Okay. Let's split up.

528
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,390
Yu Sifeng, why are you here?

529
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,770
Sifeng!

530
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,149
Xuanji, did you have a clear look at that demon?

531
00:38:12,149 --> 00:38:13,892
No.

532
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,340
This is strange.

533
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,559
Why didn't the demon kill Yu Sifeng?

534
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:22,079
Why did the demon escape after it brought Yu Sifeng here?

535
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,574
Senior Hao Chen, that's enough.

536
00:38:23,574 --> 00:38:24,999
Let's take Sifeng back.

537
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:29,219
Fine. I need to cast Nine Cycles Spell to stabilize his heart meridian for now.

538
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:30,890
Let's go.

539
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,418
<i>That demon's purpose just now is inexplicable.</i>

540
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:37,493
<i>Yu Sifeng had received spirit energy from the heavens.</i>

541
00:38:37,494 --> 00:38:40,958
<i>He should be fine, yet he's extremely weak.</i>

542
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:42,909
<i>What exactly is going on?</i>

543
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:47,079
<i>By casting the Nine Cycles Spell, I can travel around in his body</i>

544
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,898
<i>and understand what's going on.</i>

545
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,379
<i>Strange.</i>

546
00:38:53,379 --> 00:38:55,015
<i>There's nothing wrong with his body.</i>

547
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:56,986
<i>He's like an ordinary human.</i>

548
00:38:58,062 --> 00:39:01,690
<i>Wait, something is hidden within.</i>

549
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,821
Demon Poison?

550
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,119
Senior!

551
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,210
Xuanji, don't come near me!

552
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,952
Be careful!

553
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,660
It's Demon Poison!

554
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:30,278
The poison is affecting Hao Chen!

555
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:31,805
I'm afraid his body will be taken over!

556
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:34,046
What should we do? He's casting the Nine Cycles Spell!

557
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:36,359
If we force him to stop now, the poison will enter his body!

558
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,997
Let me try!

559
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,761
No! The poison is too strong!

560
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,626
Ting Nu? Brother Liu?

561
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:50,390
Ting Nu, please save Sifeng!

562
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,390
I can neutralize the poison.

563
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,494
Wait!

564
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,340
Demon, how dare you come here!

565
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,273
Father, although Ting Nu is a merman, he has helped us many times.

566
00:40:02,374 --> 00:40:04,420
He was once an immortal medic in the heavens. His medical skills are superb.

567
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,779
- He's our friend. <br> - Nonsense!

568
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,720
We're cultivators! How could we work together with demons?

569
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,030
Old guy, you're stubborn indeed!

570
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:14,236
What's wrong with demons?

571
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:18,220
Many kind-hearted demons are much better than evil humans!

572
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,579
This is an emergency, you know?

573
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:23,180
It'll be too late if you don't allow my friend to help.

574
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,138
Father, please let Ting Nu save them!

575
00:40:28,138 --> 00:40:30,919
They can't hold out for long! Ting Nu, please save them!

576
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,446
Sect Leader, this is an emergency.

577
00:40:32,446 --> 00:40:33,859
Why don't we let him try?

578
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:36,710
Besides, he won't be able to do much with us around.

579
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,468
The poison has been neutralized.

580
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:18,664
Sifeng!

581
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,056
Sifeng!

582
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:28,279
<i>Wait, this merman... It's him?</i>

583
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,481
<i>Strange, I tremble with fear when I look at him,</i>

584
00:41:31,482 --> 00:41:33,469
<i>but I have never seen him before.</i>

585
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,134
Your injury isn't serious,

586
00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:38,268
but there are residues of the poison inside your body.

587
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:41,620
You better go on a retreat and recuperate for a few months to detoxify the remaining poison.

588
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,855
No!

589
00:41:42,855 --> 00:41:44,779
I haven't captured that demon yet.

590
00:41:44,779 --> 00:41:47,254
Senior, I'm afraid the demon won't return anymore.

591
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,459
You need to recuperate. Demon Poison is a big deal.

592
00:41:49,459 --> 00:41:52,497
He Yang, bring Hao Chen back to Shaoyang for his recuperation.

593
00:41:52,497 --> 00:41:55,559
- We'll take it from here. <br> - Okay, come.

594
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,156
Sifeng.

595
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,654
Sifeng!

596
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,595
Ting Nu, what's wrong with Sifeng?

597
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:12,399
Sifeng's condition is more complicated. Yihuan, I need your assistance.

598
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,839
Xuanji, you can wait outside with the rest.

599
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,154
- I— <br> - Don't worry.

600
00:42:16,154 --> 00:42:20,260
I'll do my best to return a healthy Sifeng back to you.

601
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,624
I—

602
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,653
Sifeng, I'm going to reconstruct your heart meridian.

603
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,359
I need you to stay awake

604
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,230
and bear the pain.

605
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,883
Thank you.

606
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,012
It's done.

607
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,999
Little Phoenix, you managed to survive this ordeal,

608
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,439
but who knows how many ordeals are waiting for you in the future?

609
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,550
You better not injure yourself anymore.

610
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,999
Okay. I'll seal his Demon Point right now.

611
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,620
Yihuan,

612
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:36,447
we should use the Dragon Crystal Seal on him

613
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,808
when he is fully recovered.

614
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,436
Fine.

615
