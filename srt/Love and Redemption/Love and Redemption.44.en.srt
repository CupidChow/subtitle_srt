Hurry up! Follow Palace Lord's order and retreat into Lize Palace!

You want to run? Chase after them!

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,947
Senior Hao Chen!

38
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:11,020
Yu Sifeng, what are you trying to do?

39
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,059
What am I trying to do?

40
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:21,935
In the past, I thought that cultivators were conservative and adhered to rules.

41
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:27,259
You really shocked me by showing me how cunning you can get.

42
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:29,419
Lize Palace is just defending itself.

43
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,344
If you don't retreat now,

44
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:33,939
don't blame me for activating the Golden Bell

45
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:37,160
and crushing them to dust.

46
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:41,699
There's no point in making a deal with these demons!

47
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,985
Xuanji, don't care about us.

48
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:46,442
Go in and kill the Devil Star.

49
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:48,952
Kill every demon in Lize Palace!

50
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:52,959
So touching that Sect Leader Hao Chen is willing to die for the sake of a cause.

51
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,379
Fine. Bring it on.

52
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,865
Let's see if these disciples

53
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,522
will be able to pave the path for you towards victory.

54
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:06,070
God of War, Sect Leader Hao Chen is right.

55
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,720
To be able to sacrifice for this cause, it'll be a worthy death.

56
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,013
Sect Leader Chu, let's use this chance to go in.

57
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,905
We have to kill the Devil Star.

58
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:19,541
But...

59
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,911
The price that we have to pay is too high.

60
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,250
Okay.

61
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,295
I agree to retreat from Lize Palace.

62
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,060
No, Xuanji.

63
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,451
As the sect leader, I don't agree!

64
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,800
God of War, how can you cower at a time like this?

65
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,488
I'm not cowering.

66
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:52,194
Valley Master Rong, we are talking about people's lives here.

67
00:05:52,194 --> 00:05:54,290
Dianjing Valley's disciples are in here, too!

68
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,300
They are not bargaining chips.

69
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:59,828
Senior, you always say that we have to protect the people.

70
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:01,379
Who are the people?

71
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:04,941
Every life matters. We can't just sacrifice them!

72
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,819
I'll retreat.

73
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,346
Let them go.

74
00:06:11,346 --> 00:06:14,810
I promise that all of us will retreat from Lize Palace.

75
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,991
Xuanji!

76
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,219
Okay, we'll each take a step back.

77
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:25,319
This Golden Bell is set by Elder Luo using the four mythological objects.

78
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,779
I'll bring those mythological objects to open it.

79
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:30,834
I hope that you'll keep your word.

80
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,801
Don't worry.

81
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:37,546
I hope that this time, you won't lie to me again.

82
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:39,190
Okay.

83
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,499
Palace Lord, we can't forgive those people.

84
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,139
What do you want me to do, Elder Luo?

85
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,679
Do you want to force them

86
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,353
to break into Lize Palace and fight it out for a brief satisfaction?

87
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:56,806
Palace Lord,

88
00:06:56,806 --> 00:07:00,111
you should ask what those cultivators did.

89
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:03,540
Palace Lord, take a look inside the palace.

90
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,940
Elder He, your injuries...

91
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,220
Who cares about that? My injuries are nothing.

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,126
Why don't you look at these young disciples?

93
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:37,421
They can't be saved anymore.

94
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,419
Palace Lord, when those cultivators came in from the secret tunnel,

95
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,539
they passed our children's school.

96
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,007
The disciples inside were just young kids who couldn't even use their neigong.

97
00:07:56,007 --> 00:08:00,571
But because they are demons, they were killed without mercy.

98
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,639
They were all killed by the same person.

99
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,499
Samadhi Fire from Yaohua sword moves.

100
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:16,160
This is the doing of Hao Chen.

101
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:21,158
- Elder Luo. <br> - Palace Lord.

102
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:24,040
Give me the four mythological objects at once.

103
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,179
Are you still going to compromise?

104
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:28,799
Elder Feng is repairing the barrier now.

105
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,100
We just need to delay them for a while and they won't be able to come in.

106
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,600
No.

107
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,215
I want to let Hao Chen out

108
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,598
and kill him with my own hands

109
00:08:40,598 --> 00:08:43,212
to avenge these disciples.

110
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,579
These mythological objects belonged to our sects first.

111
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:50,073
But now, everything is theirs.

112
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:54,219
God of War, are you really going to keep your promise?

113
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:57,522
Now is the best chance for you to go in.

114
00:08:57,522 --> 00:09:00,414
I will not break my promise.

115
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,985
I won't force my way inside,

116
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:04,299
and I won't let others do the same.

117
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:09,204
Xuanji, the demon clan is especially cunning and unreliable.

118
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:13,295
Even if you keep your promise, the Devil Star might not.

119
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,580
He has been gone for so long.

120
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,818
I'm afraid that he's going to play some tricks on us. We better be careful.

121
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:25,307
Father,

122
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,920
he has no need to lie to me this time.

123
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:32,639
You want to talk about trust with a demon?

124
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,979
Just you watch.

125
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:37,692
Let's see if Yu Sifeng will break his promise again.

126
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:40,553
He always likes to use your kindness against you, right?

127
00:09:40,553 --> 00:09:43,066
Have you forgotten about that?

128

<i>[Lize Palace]</i>

129
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,662
Yu Sifeng, have you brought the four mythological objects?

00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:04,467
Yes.

131
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,922
I'm sure that you are very familiar with them.

132
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:10,135
I don't need to introduce them to you.

Yu Sifeng, what are you doing?

134
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,794
Hurry up and remove the other barriers.

135
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:26,535
Who said that I'll remove them?

136
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:40,499
Yu Sifeng, why did you break your promise?

137
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:42,462
Break my promise?

138
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:46,979
You are the one who knows about the secret tunnel and brought them in.

139

Do you know the name of the sword when four mythological objects are combined?

140
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,059
It's called the Hell Raiser Sword.

141
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:00,900
This sword can slaughter demons and ghosts in hell,

and it can kill evil people in this world, too.

today I'm going to kill you with this sword.

Is there anything real that comes out of your mouth?

147

He deserves to die!

162
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,221
since the beginning until now,

163
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,534
I've trusted you wrongly.

164
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:21,508
From now on, there will be no ties between us.

165
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,840
How is it, Sifeng? Do you feel better?

166
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,299
Let me take a look at your wound.

167
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:14,052
No need to take a look at it. Isn't he the Devil Star?

168
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:17,459
This kind of injury is nothing to him.

169
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:25,996
You are great, Devil Star.

170
00:15:25,996 --> 00:15:28,790
How is it possible that you are the Devil Star?

171
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,681
Although I can't see your future, I still have a rough idea about it.

172
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,299
If you are the Devil Star,

173
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:38,479
I'll dig out my celestial eye now and swallow it.

174
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,169
Enough. Stop glaring at me, Eldest Brother Liu.

175
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:43,101
At first, I didn't want to lie to you.

176
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:46,705
I just thought of some ways to make them believe that I'm the Devil Star.

177
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:49,589
I did it just to foil Yuan Lang's plan.

178
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:52,339
Next, I still need your help with my next plan.

179
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:56,514
You are playing with fire. You will get burned one day.

180
00:15:56,514 --> 00:15:58,683
Don't worry, I'm tough.

181
00:15:58,683 --> 00:16:00,181
I see.

182
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:03,514
When you were fighting with Xuanji outside of Lize Palace just now,

183
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:05,899
didn't you tell her that you are the fake Devil Star

184
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,359
and tell her about your plan?

185
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,619
Yuan Lang is the one who lured the three sects here.

186
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:15,022
Yuan Lang was trying to test my identity. I couldn't tell her about it.

187
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:20,140
At first, I wanted to explain everything to her slowly.

188
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:23,707
But...

189
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,691
Forget it. Let's not talk about it.

190
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:31,568
There are still many seriously wounded disciples in Lize Palace.

191
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:33,682
- I'll have to trouble you again. <br> - Don't worry.

192
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:35,897
I'll go and check on them now.

193
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,970
- What about your... <br> - Just some minor wounds. I'm fine.

194
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:06,833
Eldest Brother Liu, why are you looking at me like that?

195
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,580
I really don't understand.

196
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,097
You did so much for Chu Xuanji.

197
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:16,459
I want to see whether it'll all pay off in the end,

198
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:20,388
or if you're going to fall into the abyss and turn to dust.

199
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:23,532
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

200
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:26,240
Stop pretending, okay?

201
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,215
Why would you suddenly want to pretend to be the Devil Star?

202
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,819
It must be because that person appeared by your side and

203
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,595
you wanted to hide her identity for her.

204
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,930
Besides Xuanji, who else will you sacrifice so much

205
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,859
for without a care for your own safety?

206
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:42,451
Ever since I first met her, I already knew that she's not that simple.

207
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:46,404
I couldn't even see her past or future with my celestial eye.

208
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:50,206
I just never thought that she was the Devil...

209
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:53,412
Don't breathe a word about it.

210
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:57,543
Eldest Brother Liu, if you speak so freely again,

211
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,499
don't blame me for breaking my friendship with you.

212
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:07,409
Yu Sifeng,

213
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:10,750
you are using our friendship to threaten me?

214
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,419
You are still protecting her?

215
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,154
She doesn't even know about the things you did for her.

216
00:18:15,154 --> 00:18:17,614
She will just hate you and detest you.

217
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,272
Did that stab from her sword hurt?

218
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:25,493
Did it hurt?

219
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:28,789
And there's the Lover's Curse, too.

220
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,133
Eldest Brother Liu, you are hurting me.

221
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:44,417
I'm fine.

222
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:47,289
Although Xuanji hates me and detests me,

223
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:51,750
she still couldn't hurt me in the end.

224
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:57,295
Little Phoenix, you can't just gamble with your luck.

225
00:18:57,295 --> 00:19:00,339
You managed to stop the activation of the Lover's Curse this time.

226
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,459
What about next time?

227
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:03,272
Do you know that everything you do

228
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:06,605
will only put a bigger and bigger wedge between you and Chu Xuanji?

229
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:10,589
What are you going to do the next time she misunderstands and hurts you again?

230
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:12,921
How many times can you hold back the Lover's Curse?

231
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:15,862
Will you be able to survive until the end?

232
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:18,978
Don't worry.

233
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:21,659
I won't let the Lover's Curse be activated again.

234
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:25,554
Everything is within my expectation.

235
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:35,420
If it's really within your expectation,

236
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,632
you wouldn't have lost your focus and been stabbed by her.

237
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:41,249
<i>Yu Sifeng,</i>

238
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:43,927
<i>since the beginning until now, I've trusted you wrongly.</i>

239
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:46,053
<i>From now on,</i>

240
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:50,880
<i>there will be no ties between us.</i>

241
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,020
She said that she'll break all ties with me.

242
00:20:00,186 --> 00:20:02,545
She didn't hesitate when she attacked me.

243
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:05,174
I didn't manage to dodge her attack.

244
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:08,590
When I find the right time in the future,

245
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,019
I'll explain it to her.

246
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,640
She will understand.

247
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,292
Little Phoenix, I treat you as my friend.

248
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:25,111
If it was another person, nobody would care about you.

249
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:28,139
There are things you have to think about yourself.

250
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:31,254
I feel terrible when I look at you.

251
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:33,415
I'll go and help out Ting Nu now.

252
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,306
Come out.

253
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:54,215
Master, I once asked you to vow that

254
00:20:54,215 --> 00:20:58,145
no matter what, you are not allowed to harm Xuanji,

255
00:20:58,145 --> 00:21:00,626
but you hurt her.

256
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,221
Yes.

257
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:04,700
I disobeyed your order.

258
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,968
My heart is suffering right now.

259
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:12,044
But I don't care.

260
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,251
That Chu Xuanji deserves to die.

261
00:21:16,906 --> 00:21:20,406
Unfortunately, she's the God of War.

262
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:22,992
I'm just a Silver Snake.

263
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:25,833
I'm not her match.

264
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,521
Master,

265
00:21:29,194 --> 00:21:31,952
I am your spirit beast.

266
00:21:31,952 --> 00:21:34,939
If she hurts you, I'll kill her!

267
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:40,333
Even if I lose my life doing it, it's still my mission!

268
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,635
Okay,

269
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,771
I can't control you now.

270
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,370
You became my spirit beast out of a coincidence back then.

271
00:21:50,986 --> 00:21:54,113
You are able to take the form of a human now.

272
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:56,233
It's time to set you free.

Master.

274
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,650

♫ <i>It's too absurd, but just can't forget our past</i> ♫

322
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:17,940

323
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:24,120
♫ <i> The one you love</i> ♫

324
00:25:41,147 --> 00:25:42,070
Palace Master.

325
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,980
Elder He, why are you so seriously hurt?

326
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,539
I remember that you were just shot on the arm with the Demon Bow.

327
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:49,277
There's Bone-Melting Poison in his wound.

328
00:25:49,277 --> 00:25:51,944
The poison must have been applied to the Demon Bow.

329
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:55,113
Although the wound looks normal on the outside,

330
00:25:55,113 --> 00:25:58,399
the poison will enter the body and corrode the organs.

331
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,234
Such a cruel poison.

332
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:03,579
These sects are crueler and more vicious than we demons.

333
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:07,013
How dare they say that they are righteous?

334
00:26:07,675 --> 00:26:08,900
Then, this poison...

335
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,800
Don't worry. I can neutralize it.

336
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,379
I'll have to trouble you again.

337
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:16,933
It's nothing.

338
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,730
Who is he?

339
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,319
Liu Yihuan.

340
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:24,059
The abandoned disciple of Lize Palace is here right on time.

341
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,361
Are you the one who betrayed

342
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:30,506
the information of our secret tunnel to those sects?

343
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:34,204
You are good at diverting attention from yourself when you are the perpetrator.

344
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:38,141
Aren't you the one who put Lize Palace in danger?

345
00:26:43,642 --> 00:26:48,112
You took the Black Feather Medallion and used my name

346
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:50,973
to send a declaration of war to those sects.

347
00:26:50,973 --> 00:26:54,499
You brought war upon us when we should've been recuperating.

348
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:58,200
We've suffered heavy casualties because of you.

349
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,844
Do you dare say that you are innocent?

350
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:05,359
This...

351
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,614
Why did Deputy Chief–

352
00:27:07,614 --> 00:27:09,844
I want to know why, too.

353
00:27:09,844 --> 00:27:15,032
Maybe Right Lieutenant doesn't believe in my capability as the Devil Star

354
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:17,137
and my ability to lead the demon clan.

355
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,121
Is that why you gave me a test?

356
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:24,192
Or is it because you are dissatisfied that I'm leading Lize Palace and Tianxu Hall?

357
00:27:24,192 --> 00:27:27,848
So, you purposely lured the God of War here during the enthronement ceremony

358
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:32,139
for her to kill me for you so that you can reap the benefit of it?

359
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:33,779
Yuan Lang...

360
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:37,672
What are you trying to do?

361
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,459
Don't be angry.

362
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,899
All I want is just to revive the glory of us as a demon clan.

363
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:45,025
You are our leader. You are the savior and hope of the demon clan.

364
00:27:45,025 --> 00:27:47,499
Why would I try to kill you?

365
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,281
But we put in so much effort to get the spirit keys.

366
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:52,335
So, I just wanted to make sure.

367
00:27:53,634 --> 00:27:57,426
Besides that, in the past,

368
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:00,777
you left our clan and Lize Palace for the God of War.

369
00:28:00,777 --> 00:28:02,396
I...

370
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,624
I just want to make sure that nothing will go wrong.

371
00:28:05,624 --> 00:28:09,456
You are indeed good at using pretty words to your advantage.

372
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:11,850
You are really innocent in this matter.

373
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,419
But no matter what, you shouldn't use our clan's safety as a bet,

374
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:20,065
and you shouldn't have let our disciples be sacrificed for nothing!

375
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,937
You are right.

376
00:28:21,937 --> 00:28:23,913
I was too inconsiderate.

377
00:28:23,913 --> 00:28:25,913
I promise that it'll not happen again.

378
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:30,738
If you don't trust me, you can enter the Demon Citadel with me.

379
00:28:30,738 --> 00:28:33,458
There's no need to drag this on.

380
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:37,294
But... you are not from the demon bloodline.

381
00:28:37,294 --> 00:28:41,942
You'll be affected by the malignant aura if you enter the Demon Citadel.

382
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,099
Forget it.

383
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,600
Just decide now.

384
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:54,779
How about we depart right away once you've recovered?

385
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,311
I'll hand over the spirit keys to you when we reach the outside of Demon Citadel.

386
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:01,841
Then, the four elders and I will lead the whole Lize Palace

387
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:05,682
to stand guard outside for your protection

388
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:07,799
and to celebrate your success.

389
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,955
Okay. With Ting Nu here to treat me,

390
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:13,340
this minor wound will only take me two days to recover.

391
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,903
Please get everything ready by then.

392
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:19,127
After two days, we'll depart.

393
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,498
Yes, Demon Lord.

394
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,599
Uncle He Yang, how is Senior Hao Chen now?

395
00:29:35,837 --> 00:29:38,544
The sword that pierced him is made up of mythological objects.

396
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:41,750
It's very powerful. So, he's seriously injured now.

397
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,817
I think he'll have to rest for quite a while.

398
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:45,964
Can I go in and visit him then?

399
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:48,439
He... doesn't want to see you.

400
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:49,920
I...

401
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,218
Then, I'll wait for him here every day.

402
00:29:54,218 --> 00:29:57,460
Xuanji, even if you wait for him here every day,

403
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,770
he won't want to see you.

404
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,660
<i>Yu Sifeng, why did you break your promise?</i>

405
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,841
<i>Break my promise?</i>

406
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:28,896
<i>You are the one who knows about the secret tunnel and brought them in.</i>

407
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:32,997
<i>They are just demons.</i>

408
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,419
<i>What's wrong with killing demons?</i>

409
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:37,484
Senior Minyan.

410
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:40,029
Senior Minyan, finally, I found you.

411
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:43,177
You were practicing the New Triplets of Yaohua sword moves last time.

412
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:44,926
It was so beautiful.

413
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,664
I've practiced a long time based on my memory,

414
00:30:47,664 --> 00:30:49,379
but I can't get it right.

415
00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:52,545
Can you teach me?

416
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:55,354
I was just fooling around. Nothing to learn from me.

417
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,939
You better learn your basics first.

418
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:00,153
That New Triplets is cohesive and magnificent.

419
00:31:00,153 --> 00:31:02,499
How can you say that you were fooling around?

420
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:07,665
I'll practice here and you can just take a look at it.

421
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:34,419
Enough. You can't practice that New Triplets yet.

422
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:37,921
You can't be impatient with Shaoyang's sword practice. Take it step by step.

423
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:41,125
Most importantly, you have to have a clear heart and mind.

424
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,712
Go now.

425
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,567
When did you come here?

426
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,658
I was just looking for you.

427
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:19,578
You were practicing swords with Junior Wen Xuan?

428
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:21,617
I met her by chance.

429
00:32:21,617 --> 00:32:23,099
So, I gave her some advice.

430
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:24,959
Don't think too much.

431
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,957
I didn't think too much.

432
00:32:27,957 --> 00:32:31,528
Junior Wen Xuan is smart and has a good personality.

433
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:33,629
Everybody likes her.

434
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,143
Most importantly, she has a clear heart and mind.

435
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:39,595
She's different from me.

436
00:32:39,595 --> 00:32:41,979
Do you have to twist my words?

437
00:32:41,979 --> 00:32:43,859
Do you have to speak of yourself like this?

438
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:45,408
No.

439
00:32:45,408 --> 00:32:47,720
I was just thinking that

440
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:51,800
we shouldn't torture ourselves like this anymore.

441
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,761
I'm not the Chu Linglong whom you've once known.

442
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:57,957
I lived with demons in the past.

443
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:00,854
I committed grave sins.

444
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:04,446
I'm not worthy of you to like me anymore.

445
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,251
Torture each other?

446
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:11,175
Linglong, I really don't understand.

447
00:33:11,175 --> 00:33:15,424
When did your relationship become like this to you?

448
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:17,338
I beg you.

449
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:20,112
Can you stop assuming my thoughts for me?

450
00:33:20,112 --> 00:33:24,285
Linglong, what can I say? How can I assure you?

451
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:27,185
What should I do to make you understand?

452
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:30,201
Didn't we agree that everything was already in the past?

453
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,521
Isn't "everything is in the past"

454
00:33:34,242 --> 00:33:36,642
the greatest lie of all?

455
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,896
Everything has already happened.

456
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,299
Nobody will ever forget about that.

457
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:51,475
You don't know that you are the only one who still lives in that abyss.

458
00:33:51,475 --> 00:33:53,322
You won't forgive yourself.

459
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,652
You won't trust me.

460
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,770
What else... can I do?

461
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:34,096
I can't find it.

462
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:39,300
The scrolls of the Asuras should be here,

463
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,948
but no matter how I dig for it,

464
00:34:44,948 --> 00:34:50,745
I can't find the records of that Devil Star, Devil Maleficent.

465
00:35:00,946 --> 00:35:06,505
This smell is the incense that King Bailing always uses in his study room.

466
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:13,509
King Bailing reads about the information on the demon clan as well?

467
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:18,211
Could it be that I missed it just now?

468
00:35:50,002 --> 00:35:51,670
I found it.

469
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,350
<i>[God of War]</i>

470
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,400
Devil Star?

471
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,979
No.

472
00:35:59,979 --> 00:36:03,181
This is the record of the God of War.

473
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,534
King Bailing read about it, too.

474
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:11,669
This is strange.

475
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:16,115
They said that the God of War killed the Devil Star,

476
00:36:16,746 --> 00:36:19,570
but why isn't it recorded here?

477
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:24,619
Why is the origin of the God of War not recorded inside this scroll?

478
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:28,240
Could it be that King Bailing kept it for himself?

479
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:39,600
Is the road of enemies narrow or...

480
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,739
No.

481
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:43,839
I came here to find you when I smelled you.

482
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,907
My little obedient Teng She,

483
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:47,539
what have you been doing lately?

484
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,867
I couldn't even sense you at all.

485
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:52,957
Tell me. Where did you go?

486
00:36:57,808 --> 00:36:59,153
I didn't go anywhere.

487
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:01,746
I was just sleeping inside here.

488
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,889
You've been here all along?

489
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,980
Yes. This place is nice.

490
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,699
Old Guy knows how to enjoy himself best.

491
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:10,268
Siming Hall is quiet and cooling.

492
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:15,103
When I wake up, I just need to take a scroll and I'll have a story.

493
00:37:15,103 --> 00:37:17,624
I've been reading about this lately.

494
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,760
<i>[ILLUSTRATION OF FOUR SACRED BEASTS: GREEN DRAGON]</i>

495
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,393
What is it?

496
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,984
You've been reading this?

497
00:37:37,984 --> 00:37:39,645
Me?

498
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,277
I never thought that you admired me so much.

499
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,090
Wrong!

500
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,859
I was just curious.

501
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:53,732
Here. Open it and take a good look.

502
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:56,779
Look at you in the past and look at you now.

503
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:59,459
Look at it and reflect on yourself.

504
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:03,743
How did you become such a mess?

505
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,219
You are still drinking tea so leisurely here.

506
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:22,282
You want to enter the Demon Citadel?

507
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,304
Come. Tell me. How are you going to enter it?

508
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,199
You are not the Devil Star.

509
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:33,698
So, I need the knowledgeable Eldest Brother Liu and Ting Nu to think of a solution for me.

510
00:38:33,698 --> 00:38:37,660
I have to survive in the Demon Citadel so that my cover will not be blown.

511
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,795
So, you are not the Devil Star.

512
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,109
Little Sifeng, when did you learn how to lie?

513
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:51,618
You even lied to me.

514
00:38:54,202 --> 00:38:56,470
Who is the Devil Star then?

515
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,801
How would I know?

516
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:02,719
But this identity is quite useful.

517
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:10,059
Little Sifeng, you are indeed a good boy that is courageous and smart.

518
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:14,182
Now, I have even more confidence in you.

519
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,360
Little Sifeng, I want to enter the Demon Citadel with you.

520
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,482
I've used 1,000 years to try to save Wu Zhiqi.

521
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:30,041
I can't sit out during this critical moment.

522
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:33,519
Okay. Hide outside of the Demon Citadel then.

523
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:36,689
When the seal of the Demon Citadel is broken, use that chance to get in.

524
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:39,270
Just make sure that Yuan Lang won't sense you there.

525
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,276
Hold on.

526
00:39:42,276 --> 00:39:44,619
You are serious?

527
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,283
You really want to enter the Demon Citadel?

528
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:50,523
Do you think that the Demon Citadel is a fun place?

529
00:39:50,523 --> 00:39:53,019
Malignant auras swirl around inside it.

530
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:55,763
It's full of malignant spirits of Asuras that have lost their minds.

531
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:59,709
You are not from the demon clan. You'll die inside.

532
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:04,233
I can prepare some medicine for you

533
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:06,619
to help you recover from the attack of malignant auras,

534
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,899
but it can only relieve it for a moment.

535
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:11,386
I don't know how long it'll last.

536
00:40:11,386 --> 00:40:13,397
Okay. That's enough.

537
00:40:13,397 --> 00:40:17,848
With my 12 Feathers and her 1000-year-old cultivation, we'll manage.

538
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,911
- Thank you. <br> - Why are you thanking him?

539
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:21,430
Why are you such a busybody?

540
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,820
I–

541
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:26,173
Little Phoenix, you've already thought it through, right?

542
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,859
Are you really going to release Wu Zhiqi?

543
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:30,059
Will he help you if you release him?

544
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:32,379
Of course, he'll help Little Sifeng.

545
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:34,728
Wu Zhiqi is a person who can distinguish kindness and hatred.

546
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:37,074
By saving him, he'll be indebted to Little Sifeng.

547
00:40:37,074 --> 00:40:39,683
Wu Zhiqi will definitely pay him back.

548
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,756
So, you've made up your mind.

549
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:52,632
Fine. I can't control you.

550
00:40:52,632 --> 00:40:53,899
I don't care anymore.

551
00:40:53,899 --> 00:40:57,810
If you want to go, go ahead. Good luck.

552
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:06,539
But you have to be careful after you go in.

553
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:07,853
Keep calm.

554
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:11,801
Any movement will wake the malignant spirits of Asuras inside it.

555
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:14,019
Don't die inside there.

556
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:17,407
Okay. Don't worry, Eldest Brother Liu.

557
00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:19,728
No matter how adverse the situation is,

558
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,749
I'll come out from it alive.

559
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:25,773
Senior, I'm here to visit you.

560
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:29,859
Today is the fifth year since you brought me to Xuyang Peak to train.

561
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:33,033
If you still won't talk to me, I'll stay here.

562
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:35,179
I'm a nobody.

563
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:37,744
I'm not worthy enough to be the senior of the God of War.

564
00:41:37,744 --> 00:41:40,576
It's too much for such a powerful being to visit me.

565
00:41:40,576 --> 00:41:42,134
Go back.

566
00:41:42,134 --> 00:41:45,200
- Senior. <br> - Leave.

567
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,612
Senior, your injury...

568
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:51,281
Let me treat you.

569
00:41:51,281 --> 00:41:53,368
I don't need it.

570
00:41:53,368 --> 00:41:57,563
You don't really care about me anyway.

571
00:41:57,563 --> 00:41:59,539
No need to force yourself.

572
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:01,048
It's not like that.

573
00:42:01,048 --> 00:42:03,328
I went to your room every day to ask for you.

574
00:42:03,328 --> 00:42:05,179
I'm always worried about your injuries.

575
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:08,742
I've never forgotten about you for even a day.

576
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,906
What about Yu Sifeng?

577
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,329
I–

578
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:17,032
Have you let go of him yet?

579
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,340
Looks like you haven't.

580
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,046
Since the Sentimental Tactics have been broken,

581
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:27,939
we can't practice it anymore,

582
00:42:27,939 --> 00:42:32,657
and our master's dream will never be fulfilled.

583
00:42:32,657 --> 00:42:38,555
But in your heart, you still can't let go of that devil, Yu Sifeng.

584
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,326
I promise you.

585
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,697
Next time... When I see him again the next time,

586
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,762
I won't be lenient anymore.

587
00:42:49,898 --> 00:42:51,798
Next time?

588
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,322
Will you be able to do it next time?

589
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,456
I just need some time.

590
00:43:03,002 --> 00:43:04,742
Okay.

591
00:43:06,778 --> 00:43:09,165
Tell me then.

592
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:11,478
How long do you need?

593
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,356
It's going to take you forever, right?

594
00:43:16,356 --> 00:43:21,384
Xuanji, you are just going to turn into a demon just like him.

595
00:43:21,384 --> 00:43:24,521
Have you forgotten about the grudge for your mother and your master?

596
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:27,219
Have you forgotten about Auntie Yinghong's injuries?

597
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:31,569
He lied to you again and again and yet you want to give him time.

598
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:34,717
What is it? Are you hoping that he can do more evil

599
00:43:34,717 --> 00:43:38,260
or do you hope that he can hurt more of us?

600
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:45,587
I'm the one who worries and cares about you.

601
00:43:45,587 --> 00:43:48,417
I am the one who is destined to marry you.

602
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,019
But why?

603
00:43:50,019 --> 00:43:56,000
Why are you so obsessed with a devil who lied to you again and again?

604
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,520
Do you think that you still have a lot of chances?

605
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,927
There are no more chances, Chu Xuanji.

606
00:44:04,338 --> 00:44:06,793
You have only this one chance,

607
00:44:06,793 --> 00:44:10,284
and I have only this one chance as well.

608
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,290
Senior, what is the meaning of this?

609
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,580
What I mean is,

610
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,881
Yu Sifeng has become your demon.

611
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:30,450
If you can't defeat this demon, you'll sacrifice everything.

612
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,985
Forget it.

613
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,060
If you are not willing to avenge your master,

614
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:41,075
I'll do it.

615
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:43,223
I'll do it myself.

616
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,526
Senior!

617
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,678
Don't be like this.

618
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,411
I'll go.

619
00:44:53,411 --> 00:44:55,095
Wait.

620
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,129
Where are you going?

621
00:45:01,054 --> 00:45:03,080
Lize Palace.

622
