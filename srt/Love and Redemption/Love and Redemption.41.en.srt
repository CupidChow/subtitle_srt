00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,512
Where is Little Phoenix?

19
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,533
He must have gone to look for Xuanji.

20
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:53,452
What answer will Xuanji give Sifeng?

21
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:57,000
Since Xuanji chose to come here to find Sifeng,

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,815
I think she believes in him.

23
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,833
Xuanji.

24
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:53,440
Xuanji.

25
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,304
Sifeng!

26
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:04,562
Where are you going?

27
00:03:04,562 --> 00:03:07,575
Xuanji is missing. Something must have happened to her.

28
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:09,779
- I'll go and look for her. <br> - Sifeng!

29
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:13,302
She is the God of War. She is so powerful. Nothing will happen to her.

30
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:17,041
Sifeng, don't be so foolish.

31
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,735
Look. What is this?

32
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:25,935
Why is this hairpin with you?

33
00:03:26,637 --> 00:03:28,815
I picked it up from the floor.

34
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,939
Sifeng, don't you understand?

35
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,326
She left and she threw away the hairpin you gave her.

36
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:53,994
She's making a clean break with you!

37
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,665
This Chu Xuanji is really...

38
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:05,938
<i>Fire!</i>

39
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:07,408
Sifeng.

40
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,998
Are you okay?

41
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:15,959
What happened? Why is there a huge fire?

42
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,719
Stop talking. Let's get out!

43
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,620
- Yes! Let's go! <br> - Let's go!

44
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,330
We can't get out! There's a barrier here!

45
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,629
This blue flame is the Ninth Heaven Fire.

46
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:39,819
Ninth Heaven Fire?

47
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,855
Only the God of War can conjure it.

48
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,321
It must be Chu Xuanji. She is trying to trap us here.

49
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,580
Nonsense.

50
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,804
Sifeng, stop being so foolish.

51
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:54,712
Hurry up. Let's break the barrier together!

52
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,013
Dang Kang.

53
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,905
<i>Xuanji, since you still love him, I can only do this.</i>

54
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,318
<i>This is for your own good.</i>

55
00:05:42,318 --> 00:05:45,539
King Bailing, this is bad!

56
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,158
What is it?

57
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:50,412
After God of War was awakened, her life pillar was restored.

58
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:54,891
I don't know why but suddenly evil spreads out from it.

59
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,074
It looks like it's unavoidable now.

60
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:09,859
I'm just worried that

61
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:14,025
a demon will rise inside her because of her unhappy relationship.

62
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,778
If this continues and the demon takes over her heart,

63
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:19,139
she'll fall into the path of the devil.

64
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,733
If that happens, she won't be able to go back to the heavens.

65
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,541
If she can kill Yu Sifeng without a doubt,

66
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,365
there won't be any demon inside her.

67
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:32,859
She is obsessed with love and is crippled by it.

68
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,900
She is indecisive. That's why it has turned into an obsession.

69
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:42,200
Looks like my decision to do this for her...

70
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
is right.

71
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:50,513
Are you going to kill that Rose Gold Bird

72
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:53,693
to get rid of the obstacle for her?

73
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:56,259
It's just a fire.

74
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:59,738
It won't be able to trap a 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird.

75
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:05,939
Moreover, since this is her demon, Xuanji has to kill him herself

76
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:08,554
in order to defeat that demon.

77
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,618
Then you are doing this to

78
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,320
break the affection between God of War and Yu Sifeng?

79
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,859
This is the only way.

80
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,841
At first, I didn't want to awaken the God of War.

81
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:29,119
I just wanted Xuanji to follow the path of Heaven

82
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:33,859
and go back to the heavens with a new identity and memory.

83
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:37,475
But I was unable to stop it from happening.

84
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:40,595
If that's the case,

85
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:43,219
I can only let her

86
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:47,340
get rid of those demons to help her build up her merits.

87
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:53,401
You've really bestowed great care upon the God of War.

88
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:58,162
Luckily, she has finally seen that demon's true color now.

89
00:07:58,162 --> 00:08:02,904
So, your effort will be paid off soon.

90
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:16,467
Come with me. I have to talk to you.

91
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:17,854
Father.

92
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:23,729
Sifeng, you are hurt.

93
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,098
- She has injured you so deeply. <br> - I'm fine.

94
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:29,169
Ninth Heaven Fire is powerful.

95
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,290
Take this medicine and use it at once.

96
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,240
Sifeng.

97
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,032
She is trying to kill you.

98
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:44,410
Xuanji will not stab someone in the back.

99
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,140
You don't believe me? Tell me then.

100
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,906
Where did the Ninth Heaven Fire come from?

101
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:50,662
How do you explain the hairpin?

102
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:53,322
I know. She's just trying to keep you here

103
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:55,620
and burn you to death with Ninth Heaven Fire, right?

104
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,419
Nonsense. There are so many of us here.

105
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:00,436
Was she trying to kill us all as well?

106
00:09:00,436 --> 00:09:02,339
Don't forget. She is the God of War.

107
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,268
Demons are her sworn enemies since 1,000 years ago.

108
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:07,289
Now that she has awakened, she'll do anything to kill us.

109
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:08,938
She is the God of War,

110
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:11,103
but she is still Xuanji.

111
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:14,054
- Sifeng. <br> - There must be a misunderstanding.

112
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,539
But where has Xuanji gone?

113
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:21,545
Could it be that people from Shaoyang Sect found her

114
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:23,595
and brought her back?

115
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,138
If that's the case,

116
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:29,667
I don't know if they'll make things difficult for her.

117
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:32,111
It'll be bad if they lock her up at Mingxia Cave again.

118
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:33,590
No, I have to go to Shaoyang Sect.

119
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,032
Sifeng, you can't go!

120
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,666
They know that you are a demon.

121
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:40,070
If you go there now, they'll kill you.

122
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,810
I still haven't gotten the answer to the promise I made with her yesterday.

123
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,179
I have to go and ask her.

124
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:49,819
Fine. Even if you want to go, wait until you've recovered.

125
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:54,288
Yes. If you want to go, we'll all go with you.

126
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:57,579
Shaoyang Sect is heavily guarded now. It'll be more convenient if I go alone.

127
00:09:57,579 --> 00:09:59,699
Sifeng, don't go.

128
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,393
This is my personal matter.

129
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,807
Just wait here for me. No need to follow me.

130
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,344
Sifeng!

131
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,347
Kneel!

132
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:20,422
Don't forget that your mother

133
00:10:20,422 --> 00:10:23,419
died in the hands of Rose Gold Bird from Lize Palace.

134
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,009
And now, you went to find him again?

135
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:28,545
Is this how you repay your mother?

136
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,077
Father.

137
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,025
There are good people and bad people.

138
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:34,747
Same with demons.

139
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:37,135
The Rose Gold Bird who killed my mother is not Sifeng,

140
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:40,339
and he promised me that he'd find the killer for me.

141
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,385
I don't want to put all the hate on him.

142
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:45,526
I want to believe in him again.

143
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:48,809
Insolent girl!

144
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:50,019
Sect Leader.

145
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,219
Since the beginning, humans and demons have been sworn enemies.

146
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,879
Although you had a relationship with him before, you should forget about it now.

147
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,107
Don't forget that you are the God of War.

148
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:01,084
It's your mission to kill demons.

149
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:04,455
Do you know how big your responsibility is?

150
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,298
I should just slaughter all demons because I'm the God of War?

151
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:12,059
Even if I am the God of War, I can distinguish right from wrong. I feel pain.

152
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:14,075
If you want me to be a demon-killing machine,

153
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:15,768
I'd rather not be the God of War.

154
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:17,237
You...

155
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,489
- Sect Leader. <br> - Father.

156
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:22,657
You still haven't recovered, don't be so reckless.

157
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,488
Xuanji, apologize to your father now.

158
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:29,823
He was hurt by those Rose Gold Bird demons.

159
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,384
He still hasn't recovered yet.

160
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:34,838
Father, I–

161
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:36,718
Great.

162
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:41,816
Now, you don't even listen to your own father.

163
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:44,323
If you still want to find a demon,

164
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:48,596
from now on, don't call me father anymore.

165
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:49,786
Father!

166
00:11:49,786 --> 00:11:54,128
If you still respect me as your father,

167
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:57,779
swear to God right now that from now on,

168
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,305
you'll focus on getting rid of demons

169
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:02,522
to protect the people in this world.

170
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,761
Father, I...

171
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,371
- Do you... <br> - Father.

172
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:10,921
...want to see your own father die in front of you?

173
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:12,328
Father!

174
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:13,570
Xuanji.

175
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,730
Fine, I swear.

176
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,911
From now on,

177
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:23,139
I'll focus on getting rid of demons

178
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:25,065
to protect the people in this world.

179
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:28,369
Say that from now on, you'll break up

180
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:30,937
with Yu Sifeng and never see him again.

181
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:33,259
- Father! <br> - Swear it!

182
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,599
- I– <br> - Now, every sect in this world looks up to you for direction,

183
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,965
but you are still entangled with that demon.

184
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:44,215
By doing so, you've betrayed a lot of people's trust in you.

185
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,564
Swear it!

186
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:51,686
Fine.

187
00:12:51,686 --> 00:12:55,050
Since I can't control my own daughter,

188
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,270
I can only...

189
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,595
I can only appease the wrath of the world with my death!

190
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:02,299
- Father! <br> - Sect Leader!

191
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:03,796
Don't do that, Sect Leader.

192
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:06,692
Xuanji, how long are you going to be so foolish?

193
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:09,009
If you continue to be like this, not only sect leader,

194
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:12,064
even our master will not think of you as his disciple anymore!

195
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,482
<i>I believe that Si Feng will not lie to me anymore,</i>

196
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:20,445
<i>but I don't want to make Father angry.</i>

197
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:23,520
<i>Don't take my swear seriously later, God.</i>

198
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,932
<i>Just act like you didn't hear anything.</i>

199
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:34,836
I swear that from now on,

200
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:37,744
I'll get rid of demons with everybody

201
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:40,377
and break up with Sifeng.

202
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:43,574
If I break my promise, I'll...

203
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,059
I'll...

204
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:49,693
I'll be struck by lightning and lose all my six senses again.

205
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:52,689
No, you have to swear an oath.

206
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:54,641
Swear an oath on your father.

207
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:58,446
If you break your oath, your father

208
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:02,799
will be ripped to death on the street.

209
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,380
- Father! <br> - Swear it!

210
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,905
Do you have to force me like this?

211
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:08,809
Or else, don't call me Father ever again!

212
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:10,596
Sect Leader.

213
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:14,017
Okay.

214
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:17,917
I swear that...

215
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:23,859
I'll focus on killing demons and break up with Yu Sifeng.

216
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:26,165
If I break my oath,

217
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,648
my...

218
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:31,934
my father will be ripped to death.

219
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:39,209
Xuanji, remember your oath today.

220
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,233
Remember your mission as the God of War.

221
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:47,035
I know.

222
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:51,016
What should you do when you see Yu Sifeng again in the future?

223
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:58,576
We'll be sworn enemies.

224
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,146
<i>So...</i>

225
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:04,584
<i>So, you left the broken silver hairpin</i>

226
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:07,464
<i>because you are really going to break up with me.</i>

227
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,065
<i>And yet, I'm so insensible to come here.</i>

228
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:13,574
Who is it?

229
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:40,823
<i>I'll focus on killing demons</i>

230
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:43,559
<i>and break up with Yu Sifeng.</i>

231
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:47,692
<i>What should you do when you see Yu Sifeng again in the future?</i>

232
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,793
<i>We'll be sworn enemies.</i>

233
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:52,507
<i>Xuanji.</i>

234
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,065
<i>Since you've made up your mind,</i>

235
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:58,762
<i>I won't make things difficult for you.</i>

236
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,322
It's indeed guarded by Candle Dragon.

237
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,537
Ruo Yu?

238
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,644
Ruo Yu.

239
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:54,461
I thought you fell off the cliff.

240
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:03,776
You are working for Deputy Chief.

241
00:17:06,763 --> 00:17:08,943
It's too late.

242
00:17:09,523 --> 00:17:11,459
But since you are here,

243
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,456
help me with this.

244
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:40,236
<i>This is...</i>

245
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:44,053
<i>Wolf has gone to the secret ground of Shaoyang before.</i>

246
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:46,799
<i>The spirit of an ancient Candle Dragon is guarding it.</i>

247
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,421
<i>Outsiders cannot go near it.</i>

248
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:50,099
<i>The coins in your hand</i>

249
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:53,558
<i>is a weapon that has soaked up all energy for 1,000 years in the Water of Forgetting.</i>

250
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,793
<i>It can keep all spirits at bay.</i>

251
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:59,833
<i>If you can find the Crystal Lamp from Shaoyang's secret ground this time,</i>

252
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:03,712
<i>I'll let you meet your sister again.</i>

253
00:18:41,694 --> 00:18:44,039
This is bad! Someone is getting into the secret ground!

254
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:55,513
Don't you dare touch the Crystal Lamp.

255
00:18:55,513 --> 00:18:57,461
Xuanji hurt you so deeply.

256
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:59,529
Why are you still protecting Shaoyang?

257
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:01,076
Ruo Yu,

258
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:05,365
if the Devil Star is revived, the world will be in chaos.

259
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:08,774
The world?

260
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:11,074
I just want to live in peace.

261
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,897
The world is none of my concern.

262
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:31,022
Spirit of Heaven, gold from Eight Diagram, break this Greedy Wolf!

263
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,673
- Sifeng. <br> - It's you again, Yu Sifeng!

264
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:52,465
Sifeng, why are you here?

265
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:54,099
Do you need to ask?

266
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:57,346
He broke into the secret ground of Shaoyang and hurt the spirit of the Candle Dragon.

267
00:19:57,346 --> 00:19:59,024
He's here to take the Crystal Lamp.

268
00:19:59,024 --> 00:20:00,879
No. Sifeng wouldn't do that.

269
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,721
How do you explain his appearance here then?

270
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:05,956
He has completely destroyed the spirit of the Candle Dragon.

271
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,729
He's really powerful.

272
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:11,959
Sifeng, tell me. Why are you here?

273
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,289
Didn't you say that you wouldn't lie to me again?

274
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:15,910
I didn't lie to you.

275
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:18,433
I didn't mean to destroy it.

276
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,622
Stop trying to lie to us.

277
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:22,424
If you didn't plan this ahead,

278
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:26,196
why would you have the formation to trap the spirit of Candle Dragon?

279
00:20:28,537 --> 00:20:29,951
Sifeng,

280
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:35,451
you are really here for the Crystal Lamp.

281
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,369
So, this is how you think of me.

282
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:49,459
Because I'm a demon and since I'm here,

283
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:52,113
it must be because I'm here for the Crystal Lamp, right?

284
00:20:53,258 --> 00:20:54,952
I was too foolish.

285
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:59,458
Since you left without goodbyes, that is your answer.

286
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,659
Why did I come here to find you?

287
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:03,729
No. I left without goodbyes because I...

288
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,690
I didn't want to take the Crystal Lamp.

289
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:09,017
I found Ruo Yu here.

290
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,093
At first, I wanted to stop him.

291
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:13,874
I never thought that he would plot against me.

292
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:17,506
It was just an accident that the spirit of the Candle Dragon was destroyed.

293
00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:20,059
Ruo Yu?

294
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:22,353
I saw him fall off the cliff.

295
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:23,739
Why would he be here?

296
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:27,259
Ruo Yu is not dead. He has been working for Deputy Chief.

297
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:28,919
How did that happen?

298
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,617
How can I believe any of you ever again?

299
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:34,880
Stop lying.

300
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,539
The 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird demons are very powerful.

301
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:41,289
It's impossible that a disciple of Lize Palace would be able to defy them.

302
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:45,364
Yu Sifeng, don't use a dead man as an excuse.

303
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:49,299
Sifeng, tell me. Why are you here? Explain it to me now.

304
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:51,980
You said that you wouldn't lie to me again.

305
00:21:54,686 --> 00:21:57,384
What's the point of me explaining myself?

306
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,659
You already have your own answer.

307
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:01,226
Why are you asking me again?

308
00:22:01,226 --> 00:22:03,709
We've let you escape so many times.

309
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:06,696
Today, I'll take you down!

310
00:22:06,696 --> 00:22:09,408
- Xuanji! <br> - Don't hurt him.

311
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,114
You are still protecting him at this time?

312
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:13,720
Have you forgotten what you promised me just now?

313
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,321
I'm not protecting him. I...

314
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:19,059
I suddenly remember that Sifeng is 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird.

315
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:20,537
He has always been important to Lize Palace.

316
00:22:20,537 --> 00:22:23,726
He might be useful to us if we spare him for now.

317
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:25,979
Don't think that I don't know what you are thinking.

318
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:28,375
Today, I won't let him go!

319
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,496
- Master. <br> - Wait.

320
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:35,580
Junior, what Xuanji said just now makes sense.

321
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,977
The Rose Gold Bird is heavily wounded anyway.

322
00:22:38,977 --> 00:22:41,358
We can keep him in Mingxia Cave first.

323
00:22:41,358 --> 00:22:45,564
With the formation and situation there, I don't think he can escape.

324
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:49,874
Let him have a taste of that bone-deep pain first.

325
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:54,490
When the other sect leaders are here, we can decide together.

326
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,619
Now, the spirit of the Candle Spirit has been destroyed.

327
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:03,578
The barrier of the secret ground is broken.

328
00:23:03,578 --> 00:23:05,745
The demons have already taken all the spirit keys.

329
00:23:05,745 --> 00:23:08,579
We can't let anything happen to the Crystal Lamp.

330
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,611
But with the barrier gone,

331
00:23:10,611 --> 00:23:14,120
it'll be hard for us to keep this Crystal Lamp safe.

332
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,496
This...

333
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:18,855
What should we do?

334
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:24,259
Master, I remember that

335
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:26,905
the great master of Xuyang Peak has written down a formation

336
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,775
to summon the spirit of the Candle Dragon.

337
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,113
That's right.

338
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,659
We do have a secret art

339
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:35,961
that can summon another Dragon Candle's spirit.

340
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:38,903
But for the past thousands of years,

341
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:41,348
nothing has ever happened to the Candle Dragon in the secret ground.

342
00:23:41,348 --> 00:23:46,666
So nobody has ever used this formation before.

343
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,649
But don't worry.

344
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:52,490
I'll do my best to summon it.

345
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:56,855
We'll be counting on you then, Senior Heng Yang.

346
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,019
This is not a normal formation.

347
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:03,831
I need to cast a spell to Heaven for three days straight.

348
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:10,591
Hao Chen, go to Xuyang Peak to summon all the other protectors here

349
00:24:10,591 --> 00:24:12,465
to help me protect the formation.

350
00:24:12,465 --> 00:24:13,860
Yes, Master.

351
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,327
<i>No wonder Xuanji</i>

352
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:58,080
<i>didn't want to come back here no matter what back then.</i>

353
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:10,419
What's wrong? Why can't I feel Sifeng anymore?

354
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:14,299
Little Silver Flower, can you stop pacing around? I'm getting dizzy from it.

355
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:16,447
I think Little Phoenix purposely

356
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,246
cut the bond because you were too annoying.

357
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:19,896
This is none of your business!

358
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:21,901
Sifeng is very cunning,

359
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:25,765
and Xuanji wouldn't let anything happen to her lover.

360
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,099
Now, I'm more worried about the spirit keys.

361
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:32,224
Yuan Lang has already gathered all four spirit keys.

362
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:36,100
If that's the case, he'll be targeting Wu Zhiqi next.

363
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,770
No. I can't let him do that.

364
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,854
- I have to go to Lize Palace now. <br> - Purple Fox–

365
00:25:39,854 --> 00:25:43,113
How are you going to defeat Yuan Lang and the others if you go there alone?

366
00:25:43,113 --> 00:25:45,469
Who said I'm going to fight them?

367
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:48,930
I'm going to find a way to steal those keys.

368
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,772
Yes. Good idea.

369
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:55,002
We'll steal those spirit keys out in secret.

370
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:57,681
Then, that creepy deputy chief won't be able to do anything about it,

371
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,961
and he can't force those innocent people in Lize Palace to a corner.

372
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:02,410
Good. Just steal them.

373
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,195
I have a secret tunnel that can lead you to Lize Palace. I'll draw a map for you.

374
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:10,005
I know that no one can stop you when it comes to Wu Zhiqi.

375
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,030
Dang Kang.

376
00:26:14,632 --> 00:26:15,937
Bring Dang Kang with you.

377
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:18,887
If you are in danger, Dang Kang can get you out.

378
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:22,033
Nothing will happen to me.

379
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:27,753
But since you are so kind to offer it, I'll bring it with me then.

380
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,699
Be careful.

381
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:31,174
Here's the map.

382
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,249
Thank you.

383
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:34,947
I'll get going then.

384
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,945
I never thought those demons would be so persistent.

385
00:26:40,945 --> 00:26:42,879
They just stole the spirit key of Dianjing Valley.

386
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,899
Then, they came here to steal the Crystal Lamp from Shaoyang's secret ground.

387
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:46,834
They are too unruly.

388
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:48,179
I'm afraid that Tianxu Hall

389
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,099
is bringing those keys to open the Dimension Chain.

390
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:53,105
Once they've gotten Juntian Hoop and Chehai Hook,

391
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:56,033
they'll gather their forces to attack the secret ground of Shaoyang.

392
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:59,509
The keyhole of the Dimension Chain is at the Demon Citadel in Mount Buzhou.

393
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:02,033
I don't think they'll unlock the Dimension Chain yet.

394
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:03,601
Demon Citadel?

395
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:07,361
The world that was led by the Asuras more than 1,000 years ago?

396
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:09,880
Yes. If they want to go there,

397
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,632
they have to wait for Fenru City's gate to open on the 15th of every month.

398
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:17,446
So, we still have time to get back the spirit keys.

399
00:27:17,446 --> 00:27:20,108
Now, we have Yu Sifeng in our hands.

400
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:23,917
Actually, we can exchange him for those spirit keys from Lize Palace.

401
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:26,699
These demons have been plotting this for centuries.

402
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:29,059
Do you think they'll ruin it for one person?

403
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:31,217
But he's the 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird.

404
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,277
He's very useful for those demons.

405
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:36,419
Even if we can't exchange him for the four keys, we can get at least one.

406
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,739
- Then, we can stop them for a while. <br> - That's right.

407
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:40,099
If that's the case,

408
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:43,177
I'll ask Min Xing to send a letter to Lize Palace tomorrow.

409
00:27:43,177 --> 00:27:46,670
I'll ask them to exchange the spirit key for Yu Sifeng's life.

410
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,259
Sect Leader, you can ask Minyan to go with Min Xing.

411
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:52,179
Although he is no longer Shaoyang's disciple,

412
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:54,806
he has fought many times with Tianxu Hall.

413
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,659
He knows how to deal with them.

414
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:59,537
I think it'll be better if he goes with Min Xing.

415
00:27:59,537 --> 00:28:00,928
Okay.

416
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,979
Where is the hairpin?

417
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:18,121
Why is it missing?

418
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:25,458
<i>Since you left without goodbyes, that is your answer.</i>

419
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:27,952
<i>Why did I come here to find you?</i>

420
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,242
Sifeng.

421
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,059
Sifeng must have accidentally

422
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:34,681
gone into the secret ground because he was here for me.

423
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:38,099
That must be it. That must be it.

424
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,859
Xuanji, where are you going?

425
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:43,539
I'm hungry.

426
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,673
- I want to eat something. <br> - Are you going to visit Yu Sifeng?

427
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:49,658
- Linglong... <br> - You haven't given up hope on him, right?

428
00:28:49,658 --> 00:28:51,759
I won't let you go out. You won't be going anywhere.

429
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:54,356
Fine. I won't go. I won't go anywhere.

430
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:56,769
Calm down. I'll go back to my room now.

431
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:58,410
Calm down.

432
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,313
<i>Xuanji.</i>

433
00:29:25,074 --> 00:29:29,413
This is the Black Hole Cave that can absorb everything.

434
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:32,790
Do you think this petty thing will stop me?

435
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,755
Little Chef?

436
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:42,302
It's you.

437
00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:46,377
The stinky woman asked me to give you this package.

438
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:48,897
I was just thinking about how to go in.

439
00:29:48,897 --> 00:29:51,097
I don't need her pity.

440
00:29:53,314 --> 00:29:56,430
Are you upset that she's not here?

441
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,322
She can't leave because of her sister.

442
00:29:59,322 --> 00:30:01,886
So, she asked me to check on you.

443
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:03,260
But this is weird.

444
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,109
You are a 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird.

445
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:10,625
How can you be captured by some mortals? So embarrassing.

446
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,859
I've seen 12 Feathers Rose Gold Birds from 1,000 years ago.

447
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:15,179
They are not as weak as you.

448
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,225
Little Chef, why aren't you talking?

449
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:19,672
Are you feeling embarrassed?

450
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,899
By the way, the stinky woman wants me to ask you

451
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:24,885
about the ins and outs of the incident as well

452
00:30:24,886 --> 00:30:26,728
so that she can plead for you.

453
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:29,139
Tell us if you are in a difficult situation.

454
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:35,100
Since you can cook so well, I can consider helping you out, too.

455
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,877
<i>I swear that I'll focus on killing demons</i>

456
00:30:39,877 --> 00:30:42,468
<i>and break up with Yu Sifeng.</i>

457
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,180
<i>What should you do when you see Yu Sifeng again in the future?</i>

458
00:30:50,258 --> 00:30:52,396
<i>We'll be sworn enemies.</i>

459
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,383
Humans and demons are different.

460
00:30:58,203 --> 00:31:00,198
If she doesn't believe me,

461
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,007
I have nothing else to say.

462
00:31:10,362 --> 00:31:13,811
Why are you venting out your anger at me? You are so ungrateful.

463
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:15,600
I won't care about you.

464
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,336
I summoned all of you today to tell you something.

465
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,203
From now on, Tianxu Hall and Lize Palace are one.

466
00:32:15,203 --> 00:32:19,682
Lize Palace will help Tianxu Hall to complete their mission and revive the demon clan.

467
00:32:19,682 --> 00:32:21,312
In the future,

468
00:32:22,196 --> 00:32:24,996
you'll be the demon clan's meritorious subjects.

469
00:32:29,095 --> 00:32:32,039
Elder, we have a letter.

470
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,074
Deputy Chief,

471
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:40,979
there are two Shaoyang's disciples outside.

472
00:32:40,979 --> 00:32:42,878
They brought a letter.

473
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,974
<i>[We've seen through your plan. We've captured the Rose Gold Bird.]</i>

474
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,362
What does Shaoyang Sect want?

475
00:33:02,362 --> 00:33:04,785
Yu Sifeng has been captured by them.

476
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:10,100
Those sects want to exchange him for my spirit keys?

477
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:12,702
What a joke.

478
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:16,984
Deputy Chief, we have to find a way to save Sifeng.

479
00:33:16,984 --> 00:33:18,779
Save Sifeng?

480
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:22,971
He let himself get caught because of his obsession with the God of War.

481
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:24,628
What can we do about it?

482
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,494
Moreover, he's a Rose Gold Bird.

483
00:33:26,494 --> 00:33:29,875
If he can't even save himself from those mortals, why should we save him?

484
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:34,586
- But– <br> - Elder Luo, you are quite talkative today.

485
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,939
What about those two disciples?

486
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:44,579
They are outside.

487
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:46,290
Kill them.

488
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,610
Send their heads to Shaoyang Sect.

489
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:56,659
Tell them that they can do whatever they want to Yu Sifeng.

490
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,060
Yes.

491
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,459
What are you doing?

492
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:09,699
Do you think you can exchange Yu Sifeng for the spirit keys?

493
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,719
What a joke!

494
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,240
Deputy Chief has ordered us to behead you and send your heads back to Shaoyang!

495
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,580
Attack!

496
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,531
Come with me now!

497
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,240
<i>[Lize Palace]</i>

498
00:34:30,122 --> 00:34:31,859
Stop right there.

499
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,219
Who are you?

500
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:36,039
Senior, she is my friend.

501
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:38,671
But she was using a demonic spell just now.

502
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:40,230
What a dumb mortal.

503
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,259
At first, I didn't want to save you.

504
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:44,209
I was just passing by.

505
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:47,200
Since you are so ungrateful,

506
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,410
I'll eat you now.

507
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:52,859
Purple Fox, stop scaring my senior.

508
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:55,529
I heard from those stupid birds just now that

509
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:57,670
you caught Little Sifeng?

510
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:00,526
So, it's true.

511
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:07,655
Don't you know what kind of a person Little Sifeng is?

512
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:11,512
He cared not about his own safety to find Xuanji at Shaoyang Sect.

513
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:16,739
But you sects just caught him without any solid reason at all.

514
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,666
You even sent a letter in person

515
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,777
to exchange Sifeng for the spirit keys?

516
00:35:20,777 --> 00:35:22,979
What were you thinking?

517
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:26,722
But he was at Shaoyang's secret ground and destroyed the Candle Dragon.

518
00:35:26,722 --> 00:35:28,610
We didn't accuse him wrongly.

519
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:32,603
Did you see it with your own eyes?

520
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:36,446
Back then, you also accused me of killing those people in Zhongli City

521
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:40,207
without any solid reason as well, right?

522
00:35:41,387 --> 00:35:45,402
Now, I don't know what to believe and what not to believe.

523
00:35:45,402 --> 00:35:48,859
But to be truthful, I don't want anything to happen to Sifeng.

524
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:51,939
If Lize Palace accepted our offer,

525
00:35:51,939 --> 00:35:55,050
I could save Sifeng and get back the spirit keys.

526
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:59,226
As for others, it's out of my power to do anything about them.

527
00:36:00,516 --> 00:36:04,816
Are you dumb or are you too naive?

528
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:06,768
Do you think that despicable Yuan Lang

529
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:08,762
will take Sifeng as his friend?

530
00:36:08,762 --> 00:36:13,408
Or do you really think that he'll care about Sifeng's life?

531
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,561
It's our last solution to exchange Yu Sifeng for the spirit keys.

532
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:21,041
But now that they won't do that, what should we do then?

533
00:36:22,499 --> 00:36:23,761
Steal them.

534
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:26,746
Since you sects are so useless

535
00:36:26,746 --> 00:36:29,323
and let Yuan Lang take away your everything,

536
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:33,060
I can only do everything myself.

537
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,622
But now, I need your help.

538
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:40,354
I can't get into Lize Palace alone.

539
00:36:40,354 --> 00:36:42,019
You want us to help you?

540
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:43,720
Don't play tricks on us.

541
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,513
But do you have any other choice right now

542
00:36:47,513 --> 00:36:49,579
except working together with me?

543
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,568
Since you have no other way, we'll do it the usual way.

544
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:59,939
We'll find a way to get into Lize Palace first.

545
00:36:59,939 --> 00:37:02,057
Then, we'll split up to search for the keys.

546
00:37:02,057 --> 00:37:05,310
And the keys will belong to whoever finds the keys first.

547
00:37:06,379 --> 00:37:07,967
How about that?

548
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,098
This is the Kushui Prison.

549
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:27,620
After Kushui Prison, we'll reach Lize Palace.

550
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,020
Okay, let's go.

551
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,452
Wait.

552
00:37:30,452 --> 00:37:33,032
You have to carry me.

553
00:37:33,929 --> 00:37:36,595
The water in Kushui Prison has no effect on you

554
00:37:36,595 --> 00:37:38,003
but it's painful for demons,

555
00:37:38,003 --> 00:37:40,810
especially for us fox clan. It's deadly for us.

556
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,659
I can't even fly through it.

557
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:45,824
No wonder you need our help.

558
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:49,271
What is it? Are you shy?

559
00:37:50,364 --> 00:37:54,342
Who is the one who almost became my consort back then?

560
00:37:55,652 --> 00:37:58,346
If you say it again, aren't you afraid that I'll leave you behind

561
00:37:58,346 --> 00:37:59,619
and get the spirit keys myself?

562
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:01,699
I believe that you won't do that.

563
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:04,217
Stop talking. Carry me now.

564
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,074
Actually, I was biased towards you.

565
00:38:11,074 --> 00:38:13,559
That's why I always picked on you.

566
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,178
I only realized that

567
00:38:15,178 --> 00:38:17,979
you are a worthy friend after I thought that you were dead.

568
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:20,468
I'm not interested to become your friend.

569
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,298
But since you can drop your prejudice against me,

570
00:38:24,298 --> 00:38:27,208
shouldn't you trust Sifeng more?

571
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,499
Stop talking. Let's go.

572
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:36,409
Okay. Let's go.

573
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,499
Lize Palace is huge.

574
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:47,511
Where will they keep the spirit keys?

575
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:12,291
Master, according to my observation, both Luohou and Jidou

576
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:15,864
are moving again.

577
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,550
Both Luohou and Jidou are going to be aligned soon.

578
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,060
Yes.

579
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,019
Luohou and Jidou represent

580
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:32,064
the Devil Star's soul and primordial spirit respectively.

581
00:40:32,064 --> 00:40:36,379
But Luohou has already started to flash.

582
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:39,619
This means that the Devil Star's soul

583
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:43,179
has sensed his spirit that is on a trial right now.

584
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:46,800
He is calling out to his primordial spirit.

585
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,154
Looks like the Devil Star is going to be revived soon.

586
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:58,698
Congratulations, my master.

587
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:02,645
Even the sky is helping you to complete a grand mission.

588
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,136
<i>Who is it?</i>

589
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,309
Chase after them!

590
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,400
They are really dumb.

591
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,495
Little Pig, go and help them.

592
00:41:58,835 --> 00:42:00,911
You are Ting Nu's spirit beast, Dang Kang?

593
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,060
Purple Fox asked you to save us?

594
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,688
We've already exposed ourselves.

595
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:12,699
It'll be hard for us to go in again.

596
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:16,785
I hope that the Purple Fox can get the keys. Then, we'll still have a chance.

597
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:19,445
Just now, they said that the Devil Star is going to be revived soon.

598
00:42:19,445 --> 00:42:21,834
We have to tell Master about it at once.

599
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,283
Let's go.

600
00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:26,719
<i>[SHAOYANG]</i>

601
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,397
I never thought that those demons would be so cruel and cold-hearted.

602
00:42:29,397 --> 00:42:31,979
They don't even care about their own people.

603
00:42:31,979 --> 00:42:34,379
The Deputy Chief of Lize Palace has always picked on Sifeng.

604
00:42:34,379 --> 00:42:37,218
Maybe Sifeng is really not a part of their conspiracy.

605
00:42:37,218 --> 00:42:38,619
Minyan,

606
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:41,812
have you not suffered enough at the hands of the demons?

607
00:42:41,812 --> 00:42:43,579
Even if there's a wedge between them,

608
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:47,198
we still have to hunt those 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird demons down.

609
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:49,299
Master. My fellow sect leaders.

610
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:52,570
We found out more bad news when we went to Lize Palace.

611
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,741
There's a star map at Lize Palace.

612
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:59,939
It shows that both Luohou and Jidou are going to fuse together soon.

613
00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:02,143
As soon as they become one,

614
00:43:02,143 --> 00:43:05,506
it means that the Devil Star is going to be revived.

615
00:43:05,506 --> 00:43:08,899
Sect Leader! This is bad!

616
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:10,539
I just came back from the secret ground.

617
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:13,579
Senior Heng Yang is leading the disciples to invite the Candle Dragon.

618
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:15,859
But the demonic flame of the Crystal Lamp is getting stronger.

619
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,730
Senior Heng Yang tried his best to suppress it, but he is hurt internally.

620
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,499
How is he now?

621
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:23,139
I've already transferred some energy to him. He's fine now.

622
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:26,434
He's still performing the ritual to invite the spirit of the Candle Dragon.

623
00:43:26,434 --> 00:43:28,459
There's an anomaly in the flame of the Crystal Lamp.

624
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:30,659
Could it be that the Devil Star is really going to be revived?

625
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:33,048
No wonder these demons are so fearless.

626
00:43:33,048 --> 00:43:36,459
We have to find a way to intimidate them as a warning.

627
00:43:36,459 --> 00:43:39,568
If that's the case, let's form a formation

628
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:41,419
and ask the God of War to take the lead

629
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:43,893
and kill that Rose Gold Bird with her own hands.

630
00:43:43,893 --> 00:43:46,363
Then, take his demonic core and show it to those demons

631
00:43:46,363 --> 00:43:48,419
to show us our might!

632
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:52,579
But the God of War was very close to Yu Sifeng before this.

633
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:56,019
She couldn't even attack him before this. Now,

634
00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:58,301
will she be able to kill him?

635
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:01,179
Xuanji was tricked by the demon that day.

636
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:02,779
She couldn't accept it so suddenly.

637
00:44:02,779 --> 00:44:05,179
But she has already made a promise in front of everyone.

638
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:08,346
She'll lead us to defeat those demons.

639
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:12,091
I believe that she will be firm this time.

640
00:44:12,091 --> 00:44:14,262
If we want to extract the demonic core, we need the Demon Prison Formation

641
00:44:14,262 --> 00:44:17,341
in order to trap that 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird.

642
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:20,751
If you are worried, I'll enter the formation myself

643
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:22,765
- to suppress him. <br> - No.

644
00:44:22,765 --> 00:44:25,619
If you go into the Demon Prison Formation, you'll be corroded by it.

645
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,546
Your life will be in danger if you go in for too long.

646
00:44:27,546 --> 00:44:31,360
How about this? I'll go in myself tomorrow.

647
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,259
I believe that Xuanji won't hesitate anymore.

648
00:44:34,259 --> 00:44:35,979
- Sect Leader. <br> - Say no more.

649
00:44:35,979 --> 00:44:38,545
Tomorrow, please protect the eye of the formation.

650
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:42,233
We'll extract his demonic core to show it to the people.

651
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,710
Xuanji, this is bad.

652
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,110
What happened, Sixth Senior?

653
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,066
Just now, those sect leaders have decided for you to perform a formation tomorrow

654
00:44:52,066 --> 00:44:53,889
to extract Sifeng's demonic core.

655
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:56,479
How did that happen? Didn't Father agree not to kill him yet?

656
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,659
That's because they thought that Sifeng could threaten Tianxu Hall.

657
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:02,259
But they never thought that they wouldn't care about Sifeng's life at all.

658
00:45:02,259 --> 00:45:04,282
- I'll talk to my father now. <br> - Wait.

659
00:45:04,282 --> 00:45:05,774
So many things have happened.

660
00:45:05,774 --> 00:45:07,779
Everybody thinks that Sifeng is the devil.

661
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:10,190
- Do you think we can convince him? <br> - I–

662
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:14,080
Besides, the sect leaders of Fuyu Island and Dianjing Valley are here, too.

663
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,419
That's right.

664
00:45:16,419 --> 00:45:18,139
We have to save Sifeng first.

665
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:19,964
Okay, I'll go with you.

666
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:22,472
- Sixth Senior, you... <br> - I don't know about other things.

667
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:25,619
But I know that Sifeng has gone through thick and thin with us.

668
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:28,699
No matter what will happen in the future, I can't just watch him die.

669
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:29,880
Thank you, Sixth Senior.

670
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,710
Stop talking. Let's go.

671
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:42,140
