18
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,819
I didn't expect you to be here.

19
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:45,761
Xi Xuan.

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,099
You always go against me no matter if you're in Heaven or Earth.

21
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:54,370
Thanks to you, I've remembered everything.

22
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,713
King Bailing, are you sure you did everything for the sake of the world?

23
00:01:57,713 --> 00:02:03,930
Do you have no regrets towards God of War, Xuan Ji, and Maleficent?

24
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,059
Under what identity are you asking that?

25
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:11,470
Are you Xi Xuan, the son of the Heavenly Emperor?

26
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,470
Or are you the demon under the command of Devil Maleficent?

27
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,440
Oh, I almost forgot.

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,078
Your Highness Xi Xuan, your mother was the princess of the demon clan.

29
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:26,370
The three realms were peaceful 10,000 years ago.

30
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,264
When the demon clan was under the rule of our realm,

31
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:35,014
the demon king presented his daughter to our Heavenly Emperor as a show of good faith.

32
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:37,173
The Heavenly Emperor saw all beings as equal.

33
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:39,469
He treated you and your mother well, too.

34
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:44,560
But demons were born to be betrayers!

35
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,015
After the Asura clan grew in strength,

36
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:50,966
the Demon King wanted to establish their own kingdom.

37
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:52,459
And their princess abandoned

38
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,847
her identity as the Heavenly Emperor's consort and returned to support them.

39
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:58,041
When the demon army was attacking us,

40
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,499
you knew how to hide in order to avoid any implications.

41
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:02,108
But in the end,

42
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:05,519
you gave up your heavenly rank because of the Devil Star.

43
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,188
What?

44
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:13,979
Now you're siding with the demon clan to question the heavens?

45
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:16,799
All beings in the three realms are equal.

46
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,759
Today, we shall discuss the matter at hand.

47
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,360
I just wanted to ask you this.

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,139
You tricked Devil Maleficent into drinking the drugged wine and extracted his soul.

49
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:27,780
You turned him into the God of War and commanded him to slay his own kin.

50
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,750
And now, you won't even give him a chance to seek justice?

51
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:36,740
I had no choice under the circumstances.

52
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,019
I extracted his soul because I didn't want all beings to suffer from another war.

53
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:45,550
I'm giving him a chance to do good as well.

54
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,075
It was I who protected his primordial spirit.

55
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:52,259
I've never mistreated her when she was the God of War,

56
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:54,219
and I tried my best to compensate her.

57
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:56,640
I gave her the highest rank and honor.

58
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,679
When she was undergoing her tribulations,

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,533
I even descended to the mortal realm in order to guide her.

60
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,628
I don't owe her anything!

61
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:06,959
A chance for her to do good?

62
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,080
You were just controlling her.

63
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,488
You're just trying to make her your puppet

64
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:14,179
in order to protect your position in the heavens.

65
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:19,249
You did everything not because you wanted to compensate Devil Maleficent.

66
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:21,982
You did them to ease your conscience.

67
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,830
Your Highness Xi Xuan, your love is pure indeed.

68
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,619
You sacrifice everything for love.

69
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:33,199
You even feel sorry for Devil Maleficent.

70
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,779
But you better be clear!

71
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:37,059
She's no longer Chu Xuanji!

72
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,190
Xuanji still exists.

73
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,118
Devil Maleficent and Xuanji exist in the same body.

74
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:45,252
Xuanji will return if Devil Maleficent puts down his hatred.

75
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:49,321
You fell in love with Xuanji while you were a human, too.

76
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:53,890
Why are you trying to kill her when there's a chance to save her?

77
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,946
Fell in love?

78
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:59,035
When did I fall in love?

79
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:03,560
I'm doing all this in order to protect the three realms!

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,756
Fine.

81
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:07,906
You said that you're doing this in order to protect the three realms.

82
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,177
Let's make a bet then.

83
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:14,143
I believe Devil Maleficent won't become the merciless demon

84
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:17,093
who destroys everything.

85
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,653
What a joke!

86
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:25,964
I want to see where your confidence comes from.

87
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:30,070
Devil Maleficent had only wanted to vent his anger.

88
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,448
He wants justice to be served.

89
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:35,613
But you insist on saying that he was going to slaughter people,

90
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:37,129
and you slaughtered him in advance.

91
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,499
That's why his hatred grew.

92
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:43,630
If you can resolve this feud and acquire his forgiveness,

93
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,470
we can avoid this calamity.

94
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,139
Are you willing to let Devil Maleficent

95
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,516
meet you alone for the sake of the three realms?

96
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:54,537
So that you two can resolve the feud on your own?

97
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:59,117
What if my assumption was correct all along?

98
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:04,398
What if Devil Maleficent came to massacre everyone in the heavens?

99
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:07,209
If that's the case, I will lose the bet.

100
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:10,817
I will perish together with him in the Demon Citadel.

101
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:14,259
But if I win the bet, I only hope that

102
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,635
you can make an official apology to Devil Maleficent

103
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,986
for the wrongs you've done against him

104
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:22,072
and let him go

105
00:06:22,072 --> 00:06:23,799
from then onward.

106
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,514
No matter if he's Devil Maleficent or Xuanji,

107
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:33,278
you should never appear in their lives again.

108
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,101
Fine.

109
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,048
Since you're sacrificing yourself for the bet,

110
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:46,123
I'll accept it.

111
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:47,961
But you better remember your words.

112
00:06:47,962 --> 00:06:51,712
If Devil Maleficent does come to massacre our people,

113
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,190
you better remember your words.

114
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,835
You shouldn't forget this as well.

115
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:58,441
If Devil Maleficent does not intend to hurt anyone,

116
00:06:58,441 --> 00:07:01,972
the heavens mustn't hurt him either.

117
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:04,701
Bring him here.

118
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,013
Hurry.

119
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,203
Hurry.

120
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:32,191
Everyone, hurry up!

121
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,379
Everyone, hurry up.

122
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:47,020
Master, take them to the mountains and help them settle down.

123
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,785
Yes.

124
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:51,050
Uncle He Yang and Aunt Yinghong

125
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,260
have contacted Lord Dongfang and Valley Master Rong.

126
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,639
They're on the way here with other refugees.

127
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,228
Go and meet them.

128
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:59,266
Yes.

129
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,779
- Min Xing. <br> - Master.

130
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,883
Go back and check if there are any remaining refugees.

131
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,450
If you find them, bring them here.

132
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,459
Yes, Master.

133
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,019
Sect Leader Chu, we found some refugees.

134
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:19,369
We've brought them here.

135
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,399
Is that so? Thank you for the trouble.

136
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,919
Is Devil Maleficent going to destroy everything?

137
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,399
Will Xuanji become a demon and never return?

138
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,399
That won't be. Xuanji hasn't disappeared. I'm sure she's still around.

139
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,399
If not, Devil Maleficent wouldn't give us

140
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,870
the Core Fire and protect us from the disaster.

141
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,045
Little Phoenix?

142
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,056
Little Phoenix!

143
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:51,199
Sifeng, were you okay in the Demon Citadel?

144
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,159
We couldn't find you when we went there.

145
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,690
- We were worried. <br> - I'm fine.

146
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,819
It's just that I haven't been able to bring Xuanji back yet.

147
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:01,180
How's Xuanji then? Did she reappear?

148
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,548
Did she remember us?

149
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:05,745
Linglong, I'm sure Sifeng has something important to tell us.

150
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,747
Let's listen to him for now.

151
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:12,066
I did think of a solution to bring her back.

152
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,267
What solution?

153
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,400
Tell us then.

154
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,864
But it's risky. I need your help.

155
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:21,479
We'll do anything as long as we can bring back Xuanji.

156
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,900
I've persuaded King Bailing to meet Devil Maleficent.

157
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,399
I hope they can resolve their feud.

158
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,465
If King Bailing is willing to let Devil Maleficent seek justice,

159
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:32,638
our situation will change.

160
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,140
But he's King Bailing, you know? I don't think he will give in this easily.

161
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,980
That's what I'm worried about.

162
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:42,837
We can only bring back Xuanji if we can resolve Devil Maleficent's hatred.

163
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:45,060
Only then can all beings avoid this calamity.

164
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,839
But in the event that King Bailing goes back on his words,

165
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,663
only the Heavenly Emperor can help us out in that situation.

166
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:51,875
Are you asking us to seek the Heavenly Emperor?

167
00:09:51,876 --> 00:09:53,319
Yes.

168
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,986
The Heavenly Emperor is in Mount Kunlun.

169
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:56,440
It's a forbidden ground.

170
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,053
It's hard for you to make it there by yourselves.

171
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:00,464
You should find Wu Zhiqi first.

172
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:03,745
I'm sure he has a way to bring you there.

173
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,679
Wu Zhiqi?

174
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,145
Wu Zhiqi has been in low spirits ever since Purple Fox died.

175
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:11,459
He spends his days doing nothing before her grave.

176
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,641
- I'm afraid he... <br> - He will agree.

177
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:17,320
I'm just worried about the Heavenly Emperor.

178
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,786
He was formed by Heaven's will.

179
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:24,090
I'm afraid he won't interfere with the feud between them.

180
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,970
What should we do then?

181
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,301
If so, you should tell him...

182
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,933
You're back?

183
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:48,390
Did Bailing make things difficult for you?

184
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,250
You're not cold-blooded, indeed.

185
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,279
I'm just concerned about the way

186
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,010
that coward will treat my subordinate.

187
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,130
Bailing has agreed to see you.

188
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,130
That coward actually agreed?

189
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,630
Good.

190
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,930
It's been 1,000 years.

191
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,400
I want to see how Bailing is going to face me.

192
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,460
I'll help you cross the Sea of Life and Death,

193
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,150
but you need to promise me this.

194
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,379
This time, you're going there to resolve your feud with him.

195
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:36,439
You mustn't harm anyone there.

196
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,955
I won't harm anyone as long as that coward keeps his word.

197
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:55,443
<i>[GRAVE OF PURPLE FOX]</i>

198
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,601
Wu Zhiqi.

199
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:21,325
Little Fox, your friends are here to visit you.

200
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,526
You love it when people come to visit you, right?

201
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:27,660
Now we can drink to our heart's content.

202
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,300
Stop drinking.

203
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,970
Purple Fox wouldn't be happy if she saw you in this state.

204
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,315
Saw me in what state?

205
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:39,815
In the past, Little Fox wanted me

206
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:42,366
to accompany her every day.

207
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:44,931
Now, I'm by her side every day.

208
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,401
I'm sure she's happy.

209
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,830
Wu Zhiqi, let's meet Heavenly Emperor in Mount Kunlun together.

210
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,555
I'm not going.

211
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,959
There's no wine in Mount Kunlun.

212
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,090
Little Fox isn't there, either.

213
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,082
It's boring.

214
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:08,679
Devil Maleficent and King Bailing will fight each other soon.

215
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,491
If they do fight each other, only the Heavenly Emperor can stop them.

216
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,715
We really need you.

217
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,982
They can fight all they want.

218
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:20,153
It has nothing to do with me.

219
00:13:20,153 --> 00:13:23,824
Now, I don't care about anything.

220
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,258
Fine.

221
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,834
You want to drink?

222
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:33,764
I'll drink with you.

223
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:45,081
But I don't know if we still have a chance to drink after this.

224
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,910
If so, we should cherish our remaining time.

225
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,466
Old Wu, you should know this well.

226
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,261
King Bailing is forcing Devil Maleficent into a corner.

227
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,893
If he forces Devil Maleficent to overturn the Transcendent Furnace,

228
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:08,828
Heaven's Fire will descend

229
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:12,079
and everything in the three realms will disappear.

230
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,710
By then, not only will Purple Fox's grave disappear,

231
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,949
your memories with her

232
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:23,610
that you wanted to protect will disappear as well.

233
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:27,322
Do you really want that to happen?

234
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,544
As friends, we won't force you to make decisions.

235
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:42,814
We just hope that you can consider this with care.

236
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:47,364
Tomorrow, we'll depart for Mount Kunlun.

237
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,550
We'll wait for you at Mount Shaoyang.

238
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,970
Even if you don't come,

239
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,280
we will go there by ourselves.

240
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,910
<i>[Purple Fox]</i>

241
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,950
Let me end this once and for all.

242
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,613
Let's go.

243
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:41,490
Demon Lord, you mustn't!

244
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,419
Please wait for me to capture the Rose Gold Birds before you go!

245
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:48,470
Do you think I will go back on my word like that coward, Bailing?

246
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,714
Stay here.

247
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,630
If that coward goes back on his word,

248
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,252
I'll wreak havoc in the heavens.

249
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:01,540
Yu Sifeng,

250
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,229
let's go.

251
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,210
Right Lieutenant, what should we do now?

252
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,970
We'll stay here.

253
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,176
Observe the heavens closely.

254
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:29,872
Yes.

255
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,115
It's 7:00 a.m.already. Just forget him.

256
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,764
Let's depart now.

257
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,351
Didn't you prepare some wine for me since you want me to follow your trip?

258
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,697
Seems like Sifeng's advice was useful indeed.

259
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:15,739
The thing I regret the most in the world

260
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:18,920
is knowing Xuanji and Sifeng, the two troublemakers.

261
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,394
I have no choice.

262
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:22,639
I can't bear to leave them alone.

263
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,707
We're just trying to find the Heavenly Emperor at Mount Kunlun, right?

264
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,646
Let's go.

265
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,365
Who's there?

266
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,954
- Ruo Yu? <br> - Minyan.

267
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:41,025
Why did you follow us?

268
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:42,479
I want to go to the heavens as well.

269
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,279
Please bring me along.

270
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,425
What? Are you trying to harm us again?

271
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,165
I–

272
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,105
I know I have let you down on many occasions.

273
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:59,456
I know that I don't deserve your forgiveness.

274
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:02,830
But I promised Little Silver Flower that I'll protect Sifeng.

275
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,900
I'm sure I can be of use.

276
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,486
I want to try my best to atone for my sins.

277
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:10,980
Please.

278
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,050
Get up now.

279
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,790
Kid, it's not that easy to atone for your sins.

280
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,039
Just ignore him. Let's go.

281
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,738
Ruo Yu, if you really want to help, you can follow us.

282
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,339
We have an appointment with King Bailing.

283
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,899
We don't wish to hurt innocent people.

284
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:04,090
King Bailing has been waiting for you two. Please.

285
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,219
- We're here. <br> - Is this Mount Kunlun?

286
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,176
The Heavenly Emperor's shelter in the mortal realm?

287
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,780
No.

288
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,639
We have to get through Kaiming Gate before we reach Mount Kunlun.

289
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,569
We have no time to waste. Let's go.

290
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,100
Wait. Don't rush.

291
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,010
It isn't that easy for you to approach Mount Kunlun.

292
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,001
You see the still water surrounding this area?

293
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:50,122
Ordinary people can't cross the river.

294
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,559
After we pass this, we still have the Hell Flame to get through.

295
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,199
Mortals will turn into ashes if they touch the flame.

296
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,359
After that, we still have the Raging Gale Formation.

297
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,681
Even tough animals like elephants

298
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:04,020
will be torn into pieces when they enter the formation.

299
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,519
Of course, these obstacles are nothing to me.

300
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,190
But for mortals like you,

301
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,900
I'm afraid it's impossible to get through.

302
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,992
How can we reach Kaiming Gate then?

303
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:15,499
Don't listen to his nonsense.

304
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:16,890
Why should we pass through the obstacles

305
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:19,099
when there's an alternate route?

306
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:20,848
You know quite a lot.

307
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:23,699
Of course. I've studied every path that could reach the heavens

308
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:28,070
when I first stole the celestial eye.

309
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,176
We can reach Kaiming Gate by climbing the southern cliff.

310
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,153
Although you're right, we still need to cross the stillwater river,

311
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,344
if we want to reach the southern cliff.

312
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:41,807
We can't fly over there.

313
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,866
- Let's hurry over there then. <br> - Wait!

314
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:46,137
Can you stop rushing?

315
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:48,064
Look.

316
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,505
Even a leaf can't float on it.

317
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,736
How do we cross this river?

318
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,739
What are you trying to do?

319
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,408
Ordinary things can't float on stillwater.

320
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:20,079
There's only one exception. The feathers of a Rose Gold Bird

321
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,976
because their feathers are formed by a golden ray of sun.

322
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:27,207
That's why they can float on stillwater.

323
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,770
So, you have to suffer for a bit.

324
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:36,140
We need your feathers to make a boat.

325
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,023
We can cross after that. Come on.

326
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:39,959
Just come.

327
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,799
No way! I'll be bald by then!

328
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,519
- Come, don't run! <br> - No way!

329
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,271
It'll be over in a moment. It won't hurt.

330
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,499
Let me do it.

331
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,580
It did work.

332
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,796
Their feathers do float on stillwater.

333
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,090
We owe you a favor this time.

334
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,279
Why is it so quiet?

335
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,253
There are no towns or villages here.

336
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:22,422
Other beings can't cross the river, either.

337
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:24,160
Of course it's quiet.

338
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,919
Look! What's that?

339
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:38,278
This is bad. It's the Ten Sorcerers of Kunlun.

340
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,811
Are they powerful?

341
00:22:39,812 --> 00:22:42,400
They protect the borders of Mount Kunlun.

342
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:45,602
If I'm not mistaken, he's Wu Lu.

343
00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:49,291
Demons, how dare you show yourself in Mount Kunlun?

344
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,699
Get to the shore. We're on stillwater.

345
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:54,340
We're at a disadvantage if we fight here.

346
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,533
You want to escape?

347
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,213
The heavenly navy!

348
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,375
Get to the shore!

349
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,602
What is this?

350
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:43,444
Let me out!

351
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,907
Old guy, you should care for your own army.

352
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:06,417
You don't need to worry about what's happening on the shore.

353
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,770
Old Wu, let me out!

354
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,660
Let me out!

355
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,759
What's this scent?

356
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,039
What scent? I don't smell anything.

357
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,630
Just ignore that for now! Come and release me!

358
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,122
Why are you two in a daze?

359
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:39,488
Can't you hear me?

360
00:24:39,488 --> 00:24:42,458
Let me out!

361
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,279
<i>Brother, you're back?</i>

362
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,240
<i>Come, drink a jar with me. Let's get drunk.</i>

363
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,802
<i>One jar? That's not enough! We need ten jars! Come!</i>

364
00:24:54,802 --> 00:24:56,519
<i>We need at least ten rounds!</i>

365
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,980
<i>Come!</i>

366
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,860
<i>Stupid Monkey.</i>

367
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,508
<i>- Little Fox? <br> - Stupid Monkey.</i>

368
00:25:02,508 --> 00:25:03,841
<i>You're drinking so much.</i>

369
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:06,840
<i>- Did you forget about our vineyard? <br> - Vineyard?</i>

370
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,342
<i>The vineyard where we first met each other.</i>

371
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:13,364
<i>There are so many grapes in the vineyard right now.</i>

372
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:15,679
<i>Stop drinking. Let's harvest some grapes.</i>

373
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,540
<i>- Okay. <br> - Let's go.</i>

374
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,392
<i>I'll leave for a moment. You continue.</i>

375
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,915
<i>Ruo Yu.</i>

376
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,775
<i>Yan Ran?</i>

377
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:44,238
<i>Isn't this your favorite food?</i>

378
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:47,519
<i>I know you treated me well in the past.</i>

379
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,002
<i>I was too willful and too fierce in the past.</i>

380
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:52,812
<i>I won't act like that...</i>

381
00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:56,023
<i>like that again.</i>

382
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,631
<i>Ruo Yu!</i>

383
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,390
<i>Do you want to save your sister?</i>

384
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,577
<i>If you want to, you should obey me!</i>

385
00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:10,551
<i>Ruo Xue, don't hurt my sister!</i>

386
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:13,156
<i>Ruo Yu! Save me!</i>

387
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:15,950
<i>Ruo Yu! Save me!</i>

388
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,901
<i>How dare you betray me!</i>

389
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:23,210
<i>I'll kill your loved ones right in front of your eyes!</i>

390
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,140
This is bad! They're caught in an illusion!

391
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,010
Ling Long, try to wake them up!

392
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,343
Let's go!

393
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,550
Ruo Yu, wake up!

394
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,627
Ruo Yu!

395
00:27:02,627 --> 00:27:04,458
Wu Zhiqi, what's wrong with you?

396
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,978
Wu Zhiqi, wake up!

397
00:27:05,978 --> 00:27:07,920
Stop walking!

398
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,181
Stop walking!

399
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:12,427
Wu Peng?

400
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:14,086
This is bad!

401
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,715
It's you? You must be the one behind the illusion!

402
00:27:19,716 --> 00:27:21,839
The illusion has everything you need.

403
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,719
You can have anything you desire in the illusion.

404
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,260
Isn't that great?

405
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,277
Come, tell me.

406
00:27:28,277 --> 00:27:30,607
Tell me your desires.

407
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,007
I want...

408
00:27:34,007 --> 00:27:35,619
- I want... <br> - Linglong!

409
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:37,107
Wu Peng is one of the Ten Sorcerers!

410
00:27:37,107 --> 00:27:38,740
Snap out of it!

411
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,021
She's trying to trick you! Don't fall for it!

412
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:43,490
Don't try to trick me!

413
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:45,601
Wake them up right now!

414
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,102
Why should I?

415
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:50,349
Reality is too harsh.

416
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:53,990
You like to escape reality, right?

417
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,821
Fine! If you don't wake them up,

418
00:27:57,821 --> 00:28:00,435
I'll gauge your eyes out!

419
00:28:00,436 --> 00:28:03,330
And sever your head from your neck.

420
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,500
I'll show you no mercy!

421
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,297
Please don't gauge my eyes out!

422
00:28:07,297 --> 00:28:09,388
I'll wake them up!

423
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,067
Hurry!

424
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,940
Ruo Yu!

425
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,605
- Minyan! <br> - Let's go!

426
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,188
This– This is impossible!

427
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,144
No weapon should be able to break through my barrier!

428
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:11,631
Why is that impossible?

429
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:13,140
Listen up.

430
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,218
It's been a long time since I've used my Finger of Power.

431
00:29:17,218 --> 00:29:20,048
What a coincidence. I'll try it out on you then!

432
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:23,319
I'll show you how powerful I am!

433
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,238
- Linglong, are you okay? <br> - I'm okay.

434
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,989
We're the Ten Sorcerers of Kunlun!

435
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,580
How dare you humiliate us like this!

436
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,221
We will surely report this to the Heavenly Emperor!

437
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:47,584
Listen up. I sat on his throne before.

438
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:49,464
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

439
00:29:49,464 --> 00:29:52,635
You should stay in the water!

440
00:29:52,635 --> 00:29:55,260
Old Wu! Let me out!

441
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,490
This is great! I have never felt better being a demon!

442
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,050
Can't you be more gentle?

443
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,340
The cliff is extremely slippery. How can we climb it?

444
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,299
We have no other choice. We can only climb it.

445
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:30,979
Why can't we use our powers?

446
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:34,339
The heavens love to mystify things.

447
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:37,950
If we use our powers, we won't be able to see Kaiming Gate.

448
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,379
The cliff is alive.

449
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,326
Your daggers will disappear after a short while.

450
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:45,598
So you better be careful.

451
00:30:45,598 --> 00:30:49,859
I heard that there's a Kaiming Beast with nine heads guarding the gate.

452
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:53,294
It's hard to deal with. I think we should be careful.

453
00:30:53,294 --> 00:30:57,137
We need to go no matter what.

454
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,599
Are you okay?

455
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,495
I'm fine.

456
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,590
I'm too old for this!

457
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,043
Your body is weak indeed.

458
00:32:32,692 --> 00:32:34,475
Min Yan,

459
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,410
I've committed so many crimes in the past.

460
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:40,439
I don't deserve your help.

461
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,390
Sifeng told me about your sister.

462
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,690
Although I still can't forgive you,

463
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,410
I can't just let you die while I do nothing.

464
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:55,345
Minyan,

465
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,699
I'm sorry.

466
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:02,871
You took the risk in order to save Sifeng and Xuanji.

467
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:05,356
Since everyone is trying their best to help them,

468
00:33:05,356 --> 00:33:07,866
I'll accept your apology for now.

469
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,087
Come. Have some food.

470
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:14,839
Recover your energy. Here.

471
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,510
You even brought this?

472
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,984
- Nine heads? <br> - Is this the Kaiming Beast?

473
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,212
So delicious.

474
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:47,642
- Do you want to eat them? <br> - Yes!

475
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:49,966
I won't give you any of them!

476
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,818
We don't have much. You should share.

477
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,385
So delicious! Give us more!

478
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,195
I guess you aren't full yet.

479
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,514
I have some wine. Here.

480
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,875
What are you doing?

481
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,479
This is bad. We owe them a favor now.

482
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:10,699
We actually ate their food without knowing their goals.

483
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:14,475
Eldest Brother, you ate the most, you know? Aren't you embarrassed?

484
00:35:14,475 --> 00:35:17,153
Second Brother ate the most!

485
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,048
Who are you? Why are you approaching Mount Kunlun?

486
00:35:24,048 --> 00:35:25,978
We just passed by the area.

487
00:35:25,978 --> 00:35:27,969
We wanted to have a snack since we were hungry,

488
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:29,340
but you took it all.

489
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,832
Tell me. What should we do?

490
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:33,055
What should we do now?

491
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,546
Don't bother me because of trivial matters like these!

492
00:35:36,546 --> 00:35:38,059
You can handle this.

493
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:41,130
Be quiet! I'm going to meditate.

494
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,276
Don't cry. You drank the least.

495
00:35:56,276 --> 00:35:58,292
We won't blame you.

496
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,448
I still have some wine. Do you want to drink?

497
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,179
Don't tell Eldest Brother about this.

498
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:11,870
Don't worry. We won't tell him.

499
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,102
You're amazing! You finished it in one gulp!

500
00:36:17,777 --> 00:36:19,738
More!

501
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,281
Here.

502
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,679
I will never be drunk!

503
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,043
A few jars of wine won't do anything to me!

504
00:36:30,043 --> 00:36:32,141
But I think you're drunk.

505
00:36:32,142 --> 00:36:34,225
I thought you were the guardian of the gate?

506
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,639
Isn't it too much if you get drunk?

507
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,800
It's fine! I won't let anyone pass!

508
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,544
Here's a secret.

509
00:36:40,544 --> 00:36:43,758
Our tail is the key to unlocking Kaiming Gate.

510
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:47,639
I'll show you how to unlock it so that you can broaden your horizon

511
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,170
and know that ordinary people can't enter Mount Kunlun.

512
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,419
It's that amazing? Show it to us

513
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:57,710
so that we may sing your praise to the people below.

514
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,027
Look closely.

515
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,824
This is Kaiming Gate.

516
00:37:11,824 --> 00:37:14,919
Since I've eaten your food and drank your wine,

517
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,839
I'll repay you by showing you how to unlock the gate.

518
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,665
Remember to sing my praise to the people below.

519
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:25,088
Of course!

520
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,330
How is it? Am I amazing?

521
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,982
You're amazing!

522
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,104
Kaiming Beast?

523
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,860
This jar of wine is called Drunken Stupor.

524
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,894
It can produce the strongest wine.

525
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:53,559
You'll be drunk for three days if you drink one jar.

526
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,608
This silly beast drank nine of them.

527
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:59,679
They'll sleep for 27 days at least.

528
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,974
So, you knew Kaiming Beast was silly.

529
00:38:01,974 --> 00:38:03,501
That's why you prepared a solution.

530
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:06,347
Of course. If not, Sifeng wouldn't ask you to find me.

531
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:08,606
We deceived such an innocent beast.

532
00:38:08,606 --> 00:38:11,419
I feel like I'm the villain now.

533
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:14,115
That's enough. We should leave while the portal is open.

534
00:38:14,115 --> 00:38:16,339
It'll be difficult if someone sees us later.

535
00:38:16,339 --> 00:38:18,730
Right! Let's go!

536
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,321
What happened?

537
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:42,363
It's the Phoenix.

538
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,474
Phoenix is the king of all birds.

539
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:47,947
It's the natural counter of the Rose Gold Birds.

540
00:38:47,947 --> 00:38:51,578
Its call can rupture my internal organs.

541
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,131
Hurry!

542
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,999
<i>Since the Asura clan has surrendered to the heavens,</i>

543
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,140
<i>you may return to the Demon Citadel.</i>

544
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,999
<i>Do your part and don't create trouble.</i>

545
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,867
<i>Go now.</i>

546
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,364
<i>The Asura clan is bloodthirsty and ruthless.</i>

547
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:17,659
<i>They will disrupt the peace of the three realms.</i>

548
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,330
<i>We mustn't release the tiger back to the mountain.</i>

549
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,143
<i>Leave none of them alive.</i>

550
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:25,026
<i>Kill them.</i>

551
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:30,345
<i>Yes.</i>

552
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,059
<i>The Heavenly Emperor actually went back on his word?</i>

553
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:36,693
<i>The Asura clan is bloodthirsty and ruthless.</i>

554
00:40:36,694 --> 00:40:40,559
<i>Today, all of you will end up like Devil Maleficent.</i>

555
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,260
<i>All of you will die under the blade of the God of War!</i>

556
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,330
<i>You? The God of War?</i>

557
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:50,050
<i>You killed Devil Maleficent?</i>

558
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,910
<i>What a joke!</i>

559
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,000
<i>With the vengeful spirits of my clan, I'll curse you!</i>

560
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:01,850
<i>You'll never have a good end</i>

561
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,780
<i>for all eternity!</i>

562
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:55,166
<i>Their blood was still warm when I killed them.</i>

563
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,830
<i>I don't like that.</i>

564
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:02,052
<i>Before they died, all of them stared at me with resentment.</i>

565
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,037
<i>General, I think you're too exhausted.</i>

566
00:42:04,037 --> 00:42:07,660
<i>I'll find you some medicine that can clear your mind.</i>

567
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:11,744
<i>Lord Medic, you've been treating me for such a long time.</i>

568
00:42:11,744 --> 00:42:15,930
<i>Did you discover that my memories were missing?</i>

569
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,590
<i>General, what do you mean by that?</i>

570
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,030
<i>King Asura stared at me when I killed him.</i>

571
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:29,130
<i>He said I was a traitor. I thought he was familiar.</i>

572
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,169
<i>But I can't remember anything.</i>

573
00:42:31,169 --> 00:42:35,350
<i>And today, a new heavenly officer asked me for my name.</i>

574
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:40,718
<i>I tried to think, only to realize that you only call me the God of War or General.</i>

575
00:42:40,718 --> 00:42:43,470
<i>I can't even remember my name.</i>

576
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,378
<i>Lord Medic, do you know my name?</i>

577
00:42:51,378 --> 00:42:53,285
<i>I'm a low-rank official.</i>

578
00:42:53,285 --> 00:42:57,344
<i>I don't know much about the high-rank officials.</i>

579
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,854
<i>Don't tell me I haven't had a name since birth?</i>

580
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,450
<i>Since birth...</i>

581
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,470
<i>Where exactly did I come from?</i>

582
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,786
<i>Wu Zhiqi, you better give up</i>

583
00:43:36,786 --> 00:43:39,977
<i>and return the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook to the heavens!</i>

584
00:43:39,977 --> 00:43:41,757
<i>Do the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook belong to the heavens?</i>

585
00:43:41,758 --> 00:43:44,456
<i>You killed the Devil Star and took his Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook!</i>

586
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:47,707
<i>I'm just taking back what's rightfully ours!</i>

587
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,010
<i>God of War, King Asura wants me to send you a message.</i>

588
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,688
<i>God of War, I was murdered by you,</i>

589
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:22,590
<i>but I retained my last breath just to send you a huge gift!</i>

590
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:27,941
<i>You better take a good look at the secrets hidden within Bailing's palace!</i>

591
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:32,434
<i>You deserve all of this!</i>

592
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,755
<i>I...</i>

593
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,330
<i>Who am I?</i>

594
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,550
<i>Where's my soul?</i>

595
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,598
<i>Siming Hall!</i>

596
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,958
<i>True events are recorded in the jade tablets,</i>

597
00:45:02,959 --> 00:45:07,656
<i>but King Bailing actually asked us to change the God of War's history?</i>

598
00:45:07,656 --> 00:45:09,140
<i>This doesn't conform to the rules.</i>

599
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,060
<i>If the God of War knew that she was an Asura in the past</i>

600
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,919
<i>and she decimated her whole clan, hell will break loose.</i>

601
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,569
<i>Of course, we need to hide this fact.</i>

602
00:45:18,569 --> 00:45:22,419
<i>Stop it now. King Bailing sent us here</i>

603
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,938
<i>precisely because he wants to hide this fact from everyone.</i>

604
00:45:24,938 --> 00:45:27,079
<i>If news of this gets out,</i>

605
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:30,899
<i>we will be punished by the heavenly lightning.</i>

606
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:34,637
<i>We should do our job and leave the rest to King Bailing.</i>

607
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,720
<i>King Bailing captured Devil Maleficent.</i>

608
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,650
<i>King Bailing extracted his soul and sealed it within the Crystal Lamp.</i>

609
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:49,850
<i>It's too late when the Heavenly Emperor found out that King Bailing</i>

610
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,588
<i>colluded with the southern immortals.</i>

611
00:45:51,588 --> 00:45:54,529
<i>King Bailing reconstructed Devil Maleficent.</i>

612
00:45:54,529 --> 00:45:58,983
<i>The God of War was created after that.</i>

613
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,969
<i>Is this... telling the truth?</i>

614
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,021
<i>Bailing! Come out!</i>

615
