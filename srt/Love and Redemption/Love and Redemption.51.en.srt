19
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,620
If I'm not mistaken,

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,339
you're an ape demon that just transformed into human form recently.

21
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:49,206
Your kind usually lives in Xishu. Why have you come here to hurt people?

22
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:50,750
Ape demon?

23
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,600
When I passed by Xishu before,

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,699
I'd heard that many brides were captured and killed.

25
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,080
So it turns out you're the culprit!

26
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,380
You've got a good eye.

27
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,886
I never expected a small place like Xigu

28
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:04,187
would have two powerful cultivators.

29
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:07,919
Get out the both of you, or else I'll strangle her to death now!

30
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,477
It's hard for you to take a human form. Let go of A'Lan.

31
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:11,530
I'll spare your life.

32
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,451
I'm saving you!

33
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:15,359
All the women in the world are unfaithful.

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,365
They're the worst when they're wearing red wedding dresses.

35
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:22,411
When I just cultivated to human form, I almost married such a woman.

36
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:25,066
I didn't expect that she was a cultivator.

37
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:29,839
She knew I was a demon long ago, and set up a formation on our wedding night to kill me

38
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,548
so that she could raise her cultivation!

39
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:34,339
Luckily, I couldn't get killed that easily and so I survived.

40
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:38,688
However, all my clansmen were killed by that woman and those in her sect.

41
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:40,319
Tell me! Does she not deserve to die?

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,700
So you sought revenge on all these newlyweds?

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,255
I want the world to know that when women get married,

44
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:53,280
they might seem affectionate, but it's all just an act!

45
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,159
You were indeed innocent when you were betrayed.

46
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,050
But as you shifted your grudge onto these innocent people,

47
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:00,866
you've become a great sinner. You should die!

48
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:04,318
Why aren't you leaving yet? If worse comes to the worst, I'll make her die before I'm going to.

49
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,970
Believe it or not, I'll kill her now!

50
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,330
Stop! I understand what you've been through.

51
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,840
I can let you go. We'll leave right now.

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,558
Sifeng, you can't let him go.

53
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,032
Shut up.

54
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:20,340
How could you possibly understand the feeling of betrayal?

55
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,120
Back then when you knew I was a demon,

56
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,540
weren't you just as merciless as her and tried to kill me?

57
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,010
I've never thought of killing you.

58
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,860
I've never wanted you to die.

59
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,680
You besieged Lize Palace,

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,215
killed the young innocent Rose Gold Birds,

61
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:51,540
and tried to kill me with the Vermilion Bird Bottle.

62
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,934
Even though I'm a demon,

63
00:03:55,934 --> 00:04:00,240
was all the love and affection before completely fake?

64
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,821
I really had no idea that they would raid Lize Palace using the secret passages.

65
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:07,847
As for the Vermilion Bird Bottle, Senior said it would only trap you, but it wouldn't harm you.

66
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:13,359
Sifeng, I was foolish and I made mistakes, but I can explain everything!

67
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,763
What? You're a Rose Gold Bird?

68
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:20,020
You're a demon, too?

69
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,440
That's right. I'm a Rose Gold Bird.

70
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,760
You and I are both demons.

71
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,420
Demons are each other's companions, right?

72
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,820
Aren't you a demon?

73
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,139
No matter how splendid your excuse is, there's no reason for you to harm others.

74
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,683
Sifeng, listen to me. It's not that I don't believe you.

75
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:01,604
- I've always... <br> - Chu Xuanji,

76
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:04,200
mortals and demons cannot be together after all.

77
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,100
Don't you get it?

78
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,860
The past is over.

79
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,440
I did love you before,

80
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,850
but I don't want to be with you anymore.

81
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,039
Still, I won't leave.

82
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,340
You said that I forgot about you in all my previous lifetimes.

83
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,163
You wanted me to remember you in this one.

84
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:44,863
It took me one whole year to find you.

85
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:49,380
This time, even if you hate me or resent me, I'll hold you tight.

86
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,700
I won't let go no matter what happens.

87
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,260
If you don't leave,

88
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,920
I'll die.

99
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,439
My King, I once saw Chu Xuanji at the Beihuang region in the mortal realm.

100
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:33,740
But lately, it's been hard to trace her.

101
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,359
My King, I don't know why I was unable to trace the aura of the God of War.

102
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,020
Perhaps she cast a spell to hide her whereabouts.

103
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,100
In this lifetime, she's merely a mortal.

104
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,176
You couldn't even locate a mere mortal?

105
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:58,319
What about those fellows who always fool around with her?

106
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,200
Once you find one of them, you'll be able to track her down.

107
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,919
Those people might have cast a spell

108
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,719
to hide their whereabouts as well.

109
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,388
Then find a Rose Gold Bird Demon named Liu Yihuan.

110
00:08:13,388 --> 00:08:15,559
Didn't he steal the celestial eye?

111
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,680
He can hide his own tracks, but a celestial eye can't be hidden.

112
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:26,149
My King, how did you know the celestial eye was gone?

113
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,953
Are you asking me now?

114
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:35,252
The celestial eye is lost and yet I have to tell you about it?

115
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:37,520
You're useless!

116
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,019
Why are you still here? Hurry and track down Liu Yihuan!

117
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:43,640
<i>Yes!</i>

118
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,861
You haven't reconciled with him? What's the matter?

119
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,879
Teng She, tell me. What should I do?

120
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,700
He still refuses to see me.

121
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,460
He said if I go near him, I'll be hurting him.

122
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,268
But I want to keep him by my side.

123
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:17,120
Am I being too selfish?

124
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,860
As I see it, you've traveled so far to find him, just to keep him by your side, isn't that so?

125
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,420
What do you mean you don't know whether to stay or leave?

126
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,964
That's why I disapprove of mortals' behavior.

127
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:30,254
You're always indecisive.

128
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,420
Stinky woman, are you going in or not?

129
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,540
The sky is already dark. I'm Lord Teng She.

130
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,711
I've taken a long journey with you.

131
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:48,360
Why should I stand here as punishment?

132
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,880
I want him to stay by my side, but I wish him to be well.

133
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,860
Eldest Brother Liu said, he was already attacked twice by a Lover's Curse...

134
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,860
If it happens again, he'll die.

135
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,382
If it's because of me that the Lover's Curse is triggered again,

136
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:04,420
I'll never be able to forgive myself.

137
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,004
Are you stupid?

138
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:10,900
If he didn't love you, he would've taken the Heartless Pill to forget about you long ago.

139
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,020
But he didn't.

140
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,691
Which means he still can't get over you.

141
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:18,178
Even if you leave or stay away from him, there's still no cure for a Lover's Curse.

142
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:20,980
A Lover's Curse will break out one day, and he won't be able to escape from death.

143
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,020
So, why don't you just go for it?

144
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,340
You can either be utterly shameless or just wheedle your way in.

145
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,340
However, you have to convince him that you adore him with all your heart.

146
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,380
This is the only way to cure the Lover's Curse.

147
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,740
Otherwise, if you run away because of his words, then...

148
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,582
do you want me to stay and cure the Lover's Curse?

149
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,039
Right. You've got a point there. Why didn't I think of that?

150
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,260
All in all, this is the only way to cure a Lover's Curse.

151
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,900
You're usually quite smart, why are you so dull when it comes to this?

152
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,300
Why don't you understand this?

153
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,292
It smells so nice.

154
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:04,347
Stinky woman, I won't stand here as punishment with you.

155
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:06,380
Are you going in or not?

156
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,520
Anyway, it's been a while since we tried Sifeng's food.

157
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,160
Sifeng! Why are you eating alone? You even made three dishes.

158
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,499
That doesn't seem right. How about this?

159
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:30,920
Both of us will force ourselves to share your burden.

160
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,900
Well, it's raining out there and so I came in to shelter from the rain.

161
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,510
Why are you being so polite? We're old acquaintances.

162
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,380
- Come here. Take a seat. <br> - My poor house is small,

163
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,339
there's no room for so many people. Please leave.

164
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,519
Sifeng, we're well-acquainted, and haven't met for such a long time!

165
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,543
Why don't we catch up with each other?

166
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:56,770
Stop pulling a long face. You'll get old easily.

167
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,720
Besides, the weather is freezing cold out there.

168
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,190
We may fall and break our legs at night.

169
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,140
Don't you know how to fly on a sword?

170
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,928
Fly on a sword?

171
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:10,307
We can still get into an accident. Right?

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,500
Did I not make myself clear enough?

173
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,740
Chu Xuanji, I never imagined you to be so annoyingly persistent.

174
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,079
Sifeng, people change. I've changed.

175
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:34,319
Sifeng, three dishes do not seem enough for three people.

176
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,500
You're so good at cooking. Why don't you make a couple more dishes?

177
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,636
It's just enough for me.

178
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:41,580
Don't you feel you're not welcomed here?

179
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,500
No, not at all! I'll go make them.

180
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,639
I know what Sifeng likes to eat. I'll do it.

181
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,700
How much longer are you going to keep this up?

182
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,519
I should be the one asking that question.

183
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,260
How much longer do you want to avoid her?

184
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,060
Others might not know about it, but I know it very well.

185
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,559
The reason why you're here is because of the Snow Lingzhi in the Glacial Pool, right?

186
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,959
- It's because your body is about to... <br> - Teng She,

187
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,379
I don't want to talk about this. Don't bring it up again.

188
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:34,200
Why? Since you've done it, why would you be afraid of others talking about it?

189
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,480
Life is short.

190
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,439
But you shouldn't push away Xuanji just because of a reason like that.

191
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,080
You're overthinking it.

192
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,839
I just don't have any extra energy

193
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,820
to deal with unnecessary people or things.

194
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,660
Is there any point in lying to yourself?

195
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,981
You've done so much for her. Why can't you forgive her one more time?

196
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:14,340
Xuanji tried every means to look for you. She has had a hard time.

197
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,100
She used to be a condescending God of War.

198
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,740
Back then when we were in the heavens,

199
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,359
she would come and talk to me because she was afraid of being alone.

200
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,700
What she's doing now is just the same as before.

201
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:32,700
Actually, some people are like wine.

202
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,479
You feel warm as you get closer to them.

203
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,719
But some people are like water.

204
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,919
The more you drink, the colder you get.

205
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,480
As time goes by,

206
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,580
you will feel reluctant to drink it again.

207
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,667
Fine. Since you're so disappointed now

208
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:54,360
and don't believe Chu Xuanji anymore, you won't care whether she lives or dies.

209
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,260
Just leave her to her own devices then.

210
00:14:56,824 --> 00:15:01,128
She's the God of War. What could happen to her?

211
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:03,359
You don't need to lie about that.

212
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,179
Let's stop beating around the bush. We both know very well about the mystery of Xuanji's identity.

213
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:11,418
Otherwise, you wouldn't have gone to great pains and pretended to be the Devil Star.

214
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,040
I can't figure it out. The two identities are totally different.

215
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,057
How could they exist within the same person?

216
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,320
I don't know. What I saw was...

217
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,260
I can't describe it.

218
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,237
But I guess that the heavens are probably looking for her.

219
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:35,660
Whoever is holding a post in the heavens must return once the mantra is recited.

220
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,119
I've disobeyed the decree once.

221
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,966
Also, I have a vague feeling that they're calling everyone back because of Chu Xuanji.

222
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,318
You don't have to lie to me. The Crystal Lamp is still intact.

223
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:55,130
Xuanji won't be sanctioned by the heavens.

224
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,710
How would I know about that?

225
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,800
Regardless of anything, she's my master.

226
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,760
I should get back to the heavens and fish for some information.

227
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,996
I'll leave the stinky woman with you for now.

228
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:08,326
There's nothing much I can do about your issues,

229
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:13,953
but I still have to find out what fate awaits my master.

230
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,820
It's so hot!

231
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,820
Are you all right? Did you burn yourself?

232
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:50,380
Look, I'm blistering already.

233
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,592
Why are you covering the wound then?

234
00:16:55,241 --> 00:17:00,979
Sifeng, you do care about me. Right?

235
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:05,360
I have some medicine inside. Come in.

236
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:16,620
Second cabinet on the left.

237
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,300
Start counting from the right side, there's some ointment in the drawer.

238
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,900
Mix it with water and apply it.

239
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,000
Sifeng, are you not going to apply it for me?

240
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:49,920
<i>Young Master Yi.</i>

241
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,300
Miss A'Lan, what can I do for you?

242
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,279
Dear, have you eaten?

243
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,799
I've brought many dishes for you.

244
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,580
Yesterday, we finally got rid of that annoying person.

245
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,400
We can celebrate it now.

246
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,530
By the way, I've heard from the boss that you carried me back.

247
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,930
Thank you.

248
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:18,480
I've learned from this matter that you're someone I can trust with my life.

249
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,300
I know your marriage was a sham.

250
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,240
Stop lying to me.

251
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,090
So what if it's real or fake?

252
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,660
Young Master Yi has said that he doesn't welcome you here.

253
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,070
Yet you still linger around.

254
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,200
You should stop pestering him.

255
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:39,380
Miss A'Lan, I've known Sifeng for many years.

256
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,900
We only separated because of some misunderstandings.

257
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,540
Now that I finally found him, I'll never leave him.

258
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,119
You just want to tell me about your past relationship with Young Master Yi, right?

259
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,559
So what?

260
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,500
He's no longer that Sifeng now. He's Young Master Yi.

261
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,020
He already said he wants to let go of the past and start over.

262
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,660
Why are you bringing up the same boring old affairs for?

263
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,420
Don't try to use it as an excuse to stay.

264
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,597
You better get going.

265
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,620
This hairpin...

266
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,660
Sifeng, I've been searching everywhere for it.

267
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,140
- It turns out... <br> - It's something you discarded before,

268
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,900
there's no need to put up an act.

269
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,170
Young Master Yi gave the hairpin to me.

270
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,990
Stop thinking about it.

271
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:38,100
How could I possibly discard it?

272
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,240
You broke it off and discarded it in Qingmu Town.

273
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,700
Didn't you mean to cut all ties with me?

274
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,445
Broke it off?

275
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:49,647
Sifeng, how could I have broken it into two?

276
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,475
There must be some misunderstanding!

277
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:52,980
Enough.

278
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,600
That's all in the past. There's no point in bringing it up.

279
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,280
If you're done applying the ointment, hurry and leave.

280
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,599
Did you hear that?

281
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,220
Young Master Yi requested you to leave.

282
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,100
Get out.

283
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,940
I won't leave.

284
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,979
I finally found you. I won't leave you this way.

285
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,300
Besides, this...

286
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,980
Teng She isn't here. I'm severely injured now.

287
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,360
If no one carries me, I can't even walk.

288
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,140
Don't be so shameless.

289
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,360
Sifeng, do you really want to kick me out?

290
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,616
Look outside. It's so late at night.

291
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:37,159
It's so dark and cold.

292
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,159
And my leg is...

293
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,300
You're not going to let me limp all the way back to the inn, right?

294
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,080
Miss A'Lan, call the staff from the inn to carry her back.

295
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,340
That can be easily arranged.

296
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,279
What's the point of finding an inn for me?

297
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,940
There's no physician in the inn.

298
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,520
Sifeng, don't you practice medicine now?

299
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,499
I'm severely injured now.

300
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:06,240
I need you to take care of me. You can't abandon me.

301
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:11,460
Stop being so unreasonable.

302
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,775
I know such a minor injury is nothing to you.

303
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:21,179
Sifeng, do you really want to oust me like this?

304
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,800
Once when I didn't have pain sensation,

305
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,299
you told me to inform you when I was in pain.

306
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:32,419
<i>In the future, don't ever say that it doesn't hurt or that it's fine.</i>

307
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:34,399
<i>You're clearly bleeding.</i>

308
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:39,579
<i>Although you can't feel the pain, your body knows it.</i>

309
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:43,600
Even though I don't know it, my body knows it.

310
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,805
Look! I'm in so much pain right now.

311
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,300
Do you not care about me at all?

312
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,460
We only parted ways for two years.

313
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,100
Where did you learn such knavish tricks?

314
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,320
It's true! Take a look if you don't trust me!

315
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,160
That's not necessary.

316
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,139
Miss A'Lan, you can go back.

317
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:10,059
I'll settle this myself.

318
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:12,740
She's here with you. I feel uneasy about it.

319
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,660
Why don't I stay as well?

320
00:22:19,908 --> 00:22:21,340
Fine then.

321
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,940
I'll come and visit tomorrow.

322
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,359
I'm warning you.

323
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,680
Don't hit on Young Master Yi.

Sifeng,

326
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,840
you're letting me stay?

327
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,619
You're a girl. If you stay here, it'll be bad for your reputation.

328
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:49,880
You can marry me then.

329
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,340
I'll boil some herbal medicine for you.

Sifeng.

Where have you been early in the morning? I couldn't find you anywhere.

342
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,499
Sifeng,

343
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:04,120
I made this Sanqing tea according to your habits.

344
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,300
Try it.

345
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:13,460
Young Master Yi. Young Master Yi.

346
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:16,100
Miss A'Lan.

347
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,020
I've brought you breakfast and the milk tea I made myself.

348
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,440
Try and see if it's nice.

349
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,572
Sifeng usually drinks Sanqing tea in the morning.

350
00:25:24,572 --> 00:25:26,860
He doesn't drink milk tea.

351
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,680
I lost the habit long ago.

352
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,099
Right. The past is the past. He's different now.

353
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:43,260
Young Master Yi, have a sip.

354
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,540
I promise you'll like it!

355
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,480
Is it good?

356
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,939
It's sweet and fragrant.

357
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:10,000
Quite refreshing.

358
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,400
Take a bite of my crispy cake.

359
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:20,280
Here, try it.

360
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,122
It seems like your cooking skill has improved a lot.

361
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:34,640
It took me long enough to learn them.

362
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,759
Right, Young Master Yi! Are you going to collect herbs today?

363
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:39,239
Bring me along with you.

364
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,360
You promised to take me with you to practice medicine.

365
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,960
I do need to collect herbs up the hill.

366
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,032
Let's go together then.

367
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,200
Sifeng...

368
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,459
Your wound is much better than yesterday.

369
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:06,600
If you've stayed here long enough, hurry and leave then.

370
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,397
Let's go.

371
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:24,580
Young Master Yi, I've helped you out again just now.

372
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,156
How are you going to thank me?

373
00:27:26,156 --> 00:27:28,220
Thank you very much, Miss A'Lan.

374
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,460
But I was using you when I did it.

375
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,940
My conscience smites me.

376
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,080
It's fine. That Xuanji is so annoying.

377
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,919
I don't want her to pester you, either.

378
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,260
Besides, I have to get rid of her so that I can come and visit you.

379
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,819
Miss A'Lan, if you want to learn a medical skill,

380
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:51,679
you can come and look for me.

381
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,060
If you have any other intentions, then it's unnecessary.

382
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:03,800
Young Master Yi, don't you understand my feelings?

383
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,139
I'm sorry, A'Lan.

384
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:12,620
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

385
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,951
I have no feelings for you.

386
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:18,140
Not now, not ever.

387
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,020
Why?

388
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,939
Am I not good enough for you?

389
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:25,759
No. You're very good.

390
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,860
But...

391
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,960
All right, say no more.

392
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,020
I didn't hear anything.

393
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,340
After this, I'll only learn medical skills from you

394
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,700
and learn how to capture demons.

395
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,100
We'll talk about that in the future.

396
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,216
Okay.

397
00:28:41,945 --> 00:28:42,940
Right.

398
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,221
I spent ages fixing this hairpin,

399
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:48,200
so that it's exactly the same as before.

400
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,859
Thank you.

401
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:54,180
<i>Sifeng!</i>

402
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,119
Sifeng! Wait for me!

403
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,559
Sifeng!

404
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,500
Wait for me! Sifeng!

405
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,340
She's everywhere!

406
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,820
Young Master Yi, don't worry.

407
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,559
I'll help you chase her away.

408
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:08,520
Never mind. Let's go.

409
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,040
Sifeng, wait for me!

410
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,660
Young Master Yi, let's go.

411
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,620
Double-winged rainbow butterflies?

412
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,723
She finally left.

413
00:29:41,723 --> 00:29:44,331
You ignored her for so long. She might have given up.

414
00:29:44,331 --> 00:29:46,260
I don't think she'll come back.

415
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,299
However, she's unable to move freely.

416
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:52,843
How can she disappear in an instant?

417
00:29:52,843 --> 00:29:55,260
I wonder if she'll fall again.

418
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,524
A'Lan, pick some bupleurum from the back hill.

419
00:29:59,524 --> 00:30:01,799
I'll take these herbs back home.

420
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,460
Okay.

421
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,860
Xuanji!

422
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,260
Sifeng! Look!

423
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,380
Double-winged rainbow butterflies!

424
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,160
They're gone.

425
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,880
Sifeng! Sifeng!

426
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,960
Did you leave because you were mad?

427
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:47,119
I don't want to see you again. Quickly leave.

428
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,924
I won't. I won't ever leave you.

429
00:30:48,924 --> 00:30:52,680
It took me so long to finally find you. I would rather die than leave you.

430
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,340
If you don't leave,

431
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,556
I'll be the one who dies.

432
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,980
If we can't cure the Lover's Curse in the end,

433
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,820
and if you're going to die, I'll die with you.

434
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,160
Don't ever think you can escape from me!

435
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,939
What are you doing?

436
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:10,382
From now on,

437
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:14,039
every time you're attacked by the Lover's Curse, I'll cut myself!

438
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,860
If you're in pain, I'll be in pain with you!

439
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,980
If you want to die, I'll die with you!

440
00:31:19,617 --> 00:31:22,660
Don't treat your life like a child's game.

441
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,980
I'm not treating my life like a game.

442
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,420
You won't believe everything I say.

443
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,500
You precipitately jumped to a conclusion.

444
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,188
I didn't have a heart before, but can't I change?

445
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:34,980
I didn't understand before. Can't I change now?

446
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,720
I was indeed afraid of loneliness before, that's why I refused to let you go.

447
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,799
But later I discovered, loneliness wasn't the reason I wanted to be with you.

448
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,439
I really want to be with you every day till death tears us apart.

449
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,900
Sifeng, I've spent more than 500 days finding you.

450
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,339
If none of these can move your heart, you can leave again.

451
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:56,019
But I'll continue searching for you.

452
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:58,219
Be it 10 or 20 years.

453
00:31:58,219 --> 00:32:02,220
Until the day when you finally believe that I love you.

454
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,320
Whether I believe it or not, it's meaningless now.

455
00:32:05,948 --> 00:32:08,560
It's too late.

456
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,320
Go and look for your rainbow butterflies.

457
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,600
Sifeng, I wanted to capture rainbow butterflies

458
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,863
because of a legend I heard.

459
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:19,499
They say double-winged rainbow butterflies are the guardians of love.

460
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:22,539
If a couple sees the rainbow butterflies, they can reunite again.

461
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:25,179
As for those in love, if they can make a wish under rainbow butterflies,

462
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:28,200
they can grow old together, and be together for all lifetimes.

463
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,800
But I...

464
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,820
I couldn't catch them just now.

465
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,460
This is fate.

466
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,860
It's over for us.

467
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,360
I don't believe it.

468
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,179
If you don't go, then I'll leave. I'll leave Xigu Town.

469
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:50,019
If you don't want me to follow behind you, I'll wait.

470
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:53,499
I'll wait until the day you're willing to see me again.

471
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:56,259
What if I don't return forever?

472
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:58,860
Then I'll wait for you forever.

473
00:33:01,969 --> 00:33:03,840
Sifeng!

474
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,314
If you truly want to wait forever,

475
00:33:09,314 --> 00:33:11,710
wait as you wish then.

Sifeng! Sifeng!

490
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,980
Sifeng!

491
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,780
Sifeng!

492

Sifeng!

493
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,260
Sifeng!

494
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,719
Miss A'Lan, did Sifeng ever come here?

495
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,363
Young Master Yi?

496
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:31,836
Isn't Young Master Yi with you?

497
00:35:31,836 --> 00:35:34,499
He didn't come back last night.

498
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,660
- I... <br> - Young Master Yi has disappeared?

499
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,540
He must have been annoyed by you and so he left!

500
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:48,120
<i>If you truly want to wait forever,</i>

501
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,660

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,940
Sifeng!

503
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,700
Sifeng! Sifeng!

504
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,260
Sifeng!

505
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,580
Sifeng!

506
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,500
<i>Sifeng!</i>

507
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,900
<i>Sifeng!</i>

508
00:37:15,028 --> 00:37:16,840
Sifeng!

509
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,320
Sifeng!

510
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,400
Sifeng!

511
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,760
Sifeng!

512
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,380
Sifeng!

513
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,040
Sifeng!

514
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,700
How could you go off like that?

515
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,780
I've so many things I haven't told you!

516
00:38:08,646 --> 00:38:12,680
At that time, I made the vow to my dad

517
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,203
because he thought you were a demon from Tianxu Hall.

518
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:17,131
I said it because he threatened me with his death!

519
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:23,400
But deep inside my heart, I told God that the vow didn't count!

520
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,404
You never hear what I just say,

521
00:38:30,404 --> 00:38:34,779
but I don't mean every word that you've heard. Sifeng,

522
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,380
I told you I'll wait for you here.

523
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,620
I'll definitely wait for you.

524
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,260
No matter how long it takes, I'll wait until you come back.

525
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:08,360
When the time comes, you'll know what I truly meant.

526
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,360
<i>Xuanji, so what if I believe your sincere love?</i>

527
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,640
<i>I don't even know how long I'll live.</i>

528
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,680
<i>Now...</i>

529
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,240
<i>I hope my disappearance will make you give up.</i>

530
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,740
<i>Leave this place...</i>

531
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,300
<i>and forget about me eventually.</i>

532
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,960
Have you gone insane?

533
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,275
He's already left. He won't know even if you freeze to death!

534
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:55,199
Hurry and go inside the house.

535
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,880
No.

536
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,480
I promised him...

537
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:03,660
that if he leaves,

538
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,167
I... I'll keep waiting for him here.

539
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:10,280
What if one day,

540
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,959
he suddenly thinks about me and comes back?

541
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,560
What if he gets tired one day

542
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,420
and comes home?

543
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,600
If I keep my promise to him,

544
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,540
I'll get to see him again.

545
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,708
No.

546
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:33,826
If you go on like this, you'll have frozen to death before he comes back.

547
00:40:33,826 --> 00:40:36,780
Let's go in and warm yourself, okay?

548
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,540
I promised Sifeng that I'd wait for him.

549
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,651
If he doesn't see me on his way back,

550
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:45,980
he'll think I've given up on him.

551
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,160
I don't want that.

552
00:40:49,773 --> 00:40:52,820
You want to be crazy? Just do as you wish then!

553
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,500
- Young Master Yi. <br> - Miss A'Lan.

554
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,540
Has Xuanji left?

555
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,100
I think she's completely insane.

556
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,839
It's snowing heavily now, and yet she's still sitting by the door refusing to go inside.

557
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,380
She insisted on waiting for you.

558
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,020
You didn't see what she's like.

559
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,788
She's almost become a snowman.

560
00:41:26,788 --> 00:41:29,580
Where did she get her obstinacy?

561
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,859
By the way, Young Master Yi, I've brought a winter coat for you.

562
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:39,798
It's getting colder and colder. I think you may need it.

563
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:44,180
Miss A'Lan, do me another favor.

564
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,671
Send this winter coat to Xuanji.

565
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:51,480
Tell her I won't be coming back.

566
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,680
Tell her not to wait any longer.

567
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,919
I'll surely do as you instructed.

568
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:02,680
But...

569
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,040
I'm afraid it'll be futile.

570
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,619
Do you think Young Master Yi will come back if you act like this?

571
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,259
It's been so long.

572
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:27,260
What you're doing is meaningless.

573
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,460
It's snowing heavily now.

574
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,700
If you refuse to eat, drink, and sleep, how long can you keep this up?

575
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,839
This is Sifeng's way home.

576
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:40,460
Don't get in the way.

577
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,201
He won't be able to see me when he's back.

578
00:42:44,201 --> 00:42:47,019
Fine. I can't persuade you.

579
00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:48,300
Put it on.

580
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,239
If you want to wait for Young Master Yi, don't freeze yourself to death.

581
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,346
Young Master Yi, I've said everything I should say,

582
00:43:12,346 --> 00:43:14,880
but she still refused to leave.

583
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,520
If she continues like this, she'll freeze to death.

584
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,799
<i>You've accepted my hairpin.</i>

585
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:53,920
<i>So from now onward, you're mine.</i>

586
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,179
<i>You've taken my figurine, you're mine as well from now onward.</i>

587
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:00,199
<i>It's the best I could wish for.</i>

588
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,660
Xuanji!

589
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,060

Are you still cold?

Do you feel unwell?

605
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,580
Sifeng,

606
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,180
now that you're back,

607
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:46,581
can you not leave again?

608
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,628
I'll go and bring you the medicine I made.

609
00:45:50,628 --> 00:45:53,049
Don't leave.

610
00:45:54,556 --> 00:45:56,610
Then I'll fetch you another quilt, okay?

611
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,350
I'm not cold.

612
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:00,173
Don't be so willful.

613
00:46:00,173 --> 00:46:02,040
Sifeng,

614
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:08,459
in all my life, no matter what I've encountered,

615
00:46:08,459 --> 00:46:11,193
I had never felt fear.

616
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:15,034
It's because I didn't have a heart and feelings.

617
00:46:15,034 --> 00:46:18,189
But I'm truly terrified now.

618
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:22,693
I fear that once you leave, you'll never ever come back.

619
00:46:22,693 --> 00:46:24,259
How long?

620
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:27,691
How long will it take for you to believe my feelings for you,

621
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:30,592
so that you're satisfied?

622
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:37,859
Sifeng, I went to Fenru City and saw our previous nine lifetimes.

623
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:39,700
I let you down in each and every lifetime.

624
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,910
It was always too late for me to repent.

625
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,920
But then I discovered that I was actually in love with you in every lifetime.

626
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,540
But it was too late.

627
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,059
It's not that I didn't have a heart then, but I took too long to figure it out.

628
00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:54,680
Can you wait for a while longer, and be more patient with me?

629
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,680
Xuanji,

630
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,240
I've been waiting for too long.

631
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:16,240
You came a little late.

632
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,147
I was really angry.

633
00:47:19,147 --> 00:47:21,480
What are you saying?

634
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:24,820
I'm really happy

635
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,600
that you've come for me.

636
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,379
Why did you keep kicking me out?

637
00:47:33,379 --> 00:47:37,020
Why did you say all those harsh things?

638
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:47,910
