00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,439
North Superintendent, that person released Zhong Minyan and Ruo Yu.

19
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,160
What happened to you?

20
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,211
Who asked you to change your appearance?

21
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:58,216
Brother Tong, you said you'd like me no matter what I looked like.

22
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:00,039
This is my original look.

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,570
Brother Tong, I look good, don't I?

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,949
What I want is Linglong!

25
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,180
Where is my Linglong?

26
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,810
I just didn't want to live with another person's appearance.

27
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,420
I've returned her primordial spirit to them.

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,847
How dare you steal my Soul Bell!

29
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:25,268
I just wanted to become myself.

30
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:28,057
I just wanted you to like the original me.

31
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:32,027
Brother Tong, you should stop thinking about her.

32
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,937
Although my look has changed, I'm still me!

33
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:38,308
How dare you touch Linglong's primordial spirit!

34
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:40,817
And you even released those two fellows!

35
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:42,730
You're digging your own grave!

36
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,400
How dare you hit me!

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,140
So what if I did?

38
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,390
Kill me if you dare!

39
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,650
You...

40
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:02,941
Why are you still upset?

41
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:04,780
You weren't like this in the past.

42
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,447
You told me to get angry at you if you were upset.

43
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:11,908
You'd be happy after I scolded you.

44
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:13,304
I did say that before.

45
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:15,975
But that is only applicable to Linglong!

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,630
Since you're not Linglong anymore,

47
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,873
there's no point in keeping you here.

48
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,710
Older Brother Tong!

49
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,965
Chu Linglong,

50
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,810
you're mine.

51
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,150
I will bring you back, no matter what!

52
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,564
<i>Report!</i>

53
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:43,770
My Lord, the Flying Dragon Seal and the spirit keys are missing!

54
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,517
The Flying Dragon Seal?

55
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,592
Shaoyang Sect doesn't know that I have that seal with me.

56
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:52,823
I'm sure Zhong Minyan isn't the culprit.

57
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:54,617
Who's the culprit then?

58
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:58,217
This is bad!

59
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,591
North Superintendent, where are you going in such a hurry?

60
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:20,726
Didn't you ask me to come and take the Flying Dragon Seal?

61
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:22,409
Here I am.

62
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,507
Hao Chen, you just came out of your retreat.

63
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:27,719
You should rest more.

64
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:29,626
You don't need to rush here.

65
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:32,010
Dianjing Valley Sect will hold the next Hairpin Tournament soon.

66
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,860
I don't dare to delay this.

67
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,740
Sect Leader, did you find any clues around Mount Buzhou?

68
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,249
My spirit beast, Hong Luan, searched the area.

69
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,559
And it finally found this.

70
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,189
Indeed.

71
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:51,814
This piece is from my Demon Whip.

72
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:54,183
It fell off when I fought with that demon back then.

73
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:56,060
What do you mean?

74
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,066
No other disciples were around when my Demon Whip broke.

75
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,820
Only the elders and sect leaders of the four sects were around.

76
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,953
So, one of them must be the culprit.

77
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:09,140
So, the demon who had fought with me

78
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,460
was one of the elders or sect leaders.

79
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,850
That means there's a spy from Tianxu Hall among us.

80
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,940
How should we identify who the spy is then?

81
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,354
Sect Leader, don't worry.

82
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:25,684
I will surely think of a way.

83
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,779
Sect Leader, Xuanji has returned.

84
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:33,026
She even brought Sixth... She brought Zhong Minyan as well.

85
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,842
Sixth Senior, don't worry.

86
00:06:38,842 --> 00:06:41,639
I've sent Teng She to find out where Ruo Yu is.

87
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,478
As for Father, just try to explain everything to him.

88
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,085
Sifeng and I will help you.

89
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:47,689
Xuanji!

90
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,100
Why did you bring him back?

91
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,586
Father.

92
00:06:58,474 --> 00:06:59,849
Master.

93
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,679
I don't have a traitorous disciple like you!

94
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,650
Today, I'll get rid of the evildoers in Shaoyang Sect!

95
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,281
Father, Sixth Senior has bitter reasons for that.

96
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:10,250
We only brought back half of Linglong's primordial spirit.

97
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,479
Sixth Senior joined Tianxu Hall

98
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,060
because he wanted to retrieve the other half of her primordial spirit.

99
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,825
Father, he didn't betray us.

100
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:18,684
What did you say?

101
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,021
Master, I know I've committed a grave mistake.

102
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:26,499
I will never be forgiven.

103
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:30,809
You can punish me however you want.

104
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:33,010
But, Master,

105
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,349
please save Linglong for now.

106
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:41,740
Sect Leader Chu, Xuanji isn't saying that because she wants to defend him.

107
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,490
She's telling the truth.

108
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,100
Linglong's primordial spirit has left her body for too long.

109
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,188
If we don't return it to her now, her life will be in danger.

110
00:07:49,188 --> 00:07:52,938
Sect Leader Chu, please save Linglong.

111
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:54,613
Sect Leader!

112
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,370
- No! I'm Linglong! <br> - Linglong!

113
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,173
Linglong, you're awake!

114
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:38,184
It's fine now.

115
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,109
Look at me.

116
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,356
Father.

117
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,290
Aunt Ying Hong.

118
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,853
Am I really home now?

119
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:59,859
I'm Xuanji. We're in Shaoyang Sect.

120
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:01,653
You're home.

121
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,950
In the future, I won't let anyone bully you again.

122
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,260
- Xuanji. <br> - In the future, I'll take care of you.

123
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,290
You'll be my little sister. I'll protect you.

124
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,743
Okay?

125
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,090
I'm home!

126
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,054
You're home.

127
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,459
My child.

128
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,842
Father!

129
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:32,320
- Father! <br> - It's fine now.

130
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,953
Good to see you back. Good to see you back.

131
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:38,410
My precious child.

132
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,006
Xuanji, where's Little Six?

133
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:46,947
Why isn't he around?

134
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,508
Sixth Senior went to make some food for you.

135
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,299
- He'll return soon. <br> - Yes.

136
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,459
Linglong, your primordial spirit had just returned to you.

137
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,860
I'm sure you're exhausted.

138
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,679
You should rest.

139
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,397
Yes. Rest now.

140
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:11,400
Raise your head.

141
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,059
I was incapable.

142
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,659
I couldn't accomplish the task you gave me.

143
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:17,940
I couldn't retrieve the spirit keys and I harmed Second Senior.

144
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,407
- I'm ashamed to see you. <br> - What did you say?

145
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:23,498
When did I give you such tasks?

146
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,836
Master,

147
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:28,823
didn't you tell me to become a spy in Tianxu Hall

148
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:31,934
and try to retrieve her primordial spirit and the spirit keys?

149
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,518
What a load of nonsense!

150
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,975
Even until now, you're trying to find excuses

151
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:39,365
for the crimes that you committed?

152
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,976
Impossible. Impossible!

153
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:47,319
Master, you assigned the tasks to me in person!

154
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,220
Minyan, tell us everything that happened.

155
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,610
Do not leave out anything.

156
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,739
Yes.

157
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,432
That day, I left Fuyu Island.

158
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:00,094
I was going to Mount Buzhou.

159
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:02,500
During my night in Qingmu Town,

160
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,346
Master, you suddenly appeared.

161
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:08,220
You asked me to become a spy in Tianxu Hall,

162
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,408
and to try to retrieve Linglong's primordial spirit and the spirit keys.

163
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:17,480
<i>Are you willing to do anything it takes to save Linglong?</i>

164
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,680
<i>Good.</i>

165
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,599
<i>I wasn't wrong about you.</i>

166
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,019
<i>But not only do you need to save Linglong,</i>

167
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:28,039
<i>you need to complete an important task as well.</i>

168
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,106
<i>I want you to become a spy in Tianxu Hall.</i>

169
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:36,564
<i>Try to retrieve the spirit keys while you're there.</i>

170
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,274
<i>Master, please tell me how to retrieve them.</i>

171
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:43,247
<i>Pretend to surrender to them while you're there</i>

172
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,980
<i>and prove that you're loyal to them.</i>

173
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,254
<i>Only by doing so, will you be able to stay there and retrieve the spirit keys.</i>

174
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:51,860
<i>Hereby, I grant you special permission.</i>

175
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,062
<i>You may sacrifice righteousness</i>

176
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,244
<i>during crucial moments.</i>

177
00:11:57,244 --> 00:12:01,250
<i>You may even sacrifice your fellow disciples.</i>

178
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:09,450
Master, please tell me that you were the person I saw that night.

179
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,438
No.

180
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:16,048
I wasn't even there,

181
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,840
and I had never assigned such tasks to you.

182
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,420
During your night in Qingmu Town,

183
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,077
Sect Leader and the rest were trying to find out where you were.

184
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:29,587
How could he approach you personally?

185
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:33,090
Minyan, you're so gullible.

186
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,820
This can't be. This can't be!

187
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,720
Why is this happening?

188
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,460
Why is this happening to me?

189
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,940
Master.

190
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,959
Master, are you trying to test me?

191
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,479
Are you angry because I didn't retrieve the spirit keys?

192
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,440
Or...

193
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,352
Or is it because you still have some special tasks for me?

194
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:55,925
Master, please tell me.

195
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:58,791
- Please tell me that you're lying. <br> - Master...

196
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:03,599
On Fuyu Island, Wolf from Tianxu Hall disguised himself as Sect Leader Zhu Shi.

197
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,100
Even Xuanji, who's so sensitive to demons, couldn't detect him.

198
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,896
Minyan, maybe the sect leader you met that night

199
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:12,181
was Wolf in disguise.

200
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,140
What have I done?

201
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,460
What have I done?

202
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,509
I actually believed a demon!

203
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,100
I fell for his trick!

204
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,374
I'm stupid!

205
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,279
I'm so stupid!

206
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,439
That's why I fell for his trick!

207
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,820
It's all because I'm stupid!

208
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,660
- It's my fault! <br> - Minyan, calm down.

209
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,180
Minyan, you said that the demon wanted you to retrieve the spirit keys.

210
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,460
Where are the spirit keys?

211
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,220
Spirit keys? I was in possession of them for a moment,

212
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,819
but the demons cornered us.

213
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:53,219
- To protect me, Ruo Yu... <br> - Ruo Yu?

214
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,319
Ruo Yu from Lize Palace?

215
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,498
Ruo Yu fell off a cliff.

216
00:13:57,498 --> 00:13:59,728
I'm afraid the spirit keys

217
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:02,358
are in the hands of the demons now.

218
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,750
First, you said you possessed them.

219
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,410
Now, you say Ruo Yu fell off a cliff.

220
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:10,680
It's all your claim! How do you prove them?

221
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,037
Senior, Minyan has been with us since he was a child.

222
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:17,383
I believe that he wouldn't betray Shaoyang Sect.

223
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:20,116
I'm afraid that he fell for the demon's trick.

224
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:21,672
Even if you're saying the truth,

225
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:24,884
even if you were deceived by a demon,

226
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:26,399
how do you explain Min Jue then?

227
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,741
You grew up with him together!

228
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:32,431
How dare you murder him!

229
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,300
- Second Senior. <br> <i>- Don't look at me with those eyes.</i>

230
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,740
<i>My beloved Linglong was the one behind your second senior's death.</i>

231
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,485
Master, I can never be forgiven.

232
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:45,120
Please kill me!

233
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,130
Do you think death can clear your name?

234
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,281
Senior, Minyan did commit a grave mistake,

235
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:56,123
but he saved Linglong as well.

236
00:14:56,123 --> 00:14:58,355
- This... <br> - The Shaoyang Sect will never

237
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,252
forgive disciples who kill their seniors!

238
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:02,220
We'll lock him up for now.

239
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,995
After this, I'll hold the general meeting of Shaoyang.

240
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:06,196
We'll put him through an open trial!

241
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,590
<i>[LIZE PALACE]</i>

242
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,153
You did excellent in your last mission.

243
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,079
<i>Armies are to be maintained for years but used on a single day.</i>

244
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,100
<i>I've raised you for so long.</i>

245
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,377
<i>I've covered the fact that you lost your mask as well.</i>

246
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:50,039
<i>Now, this is the time for you to repay me.</i>

247
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,756
<i>Vice Palace Lord, I'll risk my life for you.</i>

248
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,860
<i>You don't need to risk your life.</i>

249
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,196
<i>You're friends with Chu Xuanji and the rest, right?</i>

250
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:03,306
<i>Continue to be friends with them.</i>

251
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,320
<i>I don't really understand.</i>

252
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,660
<i>Just stay beside them and observe their movement.</i>

253
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,218
<i>Report their every move to me.</i>

254
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:17,850
<i>Yes.</i>

255
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,319
<i>This is an order from our leader.</i>

256
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,980
<i>You and Zhong Minyan are to stay beside Wu Tong.</i>

257
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,959
<i>Besides acquiring the Flying Dragon Seal and the spirit keys,</i>

258
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,380
<i>you need to kill Yu Sifeng as well.</i>

259
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,560
<i>What? Kill Sifeng?</i>

260
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,380
<i>But why?</i>

261
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,253
<i>Only a huge shock will stimulate Chu Xuanji</i>

262
00:16:57,254 --> 00:17:00,544
<i>and awaken the powers within her.</i>

263
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,401
<i>But Yu Sifeng belongs to Lize Palace.</i>

264
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:05,999
<i>- To kill him... <br> - Shut up!</i>

265
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,860
<i>What's wrong?</i>

266
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,620
<i>Are you trying to disobey</i>

267
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:12,140
<i>the orders of the Vice Palace Lord?</i>

268
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,378
<i>Don't forget.</i>

269
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:16,469
<i>He wanted you to mix with them for them to let down their guard.</i>

270
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,359
<i>Don't tell me</i>

271
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,989
<i>you treat them as your true friends?</i>

272
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,398
I did so much in order to send you and Zhong Minyan into Mount Buzhou.

273
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,269
You didn't disappoint me indeed.

274
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:38,760
Vice Palace Lord, I've accomplished the task you gave me.

275
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,525
It's been some time since the last time I met my sister.

276
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,815
Can I...

277
00:17:44,645 --> 00:17:46,660
What are you saying?

278
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,530
You did such a good job.

279
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:53,940
Of course, I'll let you reunite with your sister.

280
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,934
Thank you, Vice Palace Lord.

281
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,550
You have 15 minutes.

282
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,750
Xue'er!

283
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,438
Brother, why did you injure your face?

284
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:37,880
- Does it hurt? <br> - I'm fine.

285
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,910
Xue'er, I bought you a gift.

286
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,050
It's nice.

287
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,434
This bracelet, it's...

288
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,420
A good friend of mine chose it for me.

289
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,494
But I wish he will

290
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:55,962
never meet a friend like me again.

291
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:58,340
You'll be free as long as

292
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,357
I accomplish Vice Palace Lord's tasks.

293
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,060
It's worth sacrificing everything.

294
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,410
I'll bring you home soon.

295
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,970
I'll bring you home.

296
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,353
Senior Hao Chen.

297
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,657
I haven't got the chance to say this,

298
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:17,929
but thank you for saving me in Qingmu Town.

299
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:19,439
You don't need to thank me.

300
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,759
I wouldn't have saved you if Xuanji hadn't

301
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,690
risked her life for you.

302
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,580
I wonder how Minyan is doing?

303
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,710
Senior, please plead with your sect leader on behalf of Minyan.

304
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,910
Hero Yu, you don't need to worry about our internal affairs.

305
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:43,014
I know. I shouldn't interrupt,

306
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:46,922
but Minyan is my brother.

307
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:49,160
Senior, please plead with Sect Leader Chu.

308
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,860
Please beg him to forgive Minyan since he had saved Linglong.

309
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,809
It's all because he cares too much about Linglong.

310
00:19:57,809 --> 00:19:59,930
That's why he was deceived by the demons.

311
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,199
Zhong Minyan was deceived because of his love for her,

312
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,119
but this isn't an excuse for his crimes.

313
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,924
It was precisely because of love that he was deceived.

314
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,732
That's why he couldn't comprehend the situation clearly.

315
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:17,145
So, if someone tries to use love as an excuse to deceive Xuanji,

316
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:19,436
I will make sure he pays.

317
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,319
Senior, why do you always treat me like your enemy?

318
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,099
Even until now, you still think that

319
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,430
I have ulterior motives for loving Xuanji?

320
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,239
Shouldn't I think so?

321
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,978
After Xuanji left Xuanyang Peak,

322
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:42,161
you instigated her to find her six senses. She almost fell for Tianxu Hall's ploy.

323
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:44,238
You persuaded her to leave Fuyu Island without permission.

324
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:45,429
You brought her to Mount Buzhou,

325
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:47,799
and she almost lost her life because of that!

326
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,350
I really don't know what your motive is for approaching my junior.

327
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,726
Senior Hao Chen, I heard that

328
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:58,420
you changed from the Heartless Tactics to the Sentimental Tactics.

329
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,900
But now, you look like

330
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,450
you don't believe in love at all.

331
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,050
Isn't this ironic?

332
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,917
Don't try to be a smart aleck.

333
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:13,534
I can't stop you from meeting my junior.

334
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:15,063
But...

335
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:18,093
But if I find out that you have ulterior motives for loving her,

336
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,010
I won't let you off.

337
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,799
Senior Hao Chen, something happened in the secret ground!

338
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,707
- What's wrong? <br> - The barrier is getting weaker

339
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,259
and now there's a huge gap in the barrier.

340
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:33,550
Master has issued an order. He wants every elder to be there.

341
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,459
I told you already.

342
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:41,436
I'm a friend of Chu Xuanji.

343
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:43,407
Let me in.

344
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:44,759
This is the rule of Shaoyang Sect!

345
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,900
What rule? My patience is running thin!

346
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,870
Get out of the way!

347
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,850
<i>[Shaoyang Sect]</i>

348
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,650
Hey, where's the kitchen?

349
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,930
Who are you? Why are you intruding?

350
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,812
Why did you pull out your sword when I asked you about the kitchen?

351
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:12,539
- You must be crazy. <br> - Sound the alarm!

352
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,340
Stinky woman!

353
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,857
How did such a big hole appear?

354
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,057
Much of our powers have been absorbed by it,

355
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,839
yet it has no effect at all.

356
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,269
Don't tell me the Heartless Tactics don't work anymore?

357
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,070
Senior Heng Yang, what should we do?

358
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,522
I'll set up the Secret Formation.

359
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:54,354
Maybe it can hold on for a short while,

360
00:22:54,355 --> 00:22:56,487
but it can't last for long.

361
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:59,133
If we want a long-term solution,

362
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:02,589
we can only depend on Xuanji and Hao Chen.

363
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,478
You and Hao Chen need to get married

364
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:07,621
and the two of you need to practice the Sentimental Tactics together.

365
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:12,350
Only then, the barrier will be stabilized

366
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,790
and we can protect the secret ground.

367
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:16,644
Senior Hao Chen and I? No way!

368
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,755
You and Hao Chen are destined to be together,

369
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:22,238
and you two have been together all your lives.

370
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:26,864
Why can't you practice the Sentimental Tactics with him?

371
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,519
I've explained this to my father already.

372
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,879
Father, I...

373
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,859
What? You're marrying your senior?

374
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:36,325
Who are you?

375
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:37,921
This is my friend, Teng She.

376
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:39,644
What's wrong with you?

377
00:23:39,644 --> 00:23:41,640
It's fine that you forgot about King Bailing.

378
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,220
But why are you abandoning that great chef?

379
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,531
Is your senior a great chef as well?

380
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,763
I feel like I've seen him before.

381
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,660
Outsider, how dare you invade our secret ground?

382
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,834
Leave now!

383
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:59,991
Mortal! How dare you shout at me! Do you want to die?

384
00:23:59,992 --> 00:24:02,425
Why should I enter your secret ground? There's nothing good in there!

385
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:04,649
I won't enter unless there's some delicious food in there.

386
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,607
But there's nothing inside!

387
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:08,120
There's only a short-tempered one-eyed dragon!

388
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,836
I'm sure it's not delicious. There's no reason for me to enter!

389
00:24:10,836 --> 00:24:12,895
How did you know that the Candle Dragon is our guardian?

390
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:15,439
Don't tell me you're a spy from Tianxu Hall?

391
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:17,477
Father, he's not from Tianxu Hall.

392
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:19,459
- He's my spirit beast. <br> - Spirit beast?

393
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,970
I'm your friend!

394
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,115
He's my friend as well.

395
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:25,397
When did you tame a spirit beast like him?

396
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,458
Is he just like Lu Yan Ran,

397
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,268
a spirit beast who acquired a human form?

398
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,139
Father of stinky woman, can you not compare me with that low-class creature?

399
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:39,230
I'm a divine snake who has trained for 1,000 years!

400
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,425
I would never become her spirit beast

401
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:43,362
if it weren't for my careless mistake.

402
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:45,767
So, according to what you've said, you're a heavenly officer?

403
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:47,119
Yes.

404
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,550
I'm the one and only Lord Teng She.

405
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,668
You're 25 years old at most. You don't look like a heavenly officer.

406
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:59,159
Xuanji, you mustn't let him deceive you.

407
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,256
I... I'm a heavenly officer!

408
00:25:01,256 --> 00:25:03,600
You mortals have no common sense at all!

409
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,039
Do you know that King Bailing begs me to do his tasks for him?

410
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,970
He sent me and the Four Sacred Beasts here to construct your secret ground!

411
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,300
Heartless Tactics and Sentimental Tactics?

412
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,999
You even want a stinky woman to marry another guy?

413
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,879
Listen up. Do you believe it or not?

414
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,139
I can fix your stupid barrier by using a tiny bit of my power.

415
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:25,639
This barrier is constructed by beings of the heavenly realm.

416
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,802
It's fine for you to crack inappropriate jokes,

417
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:30,719
but how could you disrespect them?

418
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,665
Father, Teng She is a heavenly officer indeed.

419
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,497
Just let him try and fix the barrier.

420
00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:35,727
Nonsense!

421
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:38,480
This concerns the three realms! How could you joke around?

422
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,815
Xuanji, you better leave with your spirit beast.

423
00:25:41,815 --> 00:25:45,567
Fine. You mortals are looking down on me, huh?

424
00:25:45,568 --> 00:25:49,038
I'll show you my power.

425
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,010
He did fix the barrier.

426
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,260
Stinky woman, I've solved your trouble.

427
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,679
You better ask Yu Sifeng to cook something delicious for me.

428
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,464
Sure. Thank you, Teng She.

429
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:38,531
He'll cook everything you want.

430
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,039
Sect Leader, please look.

431
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,090
He does look like the painting.

432
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,190
Stop it already. Let me have a look.

433
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,790
What an ugly painting. I'm much more handsome.

434
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,210
- Greetings, Heavenly Officer. <br> - Greetings, Heavenly Officer.

435
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,659
Father, what are you doing?

436
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:13,334
Heavenly Officer, the entire Shaoyang Sect

437
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:16,504
needs your help.

438
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:20,078
Uncle, can you stop scaring me? Speak in a normal tone.

439
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,792
Heavenly Officer, you may not know this.

440
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:25,144
The Flower Session will be held once every four years.

441
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,320
Now, Dianjinggu Sect is the one holding it

442
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,922
and every sect leader is fretting over this.

443
00:27:29,922 --> 00:27:33,639
If Tianxu Hall steals the spirit keys during the event,

444
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,236
the secret ground will be in danger.

445
00:27:36,236 --> 00:27:38,014
Heavenly Officer, you came just in time.

446
00:27:38,014 --> 00:27:40,544
My Lord, I hope you can help us out.

447
00:27:40,544 --> 00:27:42,364
Now that Xuanji has immense powers,

448
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:45,116
My Lord, if you accompany her to the Dianjinggu Sect,

449
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:48,027
you two will surely be able to defeat all the demons.

450
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:51,079
What is she saying?

451
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,779
- You can fight. <br> - I can fight?

452
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:54,124
Sure.

453
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:55,875
No!

454
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,179
As a heavenly officer, you mustn't interfere with mortal affairs.

455
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,079
If not, the heavens will punish you.

456
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,030
That is the heavenly law.

457
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,039
Am I right, My Lord?

458
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,150
How did you know all that?

459
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,879
Wait! You look familiar.

460
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:15,510
Have I seen you before?

461
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,610
Fine. Let me test you.

462
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,797
Teng She!

463
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:30,949
- You mustn't bully him! <br> - Your senior is weak!

464
00:28:30,949 --> 00:28:34,670
You trained with him? It's no wonder you're weak, too.

465
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,220
Senior, I have an idea.

466
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,538
Heavenly officers can't interfere with mortal affairs indeed.

467
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:48,902
But now, he's my spirit beast.

468
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:52,759
If the Tianxu Hall comes for me and puts me in a dangerous situation,

469
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,039
I don't think he's breaking the law if he assists me by then.

470
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,218
Xuanji!

471
00:28:57,218 --> 00:28:59,079
Stinky woman, you're smart! That's decided then.

472
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,024
Come, let's slay some demons and enjoy some good food.

473
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,505
Sect Leader.

474
00:29:04,505 --> 00:29:06,004
Heavenly Officer, if that's the case,

475
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:08,325
please travel with us to Dianjinggu Sect then.

476
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:09,987
I...

477
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,519
Listen, I've searched around Mount Buzhou.

478
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,863
I didn't discover Ruo Yu's body.

479
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:22,299
There's only a bloody shirt.

480
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:24,910
It was too dirty. I didn't bring it back.

481
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,939
Only a bloody shirt was left?

482
00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:31,678
Don't tell me Tianxu Hall has captured Ruo Yu?

483
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:37,228
My King.

484
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,256
What's with that Teng She?

485
00:29:42,256 --> 00:29:46,439
Well... I've ordered guards to keep watch over him.

486
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,179
I don't know when Lord Teng She descended to the mortal realm,

487
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:53,209
but it's fine. He's someone's pet now.

488
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,610
He deserved that.

489
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,407
He didn't create trouble in the heavens,

490
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:00,168
but he came and created trouble for me!

491
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,470
Can you remove that annoying snake somehow?

492
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,147
About that...

493
00:30:08,147 --> 00:30:10,988
Teng She is Xuanji's spirit beast now.

494
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:13,639
This is a mortal affair now.

495
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,999
I can't do anything.

496
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,759
If I do anything, the Heavenly Emperor will be able to sense it.

497
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,620
When he senses this, he'll be able to detect your presence, too.

498
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,356
I really can't do anything.

499
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:28,555
What's the use of keeping you?

500
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,696
My Jing, there's another thing.

501
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:36,199
You asked me to seal God of War's life pillar, right?

502
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,099
But I can't suppress it anymore.

503
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:43,499
I'm afraid the God of War will awaken sooner or later.

504
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:45,179
What?

505
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,946
My King, please forgive me.

506
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:50,970
The Mirror of Origin is a heavenly item.

507
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,339
Since it has triggered her to recover some of her memories,

508
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:54,740
it's hard to reverse it.

509
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,971
I can't do anything about it.

510
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,758
But in my opinion,

511
00:31:02,758 --> 00:31:06,939
it isn't necessarily a bad thing for Teng She to be here.

512
00:31:06,939 --> 00:31:10,619
That demon who used its malignant aura to trap Xuanji,

513
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,437
I'm sure he's trying to go after the God of War.

514
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,758
So, Teng She can serve as an aid instead.

515
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:18,531
Am I right?

516
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,020
Now, the demons are getting stronger.

517
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,679
Some of them are even elders of the Five Great Sects.

518
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,935
It's hard to guard against them indeed.

519
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,557
Fine.

520
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,267
I'll leave that annoying snake around Xuanji for now.

521
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,878
At least he can protect her.

522
00:31:37,657 --> 00:31:43,487
The most important thing now is to find the demon with the malignant aura.

523
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:47,011
Only then, can I rest at ease.

524
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,500
- Linglong. <br> - You're awake?

525
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,890
Xuanji.

526
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,699
I brought you your favorite osmanthus cake.

527
00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:06,288
Xuanji, where's Little Six? Why isn't he here to see me?

528
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,992
The Hairpin Tournament will be held soon.

529
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:14,333
Father wants Sixth Senior to lead our juniors for the training.

530
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,907
Xuanji, stop lying to me.

531
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:18,099
I vaguely recall that he went to Tianxu Hall to save me.

532
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:19,819
But I don't remember anything else.

533
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:21,339
Did something happen to him?

534
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,342
- I... <br> - Tell me!

535
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,836
I...

536
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,410
Sixth Senior committed some mistakes

537
00:32:28,411 --> 00:32:32,508
and he broke our rules. Now, he's locked up in a cell.

538
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:35,239
What did he do to break our rules?

539
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,598
- Did Father make things difficult for him? <br> - No.

540
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,904
Don't worry.

541
00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:41,944
Although Father was angry, he still cares for him.

542
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:43,679
He let us visit him often.

543
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,117
No! I need to find him!

544
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,770
<i>Your favorite food isn't glutinous rice cake.</i>

545
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:55,124
It's osmanthus cake.

546
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,184
Send Minyan some of your favorite glutinous rice cakes.

547
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,539
Linglong, what's wrong?

548
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:10,380
Don't touch me!

549
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:15,533
Xuanji.

550
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:18,186
I... I want to be alone for now.

551
00:33:18,187 --> 00:33:20,166
Please leave.

552
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,220
- Linglong. <br> - Listen to me.

553
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:25,479
Please, leave me alone.

554
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,900
Just go.

555
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,050
I...

556
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,775
Linglong!

557
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:33,261
Linglong, Sixth Senior misses you as well.

558
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,867
He wants to see you, too.

559
00:33:34,868 --> 00:33:36,919
Linglong, please don't be like this.

560
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:40,470
I beg you! Leave me alone!

561
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,272
<i>I knew it. That Yu Sifeng</i>

562
00:34:19,272 --> 00:34:21,180
<i>must be hiding the food he had made somewhere.</i>

563
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,936
<i>So, it's here.</i>

564
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,840
Who's there?

565
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,560
I'm a heavenly officer! Everyone here bows to me, you know?

566
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,579
- Be quiet! <br> - You're stealing my food.

567
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:33,479
Someone! There's a thief!

568
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,859
Stop shouting!

569
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:37,850
You'll call stinky woman here, you know?

570
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,419
It's lucky that she didn't come. I'd be in trouble if she does.

571
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:47,222
She'll nag at me all day!

572
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,750
You're stinky woman's sister, right?

573
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,700
My goodness. I retrieved your primordial spirit, you know?

574
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,563
What's wrong with eating your osmanthus cake?

575
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:04,653
You're so petty.

576
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,995
I'm sorry! I won't eat them!

577
00:35:18,995 --> 00:35:20,359
I'll return them to you, okay?

578
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,130
Please don't cry. I won't eat them.

579
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,442
Sister, why are you so useless?

580
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:30,979
You're crying over such trivial matters?

581
00:35:30,979 --> 00:35:33,038
Do you know someone risked his life

582
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,206
and suffered tremendously

583
00:35:35,207 --> 00:35:37,757
in order to retrieve your primordial spirit?

584
00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:39,367
If he sees you crying,

585
00:35:39,368 --> 00:35:42,498
I'm sure his tears will flood the room.

586
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,290
Stop crying.

587
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,604
I need to go now. Promise me this.

588
00:35:53,604 --> 00:35:57,532
Promise me that you'll not shout after I undo the spell.

589
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,550
Blink twice if you agree.

590
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,223
Okay.

591
00:36:03,223 --> 00:36:05,459
If you shout after I undo the spell,

592
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:09,550
I'll burn your hair and make you go bald.

593
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,690
Okay. I'll go now.

594
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,520
Wait!

595
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,868
You're going back on your words?

596
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:18,719
You said someone risked his life for me. That person is Minyan, right?

597
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,417
Xuanji and the rest wouldn't tell me anything.

598
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:23,168
Do you know something? Tell me about it!

599
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,790
I only know a little bit.

600
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:32,967
That Zhong Minyan, he became a spy in Tianxu Hall

601
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:35,819
in order to retrieve your primordial spirit.

602
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:36,898
A spy?

603
00:36:36,898 --> 00:36:40,490
I think he became a spy because he was deceived.

604
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:44,662
He killed someone in order to acquire the villain's trust.

605
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:47,650
He killed someone? Who did he kill?

606
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,270
It's the stinky woman's Second Senior.

607
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,119
He suffered a terrible fate. He was chopped into pieces.

608
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,850
Second Senior?

609
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,146
<i>Brother Wu Tong asked me to bring you some food.</i>

610
00:37:05,146 --> 00:37:07,050
<i>Have some food.</i>

611
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,699
<i>Here.</i>

612
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,096
<i>Are they nice?</i>

613
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,609
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

614
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:13,300
♫ <i> Time will not be enough to describe the past lifetimes </i> ♫

615
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,050
♫ <i> Ripped apart after being bonded together </i> ♫

616
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:22,510
♫ <i> A debt incurring with each encounter </i> ♫

617
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:28,700
♫ <i> I sigh as there is only yearning that cannot <br>be resolved in this world </i> ♫

618
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,506
Sixth Senior.

619
00:38:30,506 --> 00:38:31,670
Xuanji?

620
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,539
Sifeng?

621
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:35,579
Sixth Senior, I've brought you some food.

622
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,599
Where's Linglong? How is she?

623
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,300
Is she awake?

624
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,783
She's awake now. She's doing well.

625
00:38:43,783 --> 00:38:45,699
Sixth Senior, don't worry.

626
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,059
This is great.

627
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:49,037
So, where is she?

628
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:50,979
Didn't she follow you here?

629
00:38:50,979 --> 00:38:53,779
Sixth Senior, the food is hot.

630
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:55,284
You should eat them now.

631
00:38:55,285 --> 00:38:57,555
If not, they'll get cold.

632
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:05,250
♫ <i> I will not fear the coldness of the crystal colored glass </i> ♫

633
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,583
Linglong...

634
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,726
is she not willing to see me?

635
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,190
- It's not like that! She... <br> - You don't need to lie.

636
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,341
If she wants to see me,

637
00:39:26,961 --> 00:39:29,071
she would've been here right away.

638
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,998
She's right.

639
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:33,689
I was a fool. I was deceived by Tianxu Hall.

640
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:36,208
It's normal if she doesn't want to see me.

641
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,063
If I were her, I would've ignored a person like me.

642
00:39:41,063 --> 00:39:44,454
Minyan, don't think too much.

643
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:48,626
Linglong... She's very worried about you.

644
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,310
Yes, Sixth Senior.

645
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,813
She's really worried about you.

646
00:39:53,813 --> 00:39:57,190
- She... She's busy with something. <br> - I understand.

647
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,030
That's why she...

648
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,650
Linglong... She always hates evildoers.

649
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,658
I've committed a grave mistake.

650
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:10,125
I have no right to beg for her forgiveness,

651
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,328
but I don't regret my decision.

652
00:40:13,972 --> 00:40:16,302
If I could turn back time,

653
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,430
I would've made the same decision.

654
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,550
I'm willing to do anything

655
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,542
as long as I can save Linglong.

656
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,070
The only thing I'm sorry about...

657
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,327
is Second Senior.

658
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,839
Second...

659
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,170
Regarding Second Senior,

660
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,190
did you really kill him?

661
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,667
Yes.

662
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,362
I'm ashamed to face him.

663
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,630
<i>My beloved Linglong</i>

664
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,300
<i>was the one behind your second senior's death.</i>

665
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,072
<i>Me?</i>

666
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,039
Sifeng. Xuanji.

667
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,627
I need you two

668
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,190
to pass a message to Linglong, okay?

669
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,210
Tell her that I was lying.

670
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,939
I didn't love her at all.

671
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:46,892
My promises don't count now.

672
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,385
I've committed a grave mistake.

673
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:52,890
I have no right to like her anymore.

674
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,217
Tell her that she doesn't need to be awkward.

675
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,870
It's just that...

676
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,330
I can't accompany her for the rest of her life.

677
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:11,057
Ask her to take good care of herself.

678
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,130
If she meets someone she likes in the future,

679
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,474
you must persuade her.

680
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,010
Tell her not to throw her tantrums that often.

681
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,159
If not, people who don't understand her

682
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,640
may think she's not good enough.

683
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,460
It'll be painful for me.

684
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,360
I just hope that Linglong can stay happy

685
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,690
in the future.

686
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,049
That's enough for me.

687
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,439
Why are you crying here?

688
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,450
You should go in since you're here.

689
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,826
You're too embarrassed?

690
00:43:28,826 --> 00:43:31,996
- I'll call them out then. <br> - Don't!

691
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,250
I was the one who let down Little Six.

692
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:42,090
I've committed so many atrocious acts in Tianxu Hall, yet he...

693
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,499
It's all because of me.

694
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:49,170
He wouldn't have been deceived if it weren't for me.

695
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,490
He wouldn't have been misunderstood as well.

696
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,026
I've let him down.

697
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,750
I don't understand you mortals.

698
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,753
Sect Leader has issued an order. Zhong Minyan is to be summoned.

699
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,732
Where are you bringing Sixth Senior?

700
00:44:12,732 --> 00:44:16,448
Senior. Xuanji. Master said he's holding an open trial for him.

701
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:30,990
