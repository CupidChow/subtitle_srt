18
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,330
<i>Since the reordering of the primal chaos, <br> <i>(T/N: formless mass before creation in Chinese mythology)</i></i>

19
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,120
<i>the heavenly realm has ruled over the mortal and demon realms,</i>

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,680
<i>becoming the head of the three realms.</i>

21
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,567
<i>Yet, around a thousand years ago, King Vanquisher became ambitious</i>

22
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:49,808
<i>and rejected the authority of the heavenly realm.</i>

23
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:54,249
<i>He finally formed the demons and devils army and started wars across borders.</i>

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,359
<i>The heavenly realm thought it was nothing to be afraid of.</i>

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,839
<i>Unexpectedly, King Vanquisher had an extremely powerful general,</i>

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,820
<i>the Devil Star, Demon Maleficent, who defeated the heavenly army</i>

27
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,398
<i>and forced the gods to retreat to Heavenly Gate.</i>

28
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,759
<i>The Jade Emperor was shocked.</i>

29
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,119
<i>He and King Bailing dispatched many soldiers to fight the enemy.</i>

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,607
<i>But they lost again and again.</i>

31
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:19,380
<i>The heavenly realm was now in imminent danger</i>

32
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,680
<i>and the Vanquishers were about to turn the three realms upside down.</i>

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,580
<i>It's at this moment that many strange things happened.</i>

34
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,639
<i>The Devil Star disappeared right before the final great war.</i>

35
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,919
<i>At the same time, a savior appeared in the heavenly realm.</i>

36
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,480
<i>the God of War general.</i>

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,159
<i>She never lost a battle and annihilated the Vanquishers.</i>

38
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,540
<i>Without the Devil Star, the demon realm lost their chance. </i>

39
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,159
<i>Their armies totally defeated,</i>

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,620
<i>the surviving demons were scattered all over the world.</i>

41
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,519
<i>Rumor has it that the death of the Devil Star</i>

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,820
<i>was plotted by the God of War general.</i>

43
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,199
<i>His soul is sealed inside a mythological object called the Crystal Lamp.</i>

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,839
<i>It's hidden in an ancient secret area</i>

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,060
<i>and his primordial spirit was lost in the chaos.</i>

46

<i>[ONE THOUSAND YEARS LATER]</i>

47

<i>The universe changes every thousand years.</i>

49

<i>After a thousand years of rest, the separated primordial spirit</i>

50

<i>is gradually regaining its vitality and waiting for the reunion.</i>

51
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,340
<i>And the demon realm is eagerly waiting for its revival.</i>

52
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,940
<i>It seems that everything isn't over yet.</i>

53
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,940
<i>If the Devil Star returns with the grievance he's been accumulating for a thousand years,</i>

54
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,040
<i>the world will be destroyed.</i>

<i>Greetings, Hall Master!</i>

56
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,319
Elder of the Constellations,

57
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,702
were you talking about these two stars?

58
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:56,420
Yes, Hall Master.

59
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,319
After the Devil Star, Demon Maleficent Star, died,

60
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,839
there were suddenly two stars that appeared far away in the sky.

61
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,799
They're the Demon Star and Maleficent Star.

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,072
For the past thousand years,

63
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:09,118
they were located in the south and north respectively.

64
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,180
They had nothing to do with each other.

65
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,060
But today,

66
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,460
these two stars are suddenly getting closer to one another.

67
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,360
It seems that...

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,517
Seems what?

69
00:04:21,518 --> 00:04:25,039
It seems that they're trying to form into one.

70
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:30,760
Does it mean he's really waking up?

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,946
Hall Master,

72
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:37,359
that lost primordial spirit of the Devil Star

73
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,639
has appeared in Fenru City.

74
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,613
My men have looked into it.

75
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,380
Half of that primordial spirit

76
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,432
will go to the mortal realm for a tribulation via the channel of karma.

77
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,940
You deities have done wrong and have been stripped of immortal forms.

78
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,780
You're here in Fenru City,

79
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,649
and it's a chance for you to reshape your immortal qualities.

80
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:58,900
Be obedient and head to the mortal realm.

81
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,313
When you successfully get through the tribulations,

82
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:02,580
you'll have the chance to return to the heavenly realm.

83
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,500
Consider yourselves lucky!

84
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,660
Hurry up!

85
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,980
Drink this water from the River of Oblivion. We don't have all day.

86
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,199
I'm not drinking it! I don't want to leave the heavenly realm!

87
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,294
I only stole a flat peach. <br><i>(T/N: In Chinese mythology, these peaches were grown by the Queen Mother of the West for immortality)</i>

88
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:15,034
- I'm not going to the mortal realm! <br> - <i>What's there worth remembering?</i>

89
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,440
<i>It's just a boring life.</i>

90
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,290
<i>Forget it.</i>

91
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,010
<i>It's good to forget it.</i>

92
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,700
There's one more thing, Hall Master.

93
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,700
As far as I know, the God of War general and the Devil Star

94
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,350
are entering the mortal realm together for tribulations.

95
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,820
Both of them will be born on the same day, in the same month and year.

96
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,148
It's very interesting.

97
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:47,740
Hall Master,

98
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,740
they are destined to be enemies.

99
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,520
Will it ruin our plan of reviving the demon realm?

100
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,119
No.

101
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,970
Back then, it was the God of War who used the Divine Weapon of the Devil Star, Juntian Cehai,

102
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,820
to seal his soul.

103
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,039
We need both the God of War and the Divine Weapon's powers to save the Devil Star.

104
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,480
I want both of those kids.

105
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,317
Go look into it quickly.

106
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:21,079
Find out where the God of War and the Devil Star will be born.

107
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,360
Yes.

108
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,997
<i>Madam, push!</i>

109
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,280
<i>Stronger, Madam!</i>

110
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,839
<i>We're almost there.</i>

111
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,559
<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

112
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,799
Madam.

113
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,239
Madam, take a deep breath!

114
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,876
Push!

115
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,119
<i>- Push, Madam!</i> <br> - It's been more than two hours.

116
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,059
Why hasn't this second child come out yet?

117
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:46,800
<i>Almost there, Madam! Push again!</i>

118
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,080
Is it a difficult labor?

119
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:59,099
Who are you, Demon? How dare you break into the forbidden ground of Fenru City!

120
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,875
Don't delay it, open the channel of karma now!

121
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,100
Get in now!

122
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,159
<i>Madam.</i>

123
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,280
<i>It's out.</i>

124
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,740
<i>It's coming out, Madam!</i>

125
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,559
It's out, Madam!

126
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,433
It's out!

127
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,663
<i>[SIXTEEN YEARS LATER]</i>

128
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:50,199
No one thought Madam would give birth to a stillborn

129
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,500
after ten months of pregnancy.

130
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,140
Sect Leader was afraid that she would be too sad after seeing it.

131
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,180
Thus, he buried that child on that night.

132
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,971
No one saw what happened on that midnight coming.

133
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,759
Ghost!

134
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,180
What happened? Why was there a child crying?

135
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,434
The butler ordered to dig out the grave of Second Lady.

136
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,340
Guess what happened!

137
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,199
Senior!

138
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,350
That child came back to life!

139
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,938
Our junior sister took a long time to take her first breath.

140
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:37,040
You're all the disciples of other martial uncles.

141
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,614
You didn't know. Our junior sister was born without the six senses.

142
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:42,000
<i>- Senior Brother. <br> - What?</i>

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,220
<i>What you do mean lacking in the six senses?</i>

144
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,529
<i>I'll tell you what they are.</i>

145
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,809
<i>Sight.</i>

146
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:49,042
Sound.

147
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,220
<i>Smell.</i>

148
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,460
<i>Taste.</i>

149
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,799
And she's born without touch and awareness too.

150
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,959
She is, to put it politely, heartless.

151
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,420
To put it otherwise, she's a good-for-nothing.

152
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,919
But Junior Sister is now sixteen.

153
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,279
But she hasn't even mastered the first level of the Shaoyang Mantra.

154
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,620
<i>- Really? <br> - You're exaggerating!</i>

155
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,860
Fine. You don't believe me?

156
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,159
I'll show it to you all today. Let's go.

157
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,753
<i>Sure, let's go check it out!</i>

158
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,520
<i> She's pretty high up.</i>

159
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,920
<i> She's alseep.</i>

160
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,690
<i>Wake up, wake up.</i>

161
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,798
Look at her hand!

162
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,780
She really doesn't feel pain.

163
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,319
Do you believe me now?

164
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,806
Yes, we do now.

165
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:50,283
Second Senior Brother, is this yours?

166
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:51,593
Yes.

167
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:04,394
<i>- Are you all right? <br> - I'm all right.</i>

168
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,159
Second Senior Brother, if you always want to fool me,

169
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,439
you've got to be creative about it.

170
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,160
So, you're all scared of this?

171
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,277
Yes. You can't feel.

172
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:16,479
Of course you're not scared of it.

173
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,820
Xuanji!

174
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,479
- Xuanji! <br> - Linglong!

175
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,159
- Linglong! <br> - Xuanji!

176
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,500
Come, let me take a look at your hand.

177
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,580
It's all red.

178
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,100
- I'm all right. <br> - Chen Minjue!

179
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,198
You!

180
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,140
If you ever bully my sister again,

181
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,220
I'll ask Father to teach you a good lesson!

182
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,780
And you! Are you looking for trouble?

183
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,946
My good Junior Linglong. Don't get mad.

184
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:39,980
It's just a joke.

185
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,119
All right, all right.

186
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,919
Linglong, don't take it seriously.

187
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,580
I don't know what pain is, anyway.

188
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,140
And I don't even know how to get mad.

189
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,313
You see, I told you that Junior Sister wouldn't mind it.

190
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,900
I'm telling you.

191
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,399
If you ever dare bully my sister again,

192
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,639
I'll ask Master to flog your bottom!

193
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,735
Enough.

194
00:10:57,735 --> 00:10:59,159
Stop fighting.

195
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,460
- Little Six. <br> - Yes?

196
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,514
- Whose side are you on? <br> - I...

197
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:08,199
Linglong, did you forget why Aunt Yinghong asked us to come here?

198
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,460
I almost forgot about it.

199
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,422
- Xuanji, I've got some good news for you. <br> - Hurry, let's go.

200
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,778
Aunt Hong asked us to serve the sects during the Hairpin Tournament

201
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:17,239
- Let's go down the mountain now. <br> - Linglong.

202
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,875
This isn't good news.

203
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,180
Can I not go? I want to take a nap here.

204
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,871
- I don't want to join it. <br> - No way!

205
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:27,239
- No way! <br> - I'm not going!

206
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,319
- Spare me! <br> - No way!

207
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,599
The Hairpin Tournament is one of the largest events the five great sects gather for.

208
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,400
The aces from the other four sects are coming, too.

209
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,239
We can go check out if there're any handsome men first.

210
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,300
Let's go.

211
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,719
You're acting improperly

212
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,780
and you're trying to badly influence Xuanji.

213
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,173
What do you mean by bad influence?

214
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:42,260
I'm already sixteen.

215
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,460
Aunt Hong said I can look at people I like.

216
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,200
Xuanji will turn sixteen this year.

217
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,500
We can look at whoever we want.

218
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,720
Let's go, Xuanji.

219
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,181
I...

220
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:09,261
To test with such a powerful demon wolf,

221
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,746
isn't it a bit too risky?

222
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,149
Sifeng, as expected from my direct disciple,

223
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,739
only Yu Sifeng passed this set of tests.

224
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:24,156
As for the remaining disciples...

225
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:28,489
<i>Please spare us, Palace Master!</i>

226
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:33,139
Lize Palace doesn't take in good-for-nothings.

227
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,219
Let's do it the old way then.

228
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:39,239
Strip them of their skills and chase them out of here.

229
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,114
<i>Please spare us, Palace Master!</i>

230
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,048
Enough!

231
00:14:54,498 --> 00:14:56,984
You said Sifeng can't be the Head Disciple of Lize Palace

232
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:59,281
because he's still young.

233
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,699
But he's so gifted.

234
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:03,339
If not him, then who?

235
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:07,500
When Sifeng comes back after winning Shaoyang's Hairpin Tournament.

236
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,160
I will...

237
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,153
grant him the Golden Feather Token

238
00:15:14,153 --> 00:15:17,659
and have him start to manage the affairs of Lize Palace.

239
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:27,168
Since you've made up your mind, we shall obey you.

240
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,019
We're leaving for Mount Shaoyang for the Hairpin Tournament in a few days.

241
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:35,438
For many of you young disciples, it'll be your first time leaving the palace. <br> <i>[Lize Palace]</i>

242
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:37,059
I'm reminding you.

243
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:39,619
What is the first rule of the Lize Palace?

244
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:43,339
Never take off our masks in front of outsiders!

245
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:45,260
I'm glad that you remember it.

246
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,099
You know very well the consequences of breaking the rule.

247
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:52,508
Yes!

248
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:03,678
Sifeng, let's see who gets to Shaoyang first.

249
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,380
<i>[Lize Palace]</i>

250
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,599
Greetings, Hall Master.

251
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:23,299
Is there still no news?

252
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:27,899
We lost God of War and the Devil Star at Fenru City sixteen years ago.

253
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,656
And you haven't found anything since then!

254
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,527
Please don't get mad, Hall Master.

255
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,699
I've just found out the whereabouts of the Juntian Hoop and Chehai Hook.

256
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:38,520
But...

257
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,367
But it's not easy to get hold of Juntian Cehai.

258
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:50,356
Hall Master,

259
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:53,513
it has to do with Wu Zhiqi.

260
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:59,179
Since they're in the hands of an old friend, I should meet up with him.

261
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:03,019
I'll try my best to sneak our men into the five sects.

262
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:07,223
The Quadrennial Hairpin Tournament will be held in Shaoyang.

263
00:17:07,223 --> 00:17:09,339
If those two kids are among the crowd,

264
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,919
their unusual powers will be shown before everyone. They won't even be able to hide it.

265
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,500
The Devil Star and God of War

266
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,460
entered the channel of karma on the fourth of the 4th month, between 9:00 to 11:00 at night.

267
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,299
That's when they were born.

268
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:25,659
Remember. Don't miss any child who was born between 9:00 to 11:00 at night.

269
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:27,099
Yes.

270
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:32,499
<i>[Shaoyang]</i>

271
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:34,979
My fellow seniors from Xuanyuan Sect, you'll be staying at Tianzi Pavilion.

272
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:36,359
Please.

273
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:38,418
Show the seniors the way.

274
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:39,858
Yes.

275
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,139
Xuanji!

276
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:45,609
Pull yourself up!

277
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:47,379
We're representatives of Shaoyang right now.

278
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:49,676
You can't embarrass Father.

279
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:54,093
Yes.

280
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,114
Do you really not want to stay here?

281
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,659
Forget about it. You can leave.

282
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:03,667
Otherwise, you won't even know if you caught a cold from the cold wind.

283
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,719
These are the dog blood for the sacrifice.

284
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,586
Take them home.

285
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,824
You can do it, right?

286
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,142
Yes.

287
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:13,985
Open your eyes and look at it.

288
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:15,539
Even if you don't know me,

289
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,820
surely you recognize the sword made by the Dianjing Valley.

290
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,649
- You can't enter without a plaque. <br> - Stop fighting!

291
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:21,678
You can talk to me.

292
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,627
Who are you?

293
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:35,499
I'm the Shaoyang sect leader's daughter, Chu Linglong.

294
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:37,619
Am I important enough to talk to you?

295
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,739
Linglong,

296
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:42,019
this Dianjing Valley sect member insists on entering without a plaque.

297
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:44,940
You'll go in only when the elder of your sect confirms your identity.

298
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,489
- Next. <br> - What if I insist on going in?

299
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:51,339
I'm sorry. You can't enter without a plaque.

300
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,721
You rude lass.

301
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:54,959
Are you messing with me on purpose?

302
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,192
Fine, look at this.

303
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,809
Linglong!

304
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,331
I'm all right.

305
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:06,780
Now that I've shown you the plaque, can I enter now?

306
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,462
Do you think you can brush me off with your trivial martial skill?

307
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:12,140
Any one of our sect members can beat you up.

308
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,059
Even if you get in, it'll be a waste of your time!

309
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:17,619
Do you think you're able to stop me?

310
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:19,256
How impolite you are!

311
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:20,561
Don't come so close to my sister!

312
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,411
Xuanji!

313
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:26,259
You said anyone can beat me. Does it include this lass?

314
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:31,233
Fine! I'm curious to know how powerful Shaoyang Sect is!

315
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,001
Xuanji!

316
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:36,959
Xuanji!

317
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,439
- Let go of my sister! Xuanji! <br> - What do we do?

318
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,653
Let go of me! Xuanji!

319
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,530
Pull out your sword.

320
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,179
Why should I pull out my sword?

321
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,180
I don't want to fight with you.

322
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,079
Pull out your sword or I'll let go of my hand.

323
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:57,379
Don't! Don't let go!

324
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:58,479
I don't know how to summon a sword.

325
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,200
I'll fall down if you let go.

326
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,100
Are you kidding me? Didn't you brag about yourself?

327
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,879
How dare Shaoyang Sect call itself powerful with a good-for-nothing like you.

328
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,764
I'll show you what being powerful means.

329
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,819
Are you scared? Cry if you're scared.

330
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:17,979
Cry and call yourself a good-for-nothing.

331
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:19,439
And I'll let you down.

332
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,459
I was born without the ability to cry.

333
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:22,579
Have you had enough fun yet?

334
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:24,971
If so, take me back. I'm sleepy.

335
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:27,639
Fine. Since you want to be stubborn with me,

336
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,028
let's play a more exciting game.

337
00:20:47,735 --> 00:20:51,019
What do I do? I'll die for sure if I fall

338
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:53,540
and Father will call me an embarrassment again.

339
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,739
What are you d-doing, w-woman?

340
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:34,019
Your clothes are dirty. I'll clean them for you.

341
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:36,715
D-Don't touch me!

342
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:44,219
Senior, are you here for the Hairpin Tournament, too?

343
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,139
I'm a disciple of the Shaoyang Sect.

344
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,059
But I don't know how I ended up here.

345
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,657
Can you take me back?

346
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:53,000
Take me back and

347
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,280
when I get back, I'll wash this dog blood off for you.

348
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,661
N-No need.

349
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,700
W-What do you w-want?

350
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,579
W-Why do y-you talk l-like this?

351
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:09,099
Y-You're senseless.

352
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,339
Wait a second.

353
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:11,419
Senior,

354
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:15,985
I really don't know how I ended up here.

355
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:19,739
And I don't know how to fly. I can't go back there.

356
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:22,259
You can w-walk back then.

357
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,419
No!

358
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,940
It's too tiring!

359
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,951
I've never met such a l-lazy cultivator like you.

360
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,139
Where did you leave my sister? Say it!

361
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:53,499
I don't know where she fell!

362
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:54,980
She's so stupid that she can't even stand on a sword.

363
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,100
You are stupid! You've lost my sister!

364
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,060
How can you talk like this?

365
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,300
- Have you found Xuanji? <br> - Not yet.

366
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,259
We have yet to search that dense forest of Shengyun Valley.

367
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:05,459
Its terrain is complicated. Sometimes there are demons lurking there.

368
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:07,003
We're short-handed and need more people.

369
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:08,100
I'll go tell Father now.

370
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,860
- Nothing can happen to her. <br> - Linglong.

371
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,420
Xuanji!

372
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,259
Are you all right?

373
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,499
This kind and powerful senior saved me.

374
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:18,419
Great! You must be a senior from Lize Palace.

375
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,870
You look like a gentleman,

376
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,780
unlike that man who is a bully!

377
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,420
Thank you, Brother.

378
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,900
I'd like to enter.

379
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,460
M-May I register now?

380
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,860
Lize Palace, Yu Sifeng.

381
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,500
I'm quite curious.

382
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,620
You disciples of Lize Palace wear your masks all the time and don't dare to take them off.

383
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,040
What are you hiding behind them?

384
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,807
What? Want to fight with me?

385
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:48,260
Bring it on!

386
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,617
I'm not interested in it.

387
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,258
E-Everyone is still waiting to e-enter the Shaoyang Sect.

388
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:00,707
I see, a little stammerer has saved a little idiot.

389
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,302
That's very interesting!

390
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,900
I heard that the disciples of Lize Palace rarely meet women.

391
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,260
You carried this little idiot all the way back here.

392
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,660
What did it feel like?

393
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,125
Wu Tong, are you looking for trouble again?

394
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,900
- I'll tear your mouth apart! <br> - No!

395
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,260
- What are you doing? <br> - Let go of me! You...

396
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,140
What's going on?

397
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,380
What are you all arguing about?

398
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,177
- Aunt. <br> - Aunt.

399
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,140
Master,

400
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,959
I accidentally lost my plaque.

401
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,260
While waiting to enter the Shaoyang Sect,

402
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,540
I pulled a prank on the junior sisters.

403
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,380
I'm afraid they're not happy about it.

404
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,661
What prank? You call that a prank?

405
00:24:40,661 --> 00:24:42,161
- You... <br> - Wu Tong,

406
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,180
you shouldn't have done so.

407
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,220
Apologize to the daughters of Sect Leader Chu.

408
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,852
Yes. I was wrong, Master.

409
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,460
Junior Sisters, I apologize.

410
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,220
I didn't ask you to apologize!

411
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,306
We're all the disciples of five sects.

412
00:25:01,306 --> 00:25:03,578
We're all brothers and sisters.

413
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,079
I hope we can help each other in the future.

414
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,460
You're right, Elder Chu.

415
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,260
Come with me now.

416
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,800
Yes.

417
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,740
Aunt, how could we let them go just like that?

418
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,260
Do you know how he bullied Sister?

419
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,284
Thanks to Yu Sifeng from Lize Palace, he–

420
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:32,031
He left?

421
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:36,580
Xuanji, did you know that Yu Sifeng

422
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,860
is the most promising disciple in Lize Palace?

423
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,719
But their palace rule is to wear their masks every day.

424
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,140
We don't know what they look like.

425
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,039
But I bet he's definitely good-looking.

426
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,879
- Good-looking?<br>- Yes.

427
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,860
I bet he's definitely ugly-looking.

428
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,940
Why else would he wear his mask all the time?

429
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,160
You're just being jealous.

430
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,380
What a coincidence!

431
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,999
- What? <br> - Look.

432
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,740
Yu Sifeng and I

433
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,559
were born in the same year and month and on the same day.

434
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,480
It's true. <br><i>[Lize Palace - Yu Sifeng]</i>

435
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,300
<i>W-Walk back then.</i>

436
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,260
<i>No!</i>

437
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,818
<i>It's too tiring!</i>

438
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:55,100
Chu Xuanji,

439
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,180
all you know to do is to sleep and be lazy!

440
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,220
And you don't do what you should do!

441
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,980
You're already sixteen,

442
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,180
but you can't even summon a sword.

443
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:08,725
If word gets out, Shaoyang Sect will be shamed!

444
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,700
Mother!

445
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,959
- Why are you crying? <br> - Mother!

446
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,369
If you're watching us from above,

447
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:21,340
look at how Father is scolding Xuanji!

448
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,460
You'll be very upset, for sure!

449
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,279
You...

450
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,780
Mother said

451
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,500
she just wanted Xuanji to live a safe life.

452
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,420
She didn't expect her to follow the path of a cultivator.

453
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,540
Did you forget about that?

454
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,700
Xuanji is like this because she's born without the six senses.

455
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,599
She didn't ask for it.

456
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,820
Who could understand her pain?

457
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,168
All right, Linglong.

458
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,603
Mother!

459
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,220
If you insist on punishing Xuanji,

460
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,630
I'll keep crying to Mother!

461
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,959
Okay, forget about it. Stop crying.

462
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,506
There's a reason why she's dull.

463
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:11,060
But it can't be an excuse for you to not work hard.

464
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,700
Let's do this.

465
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,260
You have ten days

466
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,180
to master the first of the Yaohua sword moves.

467
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,970
If you don't work hard and still can't master it,

468
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,970
I'll teach you a lesson.

469
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,439
Okay.

470
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,260
I knew it'd work. Father can't do anything about us

471
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,360
whenever I cry to Mother.

472
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,217
But Linglong, this is indeed useful.

473
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,340
This is the most important weapon.

474
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,620
It works not only on Father.

475
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,540
If your future lover dotes on you,

476
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,660
he can't do anything about you when you cry.

477
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,180
Is that so?

478
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,020
But I don't have this.

479
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:55,860
I think tears are the most precious thing in the world, aren't they?

480
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,660
When you got mad today,

481
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,279
did your eyes feel tingly that you felt like crying?

482
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,620
I did feel quite angry.

483
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,439
But I thought I didn't need to take them seriously.

484
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,100
As long as you're happy.

485
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,660
Instead of taking them seriously, I'd rather go take a nap.

486
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,600
Then do you...

487
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,740
Little Six,

488
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,419
are you here to send us a birthday cake?

489
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:19,780
I'm the sender.

490
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,660
But Master was the one who asked to prepare it.

491
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,799
This is Eight Treasure Cake. And it's made from eight ingredients.

492
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,980
It's true that Father is fierce. But he dotes on us.

493
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,559
Let's eat now. <br><i>[Longevity]</i>

494
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,970
Xuanji.

495
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,399
It's so delicious.

496
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,500
Xuanji, it's such a shame that you can't taste it.

497
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,900
Can you not bring that up?

498
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,180
It's okay if I can't taste it.

499
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,900
As long as Linglong enjoys eating it, I'm happy.

500
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,620
Our Xuanji is such a good girl, but Father still isn't satisfied with her.

501
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,380
Jeez!

502
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,562
Then today is that little stammerer's birthday, too!

503
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,960
Sifeng?

504
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:06,242
Sifeng!

505
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,599
Is Sifeng around?

506
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,860
- Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng!

507
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,640
- Someone is looking for you. <br> - Sifeng!

508
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,279
Why are you looking for me?

509
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,300
Little Stammerer, you forgot your plaque.

510
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,146
I came to return it to you.

511
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,740
A-Anything else?

512
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,620
- Oh yeah, Little Stammerer. <br> - I'm not L-Little Stammerer.

513
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:35,359
Then, why do you s-stumble over t-three words?

514
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,291
None of your business.

515
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:40,240
You can stumble over two words, too.

516
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,420
Just leave if there's nothing else.

517
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,739
Here's the thing, Miss.

518
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:45,460
Sifeng has always stayed in Lize Palace. And he's new to the Central Plains.

519
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,100
He's not so fluent in the Central Plains language. I hope you don't mind.

520
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,660
I'll leave you two to it.

521
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,300
I see.

522
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,959
I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Chu Xuanji.

523
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,820
Thank you for saving and bringing me back to Shaoyang.

524
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,479
You're the first best friend I've made outside Shaoyang.

525
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,079
Today is your birthday and it's also mine, too.

526
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,620
Therefore, I've brought you a birthday cake. <br> <i>[Longevity]</i>

527
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,500
We share the same birthday. Linglong said fate brought us together.

528
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,520
What f-fate? Stop talking nonsense.

529
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,120
We're not friends.

530
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,250
And I never e-eat birthday cakes.

531
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,651
<i>I've finally found a peach tree.</i>

532
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,969
<i>And there's even morning dew.</i>

533
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,719
Where's Xuanji? Master asked me to teach her Yaohua sword moves.

534
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,820
Why is she nowhere to be seen?

535
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,997
With her personality, she's probably taking a nap somewhere.

536
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,519
It's wrong to steal and eat bird eggs.

537
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,042
Got it?

538
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,729
It's you again.

539
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,039
It's you, Little Stammerer.

540
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,890
Why is it... always you?

541
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,159
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to knock over your tea.

542
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,500
There's a mountain spring. I'll go fetch you some water.

543
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,437
- Wait for me. <br> - No need.

544
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,479
Peach dew...

545
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,599
Buddha's hand...

546
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,740
Pine nut...

547
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,119
They make a triple cleansing drink.

548
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,119
A cup a day helps one's cultivation.

549
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,044
I'm not drinking if it's not peach dew.

550
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,378
Why are you being so particular?

551
00:34:17,378 --> 00:34:20,740
It's just tea. Is there any difference?

552
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,319
I've never met...

553
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,679
s-someone so lazy like you.

554
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,039
And you know nothing.

555
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,380
And y-you're poor at spell casting.

556
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,879
No wonder... you get bullied.

557
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,439
You're useless.

558
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,850
You...

559
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,100
Although I am pretty useless,

560
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,199
but I didn't mean to knock over your tea just now.

561
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,620
I saw a bad snake that tried to steal bird eggs.

562
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,413
I wanted to catch it. And I accidentally...

563
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,204
It's that bad snake again!

564
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,291
Let go! Let go of it!

565
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,929
This is... my spirit... beast.

566
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,580
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to squeeze it.

567
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,887
Is it dead?

568
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,859
Tell me. Why...

569
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:21,079
did you... squeeze it?

570
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:26,058
B-Because... it c-came t-to m-me.

571
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:29,917
I thought... it'd bite me... for sure.

572
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,931
Don't mimic... the way I talk.

573
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,140
What do we do then?

574
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,800
Should I let my father have a look at it?

575
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,496
He might be able to save it.

576
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,540
Little Silver Flower!

577
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:54,839
Little Silver Flower!

578
00:35:57,224 --> 00:35:59,947
Where are you, Little Silver Flower?

579
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,640
Little Silver Flower!

580
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,140
Why is your spirit beast so disobedient?

581
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,820
My father's shows itself at once when we call it.

582
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,373
It's still young and immature.

583
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,724
Don't talk... bad about it.

584
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,978
I feel it's being... attracted by... something.

585
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,484
This peach forest is strange indeed.

586
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,500
We've been looking for Little Silver Flower for so long,

587
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,700
but it's still nowhere to be found.

588
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,245
There...

589
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:44,201
There's something wrong with this peach forest.

590
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,479
Little Stammerer, do you feel hot?

591
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,969
I... I don't.

592
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,250
You don't?

593
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:24,260
Little Stammerer, we're of the same age.

594
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,925
But why are you so knowledgeable?

595
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,718
Stop talking.

596
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,303
This formation... is very difficult.

597
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,679
Why are we here on the lake surface?

598
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,891
Little Stammerer, are you all right?

599
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,199
This isn't a... lake surface.

600
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,740
There's a barrier here.

601
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,450
Barrier?

602
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,780
It's really a barrier.

603
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,340
I know why there's a peach formation out there.

604
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,940
This is the secret ground of Shaoyang Sect.

605
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,766
How did we end up here?

606
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,860
How do we get in?

607
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,839
I don't know. Shaoyang Sect disciples aren't allowed to come near here.

608
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,180
I need to enter it.

609
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,300
No way!

610
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,836
This is the forbidden ground of the Shaoyang Sect.

611
00:38:46,836 --> 00:38:50,153
Without Father's permission, you can't set foot in it.

612
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,679
Are you all right, Little Stammerer?

613
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,639
How do we... open it?

614
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,220
I don't know.

615
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,959
We shouldn't be here.

616
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,639
- Let's go now. <br> - We're running out of time!

617
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,999
I'm connected... to my spirit beast.

618
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,156
Little Silver Flower has been attracted to it by something.

619
00:39:12,157 --> 00:39:15,300
If I don't save it, it'll be in danger!

620
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,380
Open it!

621
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,927
Let's head back and ask for help.

622
00:39:18,928 --> 00:39:21,820
- What do you think? <br> - We're running... out of time!

623
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,160
I...

624
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,180
I can do nothing about it. I'm so poor at spell casting.

625
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,839
This is the most ancient barrier

626
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,359
set by the most powerful elder in our sect.

627
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,519
There's no way I can open it.

628
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,131
If you don't believe me, just watch.

629
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,140
It's... open.

630
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,382
How did I open it?

631
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,759
- Open it! <br> - No way!

632
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,759
If my father finds out, I'm dead meat.

633
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,359
Chu Xuanji!

634
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,434
Little Silver Snake... is dying!

635
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,163
I...

636
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,159
We'll come out after saving Little Silver Flower.

637
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,599
Your father won't find out about it.

638
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,950
He won't? I'll...

639
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,279
Okay. You helped me once.

640
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,380
I'll help you this once.

641
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,759
There's something... powerful in there.

642
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,199
Don't come in... no matter... what.

643
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,591
Okay. Hurry up.

644

Little Silver Flower!

646
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,760
Little Silver Flower!

647
00:41:03,437 --> 00:41:05,349
Little Silver Flower!

648
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,348
Little Silver Flower!

649
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,733
Little Silver Flower.

650
00:42:11,435 --> 00:42:14,919
Little Stammerer! Little Stammerer!

651
00:42:17,323 --> 00:42:19,023
Little Stammerer!

652

Don't hit Little Stammerer! Let go of him!

655
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,760
Shut up!

656
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,020
- Why did you come in here? <br> - I'm here to save you, Little Stammerer.

657
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,397
Hurry up and leave!

658
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,380
Are you all right, Little Stammerer?

659
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,660
This is the Candle Dragon. It's very powerful.

660
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,599
You can't save me.

661
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,839
Run!

662
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,891
Is it powerful? Let's run together then!

663
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,246
Little Stammerer!

664
00:43:09,898 --> 00:43:11,520
Little Stammerer!

665
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,106
Little Stammerer!

666
00:43:15,107 --> 00:43:16,359
Are you all right, Little Stammerer?

667
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,033
Little Stammerer!

668
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,126
You're bleeding.

669
00:43:40,902 --> 00:43:42,599
Little Stammerer.

670
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,680
You're all right.

671
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,199
Little Stammerer.

672
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,359
Thank God you're okay.

673
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,080
Little Stammerer.

674
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,600
Thank God you've woken up.

675
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,918
My... M-My m-mask.

676
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,380
It's missing!

677
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,460
Your face was bleeding just now. That's why I took your mask off.

678
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,860
- Where's the m-mask? <br> - The mask is over there.

679
