Finally, this day has come.

33
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,899
Greetings, Demon Lord.

34
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:03,266
Congratulations for coming back to the three realms.

35
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:11,621
Yuan Lang?

36
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,399
I remember now.

37
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,919
You were the Left and Right Lieutenant of King Asura.

38
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,700
Looks like you still remember me.

39
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,217
I've been waiting for 1,000 years for you to be revived.

40
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,267
Thank you for giving me a physical body again.

41
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:55,100
I'm willing to fight the heavens with you

42
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,620
to finally seek revenge for Demon Citadel after 1,000 years.

43
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,390
You can follow me then.

44
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,219
Yuan Lang, you stupid bird.

45
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:03,732
You are really a bad penny.

46
00:04:03,732 --> 00:04:06,108
He believes you because he has been sleeping for 1,000 years.

47
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:09,073
Let me tell you. I won't let you escape today.

48
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:12,980
Wait. I remember that the heavens have tortured you for 1,000 years, too.

49
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,554
Don't you want to kill them together with me to avenge yourself?

50
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,330
I indeed detest those people from the heavens.

51
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,559
I fought with them and stole their things 1,000 years ago.

52
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,699
So it's only normal that they locked me up,

53
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,867
but now they even dared to hurt my Little Fox.

54
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:37,675
Besides, I found out today that

55
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:40,259
Bailing was so shameless to do that to you.

56
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,618
You were once the person I admired the most,

57
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,579
and Xuanji was my good friend.

58
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:48,820
- So, I have to avenge all of you. <br> - Good.

59
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,859
Looks like I didn't misjudge you.

60
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:54,370
But I have to kill this stupid bird today.

61
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,003
I don't care what kind of grudge you have between you.

62
00:04:57,003 --> 00:05:00,830
Before we destroy the heavens, I don't want there to be an internal conflict.

63
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,299
After we seek our revenge, you can kill whoever you want.

64
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:06,570
Just go ahead and do it.

65
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,840
Fine.

66
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,662
After all, that Bailing is more shameless than this zombie here.

67
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:25,430
I'll kill Bailing first, and then I'll kill you.

68
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,610
If that's the case, come with me to Fenru City now.

69
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,766
I want to give a present to the heavens.

70
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,619
King Bailing, Devil Maleficent has already destroyed Fenru City

71
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:58,480
and broke the Core Fire.

72
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,250
He even went to the Demon Citadel to revive the Asuras army.

73
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,387
What about Shen Shu and Yu Lu?

74
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,042
Please have mercy on us!

75
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:20,373
Good-for-nothing.

76
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:22,380
- King Bailing. <br> - Tell me.

77
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,939
What bad news is it this time?

78
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:25,540
Devil Maleficent sent us a war declaration

79
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,588
stating that he'll attack the heavens and drench it with blood.

80
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:34,335
I never thought that my compassion back then

81
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:37,946
would lead him act so arrogantly now.

82
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:40,974
He wants to attack the heavens?

83
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:43,268
Fine.

84
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,587
Pass down my decree.

85
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,539
Put the whole heavens on high alert now.

86
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:52,579
We won't give him an opportunity to take advantage of us!

87
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,025
Yes, King Bailing.

88
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,824
Xuanji.

89
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:04,673
Xuanji.

90
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,599
Xuanji. Xuanji!

91
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:10,159
- Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng!

92
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:11,274
Where is Xuanji?

93
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:14,359
Sifeng, Xuanji has already turned into Devil Maleficent now.

94
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,499
- It's pointless to look for her! <br> - I want to look for her.

95
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:18,219
Calm down!

96
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:21,180
Even if she's Devil Maleficent, she's still Xuanji!

97
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,220
Sifeng, Xuanji has become Devil Maleficent. She's gone.

98
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,139
Devil Maleficent has summoned all demons to the Demon Citadel to greet him.

99
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,177
He'll lead an attack towards the heavens and bring chaos to the three realms.

100
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:31,659
When you were unconscious,

101
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,059
demons were already acting so rampantly in the human realm.

102
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:36,210
Now, no one dares to come out.

103
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,681
The world is in a mess now.

104
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,860
No. Xuanji must still be alive.

105
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,752
She's just controlled by Devil Maleficent for now.

106
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:46,340
- I'll look for her tomorrow. <br> - No.

107
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,700
The majority of the demons are gathered at the Demon Citadel now. We can't be reckless.

108
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,820
I think we better discuss it with Master first.

109
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,380
I'll go! You are mortals but I'm a demon.

110
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,819
Since it's a gathering of demons, all the more reason for me to go.

111
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,100
Sifeng.

112
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,500
Sifeng, a lot of elders who didn't obey him

113
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,398
- have been killed. <br> - Yes.

114
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:05,124
- I'm worried that you– <br> - No.

115
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:09,100
Even if she's controlled by the Devil Star's soul, I'll find her.

116
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,731
The Devil Star's soul has been harboring hatred for 1,000 years in the Crystal Lamp.

117
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:15,180
As soon as it combined with Xuanji's primordial spirit,

118
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,831
I'm afraid that her mere 20 years of life

119
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,439
is just nothing compared to Devil Maleficent's tens and thousands of years of memories.

120
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,050
Yes.

121
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,379
Bailing sealed up her six senses and took away all of her memories.

122
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:29,627
He even transformed into Hao Chen and yet couldn't stop her from becoming him.

123
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:32,340
From that, you can see how deep Devil Maleficent's hatred is.

124
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,767
Little Phoenix, you can't risk your life like this.

125
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:37,019
Why are you so unconfident in Xuanji?

126
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:39,539
Although Devil Maleficent's soul is controlling her now,

127
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,026
it doesn't mean that she's completely gone.

128
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:45,351
Devil Maleficent has hatred in his heart but Xuanji has love in her heart.

129
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:49,299
I don't believe that someone can totally forget about the person they once loved.

130
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:52,798
I believe that Xuanji is still alive, too. We can save her.

131
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:57,639
It doesn't matter whether she's the God of War or the Devil Star.

132
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,842
I will stop Devil Maleficent and bring back Xuanji.

133
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,069
Please advise him against this.

134
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,264
Okay. If that's the case, I won't stop you anymore.

135
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:12,168
You–

136
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:14,140
But you have to remember this.

137
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,140
The more people Devil Maleficent kills, the more demonic he will become.

138
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,315
If you want to get Xuanji back,

139
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:22,420
you have to stop him from slaughtering people without restraint.

140
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,899
<i>Greetings, Demon Lord!</i>

141
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:36,869
<i>Welcome back to the three realms!</i>

142
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,820
The heavens destroyed the Demon Citadel 1,000 years ago.

143
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,323
We demons were scattered across the realms and were suppressed and bullied.

144
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:50,547
Now that I'm back, I'm going to stir up the three realms

145
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:53,800
to restore the power and dignity of us demons.

146
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,128
On the seventh day of the seventh month,

147
00:09:56,128 --> 00:10:00,559
I'll use the Fallen Bell to burst open heaven's gate and attack them.

148
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,195
Go and swear a blood oath with the Right Lieutenant later.

149
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:06,427
Then, we'll slaughter everyone in the heavens together.

150
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:09,580
<i>Attack the heavens! Slaughter everyone there!</i>

151
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,430
<i>Restore the power of demons again!</i>

152
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:17,659
This is Demon Lord's first order and someone is already defying it.

153
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,108
Well done.

154
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,810
My clan has little power. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

155
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,132
I hope that...

156
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:42,614
Since you are of no help, why should I keep you?

157
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,354
Demon Lord, you said that we've been suppressed and bullied for 1,000 years.

158
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:49,611
You want to lead us to fight against the heavens.

159
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:52,355
We came here because we respect you.

160
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:54,739
But not every clan is good at combat.

161
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:56,339
How can you just kill us like that?

162
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,803
Insolent!

163
00:10:57,803 --> 00:11:00,886
He was just gone for 1,000 years and now, even a mere Green Sparrow

164
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:03,445
is teaching him how to lead?

165
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:06,979
You are humiliating us just like how the heavens treat us.

166
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:08,798
Goodbye!

167
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,010
<i>Calm down, Demon Lord.</i>

168
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,530
The heavens annihilated us Asuras and drove away the rest of your demons.

169
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,059
All of you have been hiding in fear for more than 1,000 years.

170
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:32,210
At first, I thought that all of you would look forward to seeking revenge.

171
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,322
But I never thought that this insult of 1,000 years

172
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:39,230
would turn you into mellow and obedient cowards.

173
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,739
As demons,

174
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:45,296
are you really going to just hide in the human realm and be slaughtered?

175
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:49,403
I won't accept this kind of humiliation,

176
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:52,614
and it'll be the same for every demon clan!

177
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:55,137
I don't care if you want to swear the blood oath or not.

178
00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:57,900
From today onward, we are no longer separated by clans.

179
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,899
All of you will obey me.

180
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:02,193
We'll gather here on the seventh day of the seventh month.

181
00:12:02,193 --> 00:12:05,196
This is an order, not a discussion.

182
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:07,296
Those who disobey me

183
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:10,050
will be killed without mercy.

184
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,787
<i>Yes, Demon Lord!</i>

185
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,103
You are dismissed.

186
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,368
Sifeng?

187
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,525
Yu Sifeng.

188
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:26,514
It's you?

189
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:29,337
12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird?

190
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,962
I know that Xuanji's consciousness is still there.

191
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:43,147
She won't let you commit the sin of murder.

192
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:45,033
Let her out!

193
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,602
<i>Sifeng.</i>

194
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:51,146
<i>Sifeng! Sifeng!</i>

195
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,123
<i>Sifeng!</i>

196
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,125
<i>Sifeng!</i>

197
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:08,538
Xuanji, you became Devil Maleficent to save me.

198
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,049
Have you forgotten about me now that you've become Devil Maleficent?

199
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:14,749
<i>Sifeng!</i>

200
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,763
Devil Maleficent, let me out!

201
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:22,574
<i>Let me out!</i>

202
00:13:22,574 --> 00:13:26,822
Chu Xuanji is just the image of my primordial spirit.

203
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:31,498
Since I'm already back, she is gone now.

204
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:37,402
Stop mentioning this lowly mortal's name again and again in front of me.

205
00:13:38,421 --> 00:13:40,986
Xuanji will not be gone.

206
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,383
I'm sure that she's still here.

207
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:45,372
She was controlled

208
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:48,283
by your soul because she wanted to save me.

209
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:51,850
Although she was once part of your primordial spirit,

210
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,580
she has gone through 1,000 years with 10 reincarnations.

211
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,692
She's her own person now.

212
00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:59,100
She's not Devil Maleficent.

213
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,030
Xuanji,

214
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,668
I know that you are inside him. Right?

215
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:08,550
<i>Devil Maleficent, let me out!</i>

216
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,819
So what if she's here?

217
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:12,914
So what if she's not?

218
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:17,390
She's just a small portion in this long life of mine.

219
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,259
Among my tens and thousands of years of memories,

220
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,469
hers is just a drop of water in the ocean.

221
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:28,217
Do you think she can control me? Dream on.

222
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,379
Since you once risked your life to protect my primordial spirit,

223
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,590
I'll not kill you.

224
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,687
Get lost now.

225
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:40,699
I promised Xuanji that I would bring her back.

226
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:43,419
I won't leave until she appears!

227
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:46,876
Sifeng, wake up, you dummy.

228
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:48,320
She's not Xuanji now.

229
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,450
I believe in Xuanji!

230
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,773
She is not the Devil Star.

231
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:57,553
And she doesn't want to be Devil Star.

232
00:14:57,553 --> 00:15:00,829
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

233
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:04,161
You won't,

234
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:08,290
because Xuanji won't allow you to kill me.

235
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,819
I already said that she's just a part of my primordial spirit.

236
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:14,266
Do you think that you can stop me?

237
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:16,433
You tried so hard to lock Xuanji up

238
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:20,310
and used your power to take the form of Devil Maleficent

239
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,219
because you are afraid.

240
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:24,379
You are afraid that you can't control her.

241
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:30,730
You are afraid that she won't turn into a bloodthirsty demon like you.

242
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,727
<i>Let me out!</i>

243
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:35,117
<i>Let me out! Sifeng!</i>

244
00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:37,060
<i>Sifeng!</i>

245
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:41,463
<i>Sifeng!</i>

246
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,420
<i>Let me out!</i>

247
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,866
- Xuanji. <br> <i>- Let me out!</i>

248
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:50,097
<i>Let me out!</i>

249
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:54,540
<i>Let me out! Sifeng!</i>

250
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,322
<i>Sifeng!</i>

251
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,060
Xuanji!

252
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,930
<i>Sifeng!</i>

253
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,959
Sifeng.

254
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:10,561
Sifeng.

255
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:12,521
Xuanji.

256
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,860
Xuanji.

257
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,919
You are back, Xuanji.

258
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,420
I knew it.

259
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,060
I know that you are still here.

260
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,740
You won't disappear.

261
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,620
Sifeng, why are you so foolish? He'll kill you.

262
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,930
I said that I'll get you out, no matter what.

263
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,922
You promised me that you wouldn't forget about our vow.

264
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:37,890
Sifeng... but I'm Devil Maleficent.

265
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,378
It really doesn't bother you?

266
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:45,614
In my heart, you'll always be Xuanji no matter what happened.

267
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,220
But I'm not me anymore.

268
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,060
I'm afraid that I can't control myself.

269
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,206
I'll kill you.

270
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:56,179
What we had in the past will forever be gone.

271
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:58,859
Sifeng, forget about everything.

272
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:01,130
Forget about her.

273
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,583
You are not Xuanji.

274
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:17,266
Xuanji wouldn't ask me to forget about our past.

275
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:30,337
Yu Sifeng, you are really sentimental.

276
00:17:30,337 --> 00:17:34,147
Your memories with Chu Xuanji are very precious, right?

277
00:17:34,147 --> 00:17:40,307
But to me, they are just boring and embarrassing.

278
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:42,124
Boring?

279
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:44,460
Embarrassing?

280
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,216
You are just jealous of Xuanji.

281
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:49,140
You were betrayed,

282
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,020
but you hate her

283
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,230
because you've never obtained this kind of feeling before!

284
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,571
Yu Sifeng,

285
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:05,282
I'm going to get rid of Chu Xuanji's memories and you now.

286
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:06,931
Demon Lord!

287
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:10,759
Demon Lord, you want to fight the heavens. Right?

288
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,710
I'm sure that you still need a helper, right?

289
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,722
I'm a 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird. With my power,

290
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,427
not many can be my match.

291
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:22,656
Why don't you consider me?

292
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:24,785
Let me become your helper.

293
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:28,834
Demon Lord, he's really a good fighter. I can attest to that.

294
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,126
Fine. If he can withstand one blow from me,

295
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:35,739
I'll accept him.

296
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,640
Bring it on.

297
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,083
<i>Stop! I won't allow you to hurt Sifeng!</i>

298
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,787
<i>I won't allow you to hurt Sifeng!</i>

299
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,219
<i>Let him go!</i>

300
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:08,430
<i>Devil Maleficent!</i>

301
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:18,090
I already said that I'm very powerful.

302
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,739
You should keep me by your side.

303
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:21,366
Fine.

304
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:25,036
Yu Sifeng, I'll hand over the Fallen Bell to you.

305
00:19:25,036 --> 00:19:28,160
After 10 days, I want it to be filled with resentment

306
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,430
and use it to tear down Heaven's gate.

307
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,290
I won't disappoint you.

308
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,259
Yu Sifeng!

309
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,620
Don't think that I don't know what you are planning!

310
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,979
Chu Xuanji is just a speck of dirt in the Demon Lord's life.

311
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:55,299
Don't ever think about getting back Chu Xuanji.

312
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:58,499
The Demon Lord is back in the three realms to seek revenge from the heavens.

313
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:03,239
Don't think that you can ruin his ambition.

314
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,459
Yuan Lang, why are you getting so agitated?

315
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:11,043
Are you afraid that you'll lose your place because he's hotter and more powerful?

316
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,499
I just don't want to let someone with an ulterior motive

317
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:15,339
stay by the Demon Lord's side.

318
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,378
<i>Sifeng!</i>

319
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,809
I chose him myself.

320
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:41,579
So, I'm the only one who can punish or award him.

321
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,950
Don't ever think about touching him.

322
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,272
Those who disobey me

323
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,603
will not be forgiven so easily.

324
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,667
These are the prisoners we caught from the human realm recently.

325
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,420
We'll feed them to the Fallen Bell.

326
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,539
Feel free to use them.

327
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,460
Thank you,

328
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,275
but feeding these Fallen Bell souls is not an easy task.

329
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:26,011
It's a dangerous chore.

330
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:28,219
You may leave me alone here with them.

331
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:32,850
I don't want to accidentally feed this bell with any of you in here.

332
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,570
If that's the case, we won't disturb you then.

333
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,426
We'll wait for your good news.

334
00:21:38,426 --> 00:21:39,996
Let's go.

335
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:49,559
<i>- Don't come over here! Don't kill us! <br> - Don't kill me!</i>

336
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,580
<i>Don't kill us! I beg you!</i>

337
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,488
Left Lieutenant.

338
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,059
Left Lieutenant, we found a suspicious-looking person.

339
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:04,259
She's wearing a mask and looking around. She might be a spy from the heavens.

340
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:05,899
- Take me to her. <br> - Yes, Left Lieutenant.

341
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:07,200
Both of you can wait for me here.

342
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,760
Yes, Left Lieutenant.

343
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,900
<i>- Don't kill us.</i> <br> - Don't worry.

344
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,000
I won't hurt you.

345
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,168
Leave through the back of the mountain now that it's nighttime.

346
00:22:20,168 --> 00:22:22,819
Continue north and you'll find an exit.

347
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,930
If you go out from there,

348
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,313
you can go back to the human realm.

349
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:32,199
Come out.

350
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,039
<i>- Let's go now. <br> - Let's go.</i>

351
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,688
<i>- Thank you. <br> - Thank you.</i>

352
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:40,803
<i>- Let's go. <br> - Thank you.</i>

353
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:27,703
Little Fox, why did you come to the Demon Citadel?

354
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:29,739
Let me tell you. Wait for me here.

355
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:31,480
Wu Zhiqi,

356
00:23:32,508 --> 00:23:34,539
I don't want to wait anymore.

357
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,539
You were detained in Fenru City for 1,000 years and I waited for you.

358
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:40,439
And I waited for you when you helped Xuanji open the Crystal Lamp.

359
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:43,579
Now that you want to go to war with the heavens, how can I wait again?

360
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:47,125
You've just gotten your freedom. Why are you putting yourself in danger again?

361
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,736
What if you are caught by the heavens again?

362
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,659
I don't want to live another 1,000 years of suffering.

363
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,630
I can't believe you, you sour fox.

364
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,579
I'm going to war soon.

365
00:23:58,579 --> 00:23:59,779
Wu Zhiqi,

366
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,609
you know better than me how the Demon-Immortal War ended.

367
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,419
No matter who wins, what has it got to do with us?

368
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:07,387
We'll still live our own lives in the end.

369
00:24:07,387 --> 00:24:10,730
If that's the case, why do you have to be involved in this?

370
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,427
Isn't it nice to leave now

371
00:24:16,427 --> 00:24:19,754
and go back to that little hut with me to live our lives in peace?

372
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:22,539
You don't like me in human form? Fine.

373
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:26,539
- I'll turn back into a fox. As long as... <br> - Little Fox, look up there.

374
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:29,777
Tens of thousands of demons are waiting to seek revenge on the heavens.

375
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:31,563
We have to seek revenge, too!

376
00:24:31,563 --> 00:24:34,059
Have you forgotten who ruined your face and locked me up for so long?

377
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:36,579
I've endured them for more than 1,000 years! I can't endure it anymore!

378
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:41,090
We should've gone to war 1,000 years ago. I'm going to beat them up today!

379
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,199
Little Fox, just wait for me here.

380
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:04,707
Don't worry.

381
00:25:04,707 --> 00:25:06,547
It won't take long.

382
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,106
I'll take down the White Tiger Star Lord

383
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:11,339
and use his fur to make a cape for you.

384
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:14,480
Then I'll extract his core and spread it on your face.

385
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,770
Wait for me.

386
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,290
Wu Zhiqi,

387
00:25:29,924 --> 00:25:32,793
this is the last time I'll beg you.

388
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:35,084
If you don't leave with me,

389
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,901
I'll go into hiding

390
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,860
and you'll never find me again.

391
00:25:41,464 --> 00:25:45,522
Little Fox, I know what kind of power you have.

392
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:47,430
Where can you hide?

393
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,100
Stop fooling around.

394
00:25:49,818 --> 00:25:51,445
Wait for me.

395
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,299
What kind of golden ray is that?

396
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,939
I think it's the Fallen Bell!

397
00:26:15,939 --> 00:26:18,489
It's the Fallen Bell that broke Heaven's gate 1,000 years ago.

398
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:20,910
It still exists?

399
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,437
Demon Lord, once the war starts, it'll poison the three realms!

400
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:43,537
Keep quiet!

401
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,883
Wu Zhiqi, listen to my command.

402
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,674
Attack the heavens now!

403
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:52,299
Okay.

404
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:55,630
Here I go.

405
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,180
King Bailing.

406
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,203
King Bailing, they are coming.

407
00:27:40,203 --> 00:27:42,139
We can't hold them back without Heaven's gate.

408
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:44,139
- Let's retreat. <br> - Retreat?

409
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:46,306
Why should we retreat?

410
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:48,887
They are the ones who should retreat.

411
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:55,739
Pass down my order.

412
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:58,219
Tip over the Mutton Fat Jade Jar

413
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,379
and release the Sea of Life and Death.

414
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:03,330
Separate the heavens with the human realm!

415
00:28:04,064 --> 00:28:06,539
King Bailing, if you release the Sea of Life and Death,

416
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,540
it'll disrupt the cycle of the universe's aura.

417
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,658
The corrupted aura will then accumulate and it'll turn into another Demon Citadel.

418
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,588
Humans will perish.

419
00:28:14,588 --> 00:28:18,169
<i>Please take back your order!</i>

420
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,219
We have the order of priority.

421
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:28,478
The heavens are in grave danger now. We have to protect ourselves first!

422
00:28:28,478 --> 00:28:30,339
Heavenly King is not here.

423
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:32,234
I'm in charge here.

424
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:34,191
Do as I say now.

425
00:28:34,191 --> 00:28:38,383
If you hesitate, you'll be beheaded without mercy!

426
00:28:57,856 --> 00:29:00,117
What is that?

427
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,727
Sea of Life and Death.

428
00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:41,169
You would rather use the Sea of Life and Death at the cost of the human realm?

429
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,665
Fine.

430
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,560
Let's see how long you can hide up there.

431
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,772
Little Fox!

432
00:30:42,356 --> 00:30:45,060
Little Fox, are you okay?

433
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,290
Stupid Monkey.

434
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,937
You–

435
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:52,318
You just care about fighting, right?

436
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,190
Why...

437
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,540
Why do you care about me now?

438
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,783
Little Fox, are you dumb?

439
00:30:59,783 --> 00:31:02,621
Why did you do that? Why?

440
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:04,374
Yes.

441
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,332
Why is it so painful?

442
00:31:10,332 --> 00:31:13,086
You are my everything.

443
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:16,017
You can throw away your life

444
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:18,740
but I don't want you to die.

445
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,659
Little Fox, stay strong. I'll find you the best medicine.

446
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:24,858
I'll cure you, for sure.

447
00:31:24,858 --> 00:31:26,822
No.

448
00:31:26,822 --> 00:31:28,508
Stupid Monkey,

449
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:33,425
you'll definitely keep your promise to others

450
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,993
without any care for your life.

451
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,468
You don't even care about me.

452
00:31:40,153 --> 00:31:42,338
I care about you.

453
00:31:45,124 --> 00:31:49,959
It's just that sometimes, I don't know what to say.

454
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,899
Little Fox, don't worry.

455
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,706
I won't let you suffer any more after this.

456
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:56,930
Stupid Monkey,

457
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:00,605
this promise

458
00:32:02,364 --> 00:32:04,864
is already enough for me.

459
00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:12,764
Wu Zhiqi, you made promises with others everywhere.

460
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,587
Can you promise me something, too?

461
00:32:18,587 --> 00:32:20,181
Okay.

462
00:32:20,181 --> 00:32:22,526
After I die,

463
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:27,010
can you bring me back?

464
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,148
Let's leave the Demon Citadel.

465
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,472
Stop fighting.

466
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:35,304
Okay. I promise you, Little Fox.

467
00:32:35,304 --> 00:32:37,100
I won't fight anymore.

468
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,784
I won't fight anymore, Little Fox.

469
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:45,214
Can you kiss me?

470

♫ <i> My hair turns white from yearning, hope as little <br> as dropping off the cliff </i> ♫

480
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,160
♫ <i> My hair turns white from yearning, hope as little <br>as dropping off the cliff </i> ♫

481
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,075
<i>Wu Zhiqi,</i>

482
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,140
<i>in the next life...</i>

483
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,925
- Little Fox! <br> - <i>I don't want to become a fox anymore.</i>

484
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:53,830
- Little Fox! <br> - <i>I'll become even more beautiful</i>

485
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,669
<i>with the appearance that you like.</i>

486
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:59,362
<i>If I become like that,</i>

487
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,984
<i>will you like me then?</i>

488
00:34:06,716 --> 00:34:08,576
Little Fox,

489
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,778
I've been lying to you.

490
00:34:16,227 --> 00:34:18,322
You are beautiful.

491
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,166
You are really attractive.

492
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:01,590
Eldest Brother Wu, what has happened outside?

493
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:06,140
I won't fight anymore.

494
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,402
I'll get you out.

495
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,223
Eldest Brother Wu, what happened?

496
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,506
Little Fox is dead.

497
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:21,201
I promised her that I wouldn't fight anymore.

498
00:35:22,324 --> 00:35:24,749
So I came here to save you.

499
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,644
Let's go.

500
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,635
Both of you are just going to leave without goodbyes?

501
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:34,820
Such disrespect for the Demon Lord.

502
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,059
Demon Lord, I've already said that Yu Sifeng was going to rebel.

503
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:41,530
Now, looks like Wu Zhiqi wants to leave, too.

504
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,968
Both of them are traitors.

505
00:35:43,968 --> 00:35:48,219
Wu Zhiqi, I respected you 1,000 years ago.

506
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:52,260
And now you are the only one who doesn't need to address me as Demon Lord.

507
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,455
I treated you well.

508
00:35:54,455 --> 00:35:57,667
Why are you leaving me now that we are defeated?

509
00:35:57,667 --> 00:36:00,518
Is it just like what Yuan Lang said?

510
00:36:00,518 --> 00:36:03,070
Are you going to betray me?

511
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,930
I don't know what betrayal means.

512
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,750
Just now, Little Fox died saving me from that battle.

513
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,061
I've already promised her not to fight anymore.

514
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:17,970
I'm going to bring her home and bury her demonic core.

515
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:23,887
Devil Maleficent, I think I've repaid you enough for

516
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:27,102
speaking up for me to King Asura back then.

517
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,835
From now on, I'm no longer in debt to you.

518
00:36:30,835 --> 00:36:35,639
Old Wu, you want to bargain with the Demon Lord?

519
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:38,103
Aren't you too arrogant?

520
00:36:38,103 --> 00:36:40,303
What did you say?

521
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:44,454
I misunderstood you then.

522
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:48,411
Being sentimental and loyal are your best qualities.

523
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:51,859
I wasn't expecting you to pay me back when I spoke up for you back then.

524
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:55,522
Since you want to leave now, I won't force you to stay.

525
00:36:55,522 --> 00:36:57,398
You can leave,

526
00:36:57,398 --> 00:37:00,170
but Yu Sifeng has to stay.

527
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,852
Yu Sifeng, you put down an order to foil our military plan.

528
00:37:05,852 --> 00:37:07,419
That's a fatal crime.

529
00:37:07,419 --> 00:37:10,010
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

530
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:13,019
Devil Maleficent, you have Xuanji's memories inside you.

531
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:16,355
I did it so that you wouldn't commit even more sins of murder

532
00:37:16,355 --> 00:37:19,390
and suffer in the future.

533
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:23,418
I can kill you. I can let you go, too.

534
00:37:23,418 --> 00:37:25,850
Xuanji is making you do it, right?

535
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,609
Don't think too much.

536
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:33,499
For me, Chu Xuanji is just a fragment in my mind. She's powerless,

537
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:38,010
but you are quite interesting.

538
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,627
How about this? I know that you are the leader of the Rose Gold Birds.

539
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,499
If you do something for me,

540
00:37:43,499 --> 00:37:47,950
I'll forgive you for the crimes that you've committed.

541
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,300
What is it?

542
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,085
Find the Rose Gold Birds. Order them to burn their demonic cores

543
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:54,688
and carry my army over the Sea of Life and Death.

544
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:56,436
Burn their demonic cores?

545
00:37:56,436 --> 00:38:01,391
You'll destroy their cultivations and turn them into cripples.

546
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:05,570
It's their honor to be able to die for the Demon Lord.

547
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,986
Yu Sifeng, just agree to it.

548
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:14,950
Unfortunately, I'm already not their leader since a few years back.

549
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,423
So, I don't know where they are.

550
00:38:17,423 --> 00:38:21,010
But Yuan Lang is the Rose Gold Bird with the most advanced cultivation.

551
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:26,130
With his power, he can fly through that sea seven to eight times without a problem.

552
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:30,378
You can bestow to him this honor of burning his demonic core instead.

553
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:35,019
Yu Sifeng, I'm giving you a chance because I think that you are very amusing.

554
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:37,470
Don't be so imperious.

555
00:38:38,243 --> 00:38:42,450
Since you won't tell me about the Rose Gold Bird's whereabouts,

556
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,317
I'll have to kill you.

557
00:38:45,317 --> 00:38:47,019
I really don't know.

558
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:49,979
If you don't believe me, just kill me then.

559
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:52,028
Okay.

560
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,099
Eldest Brother Wu.

561
00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:01,602
Devil Maleficent, Sifeng is my friend and my savior.

562
00:39:01,602 --> 00:39:06,420
If you want to kill him, I'll help him even if it'll cost me my life.

563
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,041
Eldest Brother Wu.

564
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:12,259
Demon Lord, they are obviously trying to revolt against you.

565
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:14,995
Just kill them to prevent any future troubles.

566
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:17,430
Interesting.

567
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,899
I haven't seen such loyalty in a friendship for a long time.

568
00:39:23,899 --> 00:39:26,357
It'll be a pity if I kill you both.

569
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:30,969
But if I just pardon Yu Sifeng like this, others will think that I'm unfair.

570
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,740
What a dilemma.

571
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:38,093
How about this. If the two of you can withstand three attacks from me,

572
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:42,259
I'll consider that Yu Sifeng has paid for his crime.

573
00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:44,531
But if you die,

574
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:48,342
you can only blame yourself for not being powerful enough.

575
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:52,660
Demon Lord, Rose Gold Bird is useful to us. We can't let Yu Sifeng go.

576
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,410
I've already made up my mind. No need to say anything else.

577
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,617
Eldest Brother Wu!

578
00:40:04,677 --> 00:40:06,347
Sifeng!

579
00:40:07,253 --> 00:40:09,547
Sifeng, how are you?

580
00:40:09,547 --> 00:40:11,716
Don't worry. I'm fine.

581
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,739
You are using the Solar Palm from the Golden Crow Tactic to attack yourself

582
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:26,970
in order to expel the demonic power of the Ocean Wave?

583
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,288
Interesting.

584
00:40:29,288 --> 00:40:32,232
But both of you are seriously injured right now.

585
00:40:32,232 --> 00:40:36,570
The third one, Soul Breaker, will attack your heart and soul. It's very dangerous.

586
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,800
You still want to try it?

587
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,601
Sure.

588
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:50,387
If we are to die here together today, I'll be content with that!

589
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,508
Do it now.

590
00:40:57,508 --> 00:40:59,467
Okay.

591
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,837
Little Fox.

592
00:41:33,445 --> 00:41:35,275
<i>Xuanji?</i>

593
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:37,999
<i>Sifeng.</i>

594
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:40,200
<i>Sifeng! Sifeng!</i>

595
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,027
<i>Xuanji!</i>

596
00:41:42,027 --> 00:41:45,511
<i>Sifeng! Sifeng!</i>

597
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,019
Xuanji.

598
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:52,876
Don't be afraid. I'll find you and bring you back!

599
00:42:02,044 --> 00:42:04,058
Little Fox.

600
00:42:05,788 --> 00:42:08,499
- Eldest Brother Wu. <br> - Little...

601
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:10,156
Eldest Brother Wu.

602
00:42:10,156 --> 00:42:12,459
- Are you okay? <br> - Sifeng.

603
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:14,568
I'm fine.

604
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:17,220
Yu Sifeng, you managed to withstand the Soul Breaker.

605
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,259
Looks like you are very determined.

606
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:21,405
I've changed my mind about you.

607
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,170
You've withstood my three attacks.

608
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,780
I will keep my promise. You can go now.

609
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,810
Sifeng, let's go.

610
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,290
Eldest Brother Wu, I can't leave with you.

611
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:38,811
Foolish kid, if you stay, they won't let you go.

612
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:43,074
If I leave now, I won't be able to forgive myself.

613
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:46,254
I promised that I would stay with Xuanji.

614
00:42:46,254 --> 00:42:48,370
No matter what happens to her,

615
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,655
I'll stay with her until the end.

616
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:53,940
Just now, I've already felt her presence.

617
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,361
She must be waiting for me.

618
00:42:56,361 --> 00:43:01,774
Eldest Brother Wu, I'm sorry for wasting your effort.

619
00:43:01,774 --> 00:43:04,564
If I was the old me,

620
00:43:04,564 --> 00:43:07,510
I would laugh at you for having no guts.

621
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,890
But now, I have only admiration for you.

622
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:13,305
If I were like you

623
00:43:13,305 --> 00:43:16,765
and realized this sooner, Little Fox would be...

624
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,859
Forget it.

625
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:24,411
Sifeng, I'll be leaving then. Take care.

626
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:26,468
See you later.

627
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,674
Yu Sifeng,

628
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:34,979
you wouldn't tell me about your clan's whereabouts and you wouldn't leave.

629
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:38,230
Are you testing my patience?

630
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,270
I stayed because I want to make a bet with you.

631
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:44,421
I bet that within three days,

632
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,788
I can call forth Chu Xuanji from the depth of your heart.

633
00:43:49,388 --> 00:43:53,970
What will you do if you win and what will you do if you lose?

634
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:56,510
If I can do it within three days,

635
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,683
you can't seal her at the bottom of your heart anymore.

636
00:43:59,683 --> 00:44:02,053
Let her out to speak with me.

637
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:05,187
If I can't do it after three days,

638
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:08,179
I'll put my life in your hands forever.

639
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,079
Who do you think you are?

640
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,919
How dare you bet with Demon Lord?

641
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:16,747
Devil Maleficent, do you dare to take on this bet?

642
00:44:16,747 --> 00:44:18,123
Fine.

643
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:19,839
I have a condition, too.

644
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,859
If you can't call forth Chu Xuanji within three days,

645
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:26,274
I'll force you to tell me about the whereabouts of Rose Gold Bird.

646
00:44:26,274 --> 00:44:27,917
How about that?

647
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:29,071
Okay.

648
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:34,539
For these three days, you can become my personal slave then.

649
00:45:08,348 --> 00:45:10,824
These are qingtuan from Zhongli City.

650
00:45:10,824 --> 00:45:13,502
It's Xuanji's favorite snack.

651
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:22,819
From the aroma of this soup, I can tell that you've put a lot of effort into it.

652
00:46:22,819 --> 00:46:26,213
But this is fruitless.

653
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,899
It'll be three days already when tomorrow comes.

654
00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:33,110
You'll have to admit defeat then.

655
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,927
We'll have to wait until tomorrow then.

656
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:59,210
