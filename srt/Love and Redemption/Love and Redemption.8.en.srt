Sifeng, you are indeed my best disciple.

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,873
All these years, there are only a few who survived the 13 Punishments.

30
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:34,014
Master.

31
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:36,741
No wonder you can ignore the palace rules.

32
00:05:36,742 --> 00:05:39,957
Since you've reached the last stage of 13 Punishments,

33
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,738
you just need to make a choice.

34
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,670
Just wear this mask in front of you

35
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:51,122
and you'll be able to regain your freedom

36
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:53,234
and return to Lize Palace.

37
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:54,416
Hurry up.

38
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:57,220
Wear the mask.

39
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,847
This is...

40
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,250
the Lover's Curse Mask?

41
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,546
You are right.

42
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:06,464
This is the Lover's Curse Mask.

43
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:09,280
The person who wears this mask

44
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,660
will have to be heartless and loveless from now on.

45
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,577
Heartless and loveless.

46
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:24,501
After you wear this mask, you have to abandon all of your feelings.

47
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:28,959
Or else, this Loveless Mask will take root inside your body.

48
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,679
Every time you are hurt emotionally, you'll be cursed.

49
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,780
After three times, you'll die.

50
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:40,539
It means that you are exchanging your feelings for your freedom.

51
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:44,267
You are just getting rid of your emotions and feelings.

52
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,140
Compared to suffering in the 13 Punishments forever, this is nothing.

53
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,419
Hurry up.

54
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:55,839
Hurry up and wear the mask.

55
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,438
Humans are not objects. How can we be emotionless?

56
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,759
If you want me to live like ice forever,

57
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,759
how's that different from being a zombie?

58
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,229
Sifeng, stop being so stubborn anymore.

59
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:08,541
Listen to me.

60
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:14,334
Wear the Lover's Curse Mask and become someone without any emotions.

61
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:18,168
That way, I can protect you forever.

62
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:22,046
Master, I don't understand.

63
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,422
Why does Lize Palace want to shackle us from our own emotions?

64
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:28,628
Why can't we be like other sects?

65
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:32,199
Why can't we form bonds to support and love each other?

66
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,410
What's wrong with living like a real human with real emotions?

67
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,245
I won't wear this mask.

68
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:39,689
Insolent fool!

69
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:41,719
If I ask you to wear it, wear it.

70
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,920
Or else, you'll never get out from this 13 Punishments of Tower of Oblivion.

71
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,020
Little Sifeng, wear the mask.

72
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,911
This is not a normal virtual land.

73
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:55,999
Are you going to be stubborn until the end?

74
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,141
Sifeng, you were born with talents that others can only dream for,

75
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:02,830
but you are wasting it like this. Such a disappointment!

76
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:05,130
You want to choose feelings?

77
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:09,837
But do you know what feelings are?

78
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:13,820
How long can feelings last?

79
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,984
Feelings are just lies!

80
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,559
The Lover's Curse Mask is right in front of you.

81
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,540
Think about it carefully.

82
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,740
If you don't wear it,

83
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,011
you'll stay inside here forever!

84
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:48,695
If I can come in, I can definitely get out.

85
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,552
I'll find a way to get out.

86
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:55,606
Go ahead and try then.

87
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,760
Senior Brother.

88
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,877
You haven't improved at all.

89
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:31,835
- Are you slacking off lately again? <br> - No.

90
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,759
But I remember you said that the Five Elements Spell

91
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,540
requires the caster to feel the spirits of the five elements in this world.

92
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,527
Maybe I can't improve because all of my six senses

93
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:48,312
- are undeveloped and I can't feel them. <br> - Nonsense.

94
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:50,659
You just need to train hard.

95
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,060
<i>[MIRROR OF ORIGIN]</i>

96
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,500
Mirror of Origin?

97
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,095
This is what the merman told me about.

98
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,527
I...

99
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:41,995
Senior Brother!

100
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,146
Why wouldn't you let me read that book?

101
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,260
Why do you want to read it?

102
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,700
Because the book stated that

103
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,317
the Mirror of Origin can help me get back my six senses.

104
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,420
So, I want to read about it.

105
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,980
Who told you about it?

106
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,641
It's...

107
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,919
I heard it from someone.

108
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,038
So, I want to give it a try.

109
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,893
Listen to me, Xuanji.

110
00:11:05,894 --> 00:11:08,989
You are not allowed to investigate the Mirror of Origin anymore.

111
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,560
What are you so mad? I just want to become a normal human.

112
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:15,219
I want to feel what normal people can feel.

113
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:18,564
- What did I do wrong? <br> - I've told you many times.

114
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:20,924
You shouldn't care about having the six senses or not.

115
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:23,900
But you are still distracted with that, by readings books that you shouldn't.

116
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,912
You don't know what you did wrong?

117
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:30,490
Looks like I have to punish you for real today.

118
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,119
Go to the back of the mountain to chop down the bamboos.

119
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,239
You are not allowed to eat until you've chopped them down.

120
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,476

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,815
What is it? Are you still angry at me?

156
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:40,020
I wouldn't dare.

157
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,540
I just want to get this done earlier so that I can eat.

158
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,203
No need to chop anymore.

159
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:47,170
I was too strict that day.

160
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,325
I shouldn't have blamed everything on you.

161
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,830
Xuanj, you don't know about it,

162
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,980
but this Mirror of Origin is an evil mirror.

163
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,340
Not only can it not help you recover your six senses,

164
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,122
it can even bewitch you and mess with your mind.

165
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:05,640
How is that possible?

166
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:10,180
This mirror will use the demon and obsession in your heart

167
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,335
to put you into an imaginary land and feed on your soul.

168
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:17,940
If someone urges you to look for that Mirror of Origin,

169
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,560
I'm afraid that person must have an ulterior motive.

170
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,626
I know that having none of the six senses bothers you a lot.

171
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,802
I was too emotional that day.

172
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:35,860
I just want to tell you that

173
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,525
your six senses won't affect anything in your life.

174
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:42,565
But sometimes, I'll feel like a freak.

175
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,119
Extraordinary people are always born different.

176
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,434
Although you don't have six senses, you can smell the demonic aura.

177
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:54,526
Although you can't tell whether a sound is pleasant or not,

178
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:57,576
you can hear the sound of demons.

179
00:15:57,576 --> 00:15:59,210
It means that

180
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,460
you were born with the talent to hunt monsters and demons.

181
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:07,180
You are destined to be the protector of the forbidden ground.

182
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,060
You just need to remember this.

183
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,314
Then, you won't have to care about what you don't have.

184
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,018
But...

185
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,737
No matter if you have six senses or not, you are just you.

186
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:25,300
People who really care about you

187
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,542
won't treat you differently just because you are not the same.

188
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:33,710
In my heart, you'll always be the unique Xuanji that I know.

189
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,605
Senior Brother Hao Chen, I was too impulsive that day.

190
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:40,632
I shouldn't have butted heads with you.

191
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:46,170
Listen to me. Don't think about those unnecessary things.

192
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,062
And don't look for that Mirror of Origin.

193
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:52,680
I don't want you to be used by those who bear you ill will.

194
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,790
Okay. I promise you, Senior Brother Hao Chen.

195
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,790
You are hungry, right? You little glutton.

196
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,771
So much delicious food!

197
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:21,692
Senior Brother Hao Chen, didn't you say that I couldn't eat too much?

198
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:24,680
Why did you buy so much delicious food for me today?

199
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,440
Have you forgotten that it's your birthday today?

200
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,869
That's right. When it was my birthday in the past,

201
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:37,148
Linglong would treat me to delicious food, too.

202
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:40,628
But back then, I couldn't taste anything at all.

203
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,900
By the way, Senior Brother Hao Chen.

204
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,159
Today is Sifeng's birthday, too.

205
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,558
Can you give me that Transmission Bell for a moment?

206
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,199
I want to wish him a happy birthday.

207
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,010
Fine.

208
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,808
Enjoy.

209
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:02,082
<i>I can only wish him in my heart then.</i>

210
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,680
<i>He's such a particular person. I'm sure he will have a good birthday.</i>

211
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,683
<i>I'm sure that he'll celebrate it with good food and drinks.</i>

212
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,786
<i>Xuanji,</i>

213
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,720
<i>this is my 353rd day in this wretched place.</i>

214
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:25,896
<i>I still can't pass this last stage.</i>

215
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:32,464
<i>And... I still haven't heard anything from you yet..</i>

216
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:36,431
<i>Maybe that bell is really broken.</i>

217
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:43,353
<i>Xuanji, I might not be able to keep my promise anymore.</i>

218
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:46,762
<i>I really can't take it anymore.</i>

219
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,110
<i>It's your birthday today.</i>

220
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,178
<i>I know that you can't hear me.</i>

221
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,420
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

222
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,898
<i>I wish that you can live happily forever.</i>

223
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,783
<i>I wish that you can live your life freely however you like it.</i>

224
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,650
Senior Brother Hao Chen.

225
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:15,634
Senior Brother Hao Chen, this is the nectar that I brewed myself.

226
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:18,763
I put a lot of effort into it. Please accept it.

227
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:20,526
Thank you for your kindness.

228
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,559
Since you've put a lot of effort into it,

229
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,517
you should keep it for yourself.

230
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,679
Senior Brother Hao Chen,

231
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,873
all these years, can't you tell the feelings I have for you?

232
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:32,157
- Actually, I... <br> - If it's pointless, don't say it.

233
00:19:32,158 --> 00:19:35,289
- You won't even give me a chance to confess? <br> - A bottle of nectar.

234
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,808
I'm cultivating the Heartless Path.

235
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:45,026
Whether you say it out loud or not, it doesn't matter to me.

236
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:49,540
Senior, although you look so gentlemanly

237
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,378
and gentle on the surface,

238
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:56,780
you are actually a cruel and cold person!

239
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,400
Besides Xuanji, you've never cared about other people at all!

240
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,128
Come out.

241
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,291
You eavesdrop on people now?

242
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,920
<i>There will be a way out.</i>

243
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,207
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

244
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:29,544
So, the one Senior Duan Qing likes is you?

245
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,180
Why didn't you accept her?

246
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,132
I think Senior Duan Qing is quite nice.

247
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,938
Haven't I told you before?

248
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:39,598
We are on the Heartless Path.

249
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:42,300
We cannot love someone.

250
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,140
I know.

251
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,012
But don't you want someone to love?

252
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:53,079
Only the path I've chosen is the right one. The rest is unimportant.

253
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,594
You can't be distracted.

254
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:57,854
So stay focused and say no more.

255
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,380
Since it's your birthday today,

256
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,760
I'll make another exception to let you drink today.

257
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,246
Wait here. I'll get the grape wine.

258
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,940
<i>I think my treasures are in this library, too.</i>

259
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,846
<i>I should find the Transmission Bell and have a talk with Si Feng.</i>

260
00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:46,750
Sifeng.

261
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,130
<i>Sifeng.</i>

262
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,030
Sifeng! Sifeng!

263
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,690
Junior Sister.

264
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,022
What are you doing?

265
00:21:58,022 --> 00:21:59,393
I...

266
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,039
<i>Senior Brother,</i>

267
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,770
<i>I didn't understand</i>

268
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,150
what you said just now.

269
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,934
So, I wanted to ask my friend about it through the Transmission Bell.

270
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:12,232
You don't know what love means. Don't think too much.

271
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:16,380
Says who? I have someone I like, too.

272
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,940
I like Sixth Senior Brother.

273
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,980
<i>Minyan? You like Minyan?</i>

274
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,872
<i>Let me tell you. I've collected a lot of fruits for Sixth Senior Brother.</i>

275
00:22:25,873 --> 00:22:27,399
Senior Duan Qing told me that

276
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,898
I have to share the things that I like with the one whom I like.

277
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:35,599
Why are you laughing?

278
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,999
You've been here for so long and this is the first time you've mentioned him.

279
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,060
What's wrong with that?

280
00:22:41,988 --> 00:22:45,761
You don't even know what you are talking about.

281
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:54,874
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

282
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,839
<i>What did I say?</i>

283
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,616
You are struggling so hard here

284
00:22:59,617 --> 00:23:02,171
to keep that vague and insubstantial love.

285
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:04,911
And you put yourself into such bad shape.

286
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:07,740
But what do you get?

287
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:11,200
This is just a one-sided love.

288
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,460
She doesn't even care about you.

289
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,820
You were never in

290
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,417
Chu Xuanji's heart at all.

291
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,119
The feelings in this world

292
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,813
are the coldest and the most illusory things

293
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:30,379
in this world.

294
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:36,374
Don't you know

295
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,541
who you are?

296
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:45,580
You shouldn't have dabbled in love at all!

297
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:50,332
Lize Palace is your one true destiny.

298
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:57,980
I've given you one year.

299
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,780
I think you get it now.

300
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,523
Wear the Lover's Curse Mask.

301
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:08,465
And you'll still be the Head Disciple of Lize Palace.

302
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:12,676
And you'll still be my successor in the future.

303
00:24:12,676 --> 00:24:17,194
If others dare comment about it,

304
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,140
I'll kill them.

305
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:29,970
Sifeng, you still can't let go of those insubstantial feelings?

306
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,350
Fine.

307
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,112
Don't blame me for forcing you then!

308
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,100
Eldest Brother Liu.

309
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,500
Liu Yihuan is a traitor.

310
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,920
The rope on him will descend two feet every two hours.

311
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,050
<i>At midnight, he'll fall into the poisonous swamp below him</i>

312
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,160
<i>and be disintegrated whole.</i>

313
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,560
Master, I'm the one who broke the rules.

314
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:17,443
You should punish me instead.

315
00:25:17,443 --> 00:25:20,439
This has nothing to do with Eldest Brother Liu. Let him go!

316
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,099
Liu Yihuan is the criminal of Lize Palace. But he tried to escape.

317
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:28,520
We caught him and now he'll be punished to death.

318
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,760
But since you are pleading on his behalf,

319
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,180
I can spare him.

320
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,400
I think you know what I mean.

321
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,306
He's at Houyuan Bell Room inside Fengqi Hall.

322
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:48,019
If you want to save him, the only way

323
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:52,559
is to wear this Lover's Curse Mask and walk out from this place.

324
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,650
Let me remind you. That after midnight tonight,

325
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,790
the only thing you can do is collect his body.

326
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,779
<i>I am Chu Xuanji. You are my first friend from outside of Shao Yang Sect.</i>

327
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,599
<i>It's your birthday today. So, I made a birthday cake for you.</i>

328
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:27,480
<i>Linglong said that we are destined to meet each other.</i>

329
00:26:31,712 --> 00:26:34,480
<i>I really don't know how I fell here.</i>

330
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,980
<i>And then... And then, I can't fly.</i>

331
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,940
<i>What are you doing?</i>

332
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,460
<i>Your shirt is dirty. Let me clean it for you.</i>

333
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,980
<i>Don't touch me.</i>

334
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,420
<i>How can you talk like this?</i>

335
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,520
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to knock over your tea.</i>

336
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,450
<i>Why is it always you?</i>

337
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:07,513
<i>- Little Stammerer, do you feel very hot? <br> - I...</i>

338
00:27:07,513 --> 00:27:10,260
<i>- No. <br> - No?</i>

339
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,959
<i>Don't worry. I have a way to get past the Torch Dragon. We can use this.</i>

340
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,279
<i>We can use this.</i>

341
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,238
<i>This Lightning Baton only allows one person to use it.</i>

342
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,814
<i>But there are two of us.</i>

343
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:24,784
<i>Just act like we are one.</i>

344
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,787
<i>Don't move. I'm going to cast the spell now.</i>

345
00:27:31,787 --> 00:27:35,406
<i>Sifeng, you smiled. Your smile is so pretty.<i></i></i>

346
00:27:35,406 --> 00:27:37,420
<i>Your smile is like this wine.</i>

347
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,860
<i>So, I think you look really good when you smile.</i>

348
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,800
<i>You have to smile more from now on. Like this.</i>

349
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,352
<i>Don't you know who you are?</i>

350
00:27:52,352 --> 00:27:57,540
<i>After midnight, the only thing you can do is collect his body.</i>

351
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:05,039
<i>I'm here to bring you some dried fruits. They are very sweet.</i>

352
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,260
<i>You are kneeling. After eating some sweet, dried fruits,</i>

353
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,940
<i>you won't feel pain anymore. Here.</i>

354
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,939
<i>Don't worry. I'll find those mirror shards for you</i>

355
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:16,028
<i>so that you can restore your six senses.</i>

356
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,860
<i>It's a deal then.</i>

357
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:23,530
♫ <i> When love becomes deeper, betrayal becomes deeper </i> ♫

358
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:28,580
♫ <i> I blindfolded myself to see things clearly </i> ♫

359
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,779
<i>It's a deal then. After four years, we'll roam the world and train together.</i>

360
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,911
<i>- You are using saliva again. <br> - Linglong said that</i>

361
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:44,280
<i>this is the most unbreakable vow. Then, you won't break your promise.</i>

362
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,440
Eldest Brother Liu, are you all right?

363
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:03,872
Little Phoenix, the mask on your face...

364
00:30:03,872 --> 00:30:05,530
It's fine.

365
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,370
I heard those two monsters.

366
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,260
This is the Lover's Curse Mask.

367
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:15,680
You did it to save me.

368
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,610
I owe you a big one.

369
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:21,224
Maybe my master is right.

370
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:26,060
Love in this world is not as beautiful as I think it is.

371
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:30,670
But cutting it away, it'll be less painful and fewer grudges for me.

372
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,390
Didn't you leave Lize Palace to save your daughter?

373
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,630
How is she?

374
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:40,300
When I went there, I could almost save her.

375
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,540
But at that time, she suddenly disappeared right in front of me.

376
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,220
What is your plan then?

377
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,700
I heard that the Heavenly Realm has a celestial eye that sees everything.

378
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:54,080
As long as I can find Yu'er, I'm willing to risk my life to try and do that.

379
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,979
Who are you? Where am I?

380
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:01,908
I'm sure that you've heard about Tianxu Hall before.

381
00:32:01,908 --> 00:32:03,860
Tianxu Hall?

382
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,700
Why did you bring me here?

383
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,180
The five sects are cornering you like a rat.

384
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,680
Don't you want to seek revenge?

385
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,770
Since we have the same enemy, why don't we work together?

386
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,036
You want to use me?

387
00:32:23,036 --> 00:32:26,850
We'll have to see if you are worthy enough to be used by me.

388
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,700
What else can you do now?

389
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,690
Your turn. What's wrong?

390
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,916
Xuyang Peak must be very cold now.

391
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:04,187
I wonder if Xuanji brought enough clothes with her or not.

392
00:33:04,187 --> 00:33:07,812
Don't worry. Xuanji can't feel the cold anyway.

393
00:33:07,812 --> 00:33:11,786
Look at the board. I took away five of your chess pieces already.

394
00:33:11,786 --> 00:33:14,239
Little Six, I was not paying attention. You can't...

395
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:16,220
Stop playing.

396
00:33:17,524 --> 00:33:19,220
Master asked us to go to the Bamboo Forest

397
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,748
to help him choose some new disciples.

398
00:33:21,748 --> 00:33:25,499
Wait, First Senior. I don't believe that I can't beat Little Six.

399
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:27,110
I... I...

400
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,930
I'll put it here.

401
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:40,559
So unfortunate. You could've won another round if you put it...

402
00:33:42,164 --> 00:33:44,300
I don't want to put it here then.

403
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,612
It's too late to change.

404
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:49,740
We have a deal. The loser has to act like a dog.

405
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,540
Don't be a sore loser.

406
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:54,910
How does a dog bark? Do it.

407
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,110
I hate you the most!

408
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:02,940
Linglong, you said that you wouldn't be a sore loser!

409
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,556
Both of you have never changed since young.

410
00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:08,530
Both of you always quarrel.

411
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,560
<i>[PALACE HALL]</i>

412
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:18,320
Greetings, Master.

413
00:34:19,196 --> 00:34:22,840
Master, Xuanji can already break the Barrier Formation.

414
00:34:24,171 --> 00:34:28,303
Xuanji, you have been here for four years already.

415
00:34:28,303 --> 00:34:32,871
Now, you've improved a lot. I'm relieved.

416
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:37,026
According to the rules of the deity, you are old enough to start your first trial.

417
00:34:37,026 --> 00:34:40,290
I should let you go back to Shouyang Peak first.

418
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,508
I can go back to Shouyang Peak?

419
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:46,580
Then, I can meet Linglong and Sixth Senior again. Awesome!

420
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:52,559
But remember. No matter when it is or where you are, you have to remember

421
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,208
your mission as the disciple of Xuyang Peak.

422
00:34:56,208 --> 00:35:00,090
Do you mean the protection of the forbidden ground?

423
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,388
The forbidden ground of Shaoyang will affect the safety of the three realms.

424
00:35:05,388 --> 00:35:08,812
As the protector of the forbidden ground,

425
00:35:08,812 --> 00:35:11,764
it's a great responsibility for you.

426
00:35:11,764 --> 00:35:14,976
And it's not an easy thing to protect the forbidden ground.

427
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:17,660
It's the most important thing in your life.

428
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,460
You have to give your everything to it.

429
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,780
Other things will always come second.

430
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,660
You have to always be prepared

431
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,939
to lay down your life to protect the forbidden ground. Understand?

432
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:38,119
Good. Today, you'll make a vow

433
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,592
to protect the forbidden ground forever and the safety of the whole world.

434
00:35:43,592 --> 00:35:45,750
Yes, Master.

435
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:52,920
I, Chu Xuanji, vow that I'll protect the forbidden ground forever.

436
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,719
Linglong., you must be thirsty.

437
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,094
I brought you a cup of tea. Have a taste.

438
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,040
How is it?

439
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,525
It's not good.

440
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,440
Senior.

441
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,268
Senior, when can you bring me to Shouyang Peak?

442
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,265
- Shouyang Peak? You... <br> - Yes.

443
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:29,559
- Zhong Minyan, you... <br> - Senior.

444
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,020
- Senior! <br> - She...

445
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,055
Senior.

446
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:37,799
- You... <br> - When will we go there?

447
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,301
No.

448
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,390
Senior!

449
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,419
- Senior! <br> - Xuanji!

450
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:51,930
Xuanji.

451
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,735
Linglong. Sixth Senior.

452
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,440
Xuanji, what are you doing?

453
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,080
- She is a demon. <br> - Save me, Senior!

454
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,679
Xuanji, you misunderstood her!

455
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,499
No, I didn't. Show yourself!

456
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,000
What happened?

457
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,671
- It's Shadow Demon. <br> - Let's go and help her!

458
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,303
Wait!

459
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,335
- Father, Xuanji... <br> - Master, Xuanji is in danger.

460
00:37:22,336 --> 00:37:25,821
I want to see how much she has improved in four years.

461
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:27,541
But...

462
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,828
Xuanji, be careful!

463
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,780
- Xuanji! <br> - Xuanji!

464
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,372
Linglong!

465
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,206
You brat. How can you just come back without any notice?

466
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:49,580
Do you know how unprepared I am after not seeing you for four years?

467
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,770
I wanted to give you a surprise.

468
00:38:51,771 --> 00:38:53,919
This is not a surprise. You scared me.

469
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,879
You fought so many demons alone.

470
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,879
Let me see if you are hurt or not.

471
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,191
I'm fine.

472
00:38:59,192 --> 00:39:02,110
I've become strong now. I can protect you now.

473
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:07,048
- I really missed you. <br> - Me, too.

474
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:09,159
- Xuanji. <br> - Junior Xuanji.

475
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,240
You fought very well just now.

476
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:15,450
Sixth Senior, First Senior, Second Senior, Fifth Senior.

477
00:39:15,451 --> 00:39:17,159
Long time no see.

478
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,210
You are so biased.

479
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:22,534
How could you call Sixth Senior first before addressing me and First Senior?

480
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,163
That's because I'm her favorite Sixth Senior.

481
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,220
You've grown up and become prettier.

482
00:39:29,888 --> 00:39:32,258
Of course. Xuanji is a born beauty.

483
00:39:32,259 --> 00:39:35,791
I wonder who it was who kept holding onto a demon just now.

484
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:38,239
You kept holding onto a demon.

485
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,931
I didn't do that.

486
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,519
After fighting the demon just now, I'm hungry.

487
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,467
You are in luck. We have Eight Treasures Chicken with Longan

488
00:39:49,468 --> 00:39:51,559
and roasted lamb shank. They are delicious.

489
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,975
So much food? Stop talking and let's eat. I'm hungry. Let's go.

490
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,315
- Let's go. <br> - Let's go.

491
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:03,215
Those demons even dare to try infiltrating into our sect.

492
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,119
You have to check all the new disciples.

493
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,199
Could it be that the demon clan knows that the thing in Shaoyang forbidden ground is...

494
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,879
If they are really here for the forbidden ground,

495
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,791
they won't be so easily defeated.

496
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:21,300
Maybe they are just trying to install some spies into our sect.

497
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,279
Sect Leader, we've been investigating that Tianxu Hall for the past four years,

498
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,199
but we couldn't find anything.

499
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,279
After all, our ancestors and the deities

500
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,255
had annihilated them back then.

501
00:40:31,256 --> 00:40:34,447
Only some weak and scattered demons are left.

502
00:40:34,448 --> 00:40:35,959
I don't think they'll be able to do anything.

503
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,959
Our ancestors received an oracle in the past.

504
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,495
It's said that there will be a calamity within these 30 years.

505
00:40:40,496 --> 00:40:42,660
Now, 20 years have passed. We have only 10 more years.

506
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,800
We have to be careful.

507
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,915
All right. Send someone to inform all the major sects.

508
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:52,475
Tell them to be careful.

509
00:40:52,475 --> 00:40:53,766
Yes, Sect Leader.

510
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:59,185
- Father, we are back! <br> - Father!

511
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,720
Xuanji, you've improved a lot.

512
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,918
Father, you saw me just now?

513
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:09,959
Father, Xuanji can control the Five Elements Spell with ease now.

514
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,756
Other seniors might not be able to do that, too.

515
00:41:12,757 --> 00:41:14,320
They used to say that my sister was weak.

516
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,470
Now, we should show them how awesome she is.

517
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,140
Xuanji, you are much better than what I expected.

518
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,580
For the past four years,

519
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,056
Master Heng Yang was meditating in seclusion.

520
00:41:28,057 --> 00:41:31,603
You were single-handedly taught by Senior Hao Chen.

521
00:41:31,603 --> 00:41:35,971
To find a great teacher and friend in one's lifetime,

522
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:40,399
you are really blessed and lucky to have met Senior Hao Chen.

523
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,959
Don't ever forget about his kindness for teaching you.

524
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,079
You have to treat him with respect from now on.

525
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,559
Understand?

526
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,460
Father, I'll remember that.

527
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,679
Both of you are 20 years old now.

528
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,326
According to Shaoyang's rules, you have to train for a year in the real world

529
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:58,999
to gain experience and build your personality.

530
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,016
You'll train together with Minyan in the real world after a few days.

531
00:42:03,016 --> 00:42:05,679
- Great! We can go down to play now! <br> - Great!

532
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,820
I didn't ask you to go there to play.

533
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,860
If you see any demons attacking people or criminals causing trouble,

534
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,774
you have to fulfill your duty as a cultivator.

535
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:20,577
Don't do anything that will humiliate our Shaoyang Sect. Understand?

536
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:23,617
- Yes, Father. <br> - Yes, Father.

537
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,080
Junior.

538
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,412
Fifth Senior.

539
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:35,812
All of your things in Xuyang Peak have been sent back here.

540
00:42:35,812 --> 00:42:37,533
Thank you, Fifth Senior.

541
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,493
Sifeng.

542
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,412
Sifeng, are you there?

543
00:43:22,905 --> 00:43:24,518
<i>Sifeng.</i>

544
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,400
<i>Sifeng.</i>

545
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,390
<i>Sifeng, are you there?</i>

546
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:49,359
Little Phoenix, looks like you've improved a lot when I was away.

547
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,400
Eldest Brother Liu?

548
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,564
Why are you here? What if others found out?

549
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,540
I have the celestial eye now.

550
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,820
What can Lize Palace do to me?

551
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,500
You've succeeded?

552
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,140
This celestial eye is useless in the heavenly realm.

553
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,600
They don't need it.

554
00:44:06,601 --> 00:44:09,612
Even since it was made, it had been discarded to the side.

555
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:12,460
So, I just found it purely by accident.

556
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,119
So, I borrowed it from them.

557
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,050
After I find Yu'er, I'll just return it to them.

558
00:44:17,051 --> 00:44:19,105
They won't know.

559
00:44:19,105 --> 00:44:21,974
Have you found Yu'er then?

560
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:32,180
Yu'er must still be trapped by her kidnapper. They blocked her aura.

561
00:44:32,864 --> 00:44:37,100
But the real reason is I just got this celestial eye and I can't use it well yet.

562
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,077
I can only feel a faint trace of her.

563
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:42,692
And it takes a lot of energy to open it. I can't open it the second time at once.

564
00:44:42,692 --> 00:44:46,170
So, I can only look around with the faint trace that I felt.

565
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,612
In the past, I didn't do my duty as a father.

566
00:44:52,612 --> 00:44:56,476
So this time, I have to find her no matter what.

567
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:58,020
Be patient, Eldest Brother Liu.

568
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:02,420
Since you already have the Celestial Eye, you'll find Yu'er eventually.

569
00:45:16,856 --> 00:45:19,700
You are wearing this Lover's Curse Mask because of me.

570
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,064
But don't worry. I'll definitely

571
00:45:22,065 --> 00:45:25,520
help you to find a way to remove this Lover's Curse Mask.

572
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:40,050
