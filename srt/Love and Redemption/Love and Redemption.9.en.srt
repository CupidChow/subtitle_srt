00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,759
You're wearing this mask because of me.

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,900
But don't worry. I'll find a way to remove the Lover's Curse Mask for you.

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,559
I told you before. This was my decision.

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,159
Eldest Brother Liu, you don't need to blame yourself.

23
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,399
To become emotionless and focus on my training is a good thing as well.

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,519
How is that a good thing?

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,239
Our training is hard enough by itself.

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,198
But now, you have to force yourself to be emotionless as well.

27
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,561
That'll make your life meaningless, you know?

28
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:11,959
It's not a good thing.

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,639
It's fine. Don't worry.

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,888
I'll definitely find a solution for you.

31
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,080
By the way,

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,639
come out now.

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,948
Come out.

34
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,418
I'll return you your spirit beast.

35
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,119
Ascending the Heavenly Realm was tough indeed.

36
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,590
Little Silver Flower, you were naughty.

37
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,430
Thank you, Eldest Brother Liu.

38
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,010
Why are you thanking me?

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,399
Okay. I'll leave now.

40
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,590
Xuanji, are you done with your training?

41
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,738
Linglong, isn't this the bell Sifeng gave you?

42
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:07,907
I'm sure you kept in touch, right? How is he doing?

43
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,760
Senior Brother Hao Chen confiscated

44
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:13,799
everything I had when I went to Xuyang Peak.

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,140
That's why I didn't contact him for four years.

46
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,320
You didn't contact him at all?

47
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,219
Xuanji, before Sifeng left, he wanted you to contact him once you woke up, you know?

48
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,349
Besides, even if he did confiscate everything,

49
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,127
you could still write him letters.

50
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,719
Write letters?

51
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,829
I was busy with my training every day.

52
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,680
I never thought about that.

53
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,116
You're too heartless. Did you forget him already?

54
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:41,268
And you never contacted me as well after you went to Xuyang Peak.

55
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:44,159
I would've severed my ties with you if you weren't my sister.

56
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,579
Linglong, how could that be? I missed you so much.

57
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,239
But I think it's fine if I keep you all in my heart.

58
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,919
Besides, sisters and our friends will stay with us forever. Right?

59
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,799
Initially, I wanted to finish my training

60
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,879
as soon as possible so that I could meet up with you sooner.

61
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,399
The same goes for Sifeng as well. We made a promise.

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,380
We'll train together once I leave the mountain.

63
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,780
That's why I didn't contact him for four years.

64
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,399
That doesn't matter, right?

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,234
But, Xuanji, you need to maintain your relationships.

66
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:14,519
No one will wait at the same spot for you.

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,987
I thought you would've learned about other things besides your training.

68
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:21,607
I didn't expect you to still be a blockhead in relationships.

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,177
Linglong, will Sifeng be angry because I didn't contact him?

70
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:28,759
Will he ignore me?

71
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,020
About that, I can't say for sure.

72
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,008
I'm sure he won't do that. Sifeng must be very busy in Lize Palace.

73
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:37,349
He needs to train as well.

74
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,721
I'm sure he forgot about this due to his busy schedule.

75
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:42,159
It's fine. I'll find him immediately after we leave,

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,106
and the four of us can roam the world together.

77
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:46,264
I'm sure it will be fun.

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,983
Have some fruit wine.

79
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,314
Great wine.

80
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,450
Xuanji, I didn't ask this before because it was inconvenient.

81
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,730
Did you find any shards when you went to Xuyang Peak?

82
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,959
It's fine. Maybe we can find them when we roam around.

83
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,490
Sixth Senior, I'll stop finding them.

84
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,576
Senior Brother Hao Chen told me that everyone has a different purpose in life

85
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:19,266
and I should treat it as such.

86
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:21,440
I should be protecting the Crystal Lamp

87
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:24,759
instead of searching for shards of the Mirror of Origin in order to recover my six senses.

88
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,110
What if I become obsessed with it?

89
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,370
Is that so?

90
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,800
Did the strange power appear again during your training?

91
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,729
That's good. We won't look for it then.

92
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:42,090
Oh right, Sixth Senior Brother! I have some good stuff for you.

93
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,784
There's an immortal tree on Xuyang Peak. Its fruit is delicious,

94
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:50,100
but it only bears fruit once every five years.

95
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,684
That's why I've saved some for you, Linglong, and Sifeng.

96
00:05:55,684 --> 00:05:59,490
You little glutton. You actually saved some for us?

97
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,830
Not bad at all. Seems like my efforts were not in vain.

98
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,173
You're unlike your sister at all.

99
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:07,604
I have no idea what she's thinking about.

100
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,879
<i> Minyan!</i>

101
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,210
Linglong is going to dance with a fellow male disciple!

102
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,050
Sixth Senior Brother, what about this?

103
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,780
Xuanji, your senior doesn't like to drink and eat fruit.

104
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,401
I'll take them for myself.

105
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,289
I...

106
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:36,239
Hall Master, after the failure of Shadow Demon in Shaoyang Sect,

107
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,630
we've planted spies in the four sects successfully.

108
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,039
But due to Shadow Demon's failure

109
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,039
and to avoid any further suspicions, I think we should

110
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,919
stay in the shadows for now.

111
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,479
We should wait for the right time to grab the Spirit Keys.

112
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,479
We still need to wait? How long do I need to wait?

113
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,950
Hall Master, we...

114
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,451
Who's there?

115
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,029
You didn't manage to locate

116
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,999
the God of War and the Devil Star all these few years,

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,900
and you didn't obtain the Spirit Keys as well.

118
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,699
Wolf, aren't you too merciful?

119
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,110
Isn't that the reason you got nothing done at all?

120
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,639
Wu Tong, do you think you have the right to speak in this place?

121
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,439
Our Hall Master is keeping you here

122
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,309
because he just wanted you to tell us more about the Five Great Sects.

123
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,358
Just be a good dog.

124
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,688
When you're a dog,

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,290
you shouldn't just come out and bark like this.

126
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,959
Tianxu Hall only appreciates capable people.

127
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,519
Those who get nothing done should just keep quiet.

128
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,959
Wolf, what do you think?

129
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,510
I just didn't want to reveal our true strength too soon.

130
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,039
Hall Master, I just wanted to avoid casualties

131
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,559
from dealing with the Five Great Sects.

132
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,017
The demon tribe has been training in secret for 1,000 years.

133
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:52,519
Your strength is much greater than the Five Great Sects.

134
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,964
If they aren't willing to cooperate with us,

135
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:57,199
it's the best excuse for us to execute them without mercy.

136
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,525
Why should we hide?

137
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:03,607
You're just trying to get your revenge against the humans who had driven you out.

138
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,592
Wu Tong, don't try to manipulate us due to your personal hatred.

139
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:11,763
It's precisely because of that.

140
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:14,020
Only a human knows how to force another human to submit,

141
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,861
to manipulate and destroy them.

142
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,181
Hall Master, why don't you give me this chance?

143
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:29,159
I'll destroy the Five Great Sects and obtain the Spirit Keys.

144
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,898
Hall Master, Wu Tong is just a dog who has been driven out from its shelter.

145
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:33,880
We mustn't trust him.

146
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,479
But this pathetic dog managed to find out that the Xuanyuan Sect is lying to you.

147
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,569
- What? <br> - Someone!

148
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,639
You were misled by Xuanyuan Sect's spirit stone all along.

149
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,770
One of the Spirit Keys was actually hidden inside the Destiny Pearl.

150
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,790
You didn't know about that.

151
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,270
Tell us.

152
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,359
Yes!

153
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,420
The Spirit Key is hidden inside the Destiny Pearl in our sect.

154
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,429
But only Sect Leader Zhu Shi knows about

155
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,697
the location of the Destiny Pearl.

156
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:25,470
Wolf, you chose the wrong person to threaten.

157
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,780
Instead of threatening those who are loyal to the sect,

158
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,359
isn't it easier for you if you threaten the weaklings in the sect?

159
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,334
Darn it.

160
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,413
Hall Master, please give me a chance.

161
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,239
Let me obtain the Spirit Keys for you.

162
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,697
We've been hiding for too long.

163
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:50,170
It's time to create a scene so that our prey will be attracted.

164
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,349
Wu Tong, from today onwards,

165
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,920
you'll be the Chief of Mount Buzhou's hideout.

166
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,900
The Five Great Sects can't reach Mount Buzhou.

167
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,890
You don't need to fear anything.

168
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,360
You don't need to fear the Five Great Sects.

169
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:15,719
You can use any method to obtain the Spirit Keys.

170
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,359
Yes, Hall Master.

171
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,279
Tianxu Hall has been in the shadows for too long.

172
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,150
It's time for us to make an entrance.

173
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,470
Greetings, Master and Deputy Chief.

174
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,959
Sifeng, you've mastered your skill.

175
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,936
I'm very relieved to hear that.

176
00:11:08,937 --> 00:11:11,079
You were always the most talented.

177
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,450
As long as you aren't distracted and focus on your training,

178
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,599
I'm sure you'll be the leader of the Five Great Sects.

179
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,270
You'll take over Lize Palace sooner or later.

180
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,869
Master, your effort wasn't wasted.

181
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,080
It's good that you forced him to choose this mask.

182
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,410
Yu Sifeng, you mustn't disappoint your master

183
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,940
and repeat the same mistakes.

184
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:50,679
Let bygones be bygones.

185
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,079
Just forget about them.

186
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,159
I'm just reminding him.

187
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,586
Although the Lover's Curse Mask can render him emotionless

188
00:11:57,587 --> 00:11:59,416
and stop him from having any feelings,

189
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:03,387
if he faces a situation where he can't control himself

190
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,079
and feels for someone,

191
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:09,752
a Lover's Curse will form and he'll be done for.

192
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:12,279
You only talk about useless things.

193
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,350
Sifeng, you do understand the purpose of the Lover's Curse Mask. Right?

194
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,780
By getting rid of emotions, it will save us from unnecessary trouble.

195
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,466
That's good to hear.

196
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,160
And you must remember that

197
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,890
outsiders are just like mirages.

198
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,959
Your only home is Lize Palace.

199
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,919
- Yes, My Lord... <br> - I'm not finished yet.

200
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,192
All of you mustn't risk your lives for an illusion

201
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:55,267
that you cannot hold and create unnecessary trouble.

202
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:58,270
<i>- Yes, Master. <br> - Yes, Master.</i>

203
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:00,959
That's enough.

204
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,319
Let's return to the main point.

205
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,990
- Deputy Chief. <br> - Regarding leaving Lize Palace for training.

206
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,820
Do you understand what to do? Once you exit the palace tomorrow,

207
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,430
you should never break the rules.

208
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,512
I've received letters from Shaoyang Sect.

209
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:17,239
They stated that some demons are causing trouble outside.

210
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,545
Coincidentally, you will leave the palace soon.

211
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:22,420
Investigate the matter as well.

212
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,998
Those demons have nothing to do with us.

213
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:29,402
They can't reach Xiyang on either side.

214
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:33,940
If they want to create trouble in Zhongyuan, just let them be.

215
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,940
Senior Brother, you're ignoring everything except for our sect,

216
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,859
but you must respect the other sect leaders as well.

217
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:44,330
Since we belong to one of the Five Great Sects.

218
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,154
You make the decision.

219
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,559
Investigate the matter.

220
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,254
<i>Yes.</i>

221
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,037
Xuanji, you have the Transmission Charm with you.

222
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:03,528
Do you know your task when you leave the mountain?

223
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,373
- What's my task? <br> - Silly Xuanji.

224
00:14:06,374 --> 00:14:08,043
Senior Brother Hao Chen wants you to write letters to him.

225
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:11,052
But Senior Brother Hao Chen, we'll be busy when we leave.

226
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:12,540
She'll think it's troublesome,

227
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,650
or maybe she'll forget about it.

228
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,649
Remember to write letters to me.

229
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,039
You're pure and innocent. You haven't recovered your six senses.

230
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,647
The outside world is complex and chaotic.

231
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:27,350
I was reluctant to let you go,

232
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,380
but I have to abide by the rules.

233
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,970
If not...

234
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,950
So, after you leave,

235
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,620
you need to report to me every single detail.

236
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,619
First, you can reflect on your progress.

237
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:44,139
Second, I can know your progress as well.

238
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,860
Do you understand?

239
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,570
Yes, Senior Brother Hao Chen.

240
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,674
You must be careful.

241
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,860
You two must remember this.

242
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,284
After you two leave the mountain, you must deal with situations

243
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:58,960
according to your own capability.

244
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,340
You two mustn't be reckless.

245
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,890
Xuanji, remember to listen to your sixth senior brother.

246
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:10,315
Linglong, you must control your temper as well.

247
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:11,481
Father, I know that.

248
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:13,079
It's the first time you two are leaving here.

249
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,999
Your father is worried.

250
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,856
You must remember his words.

251
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:20,260
Yes, I'll remember them. I'll leave now.

252
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,960
You!

253
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,580
This child...

254
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,139
Father, Aunt Ying Hong, Senior Brother Hao Chen.

255
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:28,822
Don't worry. We know what to do.

256
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,319
Master, Aunt Ying Hong. Don't worry.

257
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,690
I'll take good care of them.

258
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,944
Linglong, wait for us!

259
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:42,273
Linglong! Wait for me!

260
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,410
This is so beautiful! We finally left the mountain!

261
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,882
This is too beautiful!

262
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,199
Senior Brother Hao Chen, we had another uneventful day.

263
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,260
Today, Sixth Senior Brother ordered a dish that was not tasty

264
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,930
at a restaurant on Mount Mengxi.

265
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,116
It's not delicious?

266
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,875
Fine, we won't order that tomorrow.

267
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:57,192
We can save some money as well.

268
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,225
This is great!

269
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:03,660
We'll go to Xishu tomorrow. There are many delicious foods over there.

270
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,990
There are pork trotter jelly, cold noodles, and peppered chicken.

271
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,358
You're going to finish our money soon.

272
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,399
We can only depend on Sifeng in Lize Palace later on.

273
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,546
We've been out for seven days,

274
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:19,079
but there are no demons to be seen.

275
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,199
I don't feel like a hero at all.

276
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,839
Look at the letters Xuanji wrote for Senior Brother Hao Chen.

277
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,950
I'm so happy today. I've eaten a lot today.

278
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,878
Okay, we've finished our mission for today.

279
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,164
- Let's go. <br> - Okay.

280
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,536
<i>Senior Brother Hao Chen, we had another uneventful day.</i>

281
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:43,219
<i>Today, Sixth Senior Brother ordered a dish that was not tasty</i>

282
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,190
<i>at a restaurant on Mount Mengxi.</i>

283
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,150
<i>It's lucky that the vegetables were delicious.</i>

284
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,470
<i>I'm happy today.</i>

285
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,010
Where are we? We should ask someone.

286
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,581
Excuse me.

287
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:09,039
Sorry for the interruption.

288
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,079
Judging by your attire, I'm sure you are cultivators.

289
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,039
Do you know how long it will take for us to reach Mount Shaoyang?

290
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,179
Mister, are you going to Mount Shaoyang because there are demons around?

291
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,540
Yes.

292
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,690
We came from Wangxian Town.

293
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,503
Demons are wreaking havoc in our town these days.

294
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,329
They cried in the middle of the night.

295
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:29,638
All of us were too afraid to go out.

296
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:33,319
This situation has lasted for three months. This can't continue on.

297
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,830
After that, a wandering priest told us that

298
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:39,364
Shaoyang Sect is famous for slaying demons.

299
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:43,119
That's why we're trying to seek their help.

300
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,700
Wangxian Town?

301
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,759
We need to pass by there before we reach Lize Palace and Xuanyuan Sect.

302
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,079
We can meet Sifeng after we slay the demons.

303
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,480
This is great! We finally have demons to slay!

304
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,781
Mister, we have decided to slay the demons for you.

305
00:18:55,782 --> 00:18:57,032
But...

306
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,669
You three are... ?

307
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,026
We're members of the Shaoyang Sect.

308
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:04,105
This is our name tag.

309
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:06,952
Mister, please tell us more about the demons.

310
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:08,719
We will try our best to help.

311
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,850
I think you are too young.

312
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,185
These two ladies look very fresh and innocent.

313
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,340
I think you shouldn't sacrifice your lives for this.

314
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,199
I think we should seek your master's help instead.

315
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,239
- Goodbye. <br> - Wait!

316
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,599
Mister, wait a minute.

317
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,079
We may look young, but we're famous in the pugilist world.

318
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,519
Especially this girl.

319
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,479
She may look weak and feeble,

320
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,433
but she can slay dozens of demons at one go.

321
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:37,430
Dozens of demons?

322
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,039
- They're pretty good. <br> - Sixth Senior Brother,

323
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,580
since when could I slay dozens of demons?

324
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,759
You defeated Shadow Demon and his clones, right?

325
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,879
That's a different matter!

326
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:48,825
This is a rare chance. We should grab hold of it.

327
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,210
I'm her senior.

328
00:19:53,245 --> 00:19:57,055
As for her, she's not important.

329
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,140
Little Six!

330
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,979
We came down the mountain in order to slay demons.

331
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,974
You don't need to travel far to seek help.

332
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:07,693
Since that's the case, please help us out.

333
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,285
In Wangxian Town, there's Mount Haiwan.

334
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:22,136
On that mountain, there's a grass called Zhuyu Grass.

335
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:26,170
And only our town has that grass.

336
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:30,044
But the strange thing is it can't be planted.

337
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:31,842
It can only grow on its own.

338
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:34,843
But three months ago,

339
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:38,093
some of our townsfolk went to pick some Zhuyu Grass.

340
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,011
But all of them were devoured by demons.

341
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:50,599
After that, some brave youngsters went up the mountain as well.

342
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,257
But they never came back.

343
00:20:53,258 --> 00:20:56,940
Mister, do you have any idea what the demon looks like?

344
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,459
The demon always assaulted people from the back.

345
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,460
That's why nobody has seen their true face.

346
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,337
I have a grandson who only learned how to speak recently.

347
00:21:07,338 --> 00:21:11,590
Two days ago, he said he saw a demon that cried.

348
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,506
It cries, it has two huge talons, and it can fly as well.

349
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:18,479
But he's just a child. I don't think we should treat this seriously.

350
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,645
It has wings,

351
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:23,005
and it cries as well?

352
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:24,999
Isn't that scary?

353
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,593
Linglong, look.

354
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:32,510
From the Demon Manual, a demon who cries and has wings.

355
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,770
- It is a Quru Bird? <br> - Quru Bird?

356
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,430
But it doesn't state that the demon likes to eat Zhuyu Grass.

357
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,827
Is it possible that someone is behind this

358
00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:46,079
in order to obtain more provisions?

359
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,143
Since that's the case, we must act now.

360
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:49,854
Let's check it out.

361
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,460
We must be cautious later on.

362
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,977
It's just a Quru Bird.

363
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:05,490
Since it likes to eat, I'll give it a taste of my power.

364
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,583
I'm sure there are more than one of them. We must be careful.

365
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:10,774
Even ten of them won't scare me away.

366
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,290
It's really desolate here.

367
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,870
Of course. There are demons roaming around.

368
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,229
The Zhuyu Grass is pretty fragrant.

369
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:48,270
Linglong, it's such a waste since Zhuyu Grass is delicious.

370
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,999
Xuanji, it's dirty, you know? Why are you eating it?

371
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,319
- Linglong, it's delicious. Try it. <br> - No way.

372
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,253
- Sixth Senior Brother? <br> - I'll skip this time.

373
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:57,387
Silly girl.

374
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,599
Linglong, look.

375
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,827
The cuts are uneven.

376
00:23:01,828 --> 00:23:03,591
I don't think this is caused by something sharp.

377
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:05,058
It looks like it was ripped.

378
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:06,319
You're right.

379
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,730
Look here.

380
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,820
Seems like we're facing a tough demon.

381
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,095
Little Six, why are you so timid?

382
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:14,845
- You're afraid of this? <br> - You!

383
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,823
I smell a demon.

384
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,970
Watch out!

385
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:33,759
- It's the Quru Bird! <br> - It has escaped!

386
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,368
Let's chase after it!

387
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,129
What a strong demonic scent!

388
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:55,199
I smell that, too. It's thick and disgusting.

389
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,380
It stinks!

390
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,450
It's dark down there. We don't have a clear view.

391
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,766
- Xuanji! <br> - Linglong, be careful!

392
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:44,479
Linglong, are you okay?

393
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,756
I'm fine. You must be careful.

394
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,739
- Little Six! <br> - Linglong!

395
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,119
Linglong, are you okay?

396
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,973
I'm fine.

397
00:26:21,973 --> 00:26:23,799
Be careful!

398
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:59,193
- Xuanji! <br> - Xuanji!

399
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,970
- Xuanji! <br> - Xuanji!

400
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,490
- Xuanji! <br> - Xuanji!

401
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,038
Sifeng?

402
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:19,897
Sifeng!

403
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:21,239
- Xuanji! <br> - Xuanji!

404
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,833
Xuanji!

405
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,260
Why are you bleeding?

406
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,675
I'm fine.

407
00:29:27,676 --> 00:29:29,875
Silly girl, you're not fine.

408
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:31,806
I'm Ruo Yu from Lize Palace.

409
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:33,119
Greetings.

410
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,470
Sifeng will return later, right?

411
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,228
Miss, Sifeng is...

412
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:40,411
We're his friends. This is great.

413
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,038
I didn't expect to see him here.

414
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,145
You said you were his friends?

415
00:29:46,146 --> 00:29:48,304
That is bizarre.

416
00:29:48,304 --> 00:29:50,300
What's bizarre?

417
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:51,559
I heard that the members of

418
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,279
Lize Palace weren't supposed to make friends with outsiders. Right?

419
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,523
But Sifeng is different from others.

420
00:29:56,524 --> 00:29:59,910
- There are no exceptions. <br> - Sifeng is an exception.

421
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,519
Sifeng!

422
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,839
Did you capture it?

423
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,960
The Quru Bird fled because it was frightened.

424
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,851
It fled?

425
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:11,559
It's all because of you three!

426
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,423
- You! <br> - Save your breath.

427
00:30:13,424 --> 00:30:15,014
Ruo Yu, let's go.

428
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,448
Sifeng!

429
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,030
Sifeng, is this really you?

430
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,919
You got yourself a new mask.

431
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,799
I almost couldn't recognize you.

432
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,218
I thought my skills would've been better after four years.

433
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:32,039
I thought I could protect everyone.

434
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,583
But I didn't expect you to improve this much.

435
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,390
You saved me once again.

436
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,266
Quru Birds hunt in groups.

437
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:43,709
We need a tactic to hunt them down.

438
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,340
Next time, you better prepare yourselves.

439
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,270
Don't create trouble for other people.

440
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,199
Sifeng, my brother, long time no see.

441
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,840
Sifeng, it's been four years since we have met.

442
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,900
We wanted to find you in Lize Palace.

443
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,683
Let go! All of you, stay away from Sifeng!

444
00:30:57,684 --> 00:31:00,199
You're rude! Who exactly are you?

445
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,860
That is none of your concern.

446
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,681
Please calm down.

447
00:31:03,681 --> 00:31:05,879
She is Miss Lu Yanran from Dianjing Valley Sect.

448
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,358
She was separated from her friends.

449
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,039
That's why she's traveling with us.

450
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,639
- We... <br> - We're not here to save you.

451
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,021
We prepared an ambush for the demons.

452
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:14,775
We were waiting for them to return to their nest.

453
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:17,729
But you just came and went all out on them.

454
00:31:17,729 --> 00:31:19,256
And that messed up our plan.

455
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:21,132
How would we know you had a plan?

456
00:31:21,132 --> 00:31:23,714
You speak as if this is our fault.

457
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,504
Wasn't it your fault?

458
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,540
Sifeng, since we didn't manage to find their nest,

459
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:32,039
we should return to our inn and rest.

460
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,950
Sure! Where are you staying? We can stay together

461
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,591
and we can travel together afterward.

462
00:31:37,592 --> 00:31:40,022
We're not going on the same path.

463
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,319
Miss Xuanji, first, we need to help Miss Lu find her friends.

464
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,599
So, it's inconvenient for us to travel together.

465
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,860
Please forgive us.

466
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,696
Save your breath. Let's go.

467
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:50,737
Sifeng, are you leaving us?

468
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:52,064
We missed you.

469
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:54,159
And we've finally met after so long. Please don't leave.

470
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,319
That's right. Why are you leaving us?

471
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,493
Sifeng, are you angry at us because Xuanji

472
00:32:00,494 --> 00:32:02,324
didn't contact you at all?

473
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,740
Yes. Linglong said you must've been waiting for my news.

474
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,580
Sifeng, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

475
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,159
- But the Transmission Bell... <br> - No.

476
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,995
I lost mine as well.

477
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:16,046
It's a useless item.

478
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,304
That's good. I knew it.

479
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:20,882
Sifeng, you were so busy.

480
00:32:20,883 --> 00:32:23,136
There's no need for us to contact each other, right?

481
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:25,927
- Since we'll meet anyway. <br> - I'm busy, indeed.

482
00:32:25,928 --> 00:32:27,879
I won't waste any time here.

483
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,317
- Sifeng! <br> - Everyone, farewell for now.

484
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,790
- Xuanji! <br> - Xuanji!

485
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,390
- Xuanji, what's wrong? <br> - Xuanji!

486
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,024
What's going on?

487
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,079
Xuanji was poisoned.

488
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,470
Wait, Quru Birds aren't poisonous.

489
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,100
Sifeng, seems like Miss Xuanji has a serious injury.

490
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,520
We...

491
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,566
Are we going to leave them, for real?

492
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:55,256
Sifeng, I heard that your sect are experts in neutralizing poison.

493
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:57,766
Are you really going to ignore her?

494
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,160
Little Six, will Xuanji be fine?

495
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,119
But the Demon Manual stated that Quru Birds aren't poisonous.

496
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,820
How did this happen?

497
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,954
You're right.

498
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:44,439
That's why we suspect that someone is manipulating them

499
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,839
and the manipulator must've applied poison to their talons.

500
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,959
We would've captured that demon if it weren't for someone.

501
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,759
But in the end? We're stuck here because of them.

502
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,158
Such bad luck.

503
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,963
What do you mean by that? Sifeng is our old friend.

504
00:33:57,963 --> 00:33:59,080
We will travel together sooner or later.

505
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,315
And we still have plenty of things to catch up on as well.

506
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:03,086
You can leave if you don't want to stay.

507
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:04,559
You are thinking too much.

508
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,359
Sifeng has nothing to catch up with you.

509
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,900
Didn't you see that? He ignored you just now.

510
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,985
- You! <br> - To me, you are here because the Quru Birds are too strong

511
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:16,884
and you wanted to seek Sifeng's help to defeat them.

512
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:19,079
- You! <br> - Some people are useless by themselves.

513
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,919
That's why they want to seek help from Lize Palace.

514
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,374
I–

515
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:26,384
What?

516
00:34:26,385 --> 00:34:28,076
Stop it now.

517
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,939
Sifeng.

518
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,910
Sifeng, don't leave.

519
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,158
Sifeng.

520
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,350
Sifeng, don't leave me.

521
00:34:49,277 --> 00:34:50,700
I have just neutralized the poison.

522
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,570
You better not move around.

523
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:04,240
Sifeng, I know you're angry.

524
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,700
I was too dumb.

525
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,798
When I went to Xuyang Peak for my training with Senior Brother Hao Chen,

526
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:13,289
he confiscated the Transmission Bell you gave me

527
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:16,679
because he didn't want me to be distracted.

528
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,112
And I didn't think of other ways I could use to contact people.

529
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:23,569
That's why I didn't write one letter to Linglong nor Sixth Senior Brother.

530
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:25,519
Linglong was very angry with me.

531
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,280
You don't need to explain that to me.

532
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,410
It's fine even if we didn't contact each other.

533
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,761
Sifeng, why are you still trying to leave?

534
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:37,012
We wanted to find you in Lize Palace initially.

535
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:39,335
Isn't it a great thing when we meet each other here?

536
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:41,479
Why are you still insisting on leaving?

537
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,399
Why must we stay together?

538
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,567
Because we made a promise.

539
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:50,190
The four of us are going to travel together, right?

540
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,182
<i>So childish.</i>

541
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,190
Is that so?

542
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,890
But after that, I realized that

543
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,773
nothing is permanent in this world.

544
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,230
Same goes for a friend's promise.

545
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,279
Sifeng, I don't understand.

546
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,879
- Initially... <br> - I did promise you

547
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,823
that I'd find the Mirror of Origin with you initially.

548
00:36:13,824 --> 00:36:15,894
And I will keep my promise.

549
00:36:15,894 --> 00:36:18,060
I obtained one shard by accident.

550
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,323
Here.

551
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,310
Sifeng, I didn't mean that.

552
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,050
And regarding the Mirror of Origin,

553
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,900
I don't need it anymore.

554
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,612
Senior Brother Hao Chen said that I will become obsessed

555
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:42,119
with desire and greed if I search for it.

556
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,900
It's not good for my training.

557
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,420
So, I promised Senior Brother Hao Chen that I wouldn't search for it anymore

558
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:50,531
after I leave the mountain.

559
00:36:50,531 --> 00:36:53,650
But Sifeng, I still need to thank you.

560
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,739
So, you don't want to recover your six senses anymore.

561
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,150
I was born without them.

562
00:37:08,157 --> 00:37:12,247
I think it's fine even if I don't recover them.

563
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:14,910
They don't seem that important to me.

564
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:20,464
The current Chu Xuanji isn't that bad anyway. Am I right?

565
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,350
The human heart is indecisive and unstable.

566
00:37:25,354 --> 00:37:27,573
I've witnessed it for myself.

567
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:29,923
Sifeng, what did you say?

568
00:37:29,923 --> 00:37:32,045
Since it's useless to you,

569
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:34,080
that means we don't need to meet anymore.

570
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,590
Farewell.

571
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,079
Sifeng!

572
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,558
Sifeng, don't leave us!

573
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,119
- Sifeng! <br> - Xuanji.

574
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,860
Xuanji, why are you here?

575
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,742
Sifeng, did you neutralize the poison?

576
00:37:46,743 --> 00:37:48,920
She can move after some rest.

577
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:50,820
You may leave after some time.

578
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,253
We'll handle the Quru Birds. Let's go.

579
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:54,646
- Wait, Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng.

580
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,180
What do you mean by this?

581
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,559
Aren't we your companions?

582
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,769
That's right. I thought we were going to capture them together.

583
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,566
There's no need for this many people. It's troublesome.

584
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:03,039
That's not the point.

585
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,479
Sifeng, I thought this was a happy occasion,

586
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,949
but why are you treating us like the plague?

587
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,420
You're trying to avoid us.

588
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,158
Sifeng, what's wrong with you?

589
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,056
Sifeng, there's no need for explanations.

590
00:38:14,057 --> 00:38:15,460
Let's go.

591
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,108
Sifeng!

592
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:26,468
What's going on? Why are they approaching us?

593
00:38:26,468 --> 00:38:27,877
There are so many of them!

594
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:29,403
There are too many of them!

595
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:31,094
Set up the barrier!

596
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,200
Why are there so many Quru Birds?

597
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,279
Didn't you say someone was manipulating them?

598
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,634
They're still not leaving even after the barrier was set up.

599
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:45,359
I'm afraid they're trying to trap us here.

600
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,999
You won't be trapped if you're capable enough to break through.

601
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,222
Hero Zhong, you're quite skilled

602
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:53,649
but it's hard when you have two amateurs around.

603
00:38:53,649 --> 00:38:54,909
Stop looking down on us!

604
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,554
You can leave if you're that capable!

605
00:38:56,555 --> 00:39:00,759
We'll deal with the birds and the demon once Xuanji recovers her strength.

606
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,959
Miss Lu, it's fine. We can escape by ourselves.

607
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,119
Silly girl, she's not saying that out of concern!

608
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,120
These Quru Birds all came out of their nests.

609
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,159
And their talons were coated with poison. It's too risky to try and break through.

610
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,968
Sifeng, what do you think?

611
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:13,900
We'll just destroy their nest then.

612
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,119
- Are you going to use that? <br> - We must deal with the mastermind first.

613
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,471
It's better for us to end this quickly as well.

614
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,718
Sifeng, what are you doing?

615
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:28,679
He's going to cast the secret spell of Lize Palace, Soul Chaser.

616
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,599
It can detect the location of the culprit behind this.

617
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,759
Inside the palace, among the stars,

618
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,074
chase the cursed soul, with the speed of the wind.

619
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:37,795
Search!

620
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,750
- Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng, are you okay?

621
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,719
To the west, there are ten caves.

622
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,383
Take the middle cave and you'll reach a valley.

623
00:40:29,384 --> 00:40:31,549
The demon manipulating the birds is located there.

624
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,774
I've injured the demon and he can't move around.

625
00:40:33,775 --> 00:40:35,919
You can go and capture him.

626
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,686
Sifeng, we'll let them go since they wish to capture it so badly.

627
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,799
Your breathing is a mess. You need to recuperate.

628
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,900
- I'll stay here and guard over you. <br> - No need.

629
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,700
That demon is quite powerful. All of you should go.

630
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,312
- But what if something... <br> - Stop wasting time!

631
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:51,159
If the demon flees, I'll blame it all on you.

632
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,502
Be careful then. Send us a signal if you're in danger.

633
00:40:53,502 --> 00:40:54,719
Let's go.

634
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,780
- Sifeng, you... <br> - Xuanji, let's go.

635
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,268
I...

636
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,065
Sifeng, are you okay?

637
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,140
Why are you here?

638
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,260
I've thought about it. I can't leave you alone here.

639
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,750
I'll stay by your side until you get better.

640
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:29,494
No need.

641
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,930
Sifeng, you mustn't rush the recovery process.

642
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,865
Don't move. It's dangerous for you to activate your energy by force.

643
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,293
Sifeng, why is your breathing getting more and more unstable?

644
00:41:48,294 --> 00:41:50,519
Do you feel uncomfortable? Are you in pain?

645
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,609
Why are you sweating so much?

646
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,710
This won't do. I need to transfer some of my energy to you.

647
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,698
- But your mask... <br> - Don't touch it!

648
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,830
- I want to help you. <br> - You're helping me by not touching it.

649
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,950
<i>I knew it. Sifeng is still angry at me for not contacting him.</i>

650
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,380
<i>What should I do to appease him?</i>

651
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,232
<i>Oh right! What did Sixth Senior Brother do every time</i>

652
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,262
<i>he made Linglong angry?</i>

653
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,721
Sifeng,

654
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,395
why are you sweating so much?

655
00:42:26,396 --> 00:42:28,840
You'll catch a cold.

656
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,892
Here.

657
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,180
What are you doing?

658
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,341
Sifeng, I'm wiping away your sweat.

659
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:41,888
You'll catch a cold like this.

660
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:44,267
I'm not trying to scold you, but you're not taking care of yourself.

661
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:46,538
You can't do anything without me around.

662
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,616
My sweat is gone.

663
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,355
Sifeng, this dried fruit is very sweet.

664
00:42:57,355 --> 00:43:00,347
I can't even bear to eat it. I kept it especially for you.

665
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:02,057
Try it.

666
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,703
Chu Xuanji, what exactly are you trying to do?

667
00:43:05,704 --> 00:43:08,949
I... I'm trying to make you happy.

668
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:10,439
I'm trying to coax you.

669
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,313
Please don't be angry anymore.

670
00:43:12,313 --> 00:43:14,683
Please don't hold it against me.

671
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,187
Sifeng.

672
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,759
Isn't this funny?

673
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,412
Sifeng, please smile.

674
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,092
You'll get younger when you smile.

675
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:39,120
Sifeng.

676
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,440
Chu Xuanji, that's enough.

677
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,020
Isn't this funny?

678
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,840
Never mind. I have another trick.

679
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,930
Sifeng, let me tell you a joke.

680
00:43:49,606 --> 00:43:50,980
Listen closely.

681
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,300
Once, there was a phoenix who tried to attain nirvana.

682
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,979
Guess what happened in the end? Listen carefully.

683
00:43:56,979 --> 00:43:59,827
It overheated!

684
00:43:59,827 --> 00:44:00,860
Isn't that funny?

685
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,052
Sifeng, isn't that funny?

686
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:03,536
It's funny, right?

687
00:44:03,537 --> 00:44:05,067
Answer me.

688
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,300
It's not funny?

689
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,234
I have another trick up my sleeve.

690
00:44:10,135 --> 00:44:11,879
Sifeng, look.

691
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,999
I've hidden a treasure in one of my hands.

692
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,570
Take a guess. If you're correct, I'll give you the treasure.

693
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,279
You think it's this hand, right?

694
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,890
You're wrong. There's nothing inside.

695
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,428
Are you done?

696
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,879
Sifeng, don't be angry.

697
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,673
Although you're wrong, I hate it when our Sifeng gets angry.

698
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:37,410
So, even though you're wrong, I'll still give you the treasure.

699
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,619
Are they nice?

700
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,767
Sixth Senior used this trick every time Linglong was angry,

701
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,930
and he succeeded every time.

702
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:52,925
<i>I like Sixth Senior.</i>

703
00:44:52,926 --> 00:44:54,180
<i>Minyan?</i>

704
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:56,411
<i>You like Minyan?</i>

705
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,260
Chu Xuanji, listen carefully.

706
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,210
I'm not angry.

707
00:45:10,954 --> 00:45:12,999
You can stop your silly acts.

708
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,427
Sifeng, you're not angry?

709
00:45:15,427 --> 00:45:17,096
Why are you acting like this then?

710
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:20,148
Why did you change so much?

711
00:45:20,149 --> 00:45:21,945
You don't want us to be your friends anymore?

712
00:45:21,945 --> 00:45:23,975
Do you hate me now?

713
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,290
The disciples of Lize Palace weren't supposed to have friends anyway.

714
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:35,020
There's nothing for me to like or hate.

715
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,379
Four years is a long time.

716
00:45:36,379 --> 00:45:39,130
It's normal for people to grow and change.

717
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,839
There's no need to dwell on the past.

718
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,418
No, you weren't like this in the past.

719
00:45:43,418 --> 00:45:47,101
We had plenty of things to talk about in the past, and many things we could share.

720
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:49,790
You taught me many things as well.

721
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,096
Sifeng, you even told me that

722
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:54,726
meeting me was the best thing that had happened in your life.

723
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,470
Although I was asleep, I did hear what you said.

724
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:03,159
I was rash then. I never think before I speak.

725
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,559
You mustn't hold it to your heart.

726
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,679
- It's meaningless. <br> - It's not.

727
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,720
The past you and everything you said,

728
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,636
all of them were meaningful to me.

729
00:46:10,636 --> 00:46:12,652
I don't want our relationship to change.

730
00:46:12,653 --> 00:46:14,983
Sifeng, I don't want to lose you.

731
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:52,440
