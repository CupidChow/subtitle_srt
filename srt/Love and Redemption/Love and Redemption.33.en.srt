You won't do this without reason. I'm sure you have a favor to ask.

19
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,879
Tell me.

20
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,359
What's the relationship between King Bailing and God of War?

21
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,919
Are the tribulations of the God of War

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,539
somehow connected to her relationship with King Bailing?

23
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,019
Honestly, I don't believe it, either.

24
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,311
But everyone in the heavens believes so.

25
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:02,762
I have no choice but to believe it as well.

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,519
Her love turned into hatred?

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,749
I don't think she's a person like that.

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,798
Don't worry. King Bailing is only concerned about the three realms.

29
00:02:16,798 --> 00:02:18,666
He won't snatch away your woman.

30
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,939
This is too hard. How do I solve this?

31
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:33,350
I can't solve it!

<i>Yu Sifeng wasn't a demon after all.</i>

35
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:02,578
Maybe the demon in Qingmu Town

36
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:04,829
is connected to the demon in Mount Buzhou.

37
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,870
That demon has a malignant aura surrounding it.

38
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,857
It's not an ordinary demon.

39
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,482
Thank you, Sect Leader.

40
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:36,242
You wouldn't have been hurt if it weren't for Xuanji.

41
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:39,273
I should thank you instead.

42
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:42,206
You're too good

43
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,860
for Xuanji.

44
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,985
By the way, Sect Leader,

45
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:50,999
I just remembered that something fell out of the demon's body

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,540
when I fought him on Mount Buzhou.

47
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,522
The demon wanted to harm Xuanji and the rest.

48
00:03:56,522 --> 00:03:59,133
But I don't know what exactly he was up to.

49
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:02,982
That's why I want to revisit the altar on Mount Buzhou.

50
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:06,050
Maybe I can find some clues.

51
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,039
You're injured now.

52
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,759
You shouldn't overexert yourself.

53
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,589
I think we should send our spirit beast, Hong Luan, to check it out.

54
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:19,079
You should go on a retreat and recuperate.

55
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,820
That's a good idea.

56
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,971

00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:38,940
Why are you so anxious?

61
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,300
Some demons from Tianxu Hall are gathering at the base of our mountain!

62
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,899
And Sixth Junior is there as well.

63
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:45,710
What?

64
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,019
Don't worry.

73
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,619
- Master. Aunt... <br> - Shut up!

74
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:47,977
You traitor! You betrayed us and joined Tianxu Hall!

75
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:50,859
I don't have a disciple like you!

76
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:54,219
Minyan, how could you join the demons?

77
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:57,039
You better kowtow and apologize to your master right now!

78
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,610
Master. Aunt Yinghong.

79
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,939
I'm not here to beg for Master's forgiveness.

80
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:06,690
I'm here to represent Tianxu Hall today.

81
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,320
What did you say?

82
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,919
Say that again?

83
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,670
Master, please calm down.

84
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,099
Don't think that you don't need to worry about us

85
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:21,019
because you got back Linglong's primordial spirit.

86
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,940
Actually, you only got half of it back.

87
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,580
Half of it?

88
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,670
What do you mean? Explain yourself!

89
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,653
Linglong is still unconscious, right?

90
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:32,679
You should think of the reason why

91
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,220
and cooperate with our superintendent.

92
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,919
Only by doing so will you be able to save Linglong.

93
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,879
Sixth Junior, what do you mean by that?

94
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:44,920
<i>- What do you mean by that? <br> - Explain yourself!</i>

95

Everyone has their own ambitions.

96
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:48,152
Everyone, you all don't need to be angry.

97
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:50,472
How dare you say that?

98
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:52,479
You came to my sect when you were eight years old,

99
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,808
and I raised you until you became an adult.

100
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:57,719
But only now did I finally understand what your ambition was.

101
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,111
Fine. Hero Zhong, why are you here?

102
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:05,799
Do you want to threaten me with Linglong's primordial spirit again?

103
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,790
Hero Zhong, you better accomplish the mission our superintendent gave you!

104
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,929
Master,

105
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,759
our superintendent commanded me to send you a gift.

106
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,000
As the leader of the Five Great Sects,

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,130
we hope that you won't create trouble for us anymore.

108
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,890
And we'll reward you for your cooperation.

109
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,290
How could demons such as you order Shaoyang Sect around?

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,038

113
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,248
You beast!

114
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:03,404
How dare you harm your fellow senior!

115
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:05,095
Master!

116
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,750
Minyan, are you okay?

117
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,380
Impossible!

118
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,270
Master, I didn't kill Second Senior!

119
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,979
You know I wouldn't do this!

120
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:22,833
I don't know why he's dead!

121
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,999
I thought he was still in the cell! How could this happen?

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,399
Master, you must believe in me!

123
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,190
I didn't expect myself

124
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,845
to raise an ingrate like you.

125
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:38,379
Today, I'll slay you for justice's sake!

126
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,610
We have no time for explanations! Let's go!

127
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,802
<i>- Where are they? <br> - Where are they?</i>

128
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:56,413
I didn't expect them to possess the Teleportation Charm.

129
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,610
- Minyan. <br> - Second Senior!

130
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,883
Minyan.

131
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:13,994
Why didn't you let

132
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,919
my master kill me?

133
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,373
Both of us know that Min Jue's death has nothing to do with you.

134
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:22,483
It's Wu Tong!

135
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,990
He killed Second Senior!

136
00:09:26,586 --> 00:09:28,896
He did it on purpose!

137
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:32,150
- And I actually became his accomplice! <br> - Minyan!

138
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:35,119
- Minyan! <br> - He died because of me!

139
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,768
Second Senior is dead because of me!

140
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:39,444
I deserve to die!

141
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,207
Zhong Minyan,

142
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,590
you can kill yourself if you want to!

143
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,039
But what about Linglong?

144
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,359
Who will save her?

145
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,490
Who will retrieve her primordial spirit?

146
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,090
We still have many things we need to accomplish.

147
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,178
You need to pull yourself together.

148
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,570
We still have many tasks to complete.

149
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,230
If not, your second senior will have died in vain.

150
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,609
You mustn't spoil our plan because of your impatience.

151
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,157
Wu Tong,

152
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,759
I will seek my revenge.

153
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,629
You will pay for this!

154
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,520
You two have finally returned.

155
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,119
What will you cook today?

156
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,730
Hurry, I'm starving to death.

157
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,866
Food is the only thing that's on your mind.

158
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,162
It's a secret.

159
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,479
You two have finally returned. Something huge has happened.

160
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,990
We received a notice from Shaoyang Sect.

161
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,360
How could this happen?

162
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,520
Second Senior is dead? And Sixth Senior is the murderer?

163
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,520
Sixth Senior has been kicked out of Shaoyang Sect.

164
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,928
Impossible. I don't believe it.

165
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:53,007
Sixth Senior is a kind person.

166
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:55,718
He wouldn't resort to such despicable acts!

167
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,145
I'm sure there's something behind this.

168
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:05,396
The spirit beast of Sect Leader Chu sent us a letter.

169
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,478
Father said that Sixth Senior has joined Tianxu Hall.

170
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,117
He wants us to be careful,

171
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:23,560
and he wants us to return to the sect earlier.

172
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,303
He even said that...

173
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:27,134
He said we only brought

174
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:30,359
half of Linglong's primordial spirit back from Mount Buzhou.

175
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,910
And Linglong is still unconscious.

176
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,213
We were cheated by Wu Tong.

177
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:44,700
This Wu Tong...

178
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,180
In order to exchange for Linglong's primordial spirit,

179
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,199
five of us went into Mount Buzhou, yet only two of us came back.

180
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,446
Sixth Senior even joined Tianxu Hall because of this.

181
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,741
But in the end, we still couldn't retrieve Linglong's primordial spirit.

182
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,550
Although we didn't completely save Linglong,

183
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,342
she would've been dead without the primordial spirit you brought back.

184
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:05,729
Ting Nu, please make some Birth Candles for me.

185
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,256
I want to enter Mount Buzhou once again.

186
00:12:07,257 --> 00:12:09,519
I want to save both Linglong and Sixth Senior.

187
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,879
It's not that easy to make Birth Candles.

188
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,250
We need rare ingredients to make them.

189
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:16,976
I'm afraid Dragon Scales are too hard to find.

190
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:18,559
What should we do then?

191
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,919
I...

192
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,639
Teng She.

193
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,159
Teng She, come here.

194
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,649
Aren't you a heavenly officer?

195
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,680
You can help me enter Mount Buzhou, right?

196
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,790
Please take me there, okay?

197
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,839
I can enter that place with no difficulty.

198
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,240
- Bring us there then. <br> - Sure.

199
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,100
Wait! We have a problem.

200
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,930
Now, I'm your spirit beast,

201
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,540
and you're a useless mortal.

202
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,640
Because of that, my powers are restricted and I can't enter Mount Buzhou.

203
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,987
You!

204
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,895
How about you chop off your arm?

205
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:55,320
I'll be free by then and I can help you enter Mount Buzhou.

206
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,266
Fine. You can chop off my arm

207
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:01,237
if it means that I can save Linglong and Sixth Senior.

208
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,829
Wait! I have an idea.

209
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,279
The pieces of primordial spirit can sense each other.

210
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,544
Teng She, you should be able

211
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,694
to bring back the rest by using the primordial spirit residing in Linglong's body.

212
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,239
You know quite a lot.

213
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,919
But only I, the great heavenly officer,

214
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,710
am capable of powerful feats as such.

215
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,821
This is great. Let's return to Shaoyang Sect immediately.

216
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:32,720
Okay. Let's go.

217
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,232
What's for dinner tonight?

218
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,317
Here.

219
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,419
Fill my cup.

220
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,760
My Lord,

221
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,391
we've sent your gift to Shaoyang Sect.

222
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:06,692
What?

223
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,770
It's such a big gift.

224
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:11,921
Didn't your master ask you to stay for dinner?

225
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,867
Oh, I almost forgot.

226
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:17,359
You've been kicked out of Shaoyang Sect.

227
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,560
Now, everyone knows that you belong to Tianxu Hall now.

228
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,410
You will never be able to return to Shaoyang Sect.

229
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,093
Reward him with some wine!

230
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:30,959
After you drink this,

231
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,159
you should just work for me with all your heart.

232
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,810
Naturally, I won't treat you badly.

233
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,646
Minyan!

234
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,180
Wu Tong!

235
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,018
What? You can't continue your act anymore?

236
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,999
You're far worse at acting than me.

237
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,236
In the past, when I worked for our leader,

238
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:07,109
I always followed his every order and acted obediently.

239
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,479
I would never let him notice that it was all an act.

240
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,816
But you?

241
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:12,800
Why?

242
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,192
What do you mean?

243
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:16,780
Why did you kill Second Senior?

244
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,321
He's no threat.

245
00:15:18,322 --> 00:15:20,832
And he has never offended you!

246
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,600
I didn't kill your second senior.

247
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,668
Don't stare at me like that.

248
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:30,461
My beloved Linglong

249
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:34,851
was the one behind your second senior's death.

250
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,880
Me?

251
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,340
Did you forget?

252
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,821
You gave Chen Min Jue the poisonous glutinous rice cake

253
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:45,171
yourself last night.

254
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,780
Why are you staring at Linglong like that?

255
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,999
Are you perplexed? Are you raging inside?

256
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,720
Or are you wondering why your beloved Linglong became like this?

257
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,199
You don't even understand her well.

258
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,493
You don't even know what her favorite food is.

259
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:10,280
Come, let me help you out.

260
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,796
Someone!

261
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,780
Give Minyan your favorite glutinous rice cake.

262
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,253
Go.

263
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,537
Brother Wu Tong, why don't we just forget it?

264
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:42,914
I'll treat glutinous rice cake as my favorite food, okay?

265
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:44,766
Are you trying to disobey me?

266
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:47,080
North Superintendent, although Minyan committed mistakes,

267
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,576
he doesn't deserve to die.

268
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:50,987
North Superintendent, please give him another chance.

269
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,976
Brother Wu Tong.

270
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,675
Zhong Minyan, you're getting more stupid.

271
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:20,676
Do you think I will poison you?

272
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:23,263
I don't want my audience to die on me, you know?

273
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:24,804
But you better listen up.

274
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:26,959
I hate it when people touch my stuff.

275
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,459
You better not come up with tricks under my watch!

276
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,367
Linglong is mine.

277
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:38,679
If you do something you shouldn't, I'll send Shaoyang Sect more gifts.

278
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,830
By then, it'll be more than just Chen Min Jue.

279
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,070
Come, let's go.

280
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,085
Stinky woman, I'm the best heavenly officer there is.

281
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,819
How dare you make me do such cowardly things?

282
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:04,443
We still need to save Sixth Senior after we retrieve Linglong's spirit.

283
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:07,089
If my father knows about this, he won't let us leave Shaoyang Sect.

284
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,471
We can only use this path. Hurry!

285
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,694
Zhong Minyan, accompany me to the gate of Fenru City.

286
00:18:28,694 --> 00:18:30,984
I'll visit Shen Shu and Yu Lu.

287
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,103
I'm talking to you. Why aren't you responding?

288
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,970
I know.

289
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:43,679
You're angry at me because of your senior's death.

290
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,625
But you can't blame me for this.

291
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,119
I didn't know that glutinous rice cake was poisonous.

292
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,795
Just forget it. It's only one death.

293
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,631
There are so many disciples in Shaoyang Sect.

294
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,740
I'll capture another guy and let him accompany you, okay?

295
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,052
Scram.

296
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,760
Zhong Minyan, you better know what's good for you.

297
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,865
No one has ever spoken to me, Linglong, in that tone.

298
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:05,580
Don't call yourself Linglong in front of me!

299
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,660
You're not Linglong!

300
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,580
You don't even deserve to mention her name!

301
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,245
Stop!

302
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,130
Explain yourself then!

303
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,759
What do you mean by I'm not Linglong?

304
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,306
All of you told me the same thing!

305
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:23,357
Although I don't understand your words, I'm not stupid!

306
00:19:23,357 --> 00:19:25,291
That person you spoke of, how is she connected with me?

307
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,320
So what if we look exactly the same? Why am I inferior compared to her?

308
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:29,600
Fine.

309
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,420
Since you want me to speak,

310
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,720
I'll tell you everything.

311
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,570
There's only one Linglong in this world.

312
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:38,519
And that Linglong is in the Shaoyang Sect.

313
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,719
It's more than a coincidence that you look exactly the same as her.

314
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,808
Wu Tong made you because he couldn't obtain her.

315
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,721
Wu Tong stole Linglong's primordial spirit.

316
00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:48,578
He extracted half of your primordial spirit

317
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,559
and insert half of Linglong's primordial spirit into your body.

318
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,559
He made you his puppet.

319
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,220
And you will only adopt an appearance

320
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,462
and a personality that suits his liking!

321
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:03,164
You're wearing red because that's Linglong's favorite color.

322
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:05,199
Wu Tong is treating you well

323
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,010
only because he wanted the real Linglong.

324
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,760
You're not a flower demon, and you're not Linglong, either.

325
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,890
You're just a monster that resembles no one!

326
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,150
One's heart is the hardest to imitate.

327
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,690
You only have Linglong's appearance

328
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,841
and her demeanor.

329
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:30,063
But you're not her!

330
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,671
No matter how willful the real Linglong is,

331
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:35,306
she always has a kind heart.

332
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:40,710
A person like you, who aids evil, will never become her!

333
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,438
Impossible.

334
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:44,260
Everything you said was a lie.

335
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,353
They're not real! I'm the real Linglong!

336
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:48,524
You're lying to me!

337
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:51,241
Am I lying to you?

338
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:54,151
If so, why did you cry when I was hurt?

339
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:57,306
Why did you space out when you saw my dagger?

340
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:00,470
Why do you feel familiar with every word you said to me?

341
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,521
Am I lying to you?

342
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:06,112
Or is it because the Linglong inside of you is trying to remember me?

343
00:21:06,112 --> 00:21:07,877
Tell me!

344
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,380
Fine!

345
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,420
All of you are up to no good!

346
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,820
I'll ask Brother Wu Tong to kill you right away!

347
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,900
Fine.

348
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,519
Go now.

349
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,190
Ask him to kill me right now.

350
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,439
This is better.

351
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,860
You don't need to find out the truth.

352
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,599
Just do your part and be his puppet.

353
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,830
And lose your own identity in the process.

354
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,487
Scram!

355
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,020
<i>Here.</i>

356
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,090
<i>This is the place where I first grew up and cultivated.</i>

357
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,270
<i>I saved you because you were destined to be mine.</i>

358
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,299
<i>I have a name for you, as well. You will be Linglong.</i>

359
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:16,150
<i>What are you doing? Let me go!</i>

360
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,720
<i>- It's not there. <br> - <i>She's not Linglong.</i></i>

361
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:21,756
<i>How is it?</i>

362
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:24,180
<i>The clone looks exactly like her, doesn't it?</i>

363
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,859
<i>Even you don't know who the real Linglong is, right?</i>

364
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:31,545
<i>You're wearing red because red is Linglong's favorite color.</i>

365
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:38,130
<i>Wu Tong treats you well because he wants the real Linglong!</i>

366
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,681
<i>I remember now.</i>

367
00:22:43,681 --> 00:22:46,270
<i>Yellow is my favorite color.</i>

368
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,830
<i>Yellow is my original color.</i>

369
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,910
<i>Everything here was familiar to me.</i>

370
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,402
<i>But now,</i>

371
00:22:57,402 --> 00:23:00,250
<i>it feels like I'm in unfamiliar territory.</i>

372
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,870
<i>Don't tell me it's because</i>

373
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,690
<i>I'm not the original me anymore?</i>

374
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,630
What if Brother Tong doesn't like this?

375
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,331
I'll just change it back.

376
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,590
Brother Wu Tong.

377
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,800
Brother Wu Tong, what's on your mind?

378
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,159
Our leader asked me to prepare some troops for him.

379
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,220
Tianxu Hall will hold a major operation soon.

380
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,390
I was wondering if I should help him.

381
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,430
What's wrong? Do you need anything?

382
00:24:02,602 --> 00:24:04,376
Look.

383
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,470
When did you change your clothes?

384
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,610
Do you like it?

385
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,910
If you don't like it, I can change it back.

386
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,676
As long as you like it.

387
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,809
Really? So, are you saying that I can wear anything that I like?

388
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:29,044
Brother Wu Tong, are you saying that I can choose my own appearance?

389
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:30,629
As long as you're happy.

390
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:32,378
- I... <br> - Linglong...

391
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,748
I'm busy now.

392
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:37,639
Go out and play.

393
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,045
Second Senior, I still owe you a drink.

394
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:52,122
We were going to finish this wine and listen to your story together,

395
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,810
but I didn't expect you to leave us just like that.

396
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:59,026
Minyan, you traitor.

397
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:00,937
I will definitely capture you

398
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:03,714
and make you confess in front of Second Senior.

399
00:25:03,714 --> 00:25:07,300
But I still don't believe that Minyan is behind this.

400
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,140
First Senior, you're still defending him even now?

401
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,330
You saw Second Senior's body when they sent him back, right?

402
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,283
If Minyan joined Tianxu Hall because he didn't have a choice,

403
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:23,343
he should've returned to us when Tianxu Hall asked him to come here!

404
00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:26,194
I think this is a huge blow to Master.

405
00:25:26,194 --> 00:25:28,604
We should go and visit him.

406
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,630
Sorry, Second Senior. It's all my fault.

407
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,670
I didn't manage to save you.

408
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:49,890
They should've taken me instead of you while we were there.

409
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,264
<i>Xuanji, I know it's boring to stay here and recuperate.</i>

410
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:54,157
<i>That's why I brought you something.</i>

411
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,639
<i>Second Junior, you're willing to give Xuanji your favorite treasure?</i>

412
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,346
<i>My junior is so chivalrous.</i>

413
00:26:01,346 --> 00:26:04,557
<i>I should reward her for that.</i>

414
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:05,750
Don't worry.

415
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,101
I will find out the truth and avenge you.

416
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,860
Linglong!

417
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,450
Linlong, we've found a way to save you.

418
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:34,973
When you get better, we'll find Sixth Senior together.

419
00:26:34,974 --> 00:26:36,984
Please wait a little longer.

420
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:40,430
Teng She, come and examine Linglong's condition.

421
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,196
I'll make you some Snowflake Beef.

422
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,779
I just need to resummon the other half of her primordial spirit, right?

423
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:53,130
No problem. Just watch.

424
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,031
What's going on?

425
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,571
Again.

426
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,570
You!

427
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,259
Someone kept boasting that he's a heavenly officer.

428
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:20,390
I think your powers are weaker than your boasting skill.

429
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,117
- Stupid rat snake, shut up! <br> - You're a snake as well!

430
00:27:24,117 --> 00:27:27,812
Wait! Logically, her primordial spirit will return to her

431
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,570
if I try to summon it, no matter how far away it is.

432
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,350
Unless...

433
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,679
Unless what?

434
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,350
Unless her primordial spirit is trapped within another body.

435
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,420
It'll be troublesome if that's the case.

436
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,951
Let me see what's going on by examining her primordial spirit.

437
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,159
Brother Wu Tong told me that I'm not a puppet.

438
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,392
Brother Wu Tong likes me for who I am.

439
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:01,603
He said I can do whatever I want to.

440
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,250
I'm too lazy to bother with you.

441
00:28:05,107 --> 00:28:06,840
<i>It's Sixth Senior.</i>

442
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,420
<i>What's wrong?</i>

443
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,653
Sixth Senior.

444
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:12,103
I heard his voice!

445
00:28:12,103 --> 00:28:14,741
Sixth Senior, I'm Xuanji.

446
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:16,100
What did you call me?

447
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,459
I can hear you.

448
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:19,830
Sixth Senior, I'm Xuanji.

449
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,659
Xuanji? What's going on?

450
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:27,741
We tried to resummon Linglong's primordial spirit,

451
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:29,282
but we heard your voice instead.

452
00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:31,161
Where's the other half of her primordial spirit?

453
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:34,270
It's inside the flower demon who looks exactly like her.

454
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,500
It's no wonder Wu Tong treasures her so much.

455
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,299
Sixth Senior, did you stay in Tianxu Hall

456
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,880
in order to find the other half of her primordial spirit?

457
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,191
I don't believe that you're joining them of your own accord.

458
00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:45,842
And I don't believe that you killed Second Senior.

459
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,063
Since it has come to this,

460
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:51,837
Xuanji, you're the only person who still believes in me.

461
00:28:51,837 --> 00:28:55,460
I will find a way and retrieve the remaining half of her primordial spirit.

462
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,550
And I'll apologize to Master.

463
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,470
Dumb mortal, do you think you can retrieve it without any problem?

464
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,330
You need the Soul Bell, you know?

465
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,518
Soul Bell?

466
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,690
Since Wu Tong can steal Linglong's primordial spirit,

467
00:29:13,691 --> 00:29:16,279
it means that he has the Soul Bell.

468
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,946
Minyan, try to steal the Soul Bell from him.

469
00:29:19,947 --> 00:29:22,037
We'll meet up in Mount Buzhou.

470
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,760
So what if you manage to steal it? You need to know how to use it.

471
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,401
Teng She, stop beating around the bush.

472
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:29,872
Just tell us if you have the solution.

473
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,502
I'll make you sweet and sour fish as well.

474
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:35,724
Kid, turn around.

475
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,840
- What is this? <br> - The Sun Moon Charm.

476
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,260
After I draw that, I can detect you within a proximity of 2.5 km.

477
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,840
We can't just bring her wherever we go, right?

478
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,639
As long as you're able to steal the Soul Bell,

479
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,270
I can retrieve the other half of her primordial soul outside of Mount Buzhou.

480
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,230
We should act in haste. Let's go to Mount Buzhou now.

481
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,262
Sixth Senior, please be careful.

482
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:15,700
Okay.

483
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,350
What happened just now?

484
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,780
Nothing.

485
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,310
Wait! I felt like I was trying to say something.

486
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,810
Oh right! Didn't you let me use a mirror

487
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,721
that could show me my past lives?

488
00:30:34,722 --> 00:30:37,072
Can you show it to me again?

489
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,510
<i>Only half of it went inside?</i>

490
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,387
<i>It's hard indeed using another body.</i>

491
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,180
So, this wasn't my true look after all.

492
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,254
You saw everything? You know what's going on now?

493
00:31:09,254 --> 00:31:12,799
Brother Wu Tong replaced half of my primordial spirit with Linglong's.

494
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,960
And my primordial spirit was left at the place I trained at.

495
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,839
Where's the place?

496
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,745
It's at...

497
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,472
Give it to me!

498
00:31:35,472 --> 00:31:37,573
It's no use even if you take it back.

499
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:39,559
But we can help you.

500
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,433
Help me? Do you think I don't know what you are plotting?

501
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,860
You just wanted Linglong's primordial spirit, right?

502
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,639
- I won't fall for it. <br> - Yes.

503
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,487
We're trying to retrieve her primordial spirit.

504
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:50,500
But don't you want to be yourself?

505
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,890
It's a win-win situation. So, why not?

506
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,210
Are you afraid that Wu Tong won't like you

507
00:31:57,211 --> 00:31:58,820
if you return to your past self?

508
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,116
It's not that!

509
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:02,901
Brother Wu Tong likes me. Not that Linglong.

510
00:32:02,902 --> 00:32:04,639
Fine, I'll do it then.

511
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,799
I'll prove to you that Brother Wu Tong likes me.

512
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,020
And I'm not a replacement of that Linglong.

513
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,154
Fine. But now, we lack something that could extract one's primordial spirit.

514
00:32:13,154 --> 00:32:15,750
We need Wu Tong's Soul Bell.

515
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,639
I saw that bell before.

516
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:22,590
But Brother Wu Tong doesn't allow me to touch it.

517
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,935
Will you return my primordial spirit if I steal the bell for you?

518
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:27,327
Yes.

519
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,240
Fine. I'll steal the bell,

520
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,180
but you must keep your promise.

521
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,531
- It's a deal then. <br> - See you in three days.

522
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:41,474
And we'll help the primordial spirits to return to their bodies.

523
00:32:41,474 --> 00:32:42,794
Okay.

524
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,895
Hurry!

525
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,026
Xuanji!

526
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,780
<i>Xuanji!</i>

527
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,679
Sixth Senior, we're outside of Mount Buzhou now.

528
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,219
How's your progress?

529
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:25,660
Everything is going well. Wu Tong will go on a retreat tomorrow.

530
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,115
<i>That flower demon promised us that she'll steal the bell for us.</i>

531
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:31,185
<i>And she'll help us in retrieving Linglong's primordial spirit.</i>

532
00:33:31,185 --> 00:33:35,260
Minyan, once you acquire her spirit, try to find a way out.

533
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,260
We'll meet you at the altar outside.

534
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,469
<i>Okay. Wait for my good news.</i>

535
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,163
Brother Wu Tong,

536
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:14,636
I can't bear to part with you.

537
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,892
You're missing me already?

538
00:34:16,892 --> 00:34:20,430
It's only for one day. I'll be back soon.

539
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,488
The back of the mountain is cold. This shirt is too thin for you.

540
00:34:23,488 --> 00:34:25,380
You should change your shirt.

541
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,370
It's fine. I won't be cold.

542
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:32,089
I'll be angry if you catch a cold.

543
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:33,659
Look at your temper.

544
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,999
You're angry over this?

545
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,290
Fine. I'll listen to you.

546
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,630
How is it?

547
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:06,173
Are you happy now? Is it thick enough?

548
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:07,774
Much better.

549
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,650
I'll leave now.

550
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,105
Here.

551
00:35:25,105 --> 00:35:27,460
The Soul Bell. I've finally obtained it.

552
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,905
Brother Wu Tong will return tonight.

553
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:31,820
You better be quick if you want to escape.

554
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,027
Okay. We'll start now.

555
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,490
They're here.

556
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,276
Teng She, we have the Soul Bell.

557
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:48,019
What should we do now?

558
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,967
Teng She.

559
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:51,239
Xuanji.

560
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,330
Hurry up!

561
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,760
Wait.

562
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,661
Wait! Didn't you say you would return me my primordial spirit?

563
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:02,539
What should I do now?

564
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:05,140
Don't rush me! We'll do it one by one!

565
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,410
I need to extract the primordial spirit in your current body.

566
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,310
Don't worry. I'll keep my word.

567
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,278
I know. Actually, you're not evil.

568
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,906
You should leave Tianxu Hall

569
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:23,413
after you retrieve your own primordial spirit.

570
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,959
It's hard for you to acquire a human form.

571
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,859
Find a peaceful place and find a person who truly loves you.

572
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:29,295
Don't be too full of yourself.

573
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:31,697
I did all this because of Brother Tong.

574
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:34,061
After you retrieve Linglong's primordial spirit,

575
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:35,339
we will be unrelated.

576
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:38,130
None of you can tell me what to do.

577
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,682
Are you done or not?

578
00:36:39,682 --> 00:36:41,019
I'm going to cast my spell now.

579
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:43,417
Kid, stand beside that demon.

580
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:44,755
Okay.

581
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,850
Spirit Transfer!

582
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,550
Linglong, I can finally bring you home.

583
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,314
Minyan, you mustn't delay this any longer.

584
00:37:40,315 --> 00:37:43,069
Her primordial spirit needs to return to her body immediately.

585
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,406
Okay.

586
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,770
What about her?

587
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,159
Stupid.

588
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,299
<i>Just do the same thing I did just now.</i>

589
00:37:54,299 --> 00:37:57,159
<i>Use the Five Elements Spell and find the correct position.</i>

590
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:59,394
The flower demon's element is wood. Use water element for the spell.

591
00:37:59,394 --> 00:38:03,052
When her primordial spirit returns to her body, she'll become her original self.

592
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:05,401
Do what you did?

593
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,276
Teng She, I don't understand at all.

594
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:21,267
Why don't you do it again?

595
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:22,699
Teng She?

596
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,079
- It's cut off? <br> - Cut off?

597
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,620
Teng She, can you try to detect them again?

598
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,479
I don't know what's going on. Maybe the charm fell off.

599
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:35,139
Anyway, I've given him the instructions. It's an easy task.

600
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,170
Let's just wait here.

601
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,795
Teng She?

602
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,593
Teng She? This is bad.

603
00:38:46,593 --> 00:38:48,060
How did the charm disappear?

604
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,420
- I can't remember the things he taught me. <br> - It's fine.

605
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,627
It's fine. I remember them.

606
00:38:53,627 --> 00:38:56,330
Ruo Yu, it's lucky that I have you.

607
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,639
Let's return her primordial spirit to her body now.

608
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,348
Wait! We need to let her do something for us.

609
00:39:01,348 --> 00:39:03,149
What are you doing?

610
00:39:03,149 --> 00:39:04,655
Her primordial spirit is not in her body.

611
00:39:04,655 --> 00:39:07,519
I can use the Jade Flute to hypnotize her and steal the spirit keys.

612
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,460
Did you plan for that long ago?

613
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,399
Now that Wu Tong isn't here, no one will be able to stop Linglong.

614
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,432
This is a rare chance.

615
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:16,443
You're using her!

616
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,979
This is our reward for retrieving her primordial spirit.

617
00:39:20,979 --> 00:39:23,739
We can ask for her help if we want the spirit keys.

618
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,939
We mustn't use her to our own advantage!

619
00:39:25,939 --> 00:39:27,760
A gentleman wouldn't do this.

620
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,320
A gentleman?

621
00:39:29,321 --> 00:39:32,840
You severed one of your senior's arms in order to join Tianxu Hall.

622
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:34,851
Is that what a gentleman would do?

623
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,960
Minyan, did you forget what your master told you?

624
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,440
You can do everything it takes to retrieve the spirit keys.

625
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,020
Besides, the flower demon won't be in danger.

626
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,959
We've sacrificed so much for this.

627
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,411
If we don't retrieve the spirit keys, your second senior will have died in vain.

628
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,827
Miss Linglong,

629
00:40:11,653 --> 00:40:14,863
this is forbidden ground. So...

630
00:40:14,863 --> 00:40:19,370
We mustn't mess with Miss Linglong. We'll die if she gets angry.

631
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,200
Miss Linglong, please.

632
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,608
- She did retrieve them for us. <br> - What is this?

633
00:40:53,608 --> 00:40:55,628
This...

634
00:40:55,628 --> 00:40:58,271
This is the Flying Dragon Seal, a treasure of Lize Palace.

635
00:40:58,272 --> 00:41:02,290
I'm sure the spy stole this together with the spirit key.

636
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,458
I can take this back as well.

637
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:06,480
But why is there only one spirit key?

638
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,213
The spirit keys of Fuyu Island and Xuanyuan Sect were stolen as well.

639
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:11,813
There should be three spirit keys here.

640
00:41:11,813 --> 00:41:15,523
Don't tell me they hid the other two keys in a different place?

641
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:18,289
It's our miscalculation, but now we've alerted them.

642
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,940
Let's leave first.

643
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,279
Okay. Return her primordial spirit to her body.

644
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,690
- We'll leave after that. <br> - Okay.

645
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,302
- Who's there? <br> - Let's go!

646
00:41:42,302 --> 00:41:43,555
Let's go!

647
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,750
Where is Sixth Senior?

648
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,870
Let's check it out.

649
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,780
Everyone, listen up! I'm sure they're still around!

650
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,540
- Hurry! <br> - Go!

651
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,305
I'll distract them. You leave first.

652
00:42:39,305 --> 00:42:41,520
Ruo Yu, we'll leave together!

653
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,280
- Xuanji and the rest are at the altar. <br> - There are too many enemies.

654
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,042
If this continues, both of us will die.

655
00:42:46,042 --> 00:42:47,940
I'll wait for you in Qingmu Town.

656
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,278
Ruo Yu!

657
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:44,116
Ruo Yu!

658
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,076
Sixth Senior!

659
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,177
- Sixth Senior! <br> - Xuanji! Sifeng!

660
00:44:26,178 --> 00:44:27,400
Go and save Ruo Yu!

661
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,440
Ruo Yu?

662
00:44:29,448 --> 00:44:31,103
Teng She, go and save Ruo Yu.

663
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,883
We'll escape with Minyan for now.

664
