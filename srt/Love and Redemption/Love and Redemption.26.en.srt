After that, Wu Zhiqi locked me in that grape garden.

He kept playing tricks on me.

<i>You looked better before this.</i>

<i>You stupid monkey, you make me so mad.</i>

67
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,180
Just like that, I spent 500 years with him.

68
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,177
I finally appeared in front of him in the form of a beautiful lady.

69
00:04:50,177 --> 00:04:56,410
But before I could make that macaque fall in love with me, he left.

70
00:04:57,394 --> 00:05:01,259
Back then, Asura was leading the demon clan to wage war against the heavens.

71
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,217
He has a friend named Yuan Lang.

72
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:06,253
He invited him to become the Left Lieutenant of the demon clan.

73
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:10,329
This macaque is a very loyal friend.

74
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:12,656
I couldn't stop him.

75
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:17,327
He was so impressive back then.

76
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,329
I heard that they were winning.

77
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:23,539
But suddenly, the Devil Star was killed by the God of War,

78
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,362
and the demon clan was defeated.

79
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:29,289
From then on, the demon clan was exiled from Mount Buzhou and

80
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,353
they were dispersed into the human realm.

81
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:35,702
Wu Zhiqi was captured by the heavens and chained

82
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:39,562
at the bottom of Fenru City under Mount Buzhou with the Dimension Chain.

83
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:41,672
It has been 1,000 years.

84
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:44,864
It is my fault.

85
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:49,116
If only I could have stopped him back then.

86
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,739
So, I have to save him.

87
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:00,751
I never thought that you were a sentimental person.

88
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,859
Wu Zhiqi has never given you any promise,

89
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:05,053
and you've loved him for 1,000 years. Was it worth it?

90
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:07,677
I don't care if it's worth it or not.

91
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:10,584
I love him. So, this is what I want to do.

92
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:13,370
I'm happy with my decision.

93
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:22,499
I think it's great to be so decisive in love.

94
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:28,698
It's way better than the relationship between that Lord Dongfang and his wife.

95
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:32,681
Why do you need to hesitate when you like someone?

96
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:35,087
As long as I can save Wu Zhiqi,

97
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:38,300
I'm willing to do anything.

98
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,750
Sifeng, I never thought that demons could love as deep and true as this Purple Fox, too.

99
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:09,459
Demons are like humans, too.

100
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:12,202
They are living beings in this world,

101
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:14,851
and they have real feelings, too.

102
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,258
I've never thought about it before.

103
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:22,066
I thought that Purple Fox was just a frivolous demon.

104
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,258
I never thought that she'd be so loyal.

105
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:27,049
I even like her a little bit now.

106
00:07:28,587 --> 00:07:30,059
Yes.

107
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:33,131
She took the Mirror of Origin

108
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:37,664
because she wanted to relive the moments between her and Wu Zhiqi.

109
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:45,979
I want to look at the female general in that Mirror of Origin, too.

110
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:48,459
What is her story?

111
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:52,763
And how is she related to me?

112
00:07:54,826 --> 00:08:00,192
You and your Senior Hao Chen are already destined to be together.

113
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,145
He has been pursuing you for 1,000 years.

114
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:06,955
Maybe the person in the mirror is him.

115
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:15,939
Sifeng, can I say that you are acting jealous now?

116
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,654
You are quite a fast learner of things that I didn't teach you.

117
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:24,681
Your father has never wanted us to be together.

118
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:26,881
Now that you've run away with me,

119
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:33,280
he might be putting me on a search warrant tomorrow.

120
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,578
He won't.

121
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:37,161
Although my father is a little bit old-fashioned,

122
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,379
I know that he dotes on me.

123
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:42,339
As long as it's not a demon, he will be able to accept anyone.

124
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:45,570
Don't worry, I'll convince him.

125
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:08,499
Hey, we've been walking for so long. What's wrong with your nose?

126
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:11,284
You couldn't even smell him. Can you really find him?

127
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:15,881
Ting Nu's smell disappeared around here last time.

128
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:18,332
It's the same this time.

129
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,319
You old woman, don't play any tricks on us!

130
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:24,961
I'm not playing tricks on you. Are you dumb?

131
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:28,262
If I could smell him myself, why do I have to ask for your help?

132
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:32,430
How can we find Ting Nu then?

133
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:40,041
Eldest Brother Liu has a celestial eye, right?

134
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,834
If we can find Eldest Brother Liu, we'll be able to find Ting Nu.

135
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,294
Yes. We just need to find Eldest Brother Liu.

136
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:50,124
Purple Fox, you can't smell Ting Nu, but can you smell Eldest Brother Liu?

137
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,286
I don't know him.

138
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:55,537
How do I know what he smells like?

139
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,399
<i>Little Phoenix.</i>

140
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,869
<i>Don't say that I didn't help you.</i>

141
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,580
I have something that Eldest Brother Liu left for me.

142
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,381
What is it? Show me.

143
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,299
You can't look at this.

144
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:18,694
- Why not? Show me. <br> - No.

145
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:20,419
Why not? I showed you my book last time.

146
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,483
- Why can't you show me yours? Show me. <br> - No means no.

147
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:26,225
Why not? Show me.

148
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:30,892
Don't tell me that you are reading that kind of book.

149
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,859
Nonsense.

150
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:34,819
What kind of book is that?

151
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:36,364
Stop it.

152
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:41,682
Stop fooling around. We should find Eldest Brother Liu now.

153
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,778
Smell this.

154
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:45,390
Find out where he is.

155
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,099
Let's split up and find him now. Let's go.

156
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:49,367
Show me.

157
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:52,558
Show me. Sifeng!

158
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,142
Don't tell me that the one we are looking for is here.

159
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,770
Oh my goodness.

160
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,935
Where does this handsome man come from?

161
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,459
Come, play with me.

162
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:33,630
It's painful.

163
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,980
Hurry up and let's go.

164
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,479
This is Qingyang City.

165
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,953
How do you know that Eldest Brother Liu is here?

166
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:56,859
My nose has never failed me,

167
00:11:56,859 --> 00:12:00,226
except when someone purposely covered up the smell like Ting Nu.

168
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,256
We are here.

169
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,779
Let's go.

170
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,119
Come on.

171
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,490
Let's go.

172
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,186
Come on. Come in.

173
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:17,739
Don't be shy. Just treat this like your own home.

174
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:21,659
Little Phoenix, as the saying goes, people meet out of fate.

175
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,746
Come! Have a seat.

176
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:25,629
More like out of money, right?

177
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,899
If it wasn't because we needed your help,

178
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:31,970
I wouldn't admit that I know you just now.

179
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,059
You paid for me. So you are my master now.

180
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,509
Come, Master. Have a seat.

181
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,477
It's fine. I want to stand.

182
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:44,962
Eldest Brother Liu, why are you at Qingyang?

183
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:46,924
Have you found Yu'er?

184
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:50,809
Well, Yu'er?

185
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:53,833
Half a month ago, Yu'er brought me to the Tianxu Hall's hideout.

186
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,449
She said that she wanted to stay in Tianxu Hall.

187
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:59,579
It was chaotic back then. I couldn't convince her to leave with me.

188
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,050
I saw her leaving with the people from Tianxu Hall,

189
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:07,248
and I didn't have the chance to tell you about it.

190
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:14,578
That Yu'er is really naughty.

191
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:17,019
How can she spend time with demons from Tianxu Hall?

192
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:19,020
I really can't do anything about her. Forget it.

193
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,550
I don't care anymore.

194
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:32,115
Who is this beautiful lady in purple?

195
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:34,180
God is really treating me well.

196
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,290
I even met this beautiful fox lady who is 1,000 years old.

197
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,430
How is it? Is my hand nice, you scoundrel?

198
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,939
You are indeed an old fox demon.

199
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:58,340
How dare you say that I'm old.

200
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,561
We are all friends. Be kind to him.

201
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:06,499
Eldest Brother Liu, we are here this time to ask for your help.

202
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:09,529
I have a friend named Ting Nu. He went missing.

203
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,419
We can't find him or smell him.

204
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,337
Can you help us find him?

205
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:16,659
You want to find someone? It's easy.

206
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:19,177
Great. Eldest Brother Liu, let's not waste any time then.

207
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:22,620
Open your celestial eye now to help us look for Ting Nu.

208
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,069
Now?

209
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,682
At first, it's not a problem to help you find him with my celestial eye.

210
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:36,601
But, unfortunately, I just opened my celestial eye two days ago.

211
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:40,339
You know that if I open the celestial eye again within such a short time,

212
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,785
it'd be adverse to my health.

213
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:44,676
You opened the celestial eye?

214
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:49,624
Then, we won't be able to save Ting Nu now.

215
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:52,959
Calm down. Although I can't open my celestial eye,

216
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,538
I can still feel a faint trace of him.

217
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:59,379
How about you stay at my house for two days first?

218
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,021
I'll find a way in two days. There must be a way.

219
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,649
We'll have to trouble you then.

220
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:08,601
It's no trouble. It's no trouble.

221
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,129
<i>Yu'er! Yu'er!</i>

222
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:30,719
<i>Such a bright young lady. It'll be a pity if she dies.</i>

223
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,690
<i>Old Fogey! Save me! I can't take it anymore!</i>

224
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:35,990
<i>Don't hurt her! Yu'er!</i>

225
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,158
<i>Don't touch her.</i>

226
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,163
<i>What do you want?</i>

227
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,444
<i>I need you to do something for me.</i>

228
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:50,780
<i>This is the Mirror of Origin.</i>

229
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,019
<i>Bring this mirror to Chu Xuanji.</i>

230
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,482
<i>Let her look into this mirror to remember her past</i>

231
00:15:57,482 --> 00:15:59,474
<i>so that she can awaken her God of War's power.</i>

232
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:01,176
<i>Xuanji?</i>

233
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,658
<i>You want me to betray my own friend?</i>

234
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:12,151
<i>Impossible.</i>

235
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,733
<i>Fine.</i>

236
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,822
<i>Yu'er!</i>

237
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,859
<i>Old Fogey, save me!</i>

238
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,539
<i>Fine, I promise you. Stop!</i>

239
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:30,238
<i>Stop!</i>

240
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,139
<i>You should've agreed earlier.</i>

241
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:38,480
<i>I'm just asking you to jolt her memories, not kill her.</i>

242
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,615
<i>Think about it. Our Hall Master wants to reawaken the God of War.</i>

243
00:16:41,615 --> 00:16:46,400
<i>But I heard that the God of War was the one who killed Devil Star back then.</i>

244
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,668
<i>Who can win? Our Hall Master or the God of War?</i>

245
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,930
<i>You are a lunatic.</i>

246
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:01,309
<i>I really don't know what Tianxu Hall is plotting.</i>

247
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:03,699
<i>Little Phoenix cherishes Xuanji so much.</i>

248
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:07,097
<i>If Little Phoenix and Xuanji are hurt because of me,</i>

249
00:17:07,097 --> 00:17:09,339
<i>it'll be such an unfaithful thing to do.</i>

250
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,330
<i>I can't do that.</i>

251
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,521
Just like what the hall master has expected. They've asked you to help save the merman.

252
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:42,512
Now, everything is ready.

253
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:44,550
It'll be up to you next.

254
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:49,915
Yu'er! How's Yu'er?

255
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:53,113
Don't worry. The North Superintendent knows that you'll miss your daughter.

256
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,650
So, he sent me to give you this.

257
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,201
After your mission is done, you'll be able to see your daughter.

258
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:06,257
<i>Maybe it's not a bad thing to reawaken the God of War's memories.</i>

259
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:08,859
<i>She'll have to know the truth sooner or later.</i>

260
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:11,835
<i>I'm sorry, Little Phoenix.</i>

261
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:21,129
Why aren't you letting us sleep?

262
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:23,129
You better have something important to say.

263
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:26,180
Of course, I have something important to say.

264
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:28,819
Let me tell you.

265
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:34,536
I tried everything I can and used up all of my power

266
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:39,387
to finally be able to feel where that merman is.

267
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,682
This is the Fire Desert?

268
00:18:56,158 --> 00:18:59,585
We can only reach the entrance of Mount Buzhou through this Fire Desert.

269
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:03,729
But it'll be hard to fly with a sword within a few miles around Mount Buzhou.

270
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:07,000
It's fine. We can just walk there.

271
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:10,483
Mount Buzhou has a complicated terrain.

272
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,521
A gale will blow through here every night.

273
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:14,088
We won't be able to travel in it.

274
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:15,840
It's late already.

275
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,242
How about we stay at an inn first?

276
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,683
We can travel first thing in the morning tomorrow.

277
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:26,257
Don't worry, Sect Leader. Hao Chen already said that

278
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:29,558
the entrance of Mount Buzhou will only be opened at a certain time.

279
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:33,103
Even if they reach here before us, they won't be able to go in now.

280
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,019
Okay.

281
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:37,490
Let's find an inn first then.

282
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:55,419
- Ting Nu is locked up here? <br> - There's a demon guarding the door.

283
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:58,808
It's fine. Later, we can climb over the wall.

284
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:01,483
We can save him without alerting anyone.

285
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,482
Wait.

286
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:05,140
This doesn't feel right.

287
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,906
What place is this?

288
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:10,274
We don't know who our opponents are or what they want.

289
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:15,049
It's not wise to just rush in.

290
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,260
I've lived for 1,000 years without fearing anything.

291
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,330
If you are afraid, I can go in myself.

292
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,218
We'll save Ting Nu, for sure,

293
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:25,470
but we have to be careful.

294
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,430
Be careful then. Let's split up and search the place.

295
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,970
Let's go.

296
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,190
I smell Dang Kang.

297
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,340
Dang Kang? What is Dang Kang?

298
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,413
Ting Nu's spirit beast.

299
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:01,796
Dang Kang.

300
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,079
Don't just purr. Tell us something useful.

301
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,114
Where is your master?

302
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:10,555
Bring us to him.

303
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,220
It said that Ting Nu is trapped by the demon here.

304
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,848
It just managed to break the barrier and come out to ask for help.

305
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,301
Come here, little guy.

306
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,287
Sifeng, you can communicate with it?

307
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:26,939
You can understand it?

308
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:29,584
I learned some beast language before.

309
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:32,685
If you want to learn, I can teach you in the future.

310
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,680
What did he say?

311
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,530
He said that Ting Nu is locked inside a secret room.

312
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,855
It wants to bring us to him.

313
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,861
Let's go.

314
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,766
There are so many rooms here. How long will it take?

315
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:12,500
We are here to rescue him. We can't rush it.

316
00:22:13,217 --> 00:22:15,300
We haven't checked this room, right? Let's go in.

317
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,460
Okay.

318
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,020
Let's go.

319
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,500
This doesn't look like a place to hold someone in.

320
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,400
Maybe there's a mechanism in here.

321
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,590
Let's look for it.

322
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,459
- What is this? <br> - What is this?

323
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,340
They are trying to lock us in.

324
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,308
This is a Restrictive Formation. We won't be able to get out now.

325
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,260
This is bad. Sifeng and the others are in danger.

326
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,620
We have to find a way to get out!

327
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:25,980
Mirror of Origin?

328
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,010
What happened to Ting Nu?

329
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,050
Ting Nu's heart's blood was used to build this formation.

330
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,820
This will kill him.

331
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,910
Let's try to break this formation first.

332
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:07,742
You stupid fox, why aren't you here yet?

333
00:24:39,222 --> 00:24:43,520
Sifeng, are we inside the Mirror of Origin now?

334
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,152
I think so.

335
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,442
Why would we be in the Mirror of Origin?

336
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:50,312
Where is the Purple Fox?

337
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,349
King Bailing, this is bad!

338
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:04,700
King Bailing, this is bad!

339
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,721
The life pillar of the God of War is flickering again.

340
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:11,690
I'm afraid that Chu Xuanji has entered the Mirror of Origin.

341
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,799
She just left me for a few days,

342
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,648
but she has already run into the Mirror of Origin?

343
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:21,278
This is not as simple as it looks.

344
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,387
You are the God of War, right?

345
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:32,097
She's the one I keep on seeing in my dream.

346
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,521
Do you mean that female general?

347
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,946
Xuanji, she looks exactly like you.

348
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:45,488
She looks like she has a lot of secrets in her heart.

349
00:26:46,443 --> 00:26:49,040
What does she want to tell me?

350
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,929
Where is she now?

351
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,914
No matter if it's about Xuanji or the Mirror of Origin,

352
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,446
this is a matter of the human realm.

353
00:27:07,446 --> 00:27:10,500
The heavens can't interfere with the matters of the human realm.

354
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,811
I can't find out where she is.

355
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,614
I can't stay here for long. Goodbye.

356
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:22,000
Deity Binding Spell? King Bailing!

357
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,491
I used my energy to cast this spell.

358
00:27:24,491 --> 00:27:28,820
If you break this spell forcefully, you'll break my spirit.

359
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,640
Then you'll be committing a grave crime, Si Ming.

360
00:27:34,023 --> 00:27:37,100
Just this once. Tell me where Xuanji is.

361
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,459
Why do you have to do this, King Bailing?

362
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,813
The key memories of the God of War

363
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:44,683
have already been wiped away by you from her life pillar, right?

364
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:47,141
Even if she enters the Mirror of Origin,

365
00:27:47,142 --> 00:27:50,422
she'll just see some fragmented memories.

366
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:52,880
Even if she awakens,

367
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,540
she won't be able to remember the past.

368
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,981
In this life, I can't let her be anymore.

369
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:09,723
King Bailing, everyone has their own destiny.

370
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:12,146
No matter how much you want to save the God of War,

371
00:28:12,146 --> 00:28:15,507
we can't go against the laws of God.

372
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,220
By the way, it's considered prying into the prophecy if mortals

373
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,765
go into the Mirror of Origin.

374
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:27,907
When they do that, there'll be lightning.

375
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,674
There will be lightning?

376
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,458
Smart.

377
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,900
If you think along this line, you might be able to find Chu Xuanji.

378
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,730
If you can seek her out yourself, it'll be by your own effort.

379
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,257
I didn't say anything.

380
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:44,691
Go back to Siming Hall at once.

381
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:46,460
If things go wrong with her life pillar,

382
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,290
seal it up even if you have to deplete your power to do that.

383
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,000
We can't let her power awaken yet.

384
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,980
Go now. If you fail me, I won't forgive you.

385
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,122
Yes, King Bailing.

386
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:17,699
What place is this?

387
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:19,210
This is...

388
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:22,594
Could it be that this is the heavens?

389
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,562
<i>You can fight well, right? Come, fight me.</i>

390
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:27,659
<i>I don't want to fight you.</i>

391
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:30,694
<i>Are you afraid of me? If you can't even defeat me,</i>

392
00:29:30,694 --> 00:29:34,380
<i>how can King Bailing send you to lead the army against Asura?</i>

393
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,700
<i>You are not stronger or better than I am.</i>

394
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,980
<i>King Bailing's order. Nobody is allowed to disturb the God of War.</i>

395
00:29:44,943 --> 00:29:47,396
<i>Don't mind him.</i>

396
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:54,722
<i>God of War, I'm here to issue a military order</i>

397
00:29:54,722 --> 00:29:57,842
<i>on behalf of King Bailing.</i>

398
00:29:57,842 --> 00:29:59,340
<i>Say it.</i>

399
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,399
<i>King Asura has led his right and left lieutenants with 12 Dark Knights</i>

400
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,138
<i>to attack the shore of the Life and Death Sea.</i>

401
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:06,193
<i>You are to go into battle at once.</i>

402
00:30:06,193 --> 00:30:09,558
<i>King Bailing thinks that this is our best chance to kill King Asura</i>

403
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,597
<i>and defeat the army of the demon clan.</i>

404
00:30:16,803 --> 00:30:21,510
<i>King Bailing said that he'll await your triumphant return.</i>

405
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,171
<i>After defeating the demon clan's army,</i>

406
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:28,170
<i>the war will end. Right?</i>

407
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,760
<i>After that,</i>

408
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,170
<i>does it mean that I don't have to fight anymore?</i>

409
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:36,609
<i>Well...</i>

410
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:49,156
<i>Let's go.</i>

411
00:30:55,172 --> 00:30:57,881
<i>Can you stop creating trouble for me?</i>

412
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:03,940
King Asura?

413
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,849
The demon clan's army?

414
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:07,946
Could it be that this is

415
00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:11,476
the war between the heavens and the demon realm 1,000 years ago?

416
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:13,834
I think so.

417
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:17,219
You can see the past through the Mirror of Origin.

418
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:20,755
This happened in the heavens 1,000 years ago.

419
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,620
I think it's related to you.

420
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,736
But 1,000 years ago, who is she?

421
00:31:26,736 --> 00:31:29,218
They call her the God of War.

422
00:31:29,218 --> 00:31:31,936
Could it be that she's the legendary God of War

423
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:34,544
who defeated the demon clan's army

424
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:37,553
and destroyed King Asura?

425
00:31:37,553 --> 00:31:39,612
Xuanji,

426
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:43,602
she looks like you and often appears in your dreams.

427
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:47,612
She is probably you in the past.

428
00:31:47,612 --> 00:31:49,477
Really?

429
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:53,586
In the past, I'm not a devil who killed without batting an eye

430
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:57,440
but a God of War from the heavens?

431
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,706
Look. You always thought so badly about yourself.

432
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:03,506
Do you understand now?

433
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:06,030
She's an outstanding person.

434
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,460
She stayed here?

435
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,771
It's too cold and desolate.

436
00:32:39,202 --> 00:32:41,419
That is Dingkun Sword.

437
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,530
Yes. It's Dingkun Sword.

438
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,437
No wonder you are the only one who can awaken it.

439
00:32:56,523 --> 00:33:00,528
It's Ting Nu. He told me that he was once a medic in the heavens.

440
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:04,643
He was punished and sent down to the human realm because of something.

441
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,780
<i>God of War,</i>

442
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,018
<i>you haven't fully recovered yet and you are leading the battle again?</i>

443
00:33:14,018 --> 00:33:16,538
<i>Do you want me to tell King Bailing about it,</i>

444
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:19,880
<i>so that you can sit out this battle this time?</i>

445
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,620
<i>My injuries are nothing.</i>

446
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,635
<i>The demon clan's army is gathering their forces.</i>

447
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,872
<i>If I don't go, nobody else can fight them.</i>

448
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:29,384
<i>No need to worry King Bailing because of this.</i>

449
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:33,214
<i>The most worrisome thing for a medic is a patient who doesn't take care of herself.</i>

450
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:37,398
<i>After this battle, I'm afraid that you'll add new injuries to your old ones</i>

451
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:40,170
<i>until I won't be able to treat your wounds.</i>

452
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,560
<i>I'll try to get injured less. Don't worry about me.</i>

453
00:33:48,346 --> 00:33:50,465
<i>That is not what I meant.</i>

454
00:33:52,618 --> 00:33:54,790
<i>Take care.</i>

455
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,908
<i>How can King Bailing break his promise?</i>

456
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,154
<i>You Asuras are cold-blooded killers.</i>

457
00:34:06,154 --> 00:34:10,309
<i>Today... Today, I'm going to kill you just like how</i>

458
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,599
<i>I killed the Demon Maleficent Star.</i>

459
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,830
<i>You are the God of War of the heavens?</i>

460
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,709
<i>You are the one who killed the Devil Star?</i>

461
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,037
<i>This is such a joke.</i>

462
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:30,960
What's wrong? What does King Asura mean?

463
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,555
Why can't I see anything? What does he mean by such a joke?

464
00:34:33,555 --> 00:34:35,051
Calm down, Xuanji.

465
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:37,384
Let's go through the fog.

466
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,400
<i>God of War, you are so vicious.</i>

467
00:34:57,391 --> 00:34:58,900
What's wrong?

468
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,618
The mirror already let us in.

469
00:35:00,618 --> 00:35:02,758
Why won't it show us the rest?

470
00:35:02,758 --> 00:35:06,323
This is indeed strange. As if something has covered it up.

471
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:10,079
<i>Why did you lie to me? Why?</i>

472
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,260
<i>- I'm just a sword for you to kill with!</i> <br> - Xuanji.

473
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,910
<i>- Why did you do this to me?</i> <br> - What's wrong?

474
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:18,088
Why do I feel so upset when I hear her voice?

475
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:20,131
In the past, I thought that we were two entities.

476
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:22,160
She and I were different.

477
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,666
But now, I can clearly feel her anger and helplessness,

478
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,980
but I don't know what happened.

479
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,725
Why can't I see anything?

480
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:33,780
When I read an ancient scroll regarding the Mirror of Origin,

481
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,129
someone mentioned that if a person's past is sealed,

482
00:35:37,129 --> 00:35:38,922
it'll affect the Mirror of Origin.

483
00:35:38,922 --> 00:35:41,970
Looks like your past has been sealed up.

484
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,260
That's why you can only see fragments of it.

485
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,858
It has been 1,000 years. Why do they still want to seal it?

486
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:51,163
Why? Why do the heavens want to wipe away my past?

487
00:35:51,163 --> 00:35:52,700
Xuanji!

488
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,987
Don't be obsessed with it. You might get lost within these memory fragments.

489
00:35:56,987 --> 00:36:02,562
<i>Wu Zhiqi, how dare you steal the Juntian Hoop and Chehai Hook?</i>

490
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:06,147
<i>God of War, I want you to arrest Wu Zhiqi.</i>

491
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:09,670
<i>I want to eradicate the demon clan from the three realms.</i>

492
00:36:31,076 --> 00:36:33,460
<i>Wu Zhiqi, surrender now.</i>

493
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,655
<i>Return the Juntian Hoop and Chehai Hook to the heavens.</i>

494
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:38,540
<i>Do they belong to the heavens?</i>

495
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,260
<i>You killed the Devil Star and took away his things.</i>

496
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,270
<i>I'm just getting his things back for him!</i>

497
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,690
<i>God of War, King Asura asked me to send you a message.</i>

498
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,340
<i>God of War, I was killed by you.</i>

499
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,131
<i>I kept my last breath to give you a present.</i>

500
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:20,759
<i>Take a good look at</i>

501
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,858
<i>what secret King Bailing hid in his celestial hall.</i>

502
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:28,199
<i>You brought this upon yourself!</i>

503
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,490
Why is it gone again? What happened?

504
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:45,090
Why won't it show me?

505
00:37:57,196 --> 00:37:59,887
<i>Bailing, come out!</i>

506
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,599
<i>Are you trying to revolt?</i>

507
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,630
<i>How long are you going to keep lying to me?</i>

508
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:23,620
Bailing looks so familiar.

509
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,155
<i>You lied to me and made me into this God of War.</i>

510
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:29,299
<i>I trusted you so much.</i>

511
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:31,349
<i>How could you</i>

512
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,545
<i>and the whole of Heaven use me like this?</i>

513
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,159
<i>How dare you!</i>

514
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,420
<i>God of War, you are disobedient and are revolting against your superior. It's unforgivable!</i>

515
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,940
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>

516
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,339
<i>You are the one who was wrong.</i>

517
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:45,980
<i>I want to see the Jade Emperor!</i>

518
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,443
<i>Or else, I'll destroy all of Heaven.</i>

519
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:50,820
<i>No matter how courageous you are,</i>

520
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,747
<i>you can't just charge into the celestial hall and scream at King Bailing!</i>

521
00:38:53,747 --> 00:38:57,140
<i>I can guard the heavens.</i>

522
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,519
<i>And I can destroy it.</i>

523
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,794
<i>How dare you! Arrest her!</i>

524
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,320
<i>Bailing, you have to give me an explanation today!</i>

525
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:25,669
<i>Bailing, I won't forgive you.</i>

526
00:39:25,669 --> 00:39:27,460
<i>I will kill you.</i>

527
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:33,170
<i>I'll kill all of you and avenge myself!</i>

528
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,139
<i>King Bailing, why won't you come out and talk to me?</i>

529
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:57,268
<i>Are the heavens full of cowards?</i>

530
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,479
<i>You want to see me?</i>

531
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,434
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>

532
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,743
<i>You are the one who did wrong.</i>

533
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:07,523
<i>You used me</i>

534
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:10,701
<i>and turned me into the heavens' murder weapon.</i>

535
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:14,140
<i>You used me to kill people whom I shouldn't kill.</i>

536
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,820
<i>You made me do something evil and vicious.</i>

537
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,482
<i>And in the end, I am the one who did wrong?</i>

538
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:23,140
<i>This is not fair.</i>

539
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,566
Let her go!

540
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,079
<i>You hate me for betraying you and lying to you.</i>

541
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,982
<i>So, you want to seek revenge from the heavens?</i>

542
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:37,509
<i>I will uphold justice</i>

543
00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:41,710
<i>even if it costs me my life or brings me to hell forever.</i>

544
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,180
<i>Please forgive her!</i>

545
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,260
<i>I'll send you down to the human realm to go through ten reincarnations</i>

546
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,820
<i>to get rid of your resentment.</i>

547
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,679
<i>As for how it'll turn out, it'll all depend on you.</i>

548
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,879
Why? Why do I have to be punished?

549
00:40:57,879 --> 00:41:01,170
I didn't do anything wrong. Why do I have to be punished?

550
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,540
Why? Why did you seal up all of my memories?

551
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,666
Why won't you tell me anything?

552
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:08,740
Xuanji, look at me.

553
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,762
Pull yourself together. You are not the God of War, you are Chu Xuanji!

554
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:14,060
They are still waiting for us outside.

555
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,620
Don't be dragged into it anymore.

556
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,359
I have to get to the bottom of this.

557
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,208
Xuanji!

558
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,700
Xuanji?

559
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,844
Why am I there, too?

560
00:42:00,844 --> 00:42:03,170
This is the memory of my trial.

561
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:08,950
Could it be that Xuanji was in a trial with me?

562
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:14,467
<i>It's done now.</i>

563
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,683
<i>With the injury on your ankle,</i>

564
00:43:16,683 --> 00:43:20,865
<i>you shouldn't have forced yourself to dance.</i>

565
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:26,050
<i>If you can't recover well, I'm afraid that you can't even walk properly in the future.</i>

566
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:31,231
<i>I never thought about the future,</i>

567
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:35,839
<i>and I don't believe that there is sincerity in this world.</i>

568
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,310
<i>I won't leave with you.</i>

569
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:43,395
<i>I'll only wait for one person to come and get me.</i>

570
00:43:44,077 --> 00:43:49,300
<i>Lan Yue, Mister Qiao is here to bring you back to Qiao Residence.</i>

571
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,526
<i>Pack your things.</i>

572
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:56,730
<i>See? I knew that he would come.</i>

573
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,340
<i>You said that you don't believe in sincerity,</i>

574
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,570
<i>but you believe in him.</i>

575
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:11,748
<i>Do you know what kind of man Mister Qiao is?</i>

576
00:44:11,748 --> 00:44:14,167
<i>I know what kind of a person he is,</i>

577
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:17,660
<i>and I never said that I'd trust his sincerity.</i>

578
00:44:18,386 --> 00:44:22,560
<i>I don't trust anybody. I trust only myself.</i>

579
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,723
I remember now.

580
00:44:28,723 --> 00:44:31,338
No. Xuanji.

581
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,460
Don't go, Xuanji!

582
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:40,040
