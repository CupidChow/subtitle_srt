00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,280
Now that Wu Zhiqi has been saved,

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,029
my plan will succeed soon

20
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:45,050
and everything will be clear.

21
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,970
I saw Xuanji's background within the Demon Citadel.

22
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,340
She's the God of War

23
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,482
and the Devil Star as well.

24
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,600
Although I don't know why,

25
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,894
I suspect that...

26
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:02,675
the heavens were up to something.

27
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:06,655
That's why Xuanji had to withstand nine lives of torture.

28
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:10,940
Maybe this is connected to everything.

29
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:13,339
It's tough for her?

30
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:15,139
What about you?

31
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:17,479
Do you think you're happy when she's suffering?

32
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,500
Yu Sifeng, you suffered the same fate yourself!

33
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,280
Forget it. Just sever your ties with her.

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,020
If you continue this, you'll be dead next time.

35
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,548
In this life, as long as the two stars do not align with each other,

36
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:40,798
she will never become the Devil Star

37
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,294
and she won't suffer again.

38
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:45,358
If I die,

39
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:47,560
I will only miss out on this life.

40
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,767
But if I do so, Xuanji

41
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:52,256
will never suffer again.

42
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,760
Are you silly or are you pretending to be silly?

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,820
As long as the two stars do not align with each other?

44
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,360
Do you think you can determine the movement of the stars?

45
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,239
I can't do it on my own.

46
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,270
So, I need someone to help me.

47
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,679
Don't say that.

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,069
I'm not that capable.

49
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:13,449
I can't help you with this.

50
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,330
- Wu Zhiqi. <br> - Wu Zhiqi?

51
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,412
Are you kidding me?

52
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:21,192
He's one of the strongest demons around.

53
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:23,542
Maybe it's his wish to revive the Devil Star, too.

54
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:25,665
Why should he help you?

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,423
Are you saying that you can trick him to help you?

56
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:39,680
Wu Zhiqi is a loyal person.

57
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,660
If I want him to help me, I need to be honest and sincere.

58
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,820
Eldest Brother Liu, please prepare a feast for me.

59
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,809
I'll meet him.

60
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:58,073
Xuanji.

61
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,410
Our wedding dresses are done.

62
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,750
They just sent them to me. Are they nice?

63
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,159
Both of our weddings will be held in two days.

64
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,939
Everyone is busy preparing for that.

65
00:04:18,828 --> 00:04:21,759
Xuanji, what's wrong?

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,120
Are you listening to me?

67
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,916
Xuanji!

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,080
Senior, why did you lie to me?

69
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,887
Seems like you still can't bear to kill him.

70
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:45,360
You did use the Vermilion Bird Bottle.

71
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,723
Yes.

72
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:48,521
I've asked myself 1,000 times,

73
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,660
but I really don't want him to die.

74
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,620
That's why I tried to cleanse his anguish by using the bottle.

75
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,879
I just wanted to bring him back, even if I had to lock him up forever.

76
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,020
But the Vermilion Bird Bottle almost killed him instead!

77
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,460
I knew you would go soft on him.

78
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,480
That's why I helped you out.

79
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,394
I'm doing this for your sake.

80
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,986
For my sake?

81
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:17,105
You want me to master the Sentimental Tactics,

82
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:19,241
yet you want me to be heartless?

83
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:22,763
Isn't this ironic? I can't do this.

84
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,039
Senior, I'm sorry.

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,891
Xuanji!

86
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,011
Initially, I wanted us to get married

87
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:36,540
and let everything return to normal.

88
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,549
But in the end,

89
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:41,820
it was only my wishful thinking.

90
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,637
Fine.

91
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:45,790
Since it has come to this,

92
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,010
let's end this once and for all.

93
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,884
For our wedding,

94
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:02,478
I won't force you if you're not willing to marry me.

95
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,600
I will give everyone an explanation.

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,653
But no matter what happens,

97
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:12,326
I will always be your senior.

98
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:15,400
Senior, you've always been the person I respect the most.

99
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,360
Fine.

100
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,572
I hope you can remember your vow as a protector of the secret ground.

101
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:23,958
Protect the Crystal Lamp.

102
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,189
I will never forget my responsibility.

103
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,775
I won't let anyone acquire the Crystal Lamp.

104
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:35,196
But now, I'm afraid that isn't enough.

105
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:37,816
Now that the Devi Star has reincarnated,

106
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:41,521
the secret ground is easy to be invaded as the barrier has disappeared.

107
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:43,891
The Crystal Lamp is in a dangerous position.

108
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:45,407
Promise me this.

109
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:49,022
If one day, you can't protect the Crystal Lamp any longer,

110
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:51,549
you must destroy it yourself.

111
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:55,640
If not, the world will be jeopardized once the Devil Star obtains

112
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,982
its soul.

113
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:01,699
The Shaoyang Sect has been protecting the Crystal Lamp for many years.

114
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,899
Should I really destroy it?

115
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:07,641
The heavens wanted to show mercy initially.

116
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,440
They wanted to purify the soul of the Devil Star,

117
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,682
so that he may return to the heavens one day.

118
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:17,887
But now,

119
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:20,083
it seems like he has no remorse at all,

120
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:23,003
and he has let the heavens down again.

121
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:25,197
Since that's the case,

122
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:29,789
we have no choice but to destroy his soul,

123
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:34,730
and only the God of War can do it.

124
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:42,020
Since you can't bear to kill Yu Sifeng,

125
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,295
you should never let him obtain the Crystal Lamp.

126
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:49,366
You need to do this in order to protect the world

127
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:54,020
and to prevent that kid from making further mistakes.

128
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,453
If that day does come,

129
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:59,693
I will destroy the Crystal Lamp myself.

130
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,274
I heard that you're going to treat me to a feast.

131
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:10,349
I even skipped my lunch for this.

132
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,423
I was waiting for this.

133
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:15,843
- Eldest Brother Wu. <br> - You don't need to be too courteous.

134
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:21,478
Your injuries haven't healed yet,

135
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,160
but you're treating me to a feast already?

136
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,279
Seems like this is not a free meal, right?

137
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,111
Honestly speaking, I have a favor to ask of you.

138
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,536
Eldest Brother Wu, actually I didn't save you

139
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:47,085
because I wanted to revive the demon clan.

140
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:49,605
It's because of my own selfish desire.

141
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,879
You're pretty interesting.

142
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,392
Everyone else would hide their true intentions,

143
00:09:00,393 --> 00:09:03,220
but you're funny. You tell me immediately.

144
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,560
It's either you're stupid or you're the smartest person around.

145
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,999
But it's fine.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,011
No matter which type you belong to, you're my savior.

147
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,879
I've laid out some rules before.

148
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,000
Anyone who saves me will become my brother.

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,679
I will promise you three wishes,

150
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,900
and I'll do anything to accomplish them.

151
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,000
So just tell me what you need.

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,740
Eldest Brother Wu, please promise me that

153
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,775
you'll not give Yuan Lang the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook, no matter what.

154
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,500
I think that's fine.

155
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,520
But I have three questions for you.

156
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,779
First question.

157
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,140
You don't want him to obtain the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook

158
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,100
because you don't want him to unseal the Crystal Lamp, right?

159
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,650
Yes.

160
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,100
Second question.

161
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,518
You're not the reincarnation of the Devil Star, right?

162
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,733
That is correct.

163
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,640
Just like what I've thought.

164
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,731
The reincarnation of the Devil Star

165
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:12,331
would never sustain such injuries from the malignant aura.

166
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,059
Last question.

167
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:17,399
You know the identity of the Devil Star,

168
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,206
but you don't want to revive him. Right?

169
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,024
Actually, I just don't want our clan

170
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:30,720
to be involved in an endless war.

171
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,880
Good!

172
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,442
I like people like you.

173
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:34,560
Don't worry.

174
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,620
Don't worry. I'll never let Yuan Lang obtain the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook.

175
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,060
Eldest Brother Wu, thank you.

176
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,720
Eldest Brother Wu, I have another question for you as well.

177
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,686
Actually, you don't want the Devil Star to be revived as well, am I right?

178
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,560
The Devil Star is the lord of all demons.

179
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,061
If he is revived, he'll surely invade the heavens

180
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:15,125
in order to pay them back for our humiliations.

181
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,639
That would've been fun,

182
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,350
but I hate it when people order me around.

183
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:28,230
As the Left Lieutenant, I need to follow his orders if he's revived

184
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:31,604
and that troubles me.

185
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Why don't we just forget it?

186
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,579
Just let him stay dead then.

187
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:43,049
We should just enjoy our lives and drink to our heart's content.

188
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,276
Thank you, Eldest Brother Wu.

189
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,942
Stop thanking me. Aren't you tired of it?

190
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:55,349
By the way, Eldest Brother Wu, I have something to ask.

191
00:11:55,349 --> 00:12:00,244
The furnace that could absorb humans' souls, where did Yuan Lang get that?

192
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:02,965
A furnace that can absorb human souls?

193
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,360
Don't tell me it's the Soul Furnace?

194
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,220
What's the use of this Soul Furnace?

195
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,328
For the Soul Furnace, if you absorb 99 souls with it,

196
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:14,949
it'll form a blood formation.

197
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:16,999
It enables the user to absorb the powers of live humans,

198
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,970
and the victim will turn into a dry corpse.

199
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,420
So, who is Yuan Lang targeting then?

200
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,323
Don't tell me...

201
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:35,265
this power has something to do with the revival of the Devil Star?

202
00:12:35,265 --> 00:12:37,180
How could I forget this?

203
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,939
The God of War used her own power to seal the Devil Star's soul.

204
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:42,740
So, in order to unseal the Crystal Lamp,

205
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,358
besides using the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook,

206
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:47,818
we need the God of War's power as well.

207
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,520
Don't tell me Yuan Lang is targeting Xuanji?

208
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,860
It's no wonder he's trying to wake Xuanji's hidden power.

209
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,642
That old bird is devious indeed.

210
00:13:05,642 --> 00:13:07,726
He even dares to target Little Beauty.

211
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:08,920
This is bad.

212
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,140
Xuanji will be in danger.

213
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,314
I mustn't let him succeed.

214
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,548
You're wrong.

215
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:17,500
I think you should let him succeed.

216
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,638
Why?

217
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:20,239
Although the furnace is immensely powerful,

218
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,700
Yuan Lang can't control it by himself.

219
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,669
If I'm not mistaken,

220
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:28,755
he'll try to lure me with his words. He needs my power.

221
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:31,016
Eldest Brother Wu, are you saying that

222
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:33,181
we should turn his trick against him

223
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:38,481
and destroy the Soul Furnace while we catch him off guard?

224
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:39,790
Yes.

225
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:42,760
He wants to use the furnace, right?

226
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,682
We'll make him understand the consequences

227
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:49,204
and give him a taste of his own medicine.

228
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:53,485
A great plan indeed.

229
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:55,716
Eldest Brother Wu, sorry for the trouble.

230
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:57,199
You don't need to stand on ceremony.

231
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,539
You don't need to deal with him on your own.

232
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,715
I want to settle my debts with him as well.

233
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:08,700
But to make sure we succeed in our plan,

234
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,378
we still need to make him trust us.

235
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:14,905
You'll handle that.

236
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:16,720
I'll handle the fight.

237
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,060
Oh, right.

238
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,979
I said I would grant you three wishes.

239
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:22,254
You only told me one wish. What are the other two wishes?

240
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:23,823
I don't dare to be greedy.

241
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:26,700
Eldest Brother Wu, I'm satisfied with this one wish.

242
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,920
Great!

243
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,551
I love to make friends with people like you.

244
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:31,955
But don't worry.

245
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:33,890
Since I've promised you three wishes,

246
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,670
I will grant all three of them.

247
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,439
It's fine. You can take your time.

248
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,839
Today, we'll drink to our heart's content.

249
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,220
Here.

250
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,560
You are brothers now?

251
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,714
Wu Zhiqi, I thought you needed to drink with someone

252
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:54,314
for at least 10 years before he became your brother?

253
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,851
Can you stay away from me?

254
00:14:57,851 --> 00:14:59,214
No.

255
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,300
Your injuries haven't healed yet. Go back and sleep.

256
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,960
No. I want to look at you.

257
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,360
My injuries will heal faster when I look at you.

258
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:12,913
Fine!

259
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,558
But don't look at me like that.

260
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:16,759
You're really ugly.

261
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:19,573
Turn into a fox and eat your grapes.

262
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:21,278
Why are you so heartless?

263
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,099
I'm also your savior, you know?

264
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,422
You need to grant me three wishes from today onward.

265
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:31,120
First, you can only praise me from now on.

266
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,766
Don't say I'm ugly.

267
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,160
- Annoying. <br> - Heartless person!

268
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,091
- Unreasonable. <br> - You!

269
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,800
What are you laughing at? Are you not used to it?

270
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,456
No.

271
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:47,060
I'm really envious.

272
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,974
I hope every couple in the world will have a happy ending like you two.

273
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:54,580
What happy ending?

274
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,470
Sifeng, listen up. If you spout nonsense like this, I'll leave.

275
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,592
Don't leave!

276
00:15:58,592 --> 00:16:02,400
Little Sifeng, continue. I love it when you say words like these.

277
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,702
You're such a drag. He–

278
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:33,518
- What kind of lousy wine is this? <br> - Wu Zhiqi?

279
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,039
When did you come in?

280
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,674
I'm here to drink and chat with you.

281
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:39,459
What? You don't welcome me?

282
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:42,680
How dare you give me such lousy wine?

283
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,556
I was waiting for you.

284
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:47,376
You made me wait a long time.

285
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,720
This is what you call a wine!

286
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,937
But it's lousier than the ones we drank in the past.

287
00:16:56,938 --> 00:17:00,535
When we were in the Demon Citadel, we enjoyed our lives.

288
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:02,279
We fought the heavens once we finished drinking.

289
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,001
Those were the days.

290
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:07,999
I didn't expect you to still remember our past.

291
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,740
Of course. I was glorious then.

292
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,640
The troops in the heavens were trembling when they saw me.

293
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,780
I almost demolished Mount Kunlun as well.

294
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:21,313
We were so close to success.

295
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:23,929
We would've been the rulers of the three realms

296
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,444
if it weren't for that pesky God of War!

297
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:29,159
That's right.

298
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,090
That damned God of War caught me off guard.

299
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:35,620
I must get my revenge.

300
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,980
If only there's a way to kill her.

301
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,570
- I'll do anything for that. <br> - Is that true?

302
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,830
Yes!

303
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,660
I'll gather all our brothers

304
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,940
and make preparations as long as you're willing to do so.

305
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,518
We'll kill the God of War first.

306
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,809
We'll invade the heavens after that.

307
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:52,180
Great!

308
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,013
I'll use this chance to tell our brothers that

309
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:59,382
I, Wu Zhiqi, have returned, and we'll invade the heavens together!

310
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,861
Nice!

311
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:16,340
My King.

312
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,933
What?

313
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,641
My King, you're not meant to be in the human realm.

314
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:26,994
Now, your human body has reached its limits.

315
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:28,764
You mustn't stay here any longer.

316
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,740
Seems like I don't have much time.

317
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:46,758
I gave her a chance before.

318
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,809
She wanted love.

319
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:51,408
I used love to guide her.

320
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:53,651
But she was obsessed with it.

321
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:56,850
I tried my best to get rid of her obsession,

322
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,080
yet she disobeys me

323
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,701
time and time again.

324
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,034
She's walking towards the dark abyss

325
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,339
and I can't bring her back.

326
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:16,645
Seems like she's not the old "her" anymore.

327
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,500
Now, I'm powerless.

328
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:24,899
I can never guide her back.

329
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:29,220
My King, are you saying that you're going to give up on her?

330
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,987
This tribulation was her last chance,

331
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:36,287
yet she gave up on it.

332
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:38,339
Since that's the case,

333
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,240
instead of witnessing her turning into a demon

334
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,860
and experience endless torture,

335
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:50,365
I would rather destroy her myself.

336
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:51,520
My King,

337
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,365
could you bear to do so?

338
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:57,460
You brought her up on your own!

339
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,540
So what if I can't bear to part with her?

340
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,280
My only concern is the three realms.

341
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,580
This all started because of me.

342
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,393
I should end it personally.

343
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,979
Yuan Lang, I didn't expect you to be so resourceful.

344
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:39,200
You gathered so many of our brothers within a short time.

345
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,600
Brothers, thank you all for being here.

346
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,600
It's all thanks to our Right Lieutenant. He has been planning this for 1,000 years.

347
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,509
And thank you, my brothers.

348
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:53,270
Thank you for helping me.

349
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,740
Here.

350
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,867
Let me give you all a toast.

351
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:59,461
<i>- We've been waiting for you. <br> - We've been waiting for you.</i>

352
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:01,683
<i>- Demon Lord, we'll serve you forever! <br> - Demon Lord, we'll serve you forever!</i>

353
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:02,942
Bottoms up!

354
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,954
In the past,

355
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:15,009
I've neglected our Right Lieutenant and let him down.

356
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:20,280
But now, I know who's truly loyal to me.

357
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,460
Right Lieutenant, I hope you can forget the past.

358
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,640
My Lord, you're too courteous.

359
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,879
In the past, I neglected you because I didn't know your true identity.

360
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,659
Now that the truth has been revealed,

361
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:35,640
My Lord, I will do my best to assist you.

362
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,260
I'm relieved to hear that.

363
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,930
Right Lieutenant had contributed so much to our clan.

364
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:43,735
I should reward him.

365
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,254
In the future, Right Lieutenant

366
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:48,740
will govern Lize Palace.

367
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,535
My Lord, I will do my best.

368
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,060
But now, the thing I hate the most

369
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,141
is that God of War.

370
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:05,712
I truly loved her in the past,

371
00:22:05,713 --> 00:22:10,073
but I didn't expect her to be so heartless.

372
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:13,740
She almost killed me with the Vermilion Bird Bottle.

373
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,194
Since that's the case,

374
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:19,194
I don't need to

375
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:21,740
show her mercy any longer.

376
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,119
That's right.

377
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,860
Now, we just need to retrieve Our Lord's soul.

378
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,308
How about this?

379
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:30,229
Let's attack the Shaoyang Sect.

380
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,780
We'll acquire the Crystal Lamp.

381
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,339
After that, we'll try to force the God of War

382
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:36,559
to unseal the Crystal Lamp. What do you think?

383
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,559
That's too reckless.

384
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,361
I'm afraid it will fail.

385
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,660
Do you have any great ideas then?

386
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,420
Are you able to make her unseal the Crystal Lamp?

387
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,755
Oh right, Yuan Lang! You always come up with the greatest ideas.

388
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:52,668
Why don't you tell us your idea?

389
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,860
My Lord, if you're worried that

390
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,701
the God of War is hard to deal with,

391
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:08,130
I have a formation which you could try.

392
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,343
You have a formation as powerful as that?

393
00:23:11,344 --> 00:23:14,340
Do you need my help?

394
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,499
Sure.

395
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:18,500
If My Lord and Left Lieutenant can assist me in this,

396
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,019
that'll be the best.

397
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:22,547
No problem at all. We're brothers, right?

398
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:23,980
We'll do whatever you say.

399
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,039
My Lord, please give me three days to prepare.

400
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,720
By then, I will make sure you acquire your soul

401
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,577
and recover your strength.

402
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:36,240
And the demon clan will dominate the three realms.

403
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,214
With Right Lieutenant's intellect, I'm sure this plan will succeed.

404
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:43,176
We'll attack the Shaoyang Sect in three days.

405
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:47,037
We'll capture the God of War and retrieve my soul.

406
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,987
This tea is delicious.

407
00:23:57,987 --> 00:24:00,667
Come, have another cup.

408
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:03,432
- The tea is nice. <br> - That's right.

409
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,537
Deputy Chief?

410
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,507
Why are you still standing there?

411
00:24:39,507 --> 00:24:41,380
Do you want to stay here forever?

412
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,901
I'm saving you even though Yu Sifeng might discover us.

413
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:47,521
You know what to do when you get out, right?

414
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,250
Deputy Chief, thank you for saving me.

415
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:55,891
I'll do anything for you.

416
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,608
Great.

417
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:01,877
You may rise now.

418
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:04,897
Keep an eye on Yu Sifeng these few days.

419
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:06,605
I still don't believe him.

420
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,065
I only believe in my men.

421
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:10,450
Yes.

422
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,877
Let's go.

423
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,696
My Lord!

424
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:25,400
My Lord, save me!

425
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,368
My Lord, please save me!

426
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:37,356
I forgot about this.

427
00:25:37,356 --> 00:25:40,540
- Our North Superintendent is still here. <br> - My Lord,

428
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,171
I know it was my fault.

429
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:44,159
I shouldn't have acted on my own accord.

430
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,571
But My Lord, please give me another chance on account of my contributions to Tianxu Hall.

431
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:51,000
This time, I will surely repent!

432
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:54,718
You've said that too many times.

433
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:57,298
I don't know when you're telling the truth.

434
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,919
I won't eat my words this time!

435
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,961
If not, I will suffer a terrible death!

436
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,390
I wanted to kill you a long time ago.

437
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,930
I wanted you to be the last sacrifice for the Soul Furnace.

438
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,505
But now that I think about it,

439
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:13,897
it's more fun for me if I bring you somewhere.

440
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,440
Is this the abandoned Demon Citadel?

441
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,900
Why is it filled with a malignant aura?

442
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,519
1,000 years ago, the Asura clan of the Demon Citadel

443
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,998
was massacred by the God of War.

444
00:26:27,998 --> 00:26:30,844
The heavens demolished the Demon Citadel in one night

445
00:26:30,844 --> 00:26:34,031
and it became deserted.

446
00:26:34,031 --> 00:26:38,163
The vengeful spirits of the Asura clan were stuck here.

447
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,903
That's why it is filled with a malignant aura.

448
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:45,030
Most of the malignant aura had dissipated as Wu Zhiqi

449
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,656
broke the gate.

450
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:50,996
If not, we would have no way to survive in this place.

451
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,374
Why are you here then?

452
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:59,404
What? Are you afraid now?

453
00:26:59,404 --> 00:27:01,474
You're under my control.

454
00:27:01,474 --> 00:27:04,434
You can't escape from me,

455
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,608
and these vengeful spirits will soon be mine.

456
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,640
So, you're trying to absorb the vengeful spirits?

457
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,260
You want to use me as your stepping stone?

458
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,252
No way!

459
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,560
General Asura, we're comrades. Are we not?

460
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,795
Please lend me your body.

461
00:28:11,795 --> 00:28:16,535
I'll use it to appease your 1,000-year-old hatred.

462
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:54,269
With my soul,

463
00:28:55,479 --> 00:29:00,539
I summon yours!

464
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,899
I didn't expect Yuan Lang to still hide information about the formation,

465
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:30,220
even though he mentioned it to us. He's really cunning.

466
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,220
Seems like he doesn't trust us completely.

467
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:38,408
Look at his smug face. It doesn't matter if he trusts us or not.

468
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:41,796
I'm sure he still has some tricks up his sleeves.

469
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:46,350
But it's fine. If he wants to obtain the God of War's power, he needs our help.

470
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,690
He'll take our bait for sure.

471
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,980
<i>Sifeng, I'm relieved that you're doing well.</i>

472
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,590
Little Silver Flower?

473
00:31:18,413 --> 00:31:20,068
Why are you here?

474
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:22,079
You are Tianxu Hall's lackey!

475
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,340
I still haven't settled my debts with you for hurting Sifeng!

476
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,660
Little Silver Flower!

477
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,195
Go away! Don't come near me!

478
00:31:31,195 --> 00:31:33,400
Don't come near me!

479
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:40,060
You can hit me, scold me, or even kill me.

480
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,259
You're welcome to do so, but you've left Sifeng for too long.

481
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:48,020
Your spirit power is very weak now. I need to transfer some qi to you.

482
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,670
You don't need to care about me! I will never believe you again.

483
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,690
I'll kill you.

484
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:59,840
I'll kill you!

485
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,170
Little Silver Flower! Little Silver Flower!

486
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,600
Little Silver Flower!

487
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:35,340
<i>[LIZE PALACE]</i>

488
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,510
You're awake?

489
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,180
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

490
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,980
I was too rash that day. I shouldn't have scolded you like that.

491
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,560
Since you've returned, you should never disobey me again.

492
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,420
If not, I'll punish you severely.

493
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,254
Master, I'll obey your every command, except for things related to Chu Xuanji.

494
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,795
I will never change my mind.

495
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:49,796
If that Chu Xuanji tries to hurt you, I will never let her off.

496
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:54,218
I thought you understood something after you left me,

497
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:59,218
but if you're still insisting on doing so, you shouldn't return to me.

498
00:33:59,218 --> 00:34:02,150
I don't have a spirit beast as willful as you.

499
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:04,640
Spirit beast?

500
00:34:05,774 --> 00:34:10,830
In your eyes, I'm only a spirit beast.

501
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:23,119
Master, I disobeyed your command because I didn't want you to be hurt.

502
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,757
My heart hurts when you suffer time and time again

503
00:34:27,757 --> 00:34:30,430
due to Chu Xuanji.

504
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,900
Because I only have you in my heart.

505
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:41,250
Master, can't you just notice the person who has been around you all the time?

506
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,720
Little Silver Flower, not only are you my spirit beast,

507
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:01,500
you're one of my most important friends as well.

508
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,132
There's nothing else besides that.

509
00:35:05,132 --> 00:35:07,300
If you think I'm too cruel

510
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,900
and you don't know how to face this,

511
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,100
you may leave me.

512
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,570
From today onward, I allow you to leave me

513
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,680
and lead your own life.

514
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:32,419
Fine. Yu Sifeng, you'll regret this.

515
00:35:32,419 --> 00:35:35,777
Just wait and see. I'll find a way to terminate our contract.

516
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:39,360
After that, I won't be your spirit beast!

517
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,700
My Lord.

518
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:11,599
Deputy Chief, is your formation ready?

519
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,099
I'm here to tell you just that. Everything is ready.

520
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:19,338
My Lord, we just need you to lure Chu Xuanji into the formation.

521
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:23,879
Good. Tomorrow, you and I will attack the Shaoyang Sect

522
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:25,840
and retrieve my soul.

523
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:29,899
But My Lord, if we want to obtain the God of War's power,

524
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:32,239
we need to harm Chu Xuanji.

525
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,530
My Lord, are you really willing to harm her?

526
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:44,810
I've shown her mercy, yet she has tried to take my life time and time again.

527
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,640
If Left Lieutenant didn't save me that day,

528
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,435
the Vermilion Bird Bottle would've killed me.

529
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:53,392
I will seek my revenge.

530
00:36:53,392 --> 00:37:00,300
I'm willing to kill her for this.

531
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,320
Tomorrow, during our attack,

532
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:19,240
- you should make sure Chu Xuanji falls into our formation. <br> - Yes.

533
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,959
And although Yu Sifeng is acting according to our plan,

534
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,370
I need to make sure that our plan is foolproof.

535
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,270
You're pretty tough.

536
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,428
You even became a half-demon.

537
00:37:56,428 --> 00:38:01,060
You're a human, yet you're trying to acquire demon power?

538
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,340
I don't want you to die on account of

539
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,790
you surviving the Black Pool.

540
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,300
I've stabilized the demon power inside your body.

541
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,690
How about this?

542
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:34,903
Coincidentally, I lack someone who can watch over the vengeful spirits.

543
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:37,481
Follow me and acquire the Crystal Lamp.

544
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,820
After you accomplish your mission,

545
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,640
I'll teach you how to master your power. What do you think?

546
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,240
Is that for real?

547
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,820
I'm the Right Lieutenant. I'm not an imbecile like you.

548
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,065
You'll die anyway.

549
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:57,680
It depends on you whether to cherish this chance or not.

550
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,460
<i>[SHAOYANG SECT]</i>

551
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,660
Xuanji, help me out. Which one of them is better?

552
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,780
Xuanji?

553
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,920
Xuanji.

554
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,090
What's wrong?

555
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,594
You were supposed to get married to Senior Hao Chen.

556
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:39,478
Why did you reject the wedding?

557
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:43,079
If not, we could've been married on the same day.

558
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,500
Senior Hao Chen is my senior.

559
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,849
He's the person I respect the most,

560
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:52,597
but that's all there is to it.

561
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,430
You still can't let go of the past?

562
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,238
No.

563
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,210
It's just that you're going to get married. I can't bear to part with you.

564
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,891
It's fine.

565
00:40:07,891 --> 00:40:12,766
Xuanji, anyway, I believe that you can find someone who loves you

566
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:15,389
and deserves your love.

567
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:17,167
Just like Little Six and I.

568
00:40:17,168 --> 00:40:22,170
Anyway, you should stop thinking about sad things, okay?

569
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,876
Okay. It's almost time.

570
00:40:26,876 --> 00:40:29,660
You should doll yourself up.

571
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,710
I'll check on the decorations.

572
00:40:46,431 --> 00:40:47,870
Sifeng?

573
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,120
<i>[Shaoyang]</i>

574
00:41:17,748 --> 00:41:19,550
Prepare the formation.

575
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,380
The vengeful spirits of Asura have awakened.

576
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,500
Shaoyang Sect,

577
00:42:22,996 --> 00:42:28,330
I will get back what you have taken from me!

578
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,620
Deputy Chief is all set to go. Let's start.

579
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,490
Attack the Shaoyang Sect!

580
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,740
God of War, your power is mine now.

581
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,820
Sifeng, it'll be too late for you if you don't quit!

582
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,540
Do you think I would still fall for your trick?

583
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,260
You want me to show you mercy? In your dreams.

584
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,760
This time, I won't show you any mercy.

585
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,460
Demon Lord, save your breath.

586
00:43:27,945 --> 00:43:29,630
Set up the formation.

587
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,182
Purple Fox?

588
00:43:41,182 --> 00:43:44,130
My illusion spell is pretty good, right?

589
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,460
You plotted this together?

590
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,223
Plot? You're the master of plots.

591
00:43:55,223 --> 00:43:58,403
We're just using your own trick against you.

592
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:01,940
Yuan Lang, you underestimated me.

593
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,999
Do you think I don't know what you're up to if you hide everything from me?

594
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:08,935
What do you think? I just altered some parts,

595
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:12,825
and now, you're the one being absorbed. Are you surprised?

596
00:44:12,825 --> 00:44:14,871
He who is unjust is doomed to destruction.

597
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:17,059
Since you've created the Soul Furnace,

598
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:21,130
you'll have a taste of your own medicine today.

599
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,336
Yuan Lang, stop struggling.

600
00:44:29,337 --> 00:44:33,120
You created the Soul Furnace yourself. It has absorbed 99 souls.

601
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,638
It has absorbed the malignant aura as well. It is immensely powerful.

602
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:39,450
I'm afraid you can't escape with your weak powers.

603
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:30,180
<i>Strange. Why do I see this tree everywhere I go?</i>

604
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,400
Who's behind this? Dingkun Sword!

605
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:42,630
Don't slash me! My god! Please show me mercy!

606
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,460
Eldest Brother Liu? Why are you here?

607
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,570
Why did you trap me here?

608
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,659
It's... I...

609
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:54,960
Did Sifeng ask you to come? Where is he?

610
00:45:56,718 --> 00:46:00,799
You two should settle your own problems.

611
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,520
Sifeng!

612
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,330
Si... You...
