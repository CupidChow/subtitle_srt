18
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,200
I wanted to pass this position to Elder Luo.

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,840
Eldest Brother Liu, why did you stop me?

20
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,760
If I didn't stop you,

21
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,580
I'd have to see you bang your head on the wall,

22
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,465
put a Lover's Curse on yourself,

23
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:53,980
and pretend to be the Devil Star until you're half-dead.

24
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,359
Now, I even have to see you pass all your duties to someone

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,359
and find a place to die alone.

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,280
Isn't that what you're thinking, Little Phoenix?

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,110
The power of the Juntain Hoop and Cehai Hook

28
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,720
are raging within me.

29
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,200
- I don't know how long I can last. <br> - So, you're worried that you might succumb to the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook's powers,

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,599
and the powers would render you into pieces.

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,180
Even when you die, the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook may fall into the wrong hands

32
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,479
and cause the soul of the Devil Star to be released.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,300
By then, Xuanji will become an Asura zombie herself.

34
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,679
That's why you have to stay away from Xuanji

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,100
even when you die, right?

36
00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:40,600
Fine.

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,380
While I was tidying up just now,

38
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,420
I found a Heartless Pill left by your father.

39
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,420
Since you're letting go of her,

40
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,479
you should take this potion to end this once and for all.

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,240
You can start again.

42
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,740
No... No...

43
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,460
No!

44
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,700
Xuanji.

45
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,340
Xuanji, you're awake. How are you feeling?

46
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,040
Stinky woman.

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,960
Why...

48
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,020
wasn't I at the secret ground destroying the soul of the Devil Star?

49
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,900
- Why am I... <br> - You passed out from exhaustion.

50
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,160
Father has resealed the Crystal Lamp.

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,560
Was it Father who resealed it?

52
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,520
Why do I recall

53
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,159
seeing Sifeng?

54
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,180
Why? You must be confused.

55
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,740
You fainted at the secret ground and Father resealed the Crystal Lamp.

56
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,220
Then, Teng She brought you out.

57
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,600
Ask him if you don't believe me.

58
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,420
Right, Teng She?

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,140
Is that what happened?

60
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,670
Don't you even know what you've seen?

61
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,459
I was probably hallucinating.

62
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,260
Xuanji,

63
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,959
Father and I didn't know

64
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,580
that destroying the contents of the Crystal Lamp would cost your life.

65
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,939
Had we known that, we wouldn't have let you go.

66
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,200
Promise me this.

67
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,979
Don't neglect your well-being, okay?

68
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:37,060
Yes, and I need to tell you this.

69
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,979
You can't destroy the soul of the Devil Star.

70
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,459
Senior Hao Chen got it all wrong.

71
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:43,520
Don't do this again.

72
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,260
Got it?

73
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,960
He got it wrong?

74
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,580
Little Fox, where's my booze?

75
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,320
Little Fox!

76
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,980
Little Fox! Little Fox.

77
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,800
Here.

78
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,060
Marvelous wine!

79
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,380
One jar isn't enough.

80
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,580
It's not? There's more in Lize Palace's cellars.

81
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,179
Little Sifeng brought the palace's disciples away,

82
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,940
and the demons in Tianxu Hall are gone.

83
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,720
You have more than enough wine to last you for your entire life.

84
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,920
That would be wonderful.

85
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,960
Little Fox,

86
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,179
don't you find Sifeng weird?

87
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:53,360
You see, he finally made it back here

88
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,740
and he's already occupied.

89
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,620
It's not easy to be a human or a demon.

90
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,200
That's why you should live happily and freely.

91
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,380
Why must you care so much about other people's feelings?

92
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,019
And he just had to choose something no one would do

93
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:08,220
until he's miserable and glum.

94
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,080
I don't understand him.

95
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,420
Yes...

96
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,440
Yes, you wouldn't understand him.

97
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,660
After all, freedom matters the most to you.

98
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,600
You'll never understand.

99
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,020
For some humans and demons,

100
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,620
there are things more important than freedom.

101
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,340
So what if it brings misery?

102
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,560
He did it willingly.

103
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,319
We're missing some food to go with the wine.

104
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,180
I'm going to get some food.

105
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,179
Stinky woman, why are you here again?

106
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:09,980
Are you still trying to destroy the soul of the Devil Star?

107
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,020
Before Senior Hao Chen died,

108
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,259
he kept reminding me to destroy the Crystal Lamp,

109
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:17,160
but I haven't done so yet.

110
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,100
And I don't know why, but the more I want to destroy it,

111
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,340
the more my heart aches.

112
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:28,679
And I think I saw the moment when the soul of the Devil Star was taken out.

113
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:31,400
You saw it?

114
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,759
It wasn't clear.

115
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,020
I only saw some shadows.

116
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,840
But I can clearly feel the pain when the Devil Star had his soul ripped off.

117
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,580
How strange.

118
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,320
Maybe it's because you're somehow connected to him.

119
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,760
Is it because I killed the Devil Star and sealed his soul?

120
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,440
But I don't think that's the case.

121
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,100
Or perhaps the Devil Star has possessed my mind.

122
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,860
I think I dreamed about Sifeng.

123
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,299
Perhaps I wasn't strong enough.

124
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:13,079
That's why I couldn't fulfill Senior Hao Chen's wish.

125
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,699
As long as the soul of the Devil Star remains,

126
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,740
the three realms will remain threatened.

127
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,959
I'm going to try again.

128
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,460
No, you can't. You'll die.

129
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,999
You'll die, get it?

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,860
Sacrificing for the people is my destiny.

131
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,136
Besides, I don't want Sifeng to become the Demon Lord.

132
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:32,560
Who told you Sifeng would become the Demon Lord?

133
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,259
Who said you have to die to save the world?

134
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:36,520
Destiny, you say?

135
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,268
I thought you never believed in destiny.

136
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,340
So your senior blurted some nonsense before he died,

137
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,899
and you're going to bang your head on the wall?

138
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,440
Teng She!

139
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,340
I am just speaking the truth.

140
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,100
Your senior is dead.

141
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,879
Does that make his words truthful?

142
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,759
Well, the soul of the Devil Star has not been released.

143
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,999
But even if the soul returns to its body,

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,519
will he really go on a killing spree in the three realms

145
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,760
and endanger the people?

146
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,100
Is there something you know?

147
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,700
I only know that the story about the Devil Star ending the world is just speculation.

148
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,459
No one knows what the Devil Star will do.

149
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:14,140
Not even the Heavenly Emperor knows!

150
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,840
The Devil Star hasn't done anything yet.

151
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,265
Why is he seen as the doom of the world and sentenced to eternal damnation?

152
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:24,899
Why are you sacrificing yourself for something that hasn't happened yet?

153
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,589
Your senior must have told you to take precautions

154
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,590
and end everything before it starts,

155
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:35,410
even if it's very likely that it won't even happen.

156
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,839
But Senior Hao Chen always said that

157
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,020
the appearance of the Devil Star is sure to bring disaster.

158
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,780
He's just using your trust to make you do the things he deemed right!

159
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,460
Xuanji, the Crystal Lamp has been resealed.

160
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,700
There's no danger anymore, so...

161
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,780
Teng She, is my father really capable of sealing the Crystal Lamp?

162
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,060
I must see for myself.

163
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,860
<i>Forget it.</i>

164
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,340
<i>Why keep it a secret?</i>

165
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,600
<i>She has to know some day.</i>

166
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,640
What is this?

167
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,700
Isn't this the seal of the Rose Gold Bird?

168
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,140
You almost perished with the soul of the Devil Star.

169
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,500
It was he who saved you

170
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,100
and depleted all his powers to reseal the Crystal Lamp.

171
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,700
That was a huge blow to his health.

172
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,360
Everyone hoped you wouldn't know about this,

173
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,560
Sifeng included.

174
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,880
So it wasn't a dream.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,320
But why did he do that?

176
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,800
Isn't he the Devil Star?

177
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,140
Wouldn't he want to open the Crystal Lamp?

178
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,820
<i>I am not the Devil Star.</i>

179
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,480
<i>I have never harmed anyone.</i>

180
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,609
<i>I am here today to kill Yuan Lang.</i>

181
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,420
<i>Shut up!</i>

182
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,080
<i>Sifeng!</i>

183
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,560
No.

184
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,559
He killed my master.

185
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,939
He killed Senior Hao Chen. He injured Aunt Yinghong.

186
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:20,880
But no one has ever seen him in action, right?

187
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,640
I think there must be some misunderstanding,

188
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,540
but it's a fact that he's not the Devil Star.

189
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,139
He pretended to be the Devil Star to remove Yuan Lang from the picture.

190
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:36,910
After all, our biggest threat wasn't the unseen Devil Star,

191
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,700
but the nefarious Yuan Lang.

192
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,359
Is that so?

193
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,905
So, which part of him convinced you that he was the Devil Star?

194
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:50,189
He took down our biggest enemy and risked his life to reseal the Crystal Lamp.

195
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:52,320
The Crystal Lamp is stable now.

196
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,020
I don't know.

197
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:59,080
I think there are many things that you will have to clarify.

198
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,380
- Father. <br> - You just woke up. What are you doing here now?

199
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,625
I need to go to Lize Palace.

200
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,980
I need to ask Sifeng something.

201
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:11,799
No need.

202
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,500
They have left their palace.

203
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,679
I've asked Min Xing to scout around.

204
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,100
All the barriers surrounding Lize Palace have been removed.

205
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,039
Only an empty palace remains.

206
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,399
All the Rose Gold Bird Demons are missing now.

207
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,700
I don't know if Lize Palace is truly giving up

208
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,399
or hiding themselves to plot a bigger conspiracy.

209
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,160
Then I have to go there!

210
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,560
Master!

211
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,959
Master,

212
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,900
a disciple saw Wu Tong around Mount Buzhou.

213
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,620
Wu Tong?

214
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,300
Did Yu Sifeng bring his horde of demons back to Mount Buzhou?

215
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,820
Keep a closer eye on him.

216
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,140
Remember, Linglong must not know about this.

217
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,019
Well... Linglong has left.

218
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,310
She said she wants to kill Wu Tong herself.

219
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,900
What? That's preposterous!

220
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,700
She is no match for Wu Tong!

221
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,719
Father, don't worry. I'll bring Linglong back here.

222
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,260
She couldn't have reached Mount Buzhou by now.

223
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,580
Maybe not.

224
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,780
Minyan left a Black and White Ring on Wu Tong back then.

225
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,340
That means she can access Mount Buzhou easily.

226
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,300
Let go of me!

227
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,960
You're finally here.

228
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,680
I've been waiting for you.

229
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,820
I've been wandering around Mount Buzhou for the past few days.

230
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,340
I knew you'd come when you knew that I was here.

231
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,920
Your face tells me that

232
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,620
Zhong Minyan is dead.

233
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,900
He won't die.

234
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,340
Only you will.

235
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,240
To think you're here for me even when he's not dead yet.

236
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,000
Are you so eager to see me?

237
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,240
After all, we used to be so happy together.

238
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,580
You only cared about me.

239
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,620
No one but me.

240
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,480
You'd whisper sweet nothings into my ears every day.

241
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,540
That wasn't... That wasn't me!

242
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,400
What's the point of denying the truth?

243
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,959
You still can't escape from my hands.

244
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,880
Aren't you right beside me now?

245
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,640
I'm going to make you wear a bridal veil today

246
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,280
and marry you.

247
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,280
Don't rush.

248
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,900
When our bridal room is ready,

249
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,200
we will have enough time to spend the rest of our lives together.

250
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,220
Wu Tong,

251
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,280
today is the day you die.

252
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,740
There's a Lightning Formation under your feet.

253
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,990
Do you think a mere Lightning Formation can kill me?

254
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,880
Yes, a normal formation is nothing to you.

255
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,640
But what if I sacrifice myself

256
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,800
to summon a Thunderous Calamity?

257
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,020
Wu Tong, judging from our powers,

258
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,620
a Thunderous Calamity should be enough to reduce us to ashes.

259
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,860
You're going to die!

260
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,160
You–

261
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,119
Don't you dare go anywhere.

262
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,000
Are you taking yourself down too just to kill me?

263
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,620
Fine.

264
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,839
That's fair enough.

265
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,380
Since I can't be with you in this life,

266
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,220
I'm satisfied enough to die with you.

267
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,980
A Thunderous Calamity? Something is up.

268
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,760
Keep your guard up. The gate is opening.

269
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,466
Look!

270
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:05,400
Who's there?

271
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,780
Forget about that! Let's go!

272
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,190
- Lord Teng She. <br> - Lord Teng She.

273
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,079
It's me.

274
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,700
Surprised? Happy to see me?

275
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,720
Shen Shu. Yu Lu.

276
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,560
Are you two up for a round of entertainment with me?

277
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,540
A Thunderous Calamity.

278
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,459
Linglong! Linglong!

279
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,700
Linglong! Linglong!

280
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,820
- Xuanji. <br> - Let's go.

281
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,580
Linglong, why did you do this?

282
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,820
Hadn't I made it here in time, you'd be...

283
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,260
Why did you do this?

284
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,860
Are you leaving me and Father behind?

285
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:06,240
What about Sixth Senior?

286
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,420
Don't you care about him anymore?

287
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,680
Minyan...

288
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,280
He probably won't wake up anymore.

289
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,260
We vowed to live and die together,

290
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,320
so this is just another means to do so.

291
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,780
Live together...

292
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,420
<i>The sword pierced through his heart meridian.</i>

293
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,220
<i>Any normal human would have died on the spot.</i>

294
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,140
<i>Everything is predestined, force does you no good.</i>

295
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,460
<i>I'm still going to force it.</i>

296
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,740
<i>I must save him.</i>

297
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,720
<i>As long as a shred of hope remains, I must save him.</i>

298
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,719
<i>If he lives, that will be wonderful.</i>

299
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,280
<i>If he doesn't, I will die with him.</i>

300
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,560
But what am I doing now?

301
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,100
Wu Tong,

302
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,159
let's settle our scores once and for all.

303
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,240
Where are your men?

304
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,560
Where are the demons of Tianxu Hall and Lize Palace?

305
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,559
I thought your lover, Yu Sifeng, disbanded the demons in Tianxu Hall.

306
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,070
Yuan Lang plotted for thousands of years to throw the three realms into chaos,

307
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:15,010
and Yu Sifeng stopped his plans. Didn't you know?

308
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,380
You're a clever lady, God of War.

309
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,800
Even when Yu Sifeng was the Devil Star,

310
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,680
he wouldn't open the Crystal Lamp.

311
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,000
He would rather end his life to be with you.

312
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,300
Lies!

313
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
Linglong,

314
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,220
what Wu Tong said is the same as Teng She's speculation.

315
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,599
Did Sifeng do all that because of Yuan Lang?

316
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,900
Don't tell me we've misunderstood Sifeng all this time.

317
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,280
Tell me. Where are Sifeng and his followers?

318
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,660
How would I know?

319
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,119
He wants to kill me, I should be avoiding him.

320
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,420
But why are you in the dark, too?

321
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,640
Didn't he look for you?

322
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,160
Don't tell me that when he killed Yuan Lang,

323
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,880
he killed himself as well.

324
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,020
Perhaps living as a murderous Demon Lord means nothing.

325
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,000
When you don't have that one person you want,

326
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,120
everything is dull.

327
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,320
I'm killing you today!

328
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,900
Linglong!

329
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,100
What's going on?

330
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,780
Two humans are fighting in Mount Buzhou.

331
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,340
So are you dazed or blind?

332
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,640
I–

333
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,580
If I were you,

334
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,440
I would have ignored these two humans, me

335
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,340
and the God of War herself,

336
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,319
so I wouldn't have to report to the heavens about you neglecting your duties.

337
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,160
What did you say?

338
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,720
Isn't killing me enough to appease your anger?

339
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,040
You deserve to be cut into pieces!

340
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,000
You look nice even when you hate me.

341
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,800
Why do I only understand now that what I want

342
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,320
is not eradicating the sects

343
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,320
or taking revenge on everyone, but

344
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,380
having you look at me.

345
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,620
Since the first time I met you,

346
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,800
I've always wanted to attract your gaze.

347
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,580
My Lord, the gate to Fenru City is wide open.

348
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,980
If they don't leave now,

349
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,100
they will be sucked into the oblivion of Fenru City

350
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,560
or even stuck there forever.

351
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,740
That's it?

352
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,360
Oh no.

353
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,080
Let go of me!

354
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,140
Wu Tong, let go of me!

355
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:11,120
Let go of me!

356
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,420
Let go of me!

357
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,080
Let go of me!

358
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,500
Let go of me, Wu Tong!

359
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,280
I've never understood the meaning of life.

360
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,380
I was fixated on taking revenge.

361
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,380
Now that I'm dying, I finally understand.

362
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,919
- Let go! <br> - I've always wanted you.

363
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,019
Let go of me! I'm not dying with you! Let go of me!

364
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,240
Let go of me! I'm not dying with you!

365
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,680
Stinky woman.

366
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,600
Let go of me!

367
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,200
Linglong!

368
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,320
Xuanji!

369
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,559
Xuanji!

370
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,460
- Xuanji! <br> - Linglong.

371
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,380
Xuanji!

372
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,660
<i>Why aren't you crying, Miss?</i>

373
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,020
<i>Don't you have something you're holding onto?</i>

374
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,080
<i>What's there to hold onto?</i>

375
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,540
<i>I had nothing but a boring life.</i>

376
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,760
<i>Forget it.</i>

377
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,000
<i>You should forget it.</i>

378
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:45,690
♫ <i>Were colored with sorry, joy, or tears</i> ♫

379
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:52,910
♫ <i>Just the thought of this, my tears suddenly stopped</i> ♫

380
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,900
<i>It's the River of Forgetting.</i>

381
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,200
<i>That was Sifeng.</i>

382
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,100
<i>You're weird for a music instructor.</i>

383
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,260
<i>Are you in love with me?</i>

384
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,860
<i>I–</i>

385
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,099
<i>I have never seen love.</i>

386
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:16,319
<i>and I don't believe love exists.</i>

387
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,060
<i>You said you don't believe in love.</i>

388
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,220
<i>This time, I'll take this gamble for myself.</i>

389
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,840
<i>I'm betting on you.</i>

390
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,300
<i>Let's see if you'll remember me.</i>

391
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,320
<i>How will you know?</i>

392
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,980
<i>By seeking this drop of blood so you can ask me after you die?</i>

393
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,540
<i>You have committed treason by owning private troops</i>

394
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,620
<i>and engaging in nepotism.</i>

395
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,119
<i>Am I supposed to cover for you, Prince Xin?</i>

396
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,480
<i>I conquered the kingdom,</i>

397
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,060
<i>consolidated your power,</i>

398
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,260
<i>and protected the nation for you.</i>

399
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,520
<i>In the end, one word from you nullifies everything I did.</i>

400
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,780
<i>Thy name is unpredictable.</i>

401
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:09,260
<i>Your Majesty, I hope you will trust those who can be trusted,</i>

402
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,000
<i>or else it will be miserable for you.</i>

403
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,280
<i>I will give you</i>

404
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,760
<i>everything you want.</i>

405
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,259
<i>Are you really giving me your eyes even when it's forbidden?</i>

406
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:30,960
<i>You were born into a family of sorcerers.</i>

407
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,700
<i>If you can't study spells and become a full-fledged sorceress,</i>

408
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,040
<i>you will be burned. I don't want to see you die.</i>

409
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,059
<i>Even if that's the case,</i>

410
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,719
<i>I won't remember you.</i>

411
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,040
<i>I just want you to live to your fullest.</i>

412
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,420
<i>Don't worry.</i>

413
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,780
<i>I will find a far place to die.</i>

414
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,420
<i>We will not meet again in this life.</i>

415
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,700
<i>I see you as my confidant.</i>

416
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,260
<i>Why do you want to kill me?</i>

417
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,820
<i>Someone is paying me for your life.</i>

418
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,980
<i>When you die, I will be free.</i>

419
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,320
<i>Why?</i>

420
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,500
<i>I hope that after I die,</i>

421
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,660
<i>you won't forget about me.</i>

422
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,400
<i>Dream on.</i>

423
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,520
<i>Why should I remember you?</i>

424
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,799
<i>So that's what he meant when he said I hurt him for the past nine lives.</i>

425
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,720
<i>To think I even guaranteed I'd treat him differently this life.</i>

426
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,360
<i>Yet I disappointed him again.</i>

427
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,999
<i>No, I can't continue wallowing in here.</i>

428
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,760
<i>I need to get answers from Sifeng!</i>

429
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,999
<i>You hate the heavens for wrecking your life.</i>

430
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,599
<i>All you have in your mind is revenge, right?</i>

431
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:27,440
<i>Do you think I'll forgive the heavens</i>

432
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,179
<i>for doing this to me?</i>

433
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,040
<i>Execute her!</i>

434
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,640
<i>That's right. You shouldn't die here.</i>

435
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,200
<i>I shall bring you to Fenru City so you can enter the mortal world.</i>

436
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,419
<i>Then, the heavens cannot hurt you anymore.</i>

437
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:08,120
<i>No!</i>

438
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,920
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

439
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,420
<i>I shall use my life to release you</i>

440
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,700
<i>from your pain and anger,</i>

441
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,520
<i>and make up for the wrongs the heavens have done to you.</i>

442
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,380
<i>Sifeng. Sifeng!</i>

443
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,600
Stinky woman, are you okay?

444
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,420
How are you feeling?

445
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,099
<i>Tell me. When can I finally retire from war?</i>

446
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,850
♫ <i> You are the hill to my heart </i> ♫

447
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,440
♫ <i> Cannot be moved with time </i> ♫

448
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:37,050
♫ <i> You are the breeze between my lips, <br> blowing away the sorrow on the sea of clouds </i> ♫

449
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:48,770
♫ <i> Moves my soul, build my gentleness and become immortal </i> ♫

450
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:56,260
♫ <i> I'm willing to fall to this state, <br> willing to bear this thousand years wait </i> ♫

451
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:03,550
♫ <i> The dream you gave me is sufficient, <br> I've been happy for a long time </i> ♫

452
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:10,700
♫ <i> The upheaval of the heart, flows in all directions <br>Can't help but reach out a hand out to yearning</i> ♫

453
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,120
<i>So he has always been with me.</i>

454
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,699
<i>He has been with me since I was in the heavens.</i>

455
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,419
<i>Yet he gave everything up</i>

456
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:21,599
<i>to redeem me through ten lives in the mortal world.</i>

457
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,880
<i>I was the one who dragged him down.</i>

458
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,020
<i>And not only did I forget everything, I hurt him time and again.</i>

459
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,959
What are you thinking about?

460
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:34,320
I saw everything.

461
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,419
When I was relegated to the mortal world,

462
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,619
it was King Bailing who erased all my memories.

463
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:40,819
Even the Mirror of Origin couldn't show me my memories.

464
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,399
Why did he do that?

465
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,020
The heavens have their own way of doing things.

466
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,659
They have their considerations.

467
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:48,400
Considerations?

468
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,380
I am just a toy for those in the heavens.

469
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,699
Let's not talk about this now.

470
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:57,040
Didn't you see anything else down there?

471
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,500
Sifeng.

472
00:34:06,851 --> 00:34:10,151
Sifeng. Sifeng.

473
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:16,200
I saw it. When I was in the heavens and the mortal world,

474
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,139
even when I was utterly betrayed and abandoned,

475
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:25,380
only Sifeng gave me his all to help me.

476
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,940
How would a person like him ever betray me?

477
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,240
Teng She, I was wrong.

478
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,300
I have been wrong all along, right?

479
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:48,833
By the way, when I sent Linglong back to Shaoyang Sect, I met Ting Nu.

480
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:52,270
He said it was Sifeng who told him to come to save Zhong Minyan.

481
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,558
Then Ting Nu knows where Sifeng is.

482
00:34:55,558 --> 00:34:57,740
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

483
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,039
Little Six!

484
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,239
Little Six!

485
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,840
Linglong.

486
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,020
I knew you wouldn't leave me.

487
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,659
Even if you're abandoning me, I'll look for you in heaven and hell.

488
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,599
I haven't married my wife yet.

489
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,580
I'm not going anywhere.

490
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,860
What happened?

491
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,580
I went to Mount Buzhou to confront Wu Tong.

492
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,979
He's dead now.

493
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:53,899
Our nightmare has ended.

494
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:56,740
I won't do anything silly again.

495
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,320
Everything is over now.

496
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,379
My wife, I have never felt that you were silly.

497
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:08,540
You're the silly guy here!

498
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,939
Sixth Senior.

499
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:11,740
Xuanji.

500
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,159
Teng She said you were fine,

501
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,500
but I can only be relieved when I see you myself.

502
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,959
I'm fine.

503
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,139
I'm also glad that Sixth Senior is safe now.

504
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:24,319
All of you keep giving me headaches.

505
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,560
Behave yourselves from now on.

506
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,260
Minyan, take care and recuperate.

507
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,399
I owe you yet another favor.

508
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,420
I am truly grateful.

509
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,739
No need to thank me.

510
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:45,680
I came here on behalf of a friend.

511
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,400
Ting Nu,

512
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,900
do you mean Sifeng?

513
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,559
Other than saving your Sixth Senior,

514
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,359
he also had two other requests for me.

515
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,019
First, he wants me to inform you that the Tianxu Hall demons have disbanded.

516
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,439
He has no control over the demons anymore,

517
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,603
but he can guarantee that the Rose Gold Bird

518
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:11,500
will never engage in battle with the mortals and cultivation sects.

519
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,519
Mere words do not mean much.

520
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,740
Yes, only time will tell.

521
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,980
Second, he asked me to give this pill to Elder Chu.

522
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,419
This pill is rare indeed.

523
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:28,280
It can rebuild your health so you can regain your spiritual powers.

524
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,260
Everyone, I shall take my leave.

525
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,659
Auntie Yinghon, don't be angry.

526
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:41,379
I just want to ask you

527
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:45,280
if you have clearly seen the person who injured you.

528
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,720
To be frank, I did not see my attacker clearly.

529
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,379
I only know he must be from Lize Palace.

530
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:04,700
Back then, only Yu Sifeng was there.

531
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,999
No,

532
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,439
Ruo Yu was also there.

533
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,779
Sifeng said that he was trapped within the barriers

534
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:13,200
when he was pursuing Ruo Yu.

535
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,919
Back then, we didn't believe him.

536
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,119
But when Wu Tong attacked our sect, I saw Ruo Yu

537
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,559
and he admitted to me that he was the one

538
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,120
who injured Auntie Ying Hong and trespassed the secret ground.

539
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,380
Sifeng wasn't lying.

540
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,879
I misunderstood him.

541
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,199
So, what Wu Tong said before he died was true.

542
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,739
Sifeng never intended to unseal the Crystal Lamp

543
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:37,640
to wreak havoc upon the three realms.

544
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,419
Everything he did was to destroy Yuan Lang's plot.

545
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,020
He–

546
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,139
Sifeng said he was not the Devil Star.

547
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:47,119
But I never believed him.

548
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,959
He said he'd handle everything and answer me one day,

549
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,179
but I only believed in what I saw.

550
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:56,159
I didn't listen to his explanation.

551
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,499
- I was even angry... <br> - Xuanji.

552
00:38:57,499 --> 00:39:01,060
I was angry that he deceived me and went against my wishes.

553
00:39:02,188 --> 00:39:03,920
Ting Nu.

554
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:06,973
Ting Nu!

555
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,819
You knew Xuanji's senior wasn't killed by Sifeng.

556
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:21,680
Why didn't you tell them?

557
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,800
Easy for you to say, but what about me?

558
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,960
My celestial eye saw it.

559
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,319
It was the Asura form of Yuan Lang who killed Xuanji's senior.

560
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,019
Little Phoenix was there to save him.

561
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:36,720
In the end, he was betrayed instead.

562
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,259
For whom did he do that?

563
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:40,220
That stupid girl, of course.

564
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,099
He ran all the way there to save her senior,

565
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:45,059
and now he's slapped with a baseless accusation.

566
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:47,300
No one will believe me now.

567
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,779
Chu Xuanji's senior was a scoundrel.

568
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:51,179
What a weird guy he was.

569
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:53,659
He knew very well that he was attacked by Yuan Lang,

570
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:56,540
but he put the blame on Little Phoenix.

571
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,497
I now see that those unreasonable barbarians in the Shaoyang Sect

572
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,438
are trying to pin Little Phoenix down!

573
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,400
Eldest Brother Liu!

574
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,380
Eldest Brother Liu, what did you say?

575
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,480
You heard everything?

576
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,400
Is it important anyway?

577
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,100
Little Phoenix is being maligned now.

578
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,059
- Are you happy? <br> - Yihuan.

579
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:20,860
Is it true that Sifeng didn't kill my senior?

580
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,660
You saw it?

581
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,699
What is this?

582
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:28,700
Not only did I see it, I saw it as clear as day.

583
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,559
Then, why did my senior malign Sifeng?

584
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,879
How would I know?

585
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,760
Don't you know how prejudiced your senior was towards demons?

586
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,399
He probably just wanted to harm as many demons as he could.

587
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,759
Let's go, Ting Nu.

588
00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:41,139
What a lousy place this is!

589
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,019
If it weren't for Sifeng's request, I wouldn't have come here for the rest of my life.

590
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:45,219
- Eldest Brother Liu. <br> - Yihuan.

591
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:47,119
Tell me where Sifeng is.

592
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,820
You care about him?

593
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,759
Lize Palace is empty now.

594
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,139
The Rose Gold Birds have decided to disappear from the mortal world.

595
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:54,979
I don't know where they are either.

596
00:40:54,979 --> 00:40:57,979
It's good anyway. At least you people won't pester them anymore.

597
00:40:57,979 --> 00:41:00,039
They left? Why?

598
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,920
Did Sifeng leave, too?

599
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,979
He doesn't want to see me? Doesn't he care about me anymore?

600
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:05,479
Isn't that good?

601
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,359
I was blind enough to unite you two.

602
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,679
Yu Sifeng's Lover's Curse has activated twice.

603
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,359
The third time will mean death.

604
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,319
Ending this relationship will keep his life.

605
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,219
Lover's Curse? What is that?

606
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:18,460
Why is it that I don't know anything about it?

607
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,719
You don't know anything,

608
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,840
and you're still asking why.

609
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,219
Let's go, Ting Nu.

610
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:31,159
Yihuan, just tell Xuanji everything you know.

611
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,300
Even if they have to part, let's make this a clean cut.

612
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,759
Fine, I'll tell you.

613
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,760
I'll tell you what Yu Sifeng has done for you.

614
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,420
The Lover's Mask is the most brutal torture in Lize Palace.

615
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,319
When people meet the love of their lives,

616
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,240
they would rather kill themselves than wear the Lover's Curse Mask.

617
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,999
That's because any feelings of love

618
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,200
will cause an irremovable mask to form.

619
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,120
Three letdowns in love will end the wearer's life.

620
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,380
<i>Little Phoenix couldn't bear to leave you alone.</i>

621
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,820
<i>He was locked up and tortured in the Tower of Oblivion for an entire year.</i>

622
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,519
<i>In the end, your indifference towards him</i>

623
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,020
<i>made him wear the Lover's Curse Mask so he can be free.</i>

624
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,199
<i>After he was released, he was supposed to stay away from you.</i>

625
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,399
<i>But you kept clinging onto him.</i>

626
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,300
<i>Sifeng.</i>

627
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,060
<i>Sifeng, it really is you.</i>

628
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,739
<i>You have another new mask.</i>

629
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:35,040
<i>I almost couldn't recognize you.</i>

630
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,760
Little Phoenix was unlucky enough to believe that you would be different.

631
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,739
He thought you would treat him sincerely.

632
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:43,739
He thought you would remove that mask for him.

633
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:46,800
He thought you could lift his Lover's Curse.

634
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,859
<i>But fate was cruel and you just had to be the God of War.</i>

635
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,779
<i>The Lover's Curse Mask is made from wood from the Kunlun Tree.</i>

636
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,079
It cannot resist your celestial powers.

637
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,060
You removed his mask easily,

638
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,600
but you couldn't lift his curse.

639
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,560
Sifeng.

640
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:09,859
- Sifeng! Sifeng! <br> - He didn't expect anything from you or feel anything for you.

641
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:12,300
That's how the curse can be suppressed.

642
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,800
But he still dedicated himself to you.

643
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,460
That punk must have been so determined to give his life to you.

644
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,000
<i>Didn't you say that the mask will smile when it's removed?</i>

645
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,580
<i> Why is it crying?</i>

646
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:31,828
<i> Xuanji,</i>

647
00:43:31,828 --> 00:43:36,160
<i> were you really the one who removed this mask?</i>

648
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,980
<i> Yes.</i>

649
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,800
Sifeng!

650
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,080
I was wrong, Sifeng.

651
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,199
<i>Yu Sifeng's Lover's Curse has activated twice.</i>

652
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,979
<i>The third time will mean death.</i>

653
00:43:47,979 --> 00:43:50,279
<i>Ending this relationship will keep his life.</i>

654
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,980
Stinky woman!

655
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,110
<i>[Lize Palace]</i>

656
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,079
Stinky woman, what are you doing?

657
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,059
Lize Palace is here! You almost dived straight into the sea!

658
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,060
That's right.

659
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,380
What...

660
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,100
What have I been doing?

661
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,220
He tried to explain to me about what he had done,

662
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,059
but I never listened to a single word.

663
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:25,740
I even said all those hurtful remarks.

664
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,719
He didn't tell you, so you didn't know.

665
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,540
It's not your fault.

666
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,780
No.

667
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,760
No matter what happens to me,

668
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,880
he would know even when I didn't tell him.

669
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,220
But what about me?

670
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:50,380
I...

671
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:56,320
I never cared about what he wanted.

672
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,820
I never knew if he was happy or sad.

673
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,060
He said I'm heartless.

674
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,880
I am truly heartless.

675
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,280
Now...

676
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,420
He's gone.

677
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,860
Lize Palace is abandoned now.

678
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,120
He has moved on indeed.

679
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:45,910
