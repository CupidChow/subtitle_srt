<i>[EPISODE 25]</i>

18
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:37,058
I'm already in human form. But she's feeding me rice cake?

19
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:40,602
She thought I was still a snake? I don't need to be fed.

20
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,615
Move aside!

21
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:45,338
What happened? Who are you mad at?

22
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,291
None of your business.

23
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,820
I'm so mad. I can't believe her.

24
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,140
Take it. This is for you.

25
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,115
Sifeng told me that I have to thank those who helped me before.

26
00:02:08,115 --> 00:02:11,301
So, thank you. This rice cake is for you.

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,790
Who wants to eat this kind of thing?

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,324
<i>Older Brother, this rice cake is really tasty. Have one.</i>

29
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,979
<i>You are really a glutton.</i>

30
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:40,267
<i>Ruo Xue, I was chosen as a disciple for Lize Palace.</i>

31
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:45,519
<i>Great! I heard that the disciples of Lize Palace can eat well and live well.</i>

32
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,004
<i>They can even learn some skills.</i>

33
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:48,620
<i>Go, Older Brother.</i>

34
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,450
<i>That way, nobody will ever bully you again.</i>

35
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,600
<i>If it wasn't because Lize Palace didn't accept female disciples,</i>

36
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,410
<i>I would have gone there, too.</i>

37
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:59,563
<i>But don't worry, Older Brother.</i>

38
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:02,927
<i>I'll wait for you to come back.</i>

39
00:03:28,322 --> 00:03:30,832
<i>Why are you carrying my sister?</i>

<i>You have to be good.</i>

<i>Or else, she'll never wake up again.</i>

42
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:51,360
Linglong. Drink some soup, Linglong.

43
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,362
Drink a little bit.

44
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,709
Linglong.

45
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,562
This...

46
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,660
Linglong has always been like this lately.

47
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,579
She's always so out of it and she doesn't eat much.

48
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,002
What should we do?

49
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:19,345
She doesn't have any fever.

50
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:22,475
What should we do, Sixth Senior? She can't go on like this.

51
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:25,115
What happened to her?

52
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,640
Sifeng.

53
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:34,407
Sifeng.

54
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,338
This is because her soul has been separated too long from her body.

55
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:40,337
Linglong has started to lose control over her own body.

56
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,658
We can't wait anymore. Let's go to Mount Buzhou now.

57
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:46,669
Let's go right now.

58
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:50,206
We have to go to Mount Buzhou.

59
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,920
But we don't know where to go.

60
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,180
Ever since Madam Dongfang mentioned Mount Buzhou,

61
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,812
I've been investigating about that place. But there's no such place on the map.

62
00:04:57,812 --> 00:05:01,129
In ancient myth, Water God Gong Gong was defeated by Fire God Zhu Rong.

63
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:04,860
He knocked over Mount Buzhou. The sky fell and there was a huge flood.

64
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,914
Since this, Mount Buzhou can reach until the sky.

65
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:10,842
It must be in the mountainous area of Mount Wei'e. Why isn't it on the map?

66
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:13,627
Could it be that maybe it was too long ago that

67
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:17,701
it has changed its name, just like Mount Gao?

68
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:21,147
That demon mentioned about the west before he died.

69
00:05:21,147 --> 00:05:25,650
If we continue to search the west, we might be able to find it.

70
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:29,656
Let's continue to search the west then.

71
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,360
You are not allowed to go anywhere.

72
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,850
I...

73
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,626
- Father. <br> - Xuanji.

74
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:42,747
If it wasn't because Dingkun Sword protected you before this,

75
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:46,797
you've would have been killed by the Demon Whip. Now, you are acting recklessly again.

76
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:48,611
If you fall into the hands of demons,

77
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:50,887
should I save you or not?

78
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:54,963
Do you want Shaoyang to end up like Xuanyuan and Fuyu Island

79
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:57,763
where they lost hundreds of their disciples?

80
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,460
You should know how important Shaoyang is compared to

81
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,091
Linglong's personal safety.

82
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,450
You only know how to blame me.

83
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,300
But do you know how it feels when I have to put the people first

84
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,831
while looking at how badly injured Linglong is?

85
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:18,098
You think that you are passionate and righteous.,

86
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:20,420
but you are just ignorant and reckless.

87
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,598
Well said.

88
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,240
- Greetings, Palace Master. <br> - Greetings, Master.

89
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,282
The rebellious disciple of Shaoyang keeps on causing trouble

90
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:34,742
and my disciple is always being dragged down by her.

91
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:37,826
She is really ignorant and reckless.

92
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:39,040
What you said...

93
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm talking to my disciple!

94
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:47,860
Sifeng, you went to Mount Gao because of this girl

95
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,876
and you sent your spirit beast to Tianxu Hall because of this girl, too.

96
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:55,940
Are you going to Mount Buzhou because of her again?

97
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,273
Can't you see how useless these companions from Shaoyang are?

98
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:06,145
They were caught, injured, and even caused you to be punished.

99
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:09,347
I've already warned you.

100
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:12,307
"He that lives with cripples learns to limp."

101
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,546
You won't listen to me,

102
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:17,650
but you have to understand this.

103
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,546
"If you lie with dogs, you'll rise with fleas."

104
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:24,420
Understand?

105
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:27,901
Xuanji,

106
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:31,447
I want to lecture you, too.

107
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:35,822
Shaoyang Sect has always been open and above board.

108
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:41,142
You have to stay away from slimy sects that know how to use spells only.

109
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:43,060
We may know a person's face, but not his heart.

110
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,232
Moreover, they are always wearing masks. We can't even read their expressions.

111
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:50,428
You risked your life to take a whip for someone,

112
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,894
but do you think they'll be thankful for that?

113
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:55,976
Father.

114
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:03,500
Sifeng, listen. You thought that they'd be affectionate towards you?

115
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,072
They have already taken precautions against you.

116
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:10,293
You risked your life so many times for her, but they don't remember at all.

117
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:13,495
She just took a whip for you

118
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:16,842
and they already expect you to kneel down and thank her.

119
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:21,179
So interesting.

120
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,967
Master.

121
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:27,002
Xuanji, the friendship between gentlemen is pure as water.

122
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,700
We don't fuss over little things.

123
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,727
We should stay away from those who seek revenge for the smallest grievance.

124
00:08:33,727 --> 00:08:35,140
It's not like this.

125
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,220
- Master. <br> - Shut up!

126
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,139
Sifeng, I've already said so much,

127
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:46,735
but you are still so stubborn.

128
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,746
How about this? From today onward,

129
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:54,620
I'll lock you up so that you can't spend time with idiots anymore.

130
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,124
- Master. <br> - Come. Come back with me.

131
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:01,850
Let's go.

132
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,440
Sifeng.

133
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,762
- Let's go. <br> - Sifeng.

134
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:07,760
- Sifeng. <br> - Stop right there!

135
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,658
Looks like you really need someone to discipline you.

136
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,542
Come with me.

137
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:26,974
Master, why are you here?

138
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:29,860
I'm here for a happy occasion.

139
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,160
Happy occasion?

140
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,900
Xuanj, your master has something to ask you.

141
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,758
Let me ask you. What do you think about Hao Chen?

142
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,091
Of course, he is very important to me.

143
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,590
One more question then.

144
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,340
Are you willing to accompany him forever?

145
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,107
Senior Hao Chen and I already vowed to protect the secret ground forever.

146
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:56,339
Of course, we can accompany each other forever.

147
00:09:59,147 --> 00:10:05,650
Xuanji, you've always created trouble for me and you are stubborn.

148
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:07,728
Luckily, your Senior Hao Chen doesn't mind;

149
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:13,438
or else, I really don't know how I was going to find you a good man.

150
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:22,239
I'm willing to take Xuanji as my wife to protect and respect her forever.

151
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:24,346
Please give us your blessings.

152
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,515
Senior Hao Chen, what nonsense are you talking about?

153
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:34,151
Xuanji, everything I said is sincere and true.

154
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:37,500
Xuanji, if you marry Senior Hao Chen...

155
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,420
First, you'll have someone to take care of you for the rest of your life.

156
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,760
Second, you can practice Sentimental Tactics together. Your power will grow.

157
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,875
It'll be for the best.

158
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,660
Okay. You have my blessing.

159
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,540
I don't want to marry him.

160
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,860
Linglong can take care of me. So can Sixth Senior.

161
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,127
As for the training, Sifeng can teach me.

162
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,354
He's so smart. I'll definitely improve.

163
00:10:58,354 --> 00:11:01,113
I can't marry Senior Hao Chen.

164
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,540
You– You are really troublesome.

165
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,258
Just now, your master asked you.

166
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:10,100
And you'd already agreed. How can you–

167
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,620
How can you change your mind now?

168
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,319
Just now, I said that I can protect the secret ground with Senior Hao Chen forever.

169
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:19,129
I didn't say that I'd marry him.

170
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:20,709
You–

171
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,116
Junior, looks like Xuanji has made up her mind.

172
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:27,900
Let's not force her.

173
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,827
Senior, this kid...

174
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,700
I've spoiled her too much since young.

175
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,130
Now, she still wants to be with that unethical man.

176
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,410
She won't settle down.

177
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,316
Fine. Since you won't settle down, I'll help you settle down.

178
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:44,792
I'm going to lock you up now.

179
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:48,050
After we go back to Shaoyang, don't ever think of leaving it again.

180
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,792
Father!

181
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,280
Master.

182
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,479
Are you still acting so foolish over Chu Xuanji?

183
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,930
Have you forgotten what you are?

184
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,910
If it wasn't because I reached here on time, you would've been beaten to death in the great hall!

185
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:16,762
But you don't regret it at all and still want to be with her.

186
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:18,826
Have you lost your mind?

187
00:12:18,826 --> 00:12:21,084
I've never lost my mind.

188
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,151
Xuanji risked her life to protect me.

189
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:27,431
My heart is already with her.

190
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:29,380
What did you say?

191
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:36,380
You gave her your heart.

192
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,460
Are you going to give her your life, too?

193
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,100
There are so many lives in Lize Palace.

194
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,706
Are you going to give her their lives, too?

195
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:47,827
Get up!

196
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:49,580
Think about it carefully.

197
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,730
If she finds out about your real identity, do you think she'll still protect you?

198
00:12:56,634 --> 00:13:01,250
Xuanji is different. She won't harm me.

199
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:11,493
Fine.

200
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,521
Since you are bent on having your way, I'll let you have your way.

201
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:19,820
Go further away if you want to die.

202
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,377
No matter who it is that wants to hit you or kill you, I don't care anymore.

203
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:27,030
You are no longer my disciple now.

204
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:41,641
Senior, can you let me go out a while to meet Sifeng?

205
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:45,968
I'll come back quickly. My father won't find out.

206
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:50,901
Little Xuanji, if we break the master's order, we'll be beaten up later.

207
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:52,010
Senior...

208
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,010
No.

209
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,969
<i>My father is keeping me on such a tight leash.</i>

210
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:08,861
<i>How can I get out from Fuyu Island?</i>

211
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,896
Silver...

212
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:21,825
Come with me.

213
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,780
Why are you here?

214
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,370
Sifeng instructed me to ask you if you are set on going to Mount Buzhou.

215
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,789
I have to go there.

216
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,662
Okay then.

217
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,694
Take these.

218
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,060
What are these?

219
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,436
These are Parrot Charms and Puppet Charms made by Sifeng.

220
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:45,210
Sifeng asked me to tell you that if you follow his plan,

221
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,380
you'll be able to leave the island with him.

222
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,255
Really?

223
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,370
Yu'er!

224
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,300
Yu'er! Yu'er!

225
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,119
Finally, I found you. I can't run anymore.

226
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:08,020
Come back with me.

227
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,689
I won.

228
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:16,026
My dummy, what do you mean that you won?

229
00:15:16,026 --> 00:15:17,899
I'm playing a game with Linglong.

230
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,460
The one who can lead you here first wins.

231
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,531
Game?

232
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,420
I won. How is it? Aren't I amazing?

233
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,570
Nobody can win me in a game.

234
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,450
Linglong? Who is he?

235
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,079
What do you want?

236
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,522
That's right. You won.

237
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:40,113
As a reward, I'll give you a treasure.

238
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:42,200
What treasure?

239
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:48,498
- What is this? <br> - Do you like it?

240
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,219
What are you doing? What are you going to do to Yu'er?

241
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:57,099
Don't worry. We won't do anything to Yu'er.

242
00:15:57,099 --> 00:16:00,586
She was just a bait. I was looking for you.

243
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:05,728
As long as you obey us, your daughter will be fine.

244
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:10,439
Wu Tong, you said that you'd let me go if I win. You lied to me.

245
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:12,340
- Bring them away. <br> - Yes.

246
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,035
Let's go.

247
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:35,350
Yu'er.

248
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,608
Old Fogey, I didn't trick you to come here. Don't leave me behind.

249
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:41,300
Don't worry.

250
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:48,581
What do you want? Just say it.

251
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:52,495
I'm not the one looking for you.

252
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,897
Welcome, My Lord!

253
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:16,385
Hall Master? This is the old lair of Tianxu Hall.

254
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:20,754
It's an honor to be able to see your celestial eye today, Mr. Liu.

255
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:23,533
You are the head of Tianxu Hall?

256
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:26,460
No wonder those from Tianxu Hall live in the shadows.

257
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,459
So, it's because their head is an unpresentable person.

258
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:32,420
Don't you think that you are too talkative?

259
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,140
I called you here to ask you a question.

260
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,206
You have far-reaching power and Tianxu Hall has spies all over the world.

261
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:40,980
What else don't you know?

262
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,580
I'm afraid that I won't be able to help you.

263
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,227
Since you have the celestial eye, you'll be able to help me.

264
00:17:47,227 --> 00:17:52,690
I just want to know. Is Chu Xuanji the God of War from Heaven?

265
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,124
I'll lose ten years of my life every time I open the celestial eye.

266
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,020
Moreover, it's such a difficult question.

267
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,649
I'm afraid that I'll have no answer for you. It'll just waste my life.

268
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:09,339
I don't have that many ten years to waste.

269
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:12,016
I won't open the celestial eye, no matter what.

270
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,560
Let go of him!

271
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,180
No! I have a type of blindness. I'll turn blind if I'm beaten.

272
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,279
- Listen. This is Xuanyin Chain. <br> - Let him go!

273
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,439
The more you struggle, the tighter it gets. Don't play games with me.

274
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,060
Since you can bear the pain of inserting the celestial eye,

275
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,300
this Xuanyin Chain is nothing to you.

276
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,911
But I'm not sure if your daughter can take it or not.

277
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,400
Yu'er!

278
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,082
Stop!

279
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:48,809
I forgot to tell you.

280
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,260
When this Xuanyin Chain is at its tightest,

281
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,720
no matter if it's human or demon, all will die.

282
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,480
Fine! Stop! I agree to open the celestial eye for you!

283
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:38,299
Exactly like what I suspected. Chu Xuanji is the God of War.

284
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,489
Finally, I found you...

285
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:42,386
But she has not awakened yet.

286
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:46,353
I have to find a way to awaken her power.

287
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,539
Old Fogey, are you okay? Don't die!

288
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,310
Don't worry, kid. I won't leave you behind.

289
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,277
Who are you?

290
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:03,613
Why can't I see through you?

291
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:07,090
If I dare ask you to open your celestial eye,

292
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,140
I'll have a way to block your sight from me.

293
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,920
Save it, Mr. Liu.

294
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,250
Treat him well. I still need him.

295
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,474
I'll come and get him in a few days' time.

296
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:19,620
Yes, My Lord.

297
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,580
My Lord, when are we going to attack the five sects?

298
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,301
My Lord!

299
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:28,780
Kid,

300
00:20:29,827 --> 00:20:31,386
you are too ambitious.

301
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:35,556
I'm afraid that things won't go your way.

302
00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:39,675
- What did you say? <br> - Although I can't identify him,

303
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:43,380
I saw the punishment mark of Heaven on him.

304
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,938
He's a criminal from the heavens.

305
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:49,186
If you collude with this kind of person, there'll be no good ending for you.

306
00:20:49,186 --> 00:20:53,042
I know. You don't want to sacrifice your moral integrity to stay alive.

307
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:56,818
You want to destroy the five sects and become the head of the five sects.

308
00:20:56,818 --> 00:20:59,242
But he's someone who can even hide from the heavens.

309
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:03,302
Do you think he'll really keep his promise to help you?

310
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:06,880
This is just your wishful thinking.

311
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:11,115
You want to sow discord between us?

312
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:12,660
Let me tell you.

313
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,657
I only believe in myself.

314
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:18,940
Take them away and lock them up separately.

315
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,582
Yes.

316
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,821
<i>He has the punishment mark from the heavens?</i>

317
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:31,822
<i>Then he shouldn't be able to enter Mount Buzhou.</i>

318
00:21:31,822 --> 00:21:35,880
<i>Could it be that he has a way to conceal his mark?</i>

319
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,880
<i>Could it be</i> the Dragon Seal?

320
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,047
First Senior,

321
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,259
Xuanji has been locked inside for so long. I want to chat with her.

322
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:54,827
Master asked me to keep an eye on you. Don't cause any trouble.

323
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:57,864
Don't worry. What trouble can I make?

324
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,400
Thank you, Senior.

325
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,420
Are you ready? First Senior is keeping a close eye on you.

326
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,380
Sifeng's plan will definitely work. Look.

327
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,946
Good.

328
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:18,387
Sixth Senior, I'm so bored.

329
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:20,940
Let's play Morra.

330
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,260
The loser will have to act like a dog.

331
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,100
Sure. Let's play then. Bring it on.

332
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:34,700
<i>Two brothers, three shining stars, four treasures, five leaders.</i>

333
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,060
<i>Xuanji, you lost. Bark like a dog now.</i>

334
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,860
<i>Woof!</i>

335
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,213
<i>Louder. Later, I'll buy you a meaty bone.</i>

336
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:46,530
<i>Woof!</i>

337
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,315
First Senior.

338
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,220
Good that you are here. I need to go to the toilet.

339
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,630
Keep an eye on Xuanji for me.

340
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,420
Yes, First Senior.

341
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,940
<i>Two brothers, three shining stars.</i>

342
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,980
<i>Xuanji, you lost again. Bark like a dog now.</i>

343
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,269
<i>Woof!</i>

344
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:07,460
- Little Xuanji is too dumb. Why does she keep on losing? <br> <i>- Again.</i>

345
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,439
<i>- Two brothers, three shining stars,</i> <br> - What are they doing?

346
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,780
<i>four treasures, five leaders.</i>

347
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,386
Xuanji was still heartbroken about the lad from Lize Palace yesterday, right?

348
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:19,460
Why is she...

349
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,919
- Well... <br> - What's wrong with them?

350
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,124
<i>Let's continue.</i>

351
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:24,660
Young people nowadays are too open-minded.

352
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,660
- What's wrong? <br> <i>- Two brothers.</i>

353
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,820
- They... <br> - Yes.

354
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,799
<i>Four treasures, five leaders.</i>

355
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,239
This is bad.

356
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,380
Two brothers, three shining stars, four treasures,

357
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,952
- five leaders. <br> - Minyan.

358
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:49,308
Puppet Charm and Parrot Charm.

359
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,763
- Inform master about it at once. <br> - Yes, First Senior.

360
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,362
Master Dongfang ordered us to look for Chu Xuanji and Zhong Minyan.

361
00:23:58,362 --> 00:23:59,732
Don't let them escape from the island!

362
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:02,757
All of you, go over there! The rest, come with me!

363
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,680
- Let's go. <br> - Wait.

364
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,834
You discussed in private to save Linglong. Why didn't you tell me?

365
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,529
Am I not your friend?

366
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:21,070
Ruo Yu, you've misunderstood. We don't want to drag you down with us.

367
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,780
Besides, we went against our master's order this time.

368
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,980
We'll be punished severely when we go back.

369
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,090
Linglong is my friend, too. How can I sit back on this?

370
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,680
Even if I'll be punished,

371
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,270
it'll be worth it as long as we can save her. Right, Sifeng?

372
00:24:33,277 --> 00:24:35,729
Good. The more the merrier.

373
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:39,671
If Lize Palace wants to punish us, we will face it together.

374
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:41,620
Ruo Yu, thank you.

375
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,020
Let's not talk about this now.

376
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,437
The Sword Trap is still active. We have to find a way to leave.

377
00:24:46,437 --> 00:24:48,378
I've already asked Little Silver Flower to scout out the area.

378
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:50,706
One part of the Sword Trap is still broken.

379
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:52,475
Let's go there.

380
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,084
Finally, I'm here.

381
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,883
Darn it. What's so good about Fuyu Island?

382
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,820
Why do they have to put on this Sword Trap?

383
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,109
If it wasn't because of the spirit key, I wouldn't even come here.

384
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:29,340
It's the first quarter of the moon today. We can't fix the formation.

385
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,459
I just need to lure them away.

386
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,755
Silver Snake, go.

387
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,853
Hurry up.

388
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,789
Xuanji, no matter what you think,

389
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:07,100
you can tell me about it. We can solve it together.

390
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,740
Why do you have to disobey your father?

391
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,970
Senior Hao Chen, I can't go back to Shaoyang with you.

392
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,380
- I... <br> - I know you want to save Linglong.

393
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,452
But we need to lay down a plan first.

394
00:26:15,452 --> 00:26:17,208
Xuanji,

395
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,930
come back with me now.

396
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,813
Sect Leader!

397
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:09,868
Purple Fox, why is it you?

398
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:11,450
Why are you here?

399
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,940
Humans are really rude.

400
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,315
I saved you just now out of kindness.

401
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:19,586
Shouldn't you thank me?

402
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:21,433
- Thank you. <br> - Thank you.

403
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,658
Humans are supposed to be grateful, right?

404
00:27:25,658 --> 00:27:28,209
You can repay me with the spirit key.

405
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:32,804
You old fox! I knew that you had an ulterior motive for coming here all alone.

406
00:27:32,804 --> 00:27:36,129
Let me tell you. Tianxu Hall has already taken away the spirit key.

407
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:39,130
- You are too late. <br> - What?

408
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,823
Tianxu Hall is really annoying.

409
00:27:41,823 --> 00:27:45,565
Tell me then. Where are those stinking demons now?

410
00:27:45,565 --> 00:27:47,380
We want to get even with them, too.

411
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,578
But Tianxu Hall is at Mount Buzhou.

412
00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:52,131
And we can't find it on the map.

413
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:54,120
Mount Buzhou?

414
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,511
<i>So, they are hiding at Mount Buzhou.</i>

415
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,980
<i>That macaque is being chained down in Fenru City.</i>

416
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,940
<i>And Mount Buzhou is the entrance, right?</i>

417
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,020
<i>I can go with them to find out the location of Tianxu Hall and that macaque.</i>

418
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,280
<i>Then, I can save him after I get the spirit keys.</i>

419
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,180
I want to get even with Tianxu Hall, too.

420
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,580
I'll bring you with me then.

421
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,040
You know where Mount Buzhou is?

422
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,590
Of course. I didn't live 1,000 years for nothing.

423
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,427
Don't trust her. She might attack us on the way there.

424
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:26,600
- That's right. <br> - We'll go there ourselves.

425
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,130
Wait. You can't leave.

426
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,306
Without me, you won't be able to find Mount Buzhou.

427
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:33,415
Mount Buzhou is no longer in the human realm.

428
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,820
It's not in the human realm anymore?

429
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,178
You don't know, right?

430
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:41,300
After Gong Gong knocked down Mount Buzhou,

431
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,140
the sky pillar fell and the earth caved in.

432
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,717
From then on, Mount Buzhou was gone from the human realm.

433
00:28:45,717 --> 00:28:49,100
Mortals like you won't be able to find it.

434
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,818
If you really know where it is, why don't you go there yourself?

435
00:28:51,818 --> 00:28:54,198
Why are you so kind as to bring us there?

436
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:56,673
Why should I lie to you?

437
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,860
After Mount Buzhou collapsed a few thousand years ago,

438
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,100
it became a demon territory with a strong demonic aura surrounding it.

439
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,580
Asura from the demon clan found this place by accident.

440
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,565
Then he took over this place and used the demonic aura to train himself.

441
00:29:08,565 --> 00:29:13,622
As time passed by, that place has become a demon territory.

442
00:29:14,676 --> 00:29:17,715
Let me tell you. I grew up in Mount Buzhou

443
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,138
so I'm very familiar with that place.

444
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:22,500
Fine, I'll believe you for now.

445
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,478
Tell us. Where is Mount Buzhou?

446
00:29:25,994 --> 00:29:27,980
You treat me the best.

447
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,380
Tell us. How do we go to Mount Buzhou?

448
00:29:32,057 --> 00:29:35,860
It's like this. Although I grew up in Mount Buzhou,

449
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,559
after the battle between the deities and demons,

450
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,653
the demon clan was exiled from Mount Buzhou.

451
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:44,668
They moved Fenru City there and sent celestial knights to guard it.

452
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:46,362
So, I don't know how to go back.

453
00:29:46,362 --> 00:29:48,115
You are playing around with us.

454
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:52,179
Calm down. Even if I don't know the way, Ting Nu will definitely know.

455
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:54,900
But you have to help me find him first.

456
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,460
Isn't Ting Nu with you?

457
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,212
When we were at Mount Gao, you escaped together with Ting Nu.

458
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:01,380
That's right.

459
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:05,740
After we escaped from Mount Gao, I put Ting Nu by the roadside.

460
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,300
At first, I wanted to go to Fuyu Island to find out the location of the spirit key.

461
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,498
But within an hour, Ting Nu was gone.

462
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:15,629
I found some signs of struggles nearby.

463
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,234
He was captured by a very powerful demon.

464
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:21,050
I don't know what kind of demon that is.

465
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,603
Is it a demon from Tianxu Hall again?

466
00:30:23,603 --> 00:30:25,220
Definitely not Tianxu Hall.

467
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,862
I've fought many times with Tianxu Hall.

468
00:30:27,862 --> 00:30:30,420
If they had such a powerful demon, I'd know about it.

469
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,618
I think he's just a lone demon that is hiding in the human realm.

470
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:38,100
So, after so much talking, you just want us to help you.

471
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,399
So what if I am?

472
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,740
If you want to go to Mount Buzhou, you have to help me save Ting Nu first.

473
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,763
Ting Nu is a merman. He has no legs. He can't walk.

474
00:30:45,763 --> 00:30:48,863
I don't know how he'll be tortured.

475
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:51,961
Ting Nu is our friend. We'll definitely save him.

476
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:56,701
Besides, he's the only one who can save Linglong now.

477
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,173
All right. We'll discuss it first.

478
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,060
Are you really going to travel with this fox demon?

479
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,730
She is very cunning. We can't fall for her lies.

480
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,380
How about this? We'll save Ting Nu together with her

481
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,070
and enter Mount Buzhou together.

482
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:20,260
After that, we just need to keep the spirit keys away from her.

483
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:22,915
I think we can give it a try.

484
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:26,017
But I really don't want to work with a demon.

485
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:30,859
Sixth Senior, the most important thing now is to save Linglong.

486
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:32,380
Okay.

487
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,500
We'll work together with that demon fox first.

488
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,030
But if she does anything suspicious, I'll not show her mercy.

489
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,286
How is it? Are you done whispering?

490
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,017
We'll save Ting Nu together first.

491
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:52,500
After entering Mount Buzhou, we'll part ways. How about that?

492
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,042
Good. This is exactly what I want.

493
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,030
<i>[Shaoyang]</i>

494
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,908
No matter how I think about it, it's all because of that Yu Sifeng.

495
00:32:02,908 --> 00:32:05,781
Xuanji has been led astray by him. She's getting bolder.

496
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:08,098
Even Minyan is getting so disobedient.

497
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:11,460
The most important thing now is to find them and bring them back.

498
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,745
Xuanji is determined to save Linglong.

499
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:17,060
They must have gone to Mount Buzhou to look for Tianxu Hall's lair.

500
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,060
But Mount Buzhou is hidden in another realm.

501
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,035
It's not a place for humans. How are they going to find it?

502
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:25,460
Even if they can find it, how can they get in?

503
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,133
No. Mount Buzhou is linked to the human realm.

504
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:32,819
Although it's hard for humans to survive in Mount Buzhou, there's a way in.

505
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:34,535
How do you know about that?

506
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,202
When I was going through my trial,

507
00:32:36,202 --> 00:32:38,659
I met a fallen deity who had escaped from Mount Buzhou.

508
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,677
He told me a lot about Mount Buzhou.

509
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:44,095
Sect Leader, I know where the entrance of Mount Buzhou is.

510
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,081
Maybe we can locate Xuanji and the others

511
00:32:46,081 --> 00:32:48,961
by searching along the way towards the entrance.

512
00:32:48,961 --> 00:32:51,178
Okay.

513
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:55,767
Hao Chen, you are so worried about Xuanji.

514
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,660
How about this? After you bring Xuanji back,

515
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,409
I'll find an auspicious date for your engagement.

516
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:03,754
Without you by her side,

517
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:06,714
she might cause even bigger troubles in the future.

518
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,604
My Lord.

519
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:27,390
Tomorrow, send Liu Yihuan and his daughter out from Mount Buzhou.

520
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,660
I'll have a use for them.

521
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,320
Yes.

522
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,862
My Lord.

523
00:34:21,862 --> 00:34:23,650
Where are the people that I asked for?

524
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,753
Why do you need Liu Yihuan?

525
00:34:25,753 --> 00:34:29,630
Just tell me about it. I'll help you settle it.

526
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,136
There's no need for you to know.

527
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:36,540
If I don't know what you want to do,

528
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,682
how can I do my best to serve you?

529
00:34:39,682 --> 00:34:42,540
Later, I might be betrayed by you.

530
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,420
What is the meaning of this?

531
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,113
Your goal from the beginning

532
00:34:47,113 --> 00:34:49,060
was to get the spirit keys

533
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,100
to revive Devil Star in order to topple the heavens

534
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,500
and become the leader of all three realms.

535
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,800
Am I right?

536
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,491
So?

537
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:02,389
If the five sects of the human realm are willing to bow down to you,

538
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:04,914
are you not going to kill them then?

539
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,810
Who lives and who dies,

540
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,050
it all depends on my mood...

541
00:35:12,055 --> 00:35:14,735
It's up to me to decide.

542
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,706
The five sects are unimportant to me.

543
00:35:18,706 --> 00:35:23,412
No wonder you were always so reluctant to let Wolf help me.

544
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,620
You're not going to annihilate the five sects.

545
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,496
You just lied to me saying that you'll annihilate them

546
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:32,626
so that I'll serve Tianxu Hall, right?

547
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:38,158
Wu Tong, you should be thankful to Tianxu Hall;

548
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,454
or else, you would've been dead.

549
00:35:41,454 --> 00:35:46,337
You should be grateful that you are still serving Tianxu Hall.

550
00:35:46,337 --> 00:35:50,031
Of course, I'm grateful to you for giving me this chance.

551
00:35:50,992 --> 00:35:55,132
My Lord, how about we make a deal?

552
00:35:55,132 --> 00:35:57,330
Continue with your dream to become the leader of the three realms.

553
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,810
I'll help you get the spirit keys.

554
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,722
But from now on, the soldiers in Tianxu Hall will be under my command.

555
00:36:03,722 --> 00:36:06,474
I'll destroy those five sects myself.

556
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:11,009
You want to make a deal with me?

557
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:13,020
You are really ambitious.

558
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:17,233
Now, you want to take over Tianxu Hall?

559
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,798
Listen to me carefully, Wu Tong.

560
00:36:20,798 --> 00:36:24,852
You are just a dog that I picked up.

561
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:29,140
When I'm happy, I can let you become the superintendent.

562
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,654
But if I'm unhappy,

563
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,786
I can kill you anytime.

564
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,309
Dragon Seal?

565
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:19,082
I almost forgot that

566
00:37:19,082 --> 00:37:22,251
you are carrying the punishment mark of the heavens.

567
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:25,300
Only this Dragon Seal can conceal that mark

568
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,419
and allow you to enter and leave Mount Buzhou.

569
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:31,548
But besides Yuan Lang, the Right Lieutenant,

570
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:34,093
who had this Rose Gold Bird mark,

571
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:37,024
almost nobody else has the same mark. Right?

572
00:37:37,024 --> 00:37:39,137
You know a lot.

573
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:40,819
If I'm working with the demons,

574
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:44,746
of course, I have to find out everything about the demon realm.

575
00:37:44,746 --> 00:37:46,362
I should know my opponent well.

576
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:50,920
But I can find out even more secrets about you.

577
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,724
Wu Tong, you are courting death!

578
00:37:53,724 --> 00:37:55,902
But can you kill me?

579
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,558
Liu Yihuan told me that you have the punishment mark from the heavens.

580
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:03,760
I was curious. You've entered Mount Buzhou so many times.

581
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,140
So, the Dragon Seal should be with you.

582
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,259
But I never heard anything about Lize Palace losing their Dragon Seal.

583
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:14,842
And Tianxu Hall has never had a plan to attack Lize Palace.

584
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:20,995
So, I was thinking that maybe you are hiding within Lize Palace

585
00:38:20,995 --> 00:38:24,750
where you have easy access to the Dragon Seal.

586
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,528
I was right.

587
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,923
You thought that no one would attack Lize Palace without your order.

588
00:38:32,923 --> 00:38:35,138
So, you were not on your guard.

589
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:38,820
I have to thank you for allowing me to get the Dragon Seal

590
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,162
without any effort at all.

591
00:38:42,594 --> 00:38:46,526
I'd underestimated you before this.

592
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:49,140
Besides, I found out about a groundbreaking secret.

593
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,682
I think nobody in Lize Palace knows that

594
00:38:51,682 --> 00:38:54,660
their Deputy Chief is the lord of Tianxu Hall, right?

595
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,620
Or else, you would have used Lize Palace as Tianxu Hall's hideout.

596
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,763
You don't have to go through so much trouble.

597
00:39:00,763 --> 00:39:03,180
Am I right, Deputy Chief?

598
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:08,800
Wu Tong, you follow neither human rules or demon rules.

599
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,406
There is no place for you within the three realms.

600
00:39:12,406 --> 00:39:13,940
I just want to work with you.

601
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,860
You want to get the spirit keys to become the leader of the three realms.

602
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,660
I just want to annihilate the five sects.

603
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,368
We have no contradicting interest.

604
00:39:20,368 --> 00:39:22,060
If you agree to my request,

605
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,020
not only will I help you keep your secret,

606
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,900
I'll continue to serve you.

607
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,991
You are threatening me.

608
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:32,330
We are just taking what we need.

609
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,527
Isn't that wonderful?

610
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,310
Fine. I agree.

611
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,340
Give me the Dragon Seal.

612
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,651
Since you are willing to cooperate with me,

613
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,402
we should each show our sincerity.

614
00:39:49,402 --> 00:39:52,980
This Dragon Seal and the spirit key inside

615
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,692
will become the token of our cooperation. I'll keep it for you first.

616
00:39:56,692 --> 00:39:59,340
As for what you want to do with Liu Yihuan,

617
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,301
just leave the matter to me.

618
00:40:01,302 --> 00:40:07,129
I'll do it nicely for you to show you my sincerity first.

619
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,039
You are a demon fox, not a demon dog.

620
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:26,984
Are you sure that your sense of smell is accurate?

621
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,480
Ting Nu went that way.

622
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,473
It's late. Let's rest in the forest for tonight.

623
00:40:39,473 --> 00:40:43,040
We'll depart tomorrow morning and continue to look for him.

624
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,359
Here. Eat this.

625
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:15,730
I am a fox. I eat only humans or grapes.

626
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:19,107
I don't want to eat such a charred sweet potato.

627
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:22,597
You dare to eat humans with that courage of yours?

628
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,058
Are you really not going to eat it?

629
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,318
Forget it.

630
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:48,385
After thinking about it, we are in the same boat now.

631
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:50,614
I shouldn't isolate you.

632
00:41:50,614 --> 00:41:54,455
So, I've decided to eat and stay with all of you.

633
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,212
Little Sifeng, do you want to have a taste of this?

634
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:09,179
He won't eat it. He won't eat yours. He will eat mine instead.

635
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:10,620
Sifeng.

636
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,739
What is it, Sifeng? Is her corn better than my sweet potato?

637
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:23,399
Mine is much better than her corn. Eat it.

638
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,461
I can eat it myself.

639
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,954
Don't worry. I'm not interested in your lover.

640
00:42:32,954 --> 00:42:36,451
That macaque already annoys me enough.

641
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,263
By the way, you don't look like an evil demon.

642
00:42:41,263 --> 00:42:44,299
Why would you fall in love with a devil like Wu Zhiqi?

643
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:46,209
Wu Zhiqi is not a devil.

644
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:47,703
Why is he not?

645
00:42:47,703 --> 00:42:51,279
Tianxu Hall caught Linglong just to save him.

646
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:52,717
I'll say it again.

647
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:55,025
Wu Zhiqi has nothing to do with Tianxu Hall.

648
00:42:55,025 --> 00:42:58,476
They have an ulterior motive for saving him.

649
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:05,641
Wu Zhiqi is the most free and easy person in this world.

650
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,518
<i>Let go of me!</i>

651
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,059
<i>Lately, the floor is littered with grape skins.</i>

652
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:30,039
<i>Finally, I caught you today.</i>

653
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:31,819
<i>Let go. Let go of me!</i>

654
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:34,439
<i>I'm from Qingqiu's Fox Tribe. I'm vicious.</i>

655
00:43:34,439 --> 00:43:38,560
<i>If you hurt me, my tribe will definitely avenge me.</i>

656
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,219
<i>How are you going to seek revenge from me?</i>

657
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:46,219
<i>I'll eat everything in your grape garden, watermelon garden, and pumpkin garden.</i>

658
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:48,333
<i>Are you afraid now?</i>

659
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,441
<i>Too bad for you.</i>

660
00:43:51,441 --> 00:43:56,254
<i>I'm the fiercest monkey in this world.</i>

661
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,519
<i>Look.</i>

662
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,194
<i>Your fur looks good.</i>

663
00:44:06,194 --> 00:44:08,393
<i>I need a scarf.</i>

664
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:11,234
<i>I'll skin you to warm my neck for winter.</i>

665
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,681
<i>Little fox. Little fox.</i>

666
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,242
<i>You really are such a coward.</i>

667
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:39,310
