You can't do this to me.

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,519
Demon Lord, I did everything for you!

33
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,159
For the past 1,000 years, I've stayed loyal and endured hardships

34
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,280
for your sake!

35
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,980
Is that so?

36
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,887
But why do I only see ambition in you instead of loyalty?

37
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:13,919
I did everything for you.

38
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,479
For you to conquer the three realms!

39
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,119
That does make you sound useful to me.

40
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,740
In that case,

41
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:27,360
since I am still of some use to you, release me.

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,560
Unfortunately, I am not the Devil Star.

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,920
I won't be needing you anymore.

44
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,380
You've been doubting me, haven't you?

45
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,800
Blame your ambition for blinding you and making you hasty.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,620
You deceived me.

47
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,739
You deceived me, too!

48
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,920
How dare you say I deceived you?

49
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,500
Don't fall for his tricks.

50
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,800
We are brothers.

51
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,220
Don't you remember, Old Wu?

52
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,360
We traveled across the three realms, drank together, and serenaded together.

53
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,399
For the past 1,000 years, in order to save you,

54
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,180
I've put in so much blood, sweat, and tears.

55
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,919
You can't betray me!

56
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,180
You betrayed me first!

57
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,519
Why did the heavens arrest me 1,000 years ago?

58
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,639
You think I don't know it was you?

59
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,820
It was the God of War!

60
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,419
It's not me!

61
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:20,940
Are you still denying the truth?

62
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,180
Yuan Lang, who instigated King Asura 1,000 years ago to attack the heavens?

63
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,231
And when the attempt failed, who decided to protect himself

64
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:30,359
by securing a celestial position and selling me out to the heavens?

65
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,619
Listen, Yuan Lang. I'm here to avenge my 1,000-year grudge!

66
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,660
Wu Zhiq, you've finally avenged yourself.

67
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,140
We were brothers.

68
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,100
Why did we end up like this?

69
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,160
The Soul Furnace is vicious.

70
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,860
If it were used on Xuanji,

71
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,080
it would be catastrophic.

72
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,479
This isn't right.

73
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,859
Why had Yuan Lang become so weak today?

74
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:11,239
Stupid Monkey, stop making yourself sound all high and mighty.

75
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:13,379
Oh no, I'd forgotten.

76
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,340
Yuan Lang knows clone magic.

77
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,380
Look there!

78
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,420
- They must be attacking the Shaoyang Sect now! <br> - Let's go.

79
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,820
Little Fox, you shouldn't follow us. Sifeng and I can handle this.

80
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,620
Protect yourself.

81
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,280
- Deputy Chief. <br> - Yu Sifeng. Wu Zhiqi!

82
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,999
How dare you ensnare me!

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,020
Did something go wrong with the formation?

84
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,160
Even if I haven't received power from the God of War,

85
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,480
I must take the Crystal Lamp first.

86
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,540
Then, I'd still have another chance.

87
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,999
I'm going to take the Crystal Lamp.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,620
You two stand guard.

89
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,519
Make sure nothing happens.

90
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,160
Yes, My Lord.

91
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,159
So many years have passed.

92
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,640
Aren't you giving up yet?

93
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,480
<i>My body is deteriorating day by day.</i>

94
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,860
<i>I may not last much longer.</i>

95
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,559
<i>I need to come up with a way quickly</i>

96
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,200
<i>for Xuanji to destroy the Crystal Lamp.</i>

97
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,900
The Crystal Lamp.

98
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,020
An asura?

99
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,540
Weren't the Asuras exterminated 1,000 years ago?

100
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,260
I am merely borrowing this body to take the Crystal Lamp.

101
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,959
Anyone who blocks my way shall die!

102
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,879
- Hand it over. <br> - As long as I am here,

103
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,780
you shall not prevail!

104
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,100
When you took the Vermilion Bird Bottle,

105
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,559
I'd already had an idea of who you were.

106
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,159
Not many people in the three realms are capable

107
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,420
of taking the mythical treasures in the heavens.

108
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,720
Unfortunately, with your current strength, you cannot defeat me!

109
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,199
Senior Hao Chen, I've brought you some wine from my wedding.

110
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,020
Senior Hao Chen.

111
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,479
Wine? What wine?

112
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,380
Wu Tong?

113
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,020
Don't you dare wreak havoc in the Shaoyang Sect!

114
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,980
Why are you wearing a wedding robe?

115
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,560
Who are you marrying?

116
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't you know whom I'm marrying?

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,740
I, Zhong Minyan, will only marry Linglong.

118
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,780
Linglong will only marry me!

119
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,000
Linglong is mine.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,319
No one can snatch her away from me!

121
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,560
She's mine!

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,399
- Minyan! <br> - Linglong!

123
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,780
Minyan!

124
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,179
Don't give chase. You're injured.

125
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,060
Ruo Yu.

126
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,559
You're really alive.

127
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:19,400
So, what Sifeng said was all true.

128
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,059
And I treated you as my best friend.

129
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,920
You don't deserve it!

130
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,099
Yes.

131
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,340
It was me who tricked you to steal the spirit keys

132
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,860
and set Sifeng up.

133
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,019
Also, I was the one who injured Martial Aunt Chu Yinghong.

134
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,980
It wasn't Sifeng.

135
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:40,000
So...

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,920
So, it was you who injured Martial Aunt Chu Yinghong.

137
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,620
Minyan...

138
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,619
Yes, I have done wrong and sinned.

139
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,719
That's why I cannot see you die today.

140
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:58,159
Wu Tong is already half-demon. You can't defeat him.

141
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,540
I'll go.

142
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,580
I won't let him get near Linglong.

143
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,420
Minyan.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,079
Ruo Yu, listen carefully.

145
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,119
I'll get you for everything you've done.

146
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,140
Minyan!

147
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,340
Minyan, come back!

148
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,459
You've always meddled in my business.

149
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,240
I shall not spare you!

150
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,080
Leave him to me.

151
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,220
I sense a demonic aura.

152
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,020
Dingkun Sword!

153
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,800
Someone is taking the Crystal Lamp!

154
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,420
Minyan, you're back.

155
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,020
What took you so long at Hao Chen's place?

156
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,579
What are you waiting for? Remove my veil.

157
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,080
My dear Linglong.

158
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,700
Are you so eager for me to unveil you?

159
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,120
Scram.

160
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,080
Get away!

161
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,920
I was the one who unveiled you.

162
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,460
You are now my bride.

163
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,520
I'm bringing you back home.

164
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,980
Why are you still haunting me?

165
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,239
Put me down!

166
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,540
Scram!

167
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,621
Let go of me!

168
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:51,780
- Let go of me! <br> - Wu Tong!

169
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,680
Let go of Linglong!

170
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,560
Minyan.

171
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,360
Minyan!

172
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,879
Linglong.

173
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,659
Zhong Minyan, Linglong won't follow me because of you.

174
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:12,560
As long as you're dead, Linglong will be all mine!

175
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,320
No.

176
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:22,181
No.

177
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,760
Don't kill him, Minyan!

178
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,620
Minyan!

179
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,940
Let's see how you can stop me now.

180
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,399
Dream on.

181
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,860
Don't you ever take Linglong away from me!

182
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,120
Minyan, let go of him.

183
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,240
You'd kill yourself like this.

184
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,940
Wu Tong, please let go of him.

185
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,260
I beg you.

186
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,552
Please let go of him.

187
00:13:01,552 --> 00:13:02,739
I'll follow you back.

188
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:04,519
Please let go of him.

189
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,259
Don't hurt him anymore.

190
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:08,220
I beg you.

191
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,939
Linglong, don't beg him.

192
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:17,140
Linglong, to think you will follow me back just for him...

193
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,680
Fine.

194
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,759
I'll still kill him anyway so you'll give up on him!

195
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,960
No!

196
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,340
Minyan.

197
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,200
Minyan.

198
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,220
- I'm sorry. <br> - I will be back to marry you.

199
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,660
Father.

200
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,700
Minyan.

201
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,760
Minyan, are you okay?

202
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,459
Linglong, don't be scared.

203
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:53,040
I will always stay by your side.

204
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,700
Minyan!

205
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,859
Minyan, wake up!

206
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:58,399
Minyan!

207
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,919
It's our wedding night.

208
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,440
You can't leave me like this.

209
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,419
I won't let you leave.

210
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,099
Don't leave me like this.

211
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,619
Minyan is seriously injured.

212
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,800
Take him to his room, now!

213
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,760
Minyan.

214
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,600
Oh, no! Someone is taking the Crystal Lamp!

215
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,220
This is bad. Hao Chen is alone in the secret ground.

216
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,679
Sifeng, this huge Asura is an undead spirit.

217
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,279
He is vulnerable to sunlight.

218
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,059
The golden light from your Rose Gold Bird Wings is similar to sunlight.

219
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,680
Kill him.

220
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,659
As a Rose Gold Bird yourself,

221
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,899
you shall die from the power of your own clan.

222
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:49,760
It's a perfect ending for you!

223
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,100
It's finally over.

224
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,240
Yuan Lang, I guess our 1,000-year grudge is settled.

225
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,120
Now that we've removed this monster here,

226
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,180
you can finally explain everything to Little Pretty.

227
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,920
I've been waiting

228
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,600
so long for this.

229
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,680
What? You still care about this guy?

230
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,898
He's Xuanji's senior, after all.

231
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,470
I didn't know you were so kind.

232
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,819
I'm not trying to be a saint,

233
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,399
but if I don't save him,

234
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,559
Xuanji will blame me for the rest of her life.

235
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,180
I don't want to carry this sin.

236
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,599
Besides, if her senior testifies for me,

237
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,799
I can explain everything to Xuanji.

238
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,519
You punk. That's a clever plan.

239
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,460
Senior Hao Chen.

240
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,840
What's going on?

241
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,220
Yu Sifeng, stop wasting your energy.

242
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,920
You are a good actor, Devil Star.

243
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,460
You're trying to use this chance to conquer the demons, right?

244
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,939
Regardless of your goals, do you think what you're doing is useful?

245
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:16,840
You're just wasting your efforts.

246
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,919
- What do you mean? <br> <i>- Senior Hao Chen!</i>

247
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,820
<i>Senior Hao Chen!</i>

248
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,059
<i>Senior!</i>

249
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:32,059
Xuanji is in this state because of you!

250
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:34,379
<i>- Where are you?</i> <br> - Since there's no return,

251
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:39,160
let me lend your identity as the Devil Star!

252
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,920
Sect Leader!

253
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,640
Senior!

254
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,420
You demon.

255
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,960
Even if you kill me,

256
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,000
you'll never take the Crystal Lamp!

257
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,199
Senior! Senior!

258
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,680
Senior!

259
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,620
Senior!

260
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:12,719
Senior!

261
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,059
You demon!

262
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:16,600
How dare you attack Hao Chen?

263
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,640
You people are an unreasonable bunch.

264
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,120
My brother was helping him.

265
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,160
Senior Hao Chen, I was here to kill the undead Asura spirit.

266
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,419
I was here to save you.

267
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:37,360
Why are you maligning me when you know this?

268
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,020
Yu Sifeng wants to take the Crystal Lamp.

269
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,360
I can't let him get his way.

270
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,200
You trusted the wrong person.

271
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,179
Senior! Senior!

272
00:19:58,968 --> 00:19:59,999
You'll be fine.

273
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,520
I'll heal your wounds now.

274
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,980
Xuanji, that's not it.

275
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,660
Don't waste your spiritual power.

276
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,159
Xuanji,

277
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,539
why didn't you listen to me?

278
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:21,140
Everything has gone so awry now.

279
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,580
You'll be fine, Senior.

280
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:23,648
I'll listen to you.

281
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:26,039
I'll listen to you. I'll listen to you, Senior!

282
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,500
I'll listen to you.

283
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,420
It's too late.

284
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,099
Xuanji, that's not what happened.

285
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,679
When I reached here, your senior was already seriously injured.

286
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,959
I saw the undead spirit attacking him, so I decided to strike.

287
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,940
The spirit was possessed by Yuan Lang's soul.

288
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,140
He was here to take the Crystal Lamp!

289
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,019
When I finally killed him,

290
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:52,739
your senior... I wanted to save him!

291
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,160
Promise me.

292
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,840
Destroy the Crystal Lamp.

293
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,700
Don't let the demons get their way.

294
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,800
Senior.

295
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,420
Promise me.

296
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,659
- Senior. <br> - Promise me.

297
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:14,679
I promise you!

298
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:16,020
I promise you, Senior!

299
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,100
I promise you!

300
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,439
I promise you, Senior!

301
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:22,540
Senior! Senior!

302
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,090
Senior!

303
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:26,880
Sect Leader!

304
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,240
Senior!

305
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,600
Senior. Senior!

306
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,620
Senior!

307
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,397
Senior!

308
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,540
Senior!

309
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:54,244
Senior!

310
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,520
Yu Sifeng, you killed my senior.

311
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,995
Xuanji, I didn't kill him.

312
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:21,148
Trust me!

313
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,260
When I knew you were a demon,

314
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,060
I chose to trust you.

315
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:35,737
When you trespassed upon our secret ground,

316
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:38,000
I trusted you, too.

317
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,875
Even when I knew you were the Devil Star,

318
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,959
I still hoped that you would change.

319
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,904
I trusted you time and again.

320
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,165
And now?

321
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:50,000
My loved ones are hurt because of you!

322
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,634
You injured Auntie Yinghong.

323
00:22:51,634 --> 00:22:53,929
You killed my master and my senior.

324
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:56,970
How can I still trust you?

325
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,360
Sifeng! Sifeng!

326
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,879
Xuanji, I'm not the Devil Star.

327
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:24,800
I've never hurt anyone.

328
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,460
I came here today to kill Yuan Lang.

329
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,659
Now that Yuan Lang is no longer here,

330
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,160
no one can threaten the Crystal Lamp now.

331
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,420
I can tell you everything I've done.

332
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,220
Think about it.

333
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,820
If I did kill your loved ones,

334
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,624
why didn't I run away?

335
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:46,225
Why did I stay here?

336
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,154
You think Hao Chen can stop me?

337
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:52,759
Shut up!

338
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,460
Sifeng!

339
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,080
Xuanji,

340
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,920
what should I say to make you trust me?

341
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,800
Have we ever trusted each other?

342
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,020
Senior Hao Chen was right.

343
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,380
I shouldn't have searched for my six senses.

344
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,420
Had I not done so,

345
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,260
I wouldn't hurt so much as I face you now.

346
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,100
Yu Sifeng,

347
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,060
I regret meeting you.

348
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,140
Xuanji.

349
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,500
I regret taking the brunt for you at Fuyu Island.

350
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,580
I regret loving you.

351
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,980
I regret everything that happened between us.

352
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,970
♫ <i> There is overabundance of joy in this world </i> ♫

353
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:36,540
♫ <i> Waiting for me to grow up, to capture the wisdom </i> ♫

354
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,380
I'd rather...

355
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,900
not have anything to do with you, ever!

356
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,660
Sifeng!

357
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,340
Sifeng.

358
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:58,820
♫ <i> Time and time again, faith is broken by destiny </i> ♫

359
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,220
♫ <i> Each and every sound is me </i> ♫

360
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,400
I finally understand...

361
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:11,450
why my past nine lives ended so.

362
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:17,950
♫ <i> You don't know where you're going until <br> you've been heartbroken </i> ♫

363
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,760
♫ <i> Concealed feelings deep in one's heart </i> ♫

364
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,420
♫ <i> The longing to return home is a cherished desire </i> ♫

365
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,420
Chu Xuanji...

366
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,680
♫ <i> My time has not been wasted </i> ♫

367
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,920
...you are after all a heartless woman.

368
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,200
If I don't have a heart,

369
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,060
I won't feel pain.

370
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,789
For the years to come

371
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:50,280
and even the lives to come,

372
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,220
I don't want to see you again.

373
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,939
Sifeng, stop messing around.

374
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:19,120
You're dying!

375
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,739
God of War, to think I treated you as a friend for the past 1,000 years.

376
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:27,380
Has time dulled your wits?

377
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,160
You're a bore.

378
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,360
A real bore!

379
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,440
Sifeng, let's go.

380
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,777
Hao Chen.

381
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:47,699
- Hao Chen! <br> - Sect Leader!

382
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,360
Sect Leader!

383
00:27:57,393 --> 00:27:59,873
- Sect Leader! <br> - Hao Chen!

384
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,500
Hao Chen!

385
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,559
Sect Leader!

386
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,719
Hao Chen!

387
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,980
Sect Leader!

388
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,390
<i>[IN MEMORY OF HAO CHEN]</i>

389
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,460
<i>Xuanji, do you really want to practice martial arts?</i>

390
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,359
<i>Will you follow me to Xuyang Peak for training?</i>

391
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,799
<i>Xuyang Peak?</i>

392
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,559
<i>You were born with the talent of eradicating demons.</i>

393
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,940
<i>You are also destined to guard the secret ground.</i>

394
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,750
<i>Senior, what does it mean to guard the secret ground?</i>

395
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:09,779
<i>It is a mission borne by us, the disciples of Xuyang Peak.</i>

396
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:14,520
<i>Our task is to guard the secret ground with our lives.</i>

397
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,199
<i>You are the God of War, the nemesis of evil.</i>

398
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,780
<i>You shouldn't have fallen for him.</i>

399
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,720
<i>You were just misguided by mortal desires.</i>

400
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:32,540
<i>It was he who planted the seed of pain in you.</i>

401
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,899
<i>That's right.</i>

402
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:42,920
<i>I am the Devil Star, Demon Maleficent.</i>

403
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,580
<i>You think I'm just here for the Crystal Lamp,</i>

404
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:52,260
<i>but I'm actually here to kill the God of War.</i>

405
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,799
<i>Xuanji, have you forgotten about your mother and master's deaths?</i>

406
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:01,687
<i>Have you forgotten about Martial Aunt Yinghong's injury?</i>

407
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:07,000
<i>Do you want to see him wreak havoc or attack our brethren instead?</i>

408
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,800
<i>Yu Sifeng, you broke your promise again.</i>

409
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,579
<i>Is there any shred of truth in your words?</i>

410
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:24,519
<i>He's the one who should die.</i>

411
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:26,939
<i>Xuanji, don't mind us!</i>

412
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:29,686
<i>Seize this chance and kill the Devil Star!</i>

413
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:32,847
<i>Kill the sinful demons in Lize Palace once and for all!</i>

414
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,260
<i>Why didn't you listen to me?</i>

415
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,540
<i>Everything has gone so awry now.</i>

416
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,180
<i>Promise me.</i>

417
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,359
<i>Destroy the Crystal Lamp.</i>

418
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,519
<i>Don't let the demons get their way.</i>

419
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,475
<i>I promise you!</i>

420
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:52,059
<i>I promise you, Senior!</i>

421
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:55,260
<i>- Senior! <br> - Sect Leader!</i>

422
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,720
Senior Hao Chen,

423
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,300
I'm sorry.

424
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,800
Everything started because of the Crystal Lamp.

425
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,860
<i>It's all the lamp's fault.</i>

426
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,563
<i>I will destroy it.</i>

427
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:14,880
<i>[IN MEMORY OF HAO CHEN]</i>

428
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,259
Where are we?

429
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,639
We are at Fenru City's Path of Reincarnation.

430
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,160
You're already dead.

431
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Don't jest, Brother Wu.

432
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,419
I say, you punk.

433
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:46,979
You didn't even strike back when that girl was about to kill you.

434
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:48,940
You're a fool, aren't you?

435
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,340
I'm probably the biggest fool in the whole wide world.

436
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:02,439
In the end, it was all wishful thinking on my part.

437
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:04,559
So what's your plan next?

438
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,400
Are you really ignoring her?

439
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,060
She said she regrets meeting me.

440
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,540
She regrets everything that happened between us.

441
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,040
What else can I say?

442
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,180
Let's go back to Lize Palace.

443
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:27,840
I have much work to do there.

444
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,500
Sure.

445
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,259
The Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook are wailing.

446
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:44,300
Something must be happening to the soul of the Devil Star.

447
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,620
It's in danger.

448
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,440
The soul of the Devil Star is sealed inside the Crystal Lamp.

449
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,840
Who can touch the Crystal Lamp

450
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,660
and threaten the Devil Star?

451
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,320
The God of War.

452
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:11,359
Before he died, Hao Chen told Xuanji to destroy the Crystal Lamp

453
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,760
and erase the soul of the Devil Star.

454
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,880
If the soul of the Devil Star were so easily destroyed,

455
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,939
those from the heavens would have struck a long time ago.

456
00:33:20,939 --> 00:33:22,699
They wouldn't have to wait till now.

457
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:24,299
Everything happens for a reason.

458
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:27,539
I think that shameless pact from the heavens

459
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:31,020
must have done something disastrous towards the soul of the Devil Star.

460
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,439
That's why the soul is filled with hatred.

461
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:36,139
It's indestructible.

462
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,200
Although Xuanji has the power of the God of War,

463
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,399
I think that even if she sacrifices herself,

464
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,200
she still can't destroy it.

465
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,460
Guard!

466
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,659
Yu Sifeng, you stubborn demon.

467
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,899
How dare you trespass again?

468
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:41,039
Move.

469
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:43,879
I cannot hurt the innocent. I want to save Xuanji!

470
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:45,100
Devil Star,

471
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
today is the day you die.

472
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,900
Don't you dare approach the Crystal Lamp!

473
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,820
Take him down!

474
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,060
Stop!

475
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,719
Stop! Listen, old man!

476
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,799
Xuanji can't destroy the soul of the Devil Star.

477
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:57,730
Look at her!

478
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,740
Xuanji...

479
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,180
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

480
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,180
<i>I won't let you off.</i>

481
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:40,539
Xuanji looks awful now.

482
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,339
- What should we do? <br> - Why is this happening?

483
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:43,659
Hao Chen did say that

484
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:46,379
Xuanji is the only one who can destroy the soul of the Devil Star.

485
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:49,080
Yu Sifeng, you must have done something!

486
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,599
I told you, he didn't!

487
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,939
What? You don't believe me?

488
00:35:52,939 --> 00:35:56,719
If that stinky woman destroys the soul of the Devil Star, she'll die as well.

489
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,019
Hao Chen said she's the only one who can destroy the soul

490
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:02,160
not because she's the God of War, but because...

491
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,300
Because what? Tell us.

492
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,908
She's the...

493
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,551
She's the one sealed inside...

494
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:18,279
Even the gods are forbidding me from speaking.

495
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,639
It's okay.

496
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,420
I have a jade inscription about the God of War.

497
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,720
Read it and you'll know.

498
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,000
I can't let them read it, either?

499
00:36:31,796 --> 00:36:35,579
You people from the heavens just love being sneaky and mysterious.

500
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,546
Shut up! Who do you think you are?

501
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:39,899
You have no right to comment on our affairs.

502
00:36:39,899 --> 00:36:43,273
If it weren't for Hao Chen's interference...

503
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:45,089
Hao Chen?

504
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:47,559
How did Hao Chen know that Xuanji

505
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,800
is the only one who can destroy the soul of the Devil Star?

506
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,219
Xuanji!

507
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:05,220
Stop him!

508
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,160
Fool, you can't beat him!

509
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,842
- Let me go. <br> - Don't risk yourself!

510
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,139
I can't afford to wait!

511
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:44,019
You can't do anything, Sifeng!

512
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:47,819
Who is she? No one can battle him other than she herself.

513
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:51,019
No, there must be another way.

514
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,760
I can't let her die like this!

515
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,200
Teng She! Teng She!

516
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,520
I know you have another solution.

517
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,320
Tell me!

518
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,779
The Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook. It used to be a part of the Devil Star.

519
00:38:13,779 --> 00:38:16,579
You can absorb its powers to battle the Crystal Lamp.

520
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:19,059
No, Sifeng, you're not a demon.

521
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:21,379
You can't absorb all the powers in the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook.

522
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:23,300
This monkey has a point.

523
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,019
If you do that, the weapons' powers will kill you.

524
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:29,440
I have only one question! What's the procedure?

525
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,840
Tell me!

526
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,779
The Rose Gold Birds absorb energy below the ribs, right?

527
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:39,099
Stab the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook there.

528
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:40,879
Shut up, you stupid snake!

529
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:42,219
I won't let you do this, Sifeng.

530
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:46,099
Brother Wu, you promised me three favors.

531
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,739
I can't let you die!

532
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:50,760
Brother Wu, I'm begging you!

533
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,180
Fine.

534
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,180
I can't stop you if that's what you wish.

535
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,180
Xuanji. Xuanji!

536
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:54,100
Oh no! The soul of the Devil Star is about to gush out from the Crystal Lamp!

537
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,959
Teng She, please take care of Xuanji.

538
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,800
Sifeng, are you trying to kill yourself?

539
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,820
He's using his wings to reseal the Crystal Lamp.

540
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:20,039
Sifeng. Sifeng!

541
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,720
I'm fine.

542
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,040
Teng She.

543
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,620
Don't tell her what happened today.

544
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,660
Please.

545
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,300
From now on,

546
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,500
she is just a woman called Chu Xuanji.

547
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,180
Brother Wu, let's go.

548
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,540
Very well, Sifeng.

549
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,659
The Devil Star will bring calamity someday.

550
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:29,619
They must still be near! Let's go!

551
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:31,019
You're an idiotic bunch!

552
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:33,959
Can't you understand? What are you after now?

553
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:35,959
It was Sifeng who saved Xuanji.

554
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:39,980
It was also Sifeng who resealed the Crystal Lamp that you almost opened.

555
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,659
It was also Sifeng who killed Yuan Lang

556
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:44,660
so he wouldn't release the Devil Star and destroy the three realms.

557
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:48,019
Right now, you're still standing here, and all is peaceful in the three realms.

558
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:51,159
And it was Sifeng the demon who mended your mistakes.

559
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,619
If he were the Devil Star, what can he get from this?

560
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:56,040
Can't you think about it?

561
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,220
It's over.

562
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,340
It's all over.

563
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:28,088
You haven't told me where my sister was.

564
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,480
How can you die like that?

565
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:06,100
I deceived the elders and our clansmen.

566
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,420
I no longer have the spiritual power to lead the Rose Gold Birds.

567
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,120
Elder Luo, I shall leave this in your hands.

568
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:17,060
No, please don't.

569
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,759
It is often said that we Rose Gold Birds are violent and bloodthirsty,

570
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:27,619
but we want nothing other than a peaceful life.

571
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:32,379
It's just that our pact with the demons still stands.

572
00:45:32,379 --> 00:45:36,019
Of course, we need to follow through with our promise.

573
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:38,339
Just now, you mentioned that you were not the Demon Lord,

574
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:39,860
and you do not intend to destroy the three realms,

575
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,700
so we do not have to fight for it.

576
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,820
This is a huge relief for all of us.

577
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,579
You are still the 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird,

578
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:52,179
and you've been planning the best for our clansmen,

579
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:56,839
seeking a safe sanctuary for us to live in.

580
00:45:56,839 --> 00:46:03,920
May I ask if there's anyone else who can lead the Rose Gold Birds?

581
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,619
You should keep the medallions.

582
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:12,520
Elder Luo, actually, I...

583
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,980
That's enough.

584
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,739
Our clan still acknowledges you as our leader.

585
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:20,259
Why are you still denying it?

586
00:46:20,259 --> 00:46:23,060
Exactly, so please don't worry.

587
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:27,259
I will manage the clan with the other three elders

588
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:29,199
and await your return.

589
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:31,740
I shall take my leave.

590
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:42,420
I wanted to pass this position to Elder Luo.

591
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,100
Eldest Brother Liu, why did you stop me?

592
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,020
If I didn't stop you,

593
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,799
I had to see you bang your head on the wall, put a Lover's Curse on yourself,

594
00:46:51,799 --> 00:46:55,279
and pretend to be the Devil Star until you're half-dead.

595
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,579
Now, I even have to see you pass all your duties to someone

596
00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:02,579
and find a place to die alone.

597
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:06,140
Isn't that what you're thinking, Little Phoenix?

598
