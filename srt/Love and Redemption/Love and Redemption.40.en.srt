<i>[EPISODE 40]</i>

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,910
I've told you enough.

19
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,504
Why don't you show me your sincerity as well?

20
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:42,186
I'll tell you my goal after that.

21
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,370
So, what exactly do you want me to do?

22
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:52,418
Go to the Demon Citadel

23
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:57,390
and save Wu Zhiqi with the power of the 12 Feathers.

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,898
Mortals and demons are enemies because they're equal in strength.

25
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:07,884
But if the demons grow much stronger,

26
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:11,740
no mortals will dare to disobey us.

27
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,007
So, by that time,

28
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:19,110
that silly girl will be together with you naturally.

29
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,650
Do you think I'm in the dark because you didn't tell me the truth?

30
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,639
After the Demon Citadel was destroyed by the heavens,

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,413
it was filled with deadly anguish. It is a death trap.

32
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:32,564
You just want to send me to my grave.

33
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,080
You have no right to talk about Xuanji and me when you're this selfish.

34
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,382
I'm doing this for your sake.

35
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:45,820
If you don't help out the demon clan, next time,

36
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,990
you'll die by her sword when she masters her powers.

37
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,808
It'll be too late for you to regret it by then.

38
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,527
Scram.

39
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,890
Think about it.

40
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,660
Seems like he's getting more and more ambitious.

41
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,520
Elder Luo, how's the situation in Lize Palace?

42
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:28,860
He forced everyone to join Tianxu Hall.

43
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,580
For those who disobey his orders, he'll either put them in cells

44
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,170
or execute them immediately.

45
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,295
Please pass this message to everyone.

46
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,350
Tianxu Hall is powerful now.

47
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,099
We need to compromise with them, and save our strength.

48
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,874
We shouldn't sacrifice ourselves for nothing.

49
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:50,010
Now, I know what his next plan is.

50
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,820
Give me some time to think of a solution.

51
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,970
I will surely protect our clan.

52
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,603
Yes.

53
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,552
These four stupid chains!

54
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,410
Palace Master, you've absorbed 80 souls.

55
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,096
It's finally working after absorbing so many souls.

56
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:49,570
Now, we just need another 19 souls to complete it.

57
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,418
You can absorb the God of War's power if you complete the Soul Furnace?

58
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,516
Are you interested as well?

59
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,420
The God of War is mighty. I can't absorb her powers by using the Soul Furnace alone.

60
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,620
We need to set up a formation as well.

61
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,490
And I'm the only one who knows how to set up that formation.

62
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,356
Only I can use the God of War's powers.

63
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,300
Ruo Yu,

64
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,790
I don't dare to do so!

65
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,510
I've always been loyal to you, Master.

66
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:34,168
I will never betray you.

67
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:35,660
Rise now.

68
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,555
Thank you, Master.

69
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:39,559
Of course, I will succeed.

70
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,630
I've planned this for over 1,000 years.

71
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,435
I've located the God of War and awakened her powers.

72
00:06:47,435 --> 00:06:50,174
Everything is according to the plan.

73
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,340
We need Yuntian Hoop and Chehai Hook to unseal the Crystal Cup.

74
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,057
But when we unseal the Crystal Cup,

75
00:06:57,057 --> 00:07:02,100
the immense pressure of Devil Star will turn us into dust.

76
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,650
We'll only be fine if we have God of War's power.

77
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,950
And only her powers can fight against the Devil Star's power.

78
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,810
I'm not reviving the Devil Star for him to become our leader.

79
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,370
He can only obey me.

80
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,580
So, Palace Master, you've planned for this all along.

81
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,848
But now you need Yu Sifeng to enter the Demon Citadel.

82
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:29,247
I'm afraid he won't do so.

83
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,050
Even I can't enter the Demon Citadel now.

84
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,900
Yu Sifeng is our only chance because he has the 12 Feathers bloodline.

85
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,100
I wouldn't have kept him alive if it weren't for that.

86
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,980
The chains trapping Wu Zhiqi

87
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,759
will only show up when Fenru City's gate opens on the 15th day of next month.

88
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,933
I'm sure he'll agree before that.

89
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,472
Yes.

90
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,824
Master, I have another favor to ask of you. I hope you can help me.

91
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,070
My younger sister has not feeling well lately.

92
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,110
Can I...

93
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,550
Do you think this is the time for that?

94
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,059
What you need to do now is to monitor Chu Xuanji's movement

95
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:23,439
- so that I can acquire her powers. <br> - Yes.

96
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,345
After you complete your task,

97
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:28,260
I will arrange for you two to reunite.

98
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,524
Yes.

99
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:33,875
Now, we need to think of a way to deal with Chu Xuanji.

100
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,080
You two weren't even here when I was still in Lize Palace!

101
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,414
What's going on?

102
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:45,300
Old Luo! It's me, Liu Yi Huan!

103
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,446
Why have you returned?

104
00:08:47,446 --> 00:08:51,163
Can't I even pay my condolences to the old palace master?

105
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,699
These two scoundrels won't let me in!

106
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,380
I was an elder, too, you know?

107
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,850
Old Luo, help me out.

108
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,106
Let him in.

109
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:01,797
- But the new palace master said... <br> - No buts!

110
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,779
Old Luo, you have a short temper, but you're helping me out today. What a rare sight.

111
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:10,039
I'll treat you to a drink next time.

112
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,419
Sifeng is close with you. I hope you can console him.

113
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,422
Where's that kid?

114
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:20,979
He's in the wake in our Clan Hall.

115
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,300
Today is the seventh day after his passing.

116
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,050
It's time for him to come out. Follow me.

117
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,150
It has been seven days. It's time for us to bury his coffin.

118
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,924
Wait! I haven't paid my respects yet!

119
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,989
Palace Master! I'm here to pay my respects.

120
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:54,440
Why did you leave us like that?

121
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,040
I still have many things left unsaid, you know?

122
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,670
Palace Master!

123
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,030
I'm here to wail,

124
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,320
and I'm very shy.

125
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,970
You wait outside.

126
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,638
Hurry!

127
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,809
Will you cry for me if I can't cry later?

128
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,370
Those who are outside can leave as well.

129
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,070
Palace Master!

130
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,887
Eldest Brother Liu,

131
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,999
are you here to pay your condolences?

132
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,630
Of course not. I'm here to find you.

133
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,299
I'm here to find you.

134
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,540
Purple Fox has a message for you.

135
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,072
Xuanji wants to meet you at Qingmu Town by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

136
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:13,119
Xuanji? She's willing to meet me?

137
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,430
Why should I lie to you?

138
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,159
Both of you are suffering because of each other.

139
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,596
Since you're suffering, why don't you meet her and explain everything?

140
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,888
So are you going or not?

141
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,749
Look at you. You've been here the entire day, staring at that stupid hairpin.

142
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,608
Fine then.

143
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,230
Stinky woman, if you miss Little Chef that much, you should find him.

144
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,520
Honestly speaking, he's a great cook.

145
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,960
I'm sure he's not a bad guy.

146
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:12,168
Senior Xuanji!

147
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:16,200
A lady wearing a purple dress wanted me to give you this lantern.

148
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,677
Thank you.

149
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,507
<i>[7:00 A.M., QINGMU TOWN]</i>

150
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,136
- Teng She. <br> - What are you doing?

151
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:35,066
Hey, do you want to try every food around Shaoyang Peak?

152
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,159
Of course I do.

153
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,001
Okay. Do me a favor first.

154
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,262
It's 7:00 a.m. already. Why isn't Xuanji here yet?

155
00:12:58,262 --> 00:13:00,280
I've sent the lantern to Shaoyang Sect.

156
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,810
Xuanji will definitely come.

157
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,379
How could you be sure? What if she changes her mind?

158
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,347
That's possible as well.

159
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:10,020
You're such a wet blanket.

160
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,610
Don't speak. Just wait and see.

161
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,020
<i>What's with your face?</i>

162
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,926
<i>I learned how to cook this from my neighbor.</i>

163
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:30,226
<i>This is my first time cooking it.</i>

164
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,490
<i>Sifeng, you must eat more.</i>

165
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,140
♫ <i> It's the sun that always causes problems from nothing </i> ♫

166
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:40,230
<i>So, this is how it feels like to love someone.</i>

167
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,313
<i>Please don't scare me anymore, okay?</i>

168
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:45,700
<i>Please don't ever leave me.</i>

169
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,060
<i>Xuanji, I will stay by your side forever.</i>

170
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,558
<i>Forever.</i>

171
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:54,204
<i>Sifeng, you're even jealous of my spirit beast?</i>

172
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:58,414
<i>So what if I'm jealous? I can be jealous of anyone.</i>

173
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,730
<i>Next time, I want a kiss as a consolation.</i>

174
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:13,190
♫ <i> I thought I could pretend, pretend to not love you</i> ♫

175
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:18,920
♫ <i> Because I thought I didn't want, want to hurt </i> ♫

176
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,910
♫ <i> Yet the passing years so turbulent </i> ♫

177
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,320
♫ <i> Things change with every passing second </i> ♫

178
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,210
♫ <i> Every single drop of yearning I feel is clear </i> ♫

179
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,290
♫ <i> Who cares how absurd it is? </i> ♫

180
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:40,660
♫ <i> As the autumn winds blow, see that the geese <br>have embarked on their journey </i> ♫

181
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:49,250
♫ <i> It's only a step away </i> ♫

182
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,919
We shouldn't see each other in the first place.

183
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,039
If my father knew about this, he would be disappointed in me.

184
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,486
Let's speak like this.

185
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,627
I'm sorry.

186
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:07,510
I've always wanted to tell you the truth.

187
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,050
It must've been shocking for you.

188
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,190
Why did you hide it from me then?

189
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,610
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

190
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,610
I've always wanted to tell you my true identity.

191
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:23,566
But everything happened at the same time before I got the chance to tell you the truth.

192
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:28,070
I swear that this is the only thing that I've hidden from you.

193
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,020
But that is the most important thing to me.

194
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,780
Sifeng, what I only care about is

195
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,025
the fact that the person I trusted the most deceived me, you understand?

196
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:41,188
Xuanji,

197
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,122
I'm sorry.

198
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,539
I will never deceive you in the future.

199
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:53,586
Nor will I hide anything else from you.

200
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,079
Let me ask you this. How much did you know about Yuan Lang's scheme?

201
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,155
And did you participate in his scheme?

202
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:05,007
Yuan Lang?

203
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,567
Are you talking about Deputy Chief?

204
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:09,898
Was he involved in this as well?

205
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:12,039
Yuan Lang is the Deputy Chief of Lize Palace.

206
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,950
He's the leader of Tianxu Hall as well. Purple Fox discovered that.

207
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,042
So, that's the case.

208
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,550
It's no wonder he was acting so mysteriously.

209
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,964
Yuan Lang wants to save Wu Zhiqi by using the spirit keys.

210
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:26,185
And he wants to revive the Devil Star.

211
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,130
Did you participate in his scheme?

212
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,210
I have never participated in his scheme.

213
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,640
We were on the same page before Dianjing Valley Sect held the Hairpin Tournament.

214
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,955
I didn't know Lize Palace was involved in Tianxu Hall's evil scheme.

215
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:42,626
I didn't know about their plans.

216
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:47,220
I didn't even know that my master was my father.

217
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,370
I knew something was wrong during the night before the Hairpin Tournament.

218
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,910
My father was used by Deputy Chief. I tried to trap them!

219
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,710
But in the end,

220
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,278
I still failed.

221
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,658
I know everything I'm saying now seems like an excuse to you.

222
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:06,547
But, Xuanji,

223
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,850
can you believe in me?

224
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:16,781
I believe in you.

225
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,651
So,

226
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,699
can I see your face?

227
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,403
No!

228
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,140
The two of them finally have the chance to see each other.

229
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,818
But why aren't they hugging each other? I don't understand.

230
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:41,936
An old fox like you doesn't know anything about mortals.

231
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,528
This is the delight of life.

232
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,159
Staring at each other with passionate eyes.

233
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:49,039
You're jealous, aren't you?

234
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,886
Little Phoenix is an affectionate man indeed.

235
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:57,715
It's tough being a mortal.

236
00:17:57,715 --> 00:18:00,785
But he still insists on being one.

237
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:03,740
Wu Zhiqi told me before that being a mortal is great.

238
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,284
The mortal realm is prosperous, filled with blue skies and white clouds.

239
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:10,288
Full of songs and dances, filled with amazing events.

240
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:12,490
It's a dazzling realm.

241
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,110
But I think that's not important.

242
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:19,594
Sifeng,

243
00:18:20,755 --> 00:18:22,620
I do believe in you.

244
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,476
But...

245
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:28,250
that doesn't mean everything has been solved.

246
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,026
That time,

247
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:34,813
I witnessed my mother's death personally!

248
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:38,787
She was burned to death by deadly anguish!

249
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,390
And your father was the murderer!

250
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,495
If you were in my shoes,

251
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,710
could you treat it as if nothing had happened?

252
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,683
My father, he did commit too many mistakes

253
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:03,823
due to his obsession.

254
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:09,175
And now he's dead because of it.

255
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:13,110
But, Xuanji, my father didn't murder your mother.

256
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,627
Yuan Lang, the Deputy Chief, murdered her.

257
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,216
Yuan Lang?

258
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,326
What did you say just now?

259
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:33,360
Say that again.

260
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,730
Yuan Lang admitted that himself.

261
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,736
I know I have no proof,

262
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:42,690
and Shaoyang Sect won't believe me without any proof.

263
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:48,710
You said your mother was burned to death.

264
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,426
I think I know how to investigate this matter now.

265
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:56,367
Xuanji, please give me some time.

266
00:19:56,368 --> 00:20:00,015
I will get to the bottom of this, and I'll bring the true culprit to you.

267
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,136
By that time,

268
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:04,826
I will stand in front of you

269
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:09,120
and you can punish me however you want for my deceit.

270
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,609
I won't punish you!

271
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,252
Sifeng, I don't need you to do anything!

272
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,439
I just want you to leave Lize Palace and stay with me!

273
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:17,308
I want you to return to Shaoyang Sect with me so that my father can believe in you!

274
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:21,949
As for the true culprit, we can just investigate it together!

275
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,463
Xuanji,

276
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,783
now I can't just... do nothing about the situation.

277
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,870
Before my father passed away, he told me to

278
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,100
protect the members of our clan in Lize Palace.

279
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,701
Now, Yuan Lang is the new palace master.

280
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:48,788
If I leave,

281
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:52,250
he'll manipulate my clan members and use them as killing machines.

282
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:57,140
My clan isn't evil.

283
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,497
So I can't just leave them behind.

284
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:06,840
Can you really change them?

285
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,413
What if, one day,

286
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:12,513
you become as evil as the demons of Tianxu Hall?

287
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,416
If that does happen,

288
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,390
please kill me.

289
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,390
<i>[Support and cherish each other until the end, mandarin ducks (lovers) die together]</i>

290
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,785
Kill you?

291
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,010
You want me to kill you?

292
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,639
Do you know this?

293
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,980
Every sect knows that I'm the God of War now,

294
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,187
and they want me to lead them to exterminate the demons.

295
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:11,820
Lize Palace is the first thing on their mind!

296
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,039
Lize Palace and Tianxu Hall have killed too many people in the Dianjing Valley Sect.

297
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,100
Their sins will never be undone!

298
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,063
I can't and I won't stop hunting Lize Palace just because you say that

299
00:22:22,063 --> 00:22:25,380
not all demons in Lize Palace are evil!

300
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,759
When my sword points toward Lize Palace,

301
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,700
when my Dingkun Sword points at your face,

302
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,602
what do you want me to do by then?

303
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:34,890
Are you going to fight me?

After that, I will give the sects an answer

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,910
and I'll bear the sins of Lize Palace.

317
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,815
I just hope that

318
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,968
you can wait for me.

319

♫ <i> If life is uninspired and relentless </i> ♫

320
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,680
♫ <i> Even obsessions can be destroyed </i> ♫

321
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,460
♫ <i> Would there have been less mistakes made </i> ♫

322
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,900
Let me think about it.

323
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,170
I'll give you an answer tomorrow.

324
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,479
Okay.

325
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,870
I'll wait for your answer.

326
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,800
But, Xuanji, remember this.

327
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,290
No matter what you choose,

328
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,750
you will never change in my heart.

329
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,320
♫ <i> Choosing blindness before having freedom </i> ♫

330

332
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,380
Why did Xuanji run away while crying?

333
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,600
Did the deal go wrong?

334
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,998
Are you sure you're a Rose Gold Bird? You're more like a crow.

335
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:36,904
Just shut up.

336
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,764
Master and the rest have returned to Shaoyang Sect.

337
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:48,080
It's bad for us to go there now.

338
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,660
Don't worry about Xuanji.

339
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:53,151
I'm sure everyone will take care of her.

340
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,959
I'll buy some noodles in front.

341
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,060
Why don't you go to the fabric store

342
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,520
and see if there's anything you want to buy?

343
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,170
We'll decorate our home together later.

344
00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:07,550
Okay.

345
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,964
Take care. Please come again.

346
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:18,644
Miss, please have a look inside.

347
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:20,563
Goodbye.

348
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,879
Shopkeeper.

349
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,119
Miss, what kind of fabric are you looking for?

350
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,708
Is there anything I can use to make a bedsheet?

351
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,597
Yes.

352
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,139
Valley Master insisted on sending us here to follow the Shaoyang Sect.

353
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:41,940
He wants us to follow the God of War.

354
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,260
We left in a hurry. We didn't even have time to pack our clothes.

355
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,236
Shopkeeper!

356
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:48,327
Hello, gentlemen.

357
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:49,779
Do you sell silk cloth here?

358
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,331
Of course we do.

359
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:53,342
But please wait a moment.

360
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,878
I need to give this to that lady.

361
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:57,439
Wait.

362
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,881
I think this fabric is quite good. It's suitable for us.

363
00:25:59,882 --> 00:26:01,064
Wrap it up for us.

364
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:06,624
Sir, that lady placed an order before you.

365
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,822
I thought it was someone else.

366
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:14,480
So, it's the young lady of the Shaoyang Sect.

367
00:26:15,127 --> 00:26:16,361
Wait.

368
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:19,100
I heard that she has been kicked out of the sect.

369
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,233
What was the reason again?

370
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,340
- Shopkeeper. <br> - Miss.

371
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,284
Thank you, Miss.

372
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,379
Didn't you hear me?

373
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,077
This fabric is ours.

374
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:35,960
Step aside.

375
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,079
She's scary, huh?

376
00:26:38,824 --> 00:26:41,535
Why didn't you act like this while you were together with demons?

377
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:44,039
You only like demons?

378
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,080
Humans are not that bad, you know?

379
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,877
- Is that so? <br> - Yes.

380
00:26:47,878 --> 00:26:49,719
Look.

381
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,170
Don't fight!

382
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,060
You thought you were a real young lady?

383
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,519
In our eyes, you're worse than a village girl.

384
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,759
Even village girls know how to keep their chastity intact.

385
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,143
Shut up!

386
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:24,649
This is my mouth.

387
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:26,604
I can say anything I want.

388
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:29,180
Moreover, you fooled around with demons before.

389
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,195
Are you afraid people might tease you?

390
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,727
Are you tired of living?

391
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:57,970
Look who's here.

392
00:27:57,971 --> 00:28:00,580
It's Zhong Minyan, the traitor of the Shaoyang Sect.

393
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,939
Seems like you're the only guy in the world

394
00:28:02,939 --> 00:28:06,309
who would fall for a woman like Chu Linglong.

395
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,600
Scram!

396
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,130
Let's go.

397
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,110
Linglong, are you okay?

398
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,302
I'm fine.

399
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,330
Linglong!

400
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,635
Linglong!

401
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,522
Do you remember what I said before?

402
00:28:54,522 --> 00:28:56,692
You didn't do anything wrong.

403
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:59,661
Don't torture yourself because of their words.

404
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:02,302
But in the end, I still hear their words.

405
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm not the past me anymore.

406
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,361
I can't hide from them.

407
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,918
In my eyes, you're Chu Linglong, the person I love the most.

408
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,060
There's no difference between the past and the present you.

409
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,530
Linglong, I'm beside you.

410
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,820
You don't need to hide.

411
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,928
Do you know

412
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:29,180
what I dream of every night?

413
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,790
It's Wu Tong.

414
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,380
It's like he was implanted in my brain!

415
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,044
I can't avoid him!

416
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:41,580
There's no place for me to hide!

417
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,478
Linglong, that's not you.

418
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:45,440
Don't think about it anymore.

419
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,960
But the images I see are so clear and vivid.

420
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,279
I can't avoid him. I can't avoid him!

421
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,960
Linglong, I'm here.

422
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,800
Don't be afraid.

423
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,761
Don't be afraid.

424
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,820
I will help you to forget him. I will help you to forget him.

425
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,233
Linglong.

426
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,010
Linglong.

427
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,780
I'm here.

428
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,080
Don't be afraid.

429
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,811
I'm around.

430
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,436
Linglong.

431
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,092
Linglong.

432
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:59,820
<i>If you stay by my side, you'll be despised no matter where you go.</i>

433
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,940
<i>Unless I die,</i>

434
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,620
<i>I'll never be able to escape Wu Tong.</i>

435
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,325
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

436
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,790
<i>See you in my next life.</i>

437
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,383
Linglong.

438
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,352
Linglong!

439
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,040
What happened?

440
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,440
Master, Linglong is missing.

441
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,919
- How did that happen? <br> - She was teased in town yesterday,

442
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,505
and she left without a word this morning.

443
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,833
Master, please help me find Linglong.

444
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:13,159
Lead my men and search the area.

445
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,619
- Okay. All of you, follow me. <br> - Yes.

446
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,674
Sect Leader.

447
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,537
Your injuries haven't healed yet. You better rest.

448
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,703
Linglong is a generous and forgiving girl.

449
00:32:31,703 --> 00:32:34,553
What exactly did she suffer?

450
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,270
How did this happen?

451
00:32:40,235 --> 00:32:45,805
- Senior! <br> - Linglong!

452
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:47,700
- Senior Linglong! <br> - Senior!

453
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,779
Linglong, where are you?

454
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,310
- Senior! <br> - Senior!

455
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,620
- Senior! <br> - Senior!

456
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,193
- Senior, where are you? <br> - Linglong!

457
00:32:55,193 --> 00:32:57,863
- Senior! <br> - Senior!

458
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,620
Where is Senior Linglong?

459
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,079
In the past, she would hide in places we couldn't find when she was angry.

460
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,909
We never found her.

461
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,300
I'm such a fool.

462
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,281
- Senior! <br> - Senior!

463
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,195
Duanjin Sword,

464
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,520
I've embarrassed the Shaoyang Sect.

465
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,540
I'll leave you here

466
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,570
so that you can slay more demons

467
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,810
and atone for my sins.

468
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,439
- Linglong! <br> - Let me go!

469
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,500
Can't I even choose to end my life over such a terrible fate?

470
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,377
Chu Linglong!

471
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,435
I thought you were only willful,

472
00:35:31,436 --> 00:35:33,524
but I didn't expect you to be this selfish!

473
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:34,902
Think about this carefully.

474
00:35:34,903 --> 00:35:37,444
How did you manage to stay alive after you were captured by Tianxu Hall?

475
00:35:37,444 --> 00:35:39,570
I risked my life to save you.

476
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,130
Second Senior sacrificed his life for you.

477
00:35:42,131 --> 00:35:43,948
Do you think you can die when you feel like it?

478
00:35:43,948 --> 00:35:45,768
Did you even ask me for my permission?

479
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,719
Don't you think you're letting down our second senior?

480
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,784
You've loved to serve justice ever since you were young.

481
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,875
But now, some other people are committing misdeeds.

482
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,680
Why didn't you go and punish them?

483
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:01,920
Why are you trying to punish us with your death instead?

484
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,390
Are you trying to let your father, Xuanji, and I suffer forever?

485
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,575
- It's not that. <br> - If you want to die, fine.

486
00:36:12,575 --> 00:36:14,620
I'll die as well.

487
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,980
I'll die in front of you.

488
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,180
I'll let you know how it feels to see your loved ones die before you.

489
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,321
No! Minyan! No!

490
00:36:23,322 --> 00:36:26,692
Minyan!

491
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,037
I'm sorry.

492
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,862
I'm sorry!

493
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:45,503
Please don't die. Please don't die.

494
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,896
Linglong,

495
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,430
I will always stay by your side

496
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,410
no matter what happens to you.

497
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,930
Please don't leave me behind.

498
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,600
You can't just sacrifice our happiness

499
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,430
because of something that didn't happen.

500
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,532
- Okay? <br> - Okay.

501
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:24,400
♫ <i> I still hope to continue with this entanglement </i> ♫

502
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,450
♫ <i> and wait for you </i> ♫

503
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,263
She's fine. She's unconscious because she was grieving too much.

504
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:51,734
She'll be fine after a few days.

505
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,638
It's all thanks to Minyan. It's lucky that he found her in time.

506
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:00,669
If not, she would've...

507
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,035
We'll let Xuanji accompany her.

508
00:38:05,036 --> 00:38:07,686
Maybe she'll feel better that way.

509
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,719
Where's Xuanji?

510
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,026
This is a huge matter, but Xuanji is not around at all.

511
00:38:16,026 --> 00:38:18,180
Didn't you tell her?

512
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,380
- Where's Xuanji? <br> - Don't touch me.

513
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,380
Can I say that I don't know?

514
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,759
Tell me!

515
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,970
Qingmu Town.

516
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,751
I was actually frightened by a mortal.

517
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:41,961
Is Xuanji's senior that scary in the first place?

518
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,278
Little Phoenix is pitiful indeed.

519
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:06,208
His father just died and Xuanji may become his enemy in the future.

520
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:12,937
The heavens are truly messing with him.

521
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,860
He's the 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird.

522
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,620
I think he was influenced by sentiments as he has been here for too long.

523
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,500
If he wants to be a demon, he should learn from Wu Zhiqi.

524
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,919
If I were Sifeng, I would've eloped with Xuanji.

525
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,570
The survival of Lize Palace has nothing to do with me.

526
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,560
It's easy for you to say.

527
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,935
Let me ask you.

528
00:39:34,935 --> 00:39:40,140
Sifeng chased after Xuanji in his previous nine lives,

529
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:42,199
but did he ever complain about it?

530
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,260
This time, he just wanted her to wait for a while, yet she's unhappy.

531
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,560
She even wanted Sifeng to follow her back and apologize to the other sects.

532
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,470
Being virtuous will cost him his life, you know?

533
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,693
Let me ask you this then.

534
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:58,799
Did the Rose Gold Bird clan kill Xuanji's mother?

535
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,439
Did the Rose Gold Bird hurt Xuanji's father?

536
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,654
Did the Rose Gold Bird clan slay many of their people?

537
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:07,339
If I were Xuanji, I would only be happy if all of them were dead.

538
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:09,739
Now she only wants Sifeng to follow her.

539
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:11,198
She's very magnanimous.

540
00:40:11,198 --> 00:40:12,346
She wants him to leave?

541
00:40:12,346 --> 00:40:14,599
Tell me. Where else can he go?

542
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,486
You said this yourself.

543
00:40:16,486 --> 00:40:21,570
The Deputy Chief is Yuan Lang, the leader of Tianxu Hall.

544
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:26,779
Now that he has all four spirit keys, the three realms will be in turmoil soon.

545
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:29,875
Yet you're asking him to leave Lize Palace and elope with Xuanji?

546
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:32,956
- What did you say? <br> - What?

547
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,437
Yuan Lang has obtained all four spirit keys?

548
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:41,822
Yes.

549
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:44,338
The three realms will be in turmoil soon.

550
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:47,473
Let's cherish our remaining days.

551
00:40:47,473 --> 00:40:50,496
<i>Yuan Lang is devious. He'll surely trick Wu Zhiqi again.</i>

552
00:40:50,496 --> 00:40:53,967
<i>I need to steal the spirit keys somehow.</i>

553
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:20,206
- Senior? <br> - Why are you here alone?

554
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,976
You don't need to tell me why.

555
00:41:24,976 --> 00:41:27,330
You're here to meet Yu Sifeng, right?

556
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,159
I just wanted to clarify things with him.

557
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,539
You saw his true form, the 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird personally.

558
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:37,200
He deceived you for so long, yet you still want to clarify things with him?

559
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,699
Senior,

560
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:40,464
Sifeng...

561
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,496
Although he's a demon, he has never hurt anyone.

562
00:41:43,496 --> 00:41:45,063
I believe in him.

563
00:41:45,063 --> 00:41:49,058
You know that he's a demon, yet you're still trying to defend him?

564
00:41:49,058 --> 00:41:51,208
Xuanji, when will you stop being so naive?

565
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:55,539
Do you think he's really in the dark about Lize Palace's scheme?

566
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:57,838
- Sifeng is... <br> - Enough!

567
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:00,359
I didn't expect you to not know the difference between what is good or evil.

568
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:03,590
You even ignored the basic rules of being a cultivator!

569
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:06,315
And you came to meet that demon in secret.

570
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:10,710
Xuanji, I'm too disappointed in you.

571
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,298
Fine.

572
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,832
I'll sever your ties with him now.

573
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,976
Senior, I'm sorry for this.

574
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,230
Xuanj, you actually attacked me because of a demon.

575
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,979
Senior, I'm sorry.

576
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:45,670
I don't want to do this. Please don't force me.

577
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,538
Fine.

578
00:42:47,538 --> 00:42:50,410
Since you've brought out your Ninth Heaven Fire,

579
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,003
there's no way for me to defeat you.

580
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,422
Just forget it.

581
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,387
But I didn't expect you

582
00:42:57,387 --> 00:43:02,317
to use the God of War's power just to protect a demon.

583
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,328
Linglong's reputation was ruined because of a demon,

584
00:43:07,328 --> 00:43:10,079
and she almost committed suicide because of it.

585
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,575
Yet you're here, fighting against me because of a demon.

586
00:43:12,575 --> 00:43:14,645
Committed suicide?

587
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,799
What's going on?

588
00:43:16,799 --> 00:43:19,732
Is Linglong okay? What exactly happened?

589
00:43:19,732 --> 00:43:25,423
Although her life is not in danger, her reputation was ruined.

590
00:43:25,423 --> 00:43:29,760
I'm afraid the trauma in her heart will never disappear.

591
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,977
Linglong...

592
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,529
I'll look for Linglong right away.

593
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,111
<i>Sifeng, wait for me.</i>

594
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,619
Linglong!

595
00:43:56,619 --> 00:43:58,257
Xuanji.

596
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,090
Why are you so silly? Are you trying to leave both Father and me behind?

597
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,519
I'm sorry.

598
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:07,066
How could you do such a silly thing because of a villain like that?

599
00:44:07,066 --> 00:44:08,491
What about Father and me?

600
00:44:08,491 --> 00:44:10,124
Sixth Senior will be very sad, you know?

601
00:44:10,124 --> 00:44:12,410
Xuanji, I've thought about it.

602
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,379
I won't do silly things anymore.

603
00:44:14,379 --> 00:44:17,239
I will stay alive and take my revenge against Wu Tong.

604
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:20,969
I will make him pay for all the humiliations I've faced.

605
00:44:20,969 --> 00:44:23,520
I'll avenge you.

606
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,575
I won't let Wu Tong or anyone from Tianxu Hall off.

607
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,928
And Sifeng as well.

608
00:44:32,928 --> 00:44:34,299
Sifeng is with them.

609
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:35,946
You mustn't show him mercy.

610
00:44:35,946 --> 00:44:38,784
Linglong, Sifeng has nothing to do with Tianxu Hall.

611
00:44:38,784 --> 00:44:41,539
Why didn't he return with you if he was innocent?

612
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:42,942
He–

613
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,131
It's because he's busy with something.

614
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:51,078
Xuanji, don't fall for his tricks again.

615
00:44:51,078 --> 00:44:53,227
He's just trying to acquire your trust.

616
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:55,318
He's trying to find another chance.

617
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:58,039
No! Sifeng isn't a person like that!

618
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:01,376
He told me that the only thing he lied to me about was his identity.

619
00:45:01,376 --> 00:45:03,879
That's the only time he lied to me. I believe in him.

620
00:45:03,879 --> 00:45:06,724
Xuanji, he's a demon.

621
00:45:06,724 --> 00:45:12,058
Even if he's not a part of Tianxu Hall, you two won't end well together.

622
00:45:12,058 --> 00:45:14,659
I'm your older sister. You should listen to me.

623
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,990
The people will forsake

624
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,310
those who affiliate themselves with demons.

625
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:27,419
I've embarrassed Father and Shaoyang Sect.

626
00:45:27,419 --> 00:45:29,313
You mustn't disappoint Father anymore.

627
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:31,704
You're the only one he can depend on now.

628
00:45:31,704 --> 00:45:35,616
You mustn't disappoint him. You mustn't follow my steps.

629
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,899
I won't go anywhere.

630
00:45:39,899 --> 00:45:41,619
I'll stay here and accompany you.

631
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:44,019
I'll stay here. I won't meet Sifeng.

632
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:47,927
If Sifeng did commit those atrocious deeds, I will never let him off.

633
00:45:47,927 --> 00:45:52,983
But if he's innocent,

634
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:56,499
please give him another chance. Okay?

635

♫ <i> There is overabundance of confusion </i> ♫

639
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:09,110
♫ <i> When you look at me, you'll understand </i> ♫
