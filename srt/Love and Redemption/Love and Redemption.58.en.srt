<i>You conspired with the Southern Lord</i>

<i>Where is my soul?</i>

31
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:17,199
<i>Isn't it good to be the God of War?</i>

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,197
<i>Fine.</i>

33
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,117
<i>All these years, I've lived in confusion.</i>

34
00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:28,459
<i>I didn't know where I was born or came from.</i>

35
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:31,699
<i>I had no name because you dared not mention it.</i>

36
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,953
<i>I had no family or friends</i>

37
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:37,859
<i>because you were afraid that I'd find out my origin.</i>

38
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:41,219
<i>And I never had one single soldier under my command.</i>

39
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,499
<i>You relied on my ability, and yet you're scared of me.</i>

40
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,870
<i>You're afraid that I'd recall everything, lead the army, and rebel against you!</i>

41
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:56,975
<i>In fact, the reason I'm so different is that I'm not myself.</i>

42
00:02:56,975 --> 00:03:00,980
<i>No wonder I felt upset whenever I killed an Asura,</i>

43
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,500
<i>because we came from the same clan!</i>

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,599
<i>And you, King Bailing, ordered me to kill them all!</i>

45
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,650
<i>Tell me. Why did you do that?</i>

46
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,260
<i>Are you sure you can control me forever?</i>

47
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,620
<i>You deceived me into becoming the God of War.</i>

48
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,860
<i>I have always trusted you.</i>

49
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,064
<i>How dare you and the heavens use me like this!</i>

50
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,019
<i>God of War!</i>

51
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,620
<i>You're being disobedient and rebellious. This is unpardonable!</i>

52
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,300
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>

53
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,860
<i>You are the ones in the wrong!</i>

54
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,300
<i>Ask the Heavenly Emperor to come and see me!</i>

55
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,860
<i>If not, I will burn the heavens down!</i>

56
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,299
<i>Even though you're a brave general,</i>

57
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,079
<i>you shouldn't have barged into the celestial hall and bawled at King Bailing!</i>

58
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,378
<i>This heaven, I can protect it</i>

59
00:03:58,378 --> 00:03:59,739
<i>and I can kill it.</i>

60
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,766
<i>How outrageous you are!</i>

61
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:02,616
<i>Take her down!</i>

62
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,420
<i>Bailing, I want you to explain yourself today!</i>

63
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,994
<i>Bailing, just you wait.</i>

64
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:35,799
<i>I will definitely take it back.</i>

65
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:38,260
<i>God of War! Enough!</i>

66
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,119
<i>Stop calling me God of War!</i>

67
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,620
<i>I will not let you go!</i>

68
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,944
<i>I will kill you.</i>

69
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:49,666
<i>I will kill all you rats and avenge myself!</i>

70
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,719
<i>The God of War is attempting a rebellion and revolting against the realm!</i>

71
00:04:57,719 --> 00:05:01,310
<i>Escort her to the Altar of Banishment at once!</i>

72
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,461
Yu Sifeng, do you see this?

73
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:25,259
This is the heavens that you wanted to protect.

74
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,659
They remain despicable

75
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:31,119
and they don't keep their word.

76
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:33,611
They keep spouting lies.

77
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,019
Heaven and Earth are the furnace, his copper, all things of creation.

78
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:47,579
In that case, let's throw everyone into the furnace for reformation.

79
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:52,430
Today, I am going to kill everyone in the heavens.

80
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,099
I shall reorder the three realms.

81
00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:01,770
Do you all think you can guard this Sea of Life and Death?

82
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,859
Yu Sifeng, just stay behind this barrier

83
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:07,045
- No. <br> - and watch how I kill them.

84
00:06:13,955 --> 00:06:15,605
No.

85
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,430
The Sea of Life and Death has receded.

86
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,059
Listen my fellow tribes! Let us storm the heavens!

87
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,799
Look. That's the Heavenly Emperor's manor.

88
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,239
Bailing, I'm here.

89
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,139
You can't go any further! You can't destroy the Transcendent Furnace!

90
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:48,819
And I won't allow you to talk the stinky woman into doing evil!

91
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:53,619
You must obey me because you are Chu Xuanji's spirit beast.

92
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:56,709
Otherwise, you will be punished.

93
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:59,033
The stinky woman is my one and only master.

94
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,699
You are not. Let her out now!

95
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,613
You used to be the spirit beast of Chu Xuanji.

96
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:07,339
I'm not going to kill you,

97
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,579
but that doesn't mean that you have the right to talk to me.

98
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:12,504
Scram!

99
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,279
Brother Maleficent, you're here.

100
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,643
I remember we once promised that we'd drink and talk every day.

101
00:09:48,643 --> 00:09:54,439
I didn't expect just a short while, a thousand years have passed.

102
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:58,499
Since we're gathering here today, why don't we catch up

103
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:02,047
so as to fulfill our promise of that year?

104
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,003
Do you think I'll still believe what you say, Bailing?

105
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:27,095
Brother Maleficent, can't you even catch up with me?

106
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:31,782
A cup of wine crippled me a thousand years ago.

107
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:35,899
If you were me, would you drink such tea again?

108
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:37,897
You worry too much.

109
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:41,039
Brother Maleficent, you're always on my mind.

110
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,499
That's why I came to advise you.

111
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:50,379
For the sake of our friendship from the heavens to the mortal realm, stop it.

112
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,709
Bailing, you lie too much. That's why you're deceiving yourself.

113
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,679
Have you ever looked down at your hands?

114
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,099
They're full of Chu Xuanji's blood,

115
00:11:00,099 --> 00:11:03,079
the blood of the God of War, and mine.

116
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,739
It's not dry yet.

117
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:09,500
All you want is a marionette you can control.

118
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,587
Today, I am going to take revenge against this blood feud!

119
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,059
I've been trying to save you for a thousand years,

120
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,899
but I can't get rid of your murderous thoughts.

121
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:34,132
It seems that Asuras are incurably murderous.

122
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,419
Forget it. Look! What is this?

123
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,439
Mirror of 36 Heavenly Spirits?

124
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,120
That's right.

125
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,199
This Mirror of 36 Heavenly Spirits restrains all kinds of demons

126
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,239
and gets rid of all kinds of evil thoughts.

127
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:01,300
Today, I am going to capture you with it,

128
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,424
and I hope you will abandon your murderous thoughts and repent!

129
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:20,980
Bailing, in the Sea of Life and Death,

130
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,859
I saw thousands of souls of Asuras who were killed.

131
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:26,620
They've been tortured by hatred for thousands of years,

132
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,059
and they've looked forward to avenging themselves.

133
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,219
You want us to abandon the murderous thoughts and repent?

134
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,859
Today, I will let them ask you this.

135
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:39,780
When will you reap what you sow?

136
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:50,613
Next, it's your turn.

137
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:54,739
Devil Maleficent, so what if you manage to destroy the mirror?

138
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:58,208
This is the Heavenly Central Hall, where the strongest of Heaven's law lies.

139
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,619
You can't even figure out where I am.

140
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:02,459
Don't you act outrageously here!

141
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,619
I know you're being protected by Heaven's law

142
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,459
and you think I can't hurt you.

143
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:11,039
But what a pity. Heaven's law was made when the world was created.

144
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,779
As long as I overturn the Transcendent Furnace and rewrite the rules,

145
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:16,839
you won't be able to hide yourself.

146
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,699
What a boaster you are!

147
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:21,619
The Transcendent Furnace is the root of the three realms.

148
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:24,059
There is no way you can find it!

149
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,903
Is it?

150
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:30,868
You seem to have forgotten that I was once the God of War of the heavens.

151
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:46,178
I happen to know how to make it show itself.

152
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,228
Stop it!

153
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,730
Stop it now!

154
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,601
Xuanji.

155
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,979
Who are you who've trespassed Mount Kunlun?

156
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:54,599
It's outrageous of you to come to Xi Wangmu's backyard.

157
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:57,499
If you disturb the Heavenly Emperor's rest,

158
00:16:57,499 --> 00:17:00,700
heavenly punishment will be meted out to you.

159
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,779
Heavenly officer, we came all the way here to report something to the Heavenly Emperor.

160
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:07,539
You're mouthy.

161
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:09,773
- Kick them out to the mortal realm. <br> - Yes!

162
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:11,219
Off to the mortal realm?

163
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:13,107
We walked a long way!

164
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:15,659
- It took a lot of effort to come up here! <br> - What are you waiting for?

165
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,978
Take all of them down!

166
00:17:16,978 --> 00:17:19,899
Old fogey, aren't you being unreasonable?

167
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:21,779
Bring it on then!

168
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,019
We're here to beg the Heavenly Emperor. We can't act recklessly.

169
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:27,519
But do we let them send us back to the mortal realm?

170
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,614
Since he said that we can't disturb Heavenly Emperor, we will then...

171
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,019
- Heavenly Emperor! <br> - Old Heavenly Emperor, come out!

172
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,500
- Heavenly Emperor, we're here to see you! <br> - Heavenly Emperor!

173
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,260
- Come out! <br> - Heavenly Emperor!

174
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,059
- We would like to see the Heavenly Emperor! <br> - Come out and see us!

175
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,079
- Come out now! <br> - Save us!

176
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,439
Take all of them down!

177
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,706
- We want to see the Heavenly Emperor! <br> - Come out, Old Heavenly Emperor!

178
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,319
<i>Lord Xuan Huo, let them see me.</i>

179
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,468
Heavenly Emperor, but they–

180
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:23,199
Heavenly Emperor, they are here.

181
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:41,004
We have here two mortals, two Rose Gold Birds, and a demon monkey.

182
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:43,260
What are you here for?

183
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,279
Heavenly Emperor, we're all family and friends of Chu Xuanji.

184
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:50,258
We came all the way to Mount Kunlun to ask for your help.

185
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,401
Chu Xuanji?

186
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,519
That lass who's the reincarnation of the God of War.

187
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,519
I remember that her power of the God of War has awakened.

188
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,159
The mortal realm is now invincible.

189
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,641
What else can I do for her?

190
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:09,179
The Crystal Lamp has been opened.

191
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,819
Xuanji has become the Devil Star, Devil Maleficent.

192
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,400
He's going to lead the demons and attack the heavens,

193
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,519
and he wants to reshape the three realms.

194
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,639
You must save the three realms, please.

195
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:20,559
And save Xuanji!

196
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,759
It is true that one reaps what one sows.

197
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:28,305
The time has finally come.

198
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,100
Heavenly Emperor, why are you still playing chess?

199
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,070
Because I have yet to figure out this game.

200
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,030
Heavenly Emperor, the three realms are going to be ruined.

201
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,559
Aren't you worried?

202
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,367
I once advised Bailing against it, but he insisted on doing so.

203
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:58,220
Thus, what is happening has come.

204
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,399
Everyone from the three realms is all in this calamity.

205
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,140
It's kind of you to worry about the people.

206
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,419
But Heaven's law made me the Heavenly Emperor.

207
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,759
I must obey the law.

208
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,690
Without a chance, I can't interfere with the fate of the three realms.

209
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,539
You should leave.

210
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,699
What is a chance?

211
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:21,619
We came all the way here to see you. Now that's a chance.

212
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:24,319
Both the mortal realms and sects are fighting against the Heaven Fire and rescuing the people.

213
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,761
That, too, is a chance.

214
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:28,419
Yu Sifeng came to the mortal realm because of Xuanji.

215
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:29,779
That's more of a chance.

216
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:34,760
I think surely you know his name in the heavens, Xi Xuan.

217
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,479
He is trying his best to save the three realms.

218
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:43,239
We are doing the same thing. So is everyone else.

219
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:44,840
And you're not doing anything about it.

220
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,510
Chance? That's just an excuse!

221
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,040
Xi Xuan is as persistent as he was.

222
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,879
Lass, you're right,

223
00:20:56,879 --> 00:21:00,559
but this is their chance, not mine.

224
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,665
Chance is not predictable and yet the heart is.

225
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:07,239
I am holding a black stone and solving this endgame.

226
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:09,679
It is the chance I have.

227
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,910
If I manage to win this game, that means my chance is here.

228
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,789
But you see,

229
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:20,039
now the white stones are more than the black stones.

230
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,099
This shows that my chance is still far away.

231
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:26,459
Fine. Since you're helping us only if the black stones win,

232
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:29,350
I'll help you solve this game then.

233
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,903
Now that the chessboard is full of black stones, you won.

234
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:44,899
How dare you? How outrageous you are!

235
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:46,855
How dare you spoil Xi Wangmu's endgame!

236
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:50,160
Hurry and take down this disobedient lass!

237
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,439
Interesting. It is truly interesting.

238
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:55,679
It was an unsolvable endgame.

239
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,870
And the ink has dyed the white stones black.

240
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,238
It is against the rules to call this a victory.

241
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,039
But it cannot be called a defeat

242
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,399
since the board is full of black stones.

243
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:11,595
Perhaps I didn't realize that because I was so involved in the game.

244
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:14,459
And you thought outside the box,

245
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,777
and that's the solution.

246
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:25,559
Fine. I'll come with you.

247
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,820
Thank you, Heavenly Emperor!

248
00:22:36,284 --> 00:22:37,839
Heavenly Emperor!

249
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,099
Heavenly Emperor, what about me?

250
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:43,060
How do I go back?

251
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,110
My Lord, what do we do?

252
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,311
What else can we do?

253
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:55,625
The solution is to jump out of the game.

254
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,823
Let's walk back.

255
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,739
How dare you!

256
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:07,939
You didn't see this coming, did you?

257
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:12,676
The God of War who used to protect the heavens is now turning it upside down!

258
00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:14,500
What an irony!

259
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,460
You tried to make the God of War serve the heavens, by fair means or foul.

260
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,740
Fine!

261
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,299
Today, I will use this face of the God of War

262
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,284
to destroy the heavens you've meant to protect

263
00:23:24,284 --> 00:23:25,939
and avenge my humiliation with my blood!

264
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:27,699
Devil Maleficent,

265
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:32,039
you're ruining the world and the people! You are unforgivable!

266
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,419
Unforgivable?

267
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:37,339
I've become unforgivable

268
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:41,610
when I killed the Asuras thousands of years ago!

269
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,139
The wails you are hearing,

270
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:47,685
the Asuras I killed, let out the same wails!

271
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:49,919
They say every living thing suffers.

272
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,499
But why do they have to suffer?

273
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:57,037
It's because of Heaven's law and fate!

274
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,935
Heaven's law is made by the Transcendent Furnace.

275
00:24:02,935 --> 00:24:05,119
I just need to overturn the furnace,

276
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,859
and all this suffering will cease to exist!

277
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:09,419
Dream on!

278
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:13,859
I am standing right here, and you shall not go near the furnace!

279
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:16,345
You are overestimating yourself!

280
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:23,069
I will not let you destroy the three realms!

281
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,979
You want to die?

282
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:31,460
No rush.

283
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,189
You are next!

284
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,035
No!

285
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,758
Xuanji.

286
00:24:57,758 --> 00:25:02,515
Yu Sifeng, stop digging your own grave.

287
00:25:03,762 --> 00:25:08,299
Devil Maleficent, if the Transcendent Furnace gets destroyed,

288
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,991
everything will cease to exist.

289
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:14,316
What you love and hate will all be gone.

290
00:25:14,316 --> 00:25:16,477
You can't do that.

291
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:20,922
I am the Devil Star, not Chu Xuanji.

292
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:24,143
I don't want love and hate.

293
00:25:24,143 --> 00:25:26,817
Just let it go.

294
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,200
Yu Sifeng,

295
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,290
don't think I won't kill you.

296
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,960
If you really want to kill me, go ahead then.

297
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,399
I'm going to die anyway after the furnace gets destroyed.

298
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:49,410
Instead of dying for no reason,

299
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,623
I'd rather be killed by you.

300
00:25:51,623 --> 00:25:54,784
Didn't you leave half of your primordial spirit in the Demon Citadel?

301
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:57,530
I want a complete self.

302
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,483
If the furnace gets ruined, my memory will be gone.

303
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:05,982
Even if this body survives, it's no different than death.

304
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,679
I'd rather be killed by you.

305
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,490
That's better than living like a living dead that has no memory.

306
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,493
I have no interest in killing you myself.

307
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:18,019
Since you didn't preserve any primordial spirit,

308
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:21,110
you shall fend for yourself.

309
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,240
Greetings, Heavenly Emperor.

310
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,939
Bailing, I told you.

311
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,187
Xi Xuan.

312
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:32,284
Heavenly Emperor.

313
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:33,939
You're still in the mortal realm.

314
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:36,558
I should call you by the name you use there.

315
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:38,663
Yu Sifeng.

316
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,899
I know everything you did.

317
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:44,870
You've worked hard.

318
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,099
Long time no see, Devil Maleficent.

319
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:53,540
I was wondering who could stop my Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook.

320
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,459
It turns out that Heavenly Emperor is here.

321
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:57,721
This has to do with the three realms.

322
00:27:57,721 --> 00:28:03,010
Not only should I be here, everyone should come here.

323
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,025
Greetings, Heavenly Emperor.

324
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,899
Xuanji, we've told Heavenly Emperor about your grievance.

325
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:21,010
He will uphold justice for you. You need not destroy the Transcendent Furnace anymore.

326
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:26,880
Heavenly Emperor, you brought such a big fanfare. Are you all here to stop me?

327
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,932
I'm not trying to stop you.

328
00:28:28,932 --> 00:28:31,819
But the resentment between you and Bailing

329
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:33,492
has to do with all the lives in three realms.

330
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:37,979
As the lord of the heavens, I have to solve this problem.

331
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:42,579
Heavenly Emperor, this demon is unstoppable.

332
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:45,919
I tried my best, but I couldn't stop him.

333
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,099
Please take him down, Heavenly Emperor!

334
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:52,060
I told you before, everything has a cause and effect.

335
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,300
You made the God of War and killed all the Asuras.

336
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,500
You ordered both the heavens and the mortal realm to kill the demons.

337
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,288
You initiated the Heavenly Meteor Formation and sacrificed Shaoyang.

338
00:29:05,288 --> 00:29:08,619
You killed the mortals with the Sea of Life and Death.

339
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:12,619
They're all extremely tragic incidents.

340
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:17,500
Those lost lives, they all belonged to the three realms.

341
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,360
And now you're accusing that Devil Maleficent's demon characteristics cannot be restrained.

342
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,805
I think you are the one whose demon characteristics cannot be restrained.

343
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:40,484
Heavenly Emperor, I did all this to protect the three realms!

344
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:44,725
Not at all. It was to protect your mad obsession in your heart!

345
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,540
Is this the outcome you wanted?

346
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,839
In fact, that day you made the wrong decision

347
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,903
at Baiyu Pavilion by the bank of the Ruoshui River.

348
00:30:04,954 --> 00:30:06,798
No.

349
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:08,219
That's not the case.

350
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:10,379
Do you refuse to believe it?

351
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:13,426
Fine. Let me show you what it would look like

352
00:30:13,426 --> 00:30:19,107
if you had not poisoned Devil Maleficent's wine thousands of years ago.

353
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,059
<i>You need not worry.</i>

354
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:27,578
<i>In fact, I came with good news.</i>

355
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,879
<i>Immortals and demons are having a fierce war.</i>

356
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:34,525
<i>There's no good news.</i>

357
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:37,140
<i>It has to do with this great war.</i>

358
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,947
<i>Two days ago, I submitted a memorial to His Majesty</i>

359
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:40,979
<i>requesting a ceasefire in the heavens and the Demon Citadel.</i>

360
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:42,679
<i>His Majesty said yes to it.</i>

361
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:43,999
<i>Really?</i>

362
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:45,699
<i>Positive.</i>

363
00:30:45,699 --> 00:30:48,219
<i>After this drink with you, I'll go communicate the decree.</i>

364
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:50,300
<i>The entire army of Asura will withdraw and head back to the Demon Citadel.</i>

365
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,439
<i>The three realms will be peaceful from then on.</i>

366
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:57,986
<i>Why don't you finish this cup of wine?</i>

367
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,664
<i>- Sure. <br> - Here.</i>

368
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,990
<i>- Please. <br> - Please.</i>

369
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,199
Bailing, you ruined the peace we could have had.

370
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:20,079
The war broke out again because the Asuras didn't receive the decree.

371
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:26,659
If you could have stopped back then, things wouldn't have turned out this way,

372
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:29,619
but you insisted on judging others by your own standards,

373
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:32,339
and went down to the mortal realm to control the God of War's trial.

374
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:35,079
In fact, if you hadn't gone down to the realm,

375
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:39,712
this trial would've been over by now.

376
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,779
<i>I, Chu Xuanji, have completed all ten trials,</i>

377
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:52,239
<i>and I have regained my flesh and blood.</i>

378
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:54,639
<i>I know what love is.</i>

379
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:59,179
<i>I seek your permission to come back to the heavens, Heavenly Emperor.</i>

380
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,699
<i>Yu Sifeng and I will work together</i>

381
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:08,398
<i>to protect everyone in the three realms.</i>

382
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,684
I was wrong.

383
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,802
Could it really be my fault?

384
00:32:28,628 --> 00:32:34,545
Bailing, everything in this world has its own conscience.

385
00:32:34,545 --> 00:32:36,799
If you don't move, he won't.

386
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,819
But you buried your evil thoughts inside your heart and manipulated others.

387
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,419
Without you knowing,

388
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,019
this evil thought of yours has long grown into a very tall tree.

389
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:50,156
A gigantic and merciless tree.

390
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,493
It's me.

391
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,697
I've hurt the three realms.

392
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,387
It's me.

393
00:33:03,936 --> 00:33:06,339
It's all because of me.

394
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:09,539
You always thought it was the God of War who was being evil.

395
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:10,859
You thought it was Devil Maleficent.

396
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:14,619
In fact, you're the evil one.

397
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:18,299
Everything in this world is originally empty.

398
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:21,319
Out of nothing, yin and yang spin.

399
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,619
They reinforce and counteract each other.

400
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:27,099
The heavens were originally empty. So was Asura.

401
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:30,659
Since they were both empty, how can the heavens be superior?

402
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:34,259
How can the mortal and demon realms be inferior?

403
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:37,259
You cared too much about the heavens' safety.

404
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:41,562
That's why you became irreversibly evil.

405
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,001
Please give me some advice, Heavenly Emperor.

406
00:33:51,001 --> 00:33:52,812
How can I make up for it?

407
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:55,230
Please give me some advice, Heavenly Emperor!

408
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,179
It's too late.

409
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:00,697
It is already too late.

410
00:34:09,686 --> 00:34:15,181
Heavenly Emperor, I caused this calamity.

411
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:17,539
I know that I'm deeply sinful.

412
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:23,159
Today, I will strip myself of my immortal qualities and powers

413
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,731
to compensate the world for what I did.

414
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,659
King Bailing, you are the head of the heavens.

415
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,319
Without the heavenly qualities, you will devolve into a trivial deity.

416
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,383
Please think twice!

417
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:34,371
- Please think twice, King Bailing. <br> - Please don't do that, King Bailing.

418
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:36,955
<i>Please think twice, King Bailing.</i>

419
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:45,841
For thousands of years, I've worried too much.

420
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:48,940
That's why I became like this.

421
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,193
Stop talking.

422
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:56,108
From today onward, you all should learn from my mistakes

423
00:34:56,108 --> 00:34:59,070
and behave yourselves.

424
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,674
Bailing, is this really what you want?

425
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,819
Heavenly Emperor, I have made up my mind.

426
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,299
Fine.

427
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:27,386
Perhaps this is your chance.

428
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,630
- King Bailing! <br> - King Bailing!

429
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,510
King Bailing. King Bailing!

430
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,027
<i>King Bailing!</i>

431
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,819
Devil Maleficent, Bailing has stripped himself of his heavenly qualities.

432
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:43,919
He is now a powerless trivial deity.

433
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:47,905
Could you have mercy on him?

434
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,450
Heavenly Emperor, you shouldn't have bothered yourself.

435
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:58,819
Are you trying to make me change my mind with this show?

436
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:01,939
Fine. Then let me ask you.

437
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:06,219
Will the Asuras come back to life with him being stripped of heavenly qualities?

438
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:10,329
With him being stripped of heavenly power, will I be able to forget that painful suffering?

439
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:13,745
You've underestimated my pain.

440
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:18,519
Fine. Even if the three realms are slaughtered as you wish,

441
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:22,080
then what? Everything would be empty after that.

442
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,019
You were a human in the first nine lives and couldn't stop being resentful.

443
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:26,779
But you finally got over it in this life.

444
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:29,179
And you've found the most important person in your life.

445
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:33,179
Isn't this far better than being a murderous tool?

446
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:34,780
You once asked me this.

447
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:39,465
Where else can you go since you're not a deity or Asura?

448
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:43,439
Isn't the mortal realm where your heart is?

449
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:47,099
Or do you really want to destroy everything in the mortal realm

450
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,819
and indulge in the anger?

451
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:52,579
So what if I indulge in the anger?

452
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:55,939
That's the path I chose. I need to figure it out.

453
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:59,688
Be it Devil Maleficent or Chu Xuanji,

454
00:37:59,688 --> 00:38:03,090
in your eyes, they are just insignificant existences.

455
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,699
Even though my life is insignificant,

456
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:08,467
I will never let you all mess with it.

457
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:11,359
As long as Heaven's law remains unchanged,

458
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,739
there will be another evil Bailing even though this one has been banished.

459
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:18,799
Thus, only by destroying the Transcendent Furnace

460
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:22,890
can I get rid of your arrogance.

461
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:29,039
Heavenly Emperor, fight with me or get out of my way.

462
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,159
It's the heavens' fault. I have no right to stop you.

463
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,139
If you insist on destroying the furnace, I can't do anything about it.

464
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:39,439
Yet when the furnace collapses and karma vanishes,

465
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:42,879
all of your friends and family will return to the chaos void.

466
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:44,979
Is that really what you want?

467
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:48,524
Xuanji... Don't, Xuanji!

468
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:55,550
Devil Maleficent, turn around and look at your family and friends.

469
00:38:56,412 --> 00:38:59,668
They could've stayed at Shaoyang for their safety,

470
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,613
but they couldn't bear to forget

471
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,819
the experiences we shared.

472
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:09,859
That's why they came here despite the difficulties.

473
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:15,242
Although they know they could be killed, they want you to know that

474
00:39:15,242 --> 00:39:17,742
you are important to them.

475
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,779
Whether you're Devil Maleficent or Xuanji, in this life,

476
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:27,499
those around you love you deeply.

477
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,890
They protect you.

478
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,369
You're no longer that lonely Devil Star.

479
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:38,572
You're a family member, friend,

480
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:41,983
a loved one whom we can't let go of.

481
00:39:41,983 --> 00:39:44,739
Demon Lord, listen to it.

482
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:49,219
These people are trying to talk you into turning into Chu Xuanji.

483
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:52,739
In fact, they don't care about you at all.

484
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:55,219
They care only about Chu Xuanji.

485
00:39:55,219 --> 00:39:59,319
After all, these are all Chu Xuanji's family, friends,

486
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:01,079
and loved ones.

487
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,634
They're not yours.

488
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:07,319
Our great army has scattered the primordial spirit around Demon Citadel.

489
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:10,765
When the furnace is collapsed and the three realms are ruined,

490
00:40:10,765 --> 00:40:14,275
the world will belong to us demons.

491
00:40:14,275 --> 00:40:19,129
Don't let their words ruin our grand plan.

492
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,139
Since Bailing didn't care about life,

493
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:26,959
why should I care about love, friends, and family?

494
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:30,454
They are impermanent.

495
00:40:30,454 --> 00:40:33,499
Heavenly Emperor, I am definitely destroying the furnace.

496
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:37,098
If that's the case, go ahead then.

497
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,152
Xuanji!

498
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,099
All of your friends and family will return to the chaos void.

499
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:19,491
Is that really what you want?

What is this?

520
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:34,479
I have just hit the String of Yellow Millet and have let you foresee

521
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:37,619
what happens when the three realms are destroyed.

522
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:39,379
Illusion.

523
00:43:39,379 --> 00:43:41,279
It is all an illusion!

524
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:42,659
It is not an illusion.

525
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:46,899
If you insist on smashing the furnace, what you saw will become the reality.

526
00:43:46,899 --> 00:43:48,619
I cannot stop you from taking revenge,

527
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:50,339
but it concerns the life of the three realms.

528
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:53,139
I just hope that you won't regret your decision.

529
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:57,179
Devil Maleficent, you said you were a heartless man,

530
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:00,142
but you just shed tears.

531
00:44:00,142 --> 00:44:04,919
How can a heartless man shed tears?

532
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:14,159
It's obvious that you're gaining fresh and blood.

533
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,379
Try to accept yourself.

534
00:44:16,379 --> 00:44:19,699
Don't let your hatred blind you.

535
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:21,259
Shut up!

536
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:23,699
I will not believe everything you say!

537
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:27,019
Demon Lord, if you are wavering because of their sweet nothings,

538
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:30,899
listen to what I am about to say and you will no longer hesitate.

539
00:44:30,899 --> 00:44:33,811
Yu Sifeng has long betrayed you.

540
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:37,699
He said he came to the heavens and discussed it with King Bailing.

541
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:41,419
In fact, they have long decided to help the heavens change your mind.

542
00:44:41,419 --> 00:44:43,589
If you listen to him and don't ruin the three realms,

543
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:45,719
that shows he can control you.

544
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:49,073
This Yu Sifeng, it is obvious that

545
00:44:49,073 --> 00:44:53,619
he wants to be the new Crystal Lamp which King Bailing can use to seal your soul!

546
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:03,079
Demon Lord, you've broken my defensive spell.

547
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:04,639
You want to kill me!

548
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,679
Yuan Lang, I'd have bought into your lie if you'd framed somebody else.

549
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:12,759
But I remember every single thing Yu Sifeng did in his ten lives!

550
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:14,899
You said he betrayed me.

551
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:17,132
Do you think I'll believe you?

552
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:20,156
Demon Lord, I am wrong.

553
00:45:20,156 --> 00:45:21,592
I am wrong!

554
00:45:21,592 --> 00:45:25,019
You betrayed the Demon Citadel, framed Wu Zhiqi, and seized the power of the God of War.

555
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:27,179
They are all your schemes.

556
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:31,010
If Bailing is called vicious, you can be called a backstabber.

557
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:36,619
There is no way I'm keeping a backstabber by my side.

558
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:38,616
Take your own life.

559
00:45:38,616 --> 00:45:43,665
Demon Lord, I have been working for you for thousands of years.

560
00:45:43,665 --> 00:45:47,907
Now that we are going to succeed, you want me to kill myself?

561
00:45:47,907 --> 00:45:51,331
You were working for yourself, not me.

562
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,900
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

563
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,680
If I really destroy the three realms,

564
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,260
my next enemy would be you.

565
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,299
I never thought that the effort I put into the grand plan

566
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:10,011
would eventually lead to my death.

567
00:46:10,011 --> 00:46:12,099
That's really careless of me.

568
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:15,499
Demon Lord, it seems that you've bought into their nonsense

569
00:46:15,499 --> 00:46:17,899
and you are not going to destroy the furnace!

570
00:46:17,899 --> 00:46:22,499
If so, you shall be burned into ashes in the Great Gold Flame!

571
00:46:22,499 --> 00:46:28,648
I, Yuan Lang, want to be the head of three realms!

572
