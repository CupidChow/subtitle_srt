00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:18,461
that you were not a murderous demon

33
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:23,485
because your heart has gained flesh and blood.

34
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:31,100
This heart couldn't bring itself to destroy the three realms.

35

that Devil Maleficent wasn't some apocalyptic demon.

Heavenly Emperor, I've lost.

106
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:11,704
My deeply improper thoughts have ruined the three realms

107

and killed many lives,

108
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:18,893

I am unpardonable.

110

King Bailing.

111
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,499
I am the root of this thousand-year grudge.

Chu Xuanji, please grant my death.

Let me be free.

115
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:02,699
I will never simply take one's life for my own interest.

116

Sifeng once said that revenge is an endless cycle.

118
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:25,992
In this life, my heart has found the most important thing.

119
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:29,892
There's no more room for hatred.

120
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:34,929
From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.

124
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:09,687
Chu Xuanji, you are luckier than me.

125
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:11,419
You've met those whom you care about

126
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:13,659
and they're willing to sacrifice for you.

127
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,719
You must cherish them.

128
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,334
I really wish that I could live once again.

129
00:14:12,712 --> 00:14:17,560
Bailing, do you still remember...

130
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,046
the shore of Ruoshui River?

131
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,000
The shore of Ruoshui River.

132
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,687
In the Baiyu Pavilion.

133
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,417
It's where we drank.

134
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:41,865
Those days, I always remember them.

135
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:43,547
Yes.

136
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:45,995
I always remember them, too.

137
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,454
We had our last drink one thousand years ago.

138
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:52,993
You toasted me and I drank mine.

139
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:57,543
I toasted you, but you didn't drink yours.

140

Today,

141
00:15:00,628 --> 00:15:03,568
you shall drink it.

142
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,011
All right.

143
00:15:08,011 --> 00:15:12,688
Brother Maleficent, I shall drink it.

144
00:15:21,844 --> 00:15:24,644
- King Bailing! <br> - King Bailing!

145
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:31,628
King Bailing.

146
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:36,825
We are finally done drinking.

147
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,512
King Bailing.

148
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,659
- King Bailing! <br> - King Bailing!

149
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:43,227
Don't come over.

150
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:48,054
I brought this all upon myself.

151
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:53,921
Devil Maleficent's hatred cannot dissipate and refuses to forgive me.

152
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:57,227
In fact, I cannot even forgive myself.

153
00:15:57,227 --> 00:16:00,395
I just want to bring you to justice

154
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:03,996
for what you did to me and the other victims.

155
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,788
You brought this on yourself.

156
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:09,084
It serves you right.

157
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:12,340
Vanity is all I've cultivated these ten thousand years.

158
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,536
Now that it's come to this,

159
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,954
wouldn't it be a death worth dying?

160
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:19,941
King Bailing.

161
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,843
Don't follow in my footsteps.

162
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:29,624
My obsession with grievance and scheming eventually led to my big mistake.

163
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,974
Heavenly Emperor, I know that I don't deserve to be a deity.

164
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:38,479
Today, I'm entering the channel of karma and recultivating myself.

165
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:42,411
If there were to be the chance ten thousand years from now,

166
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:45,461
I would be sitting by your side

167
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:48,062
and listening to your teachings, Heavenly Emperor.

168
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,680
Bailing, Heaven willing,

169
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,378
may you repent and be enlightened the soonest.

170
00:17:06,922 --> 00:17:08,751
King Bailing!

171
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:10,737
- King Bailing! <br> - King Bailing!

172
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,960
King Bailing!

173
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,706
Listen my fellow deities.

174
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:50,499
The death of Bailing

175
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:54,700
is the merit he has earned by repenting and taking his own life.

176
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,819
The heavens have done the Demon Citadel wrong.

177
00:17:57,819 --> 00:18:01,159
You shall not kill and take revenge on the demons.

178
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,539
From today onward, the three realms are equal and shall live in harmony with one another.

179
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:09,903
Anyone disobeying this order will be severely punished.

180
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:13,204
<i>We shall obey the decree, Heavenly Emperor!</i>

181
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,059
Heavenly Emperor, Sifeng died saving the three realms.

182
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:22,643
It's not his fault. The fault is all mine!

183
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,298
I beg you. Please save him.

184
00:18:26,298 --> 00:18:30,106
I'm willing to exchange my life for his!

185
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:33,699
Xi Xuan is my son. I certainly hope that he'll be fine,

186
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:37,179
but I have no control over life and death.

187
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:42,094
As much as I want to save him, there's nothing I can do.

188
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:43,828
However...

189
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:45,735
What?

190
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:47,959
However, I need not do so anymore.

191
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:50,569
Someone's saved him.

192
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,062
What is this?

193
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:02,439
It's Devil Maleficent's heart.

194
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:06,739
When Devil Maleficent brushed Xi Xuan's chest,

195
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:11,318
he's planted half of the Crystal Heart in him.

196
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,656
The heart has gained flesh and blood.

197
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,219
It can save his life.

198
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:30,154
Will this heart start beating again and wake him up?

199
00:19:30,154 --> 00:19:32,880
That depends on you.

200
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,899
Thank you for your guidance, Heavenly Emperor.

201
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:43,467
Sifeng will surely wake up.

202
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,814
He will wake up, for sure.

203
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:49,418
He will surely wake up.

204
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:55,340
Heavenly Emperor, please tell me where my daughter is.

205
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,533
I'm the one who stole the celestial eye. She has nothing to do with it.

206
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:59,279
Please have mercy on us, Heavenly Emperor!

207
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,633
You stole the celestial eye because of your daughter.

208
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,759
It is a father's love of his child.

209
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,139
And you went to Kunlun to see me for the sake of the three realms.

210
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,479
You have made up for the mistake.

211
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:09,439
You should head back to Qingyang.

212
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:12,564
Your father-daughter relationship is not over yet.

213
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:14,499
She is waiting for you at home.

214
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:16,479
Sure! I'm leaving now!

215
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,532
Thank you, Heavenly Emperor!

216
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,454
Heavenly Emperor, what about Purple Fox?

217
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:27,239
I took them to Mount Kunlun, and I've made up for the mistake!

218
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,679
Please save Purple Fox, too!

219
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,659
Purple Fox died for you and bears your sins from a thousand years ago.

220
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:35,692
What goes around comes around. She will re-enter the channel of karma.

221
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,339
Then, where is she?

222
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:40,705
She has suffered from missing you for a thousand years.

223
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:43,139
Why should you go and see her?

224
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,779
Twelve hours from now, she is going to drink the Water of Forgetting.

225
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,559
- Water of Forgetting? <br> - She will forget you in the next life

226
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,880
and she will be free.

227
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,220
Little Fox is at the River of Forgetting?

228
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,447
Deep yet transient love.

229
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:02,911
Why bother?

230
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:06,636
Xuanji, let's go home.

231
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:15,899
Teng She, I know that you had a deep affection for King Bailing.

232
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,285
You may stay here as long as you want.

233
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:22,900
You have my word forever.

234
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:28,608
You may go far away for as long as you want.

235
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:33,585
You're welcome to come back anytime.

236
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,635
Take good care of yourself.

237
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,050
Sifeng, let's go home now.

238
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:18,840
<i>Wu Zhiqi, he's the most easy-going and carefree person in the world.</i>

239
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,699
<i>- Little Fox. Thank you for saving me. <br> - Wu Zhiqi! </i>

240
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,137
<i>I'm willing to do anything to save Wu Zhiqi.</i>

241
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,490
<i>Don't let me go again.</i>

242
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,884
Little Fox!

243
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:04,182
Wu Zhiqi.

244
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:18,349
Little Fox, I will never let you go again.

245
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,935
<i>Candied Chinese hawthorn!</i>

246
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:20,992
Yu'er.

247
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:24,299
Old Fogey, where've you been?

248
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,619
You've been away too long! I'm starving!

249
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:28,806
Cook for me!

250
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:32,984
Sure! I'm going home to cook for you now.

251
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,120
Gosh, you're a grown-up.

252
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,648
Don't cry. It's so embarrassing.

253
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,999
Oh right! I want to eat a scallion pancake. Buy me some.

254
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:48,119
Sure. I'm willing to buy you scallion pancakes for life.

255
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,575
Let's go.

256
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,140
Old Fogey, I'm telling you.

257
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,919
There are many delicious foods ahead.

258
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,724
Ahead there. Let's go.

259
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:39,478
Sifeng, we're home.

260
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:47,865
But... when will you wake up?

261
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,172
It's okay.

262
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,769
No matter how long, I'll always wait for you.

263
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,259
Sifeng, did you know?

264
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:10,639
Linglong and Sixth Senior are fighting about who the baby will look like.

265
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:13,113
Sixth Senior says Linglong's too short.

266
00:27:13,113 --> 00:27:15,579
Linlong says Sixth Senior's too dull.

267
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:19,539
I was there when she chased after and hit him.

268
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,742
Isn't it funny?

269
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:29,215
And look at this. It's your favorite Qingyang lotus seeds.

270
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:33,270
Sifeng,

271
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,860
do you still remember the promise we made under the Magpie Bridge?

272
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,690
That we'll be together forever.

273
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,249
Sifeng,

274
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:13,495
you must've had a hard time practicing sword moves.

275
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,699
You've been sleeping for so long.

276
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:22,055
But the calluses on your hands haven't gone away.

277
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,435
I received a letter from Eldest Brother Liu today.

278
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:34,179
He says Yu'er isn't as obedient as you.

279
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:38,140
She competes with him all the time.

280
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,500
Sifeng.

281
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,559
Sifeng! Sifeng!

282
00:29:08,924 --> 00:29:10,984
Sifeng!

283
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,480
Sifeng! Sifeng!

284
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,810
Sifeng! Sifeng!

285
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:24,179
Sifeng! Sifeng!

286
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,951
Sifeng!

287
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:30,139
Sifeng! Sifeng!

288
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:31,719
Sifeng!

289
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,660
Xuanji.

290
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,782
Xuanji.

291
00:29:49,782 --> 00:29:51,663
Sifeng.

292
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,136
I've missed you so much.

293
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:21,326
I've really missed you so much.

294
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,420
Xuanji, don't cry.

295
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,363
I'm not crying.

296
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,001
I'm happy.

297
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,383
The tears fell down themselves.

298
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,340
Silly girl.

299
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,899
I knew you'd come back, Sifeng.

300
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:48,919
I knew you'd surely come back.

301
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:50,820
Silly girl.

302
00:30:51,972 --> 00:30:55,836
How could I not come back when you're here?

303
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,071
Let's go.

304
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:11,240
Where to?

305
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,682
Go ask my father for my hand.

306
00:31:17,436 --> 00:31:19,230
Father!

307
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,059
Sifeng? You...

308
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:27,439
Sect Leader Chu, I have fully recovered.

309
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:30,504
That's great.

310
00:31:30,504 --> 00:31:35,779
Sifeng, because of my foolishness, you've gone through a lot.

311
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:40,229
- This time I... <br> - I am all right now.

312
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:44,804
Father, please allow me to marry Sifeng.

313
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:46,290
Sure.

314
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:48,870
Sure!

315
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,319
Xuanji?

316
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:18,649
- Linglong? <br> - Get in first.

317
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:20,100
It's your wedding day.

318
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,979
You should wait for Sifeng in your room. Why are you lingering out here?

319
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:24,874
Auntie Yinghong dressed me up long ago.

320
00:32:24,874 --> 00:32:27,328
I felt so bored staying in the room.

321
00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:30,099
Moreover, our sect doesn't care about formality.

322
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:31,739
That's why I decided to come and check the guests out.

323
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:33,879
You are, as always, inappropriate. Go back and stay in there.

324
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:36,888
I'll decorate the venue well.

325
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:41,359

00:44:24,973 --> 00:44:26,380
Congratulations!

479
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,759
Eldest Brother Liu, you're late.

480
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,700
- We've been waiting for you. <br> - It's all Yu'er's fault.

481
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,900
- Here. <br> - She kept asking for food and drink.

482
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,180
- That's why we're late. <br> - It's because you're stingy.

483
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,439
- Have a seat first. <br> - You always buy so little.

484
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,119
- Of course, I needed to buy more. <br> - She's blaming me.

485
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,575
You can eat as much as you want today, have a seat.

486
00:44:36,575 --> 00:44:38,279
Xuanji, here.

487
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,879
Carry him for a while.

488
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,079
- Baby. <br> - Teng She?

489
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,039
Don't cry, baby. There, there.

490
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,299
I heard there's good food. Of course, I've got to be here. Ask them to serve the food.

491
00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:49,054
Want to eat those delicious foods? Here, help me and carry him first.

492
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:50,380
Don't cry.

493
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,740
Don't cry.

494
00:44:51,741 --> 00:44:53,679
- Don't cry. <br> - He peed.

495
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,590
Carry him!

496
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:58,980
Careful, the baby!

497
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,540
Yu'er...

498
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,244
Yu'er used to pee a lot when she was small. You'll get used to it eventually.

499
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:05,639
- It's okay. Here, let me do it. <br> - Brother Chu, you should stop drinking.

500
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,741
- We've just started. Fill up the cup. <br> - Don't drop the baby!

501
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,159
<i>One thousand years ago, you were a created being.</i>

502
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:20,399
<i>That's why every step you took wasn't governed by the heavens.</i>

503
00:45:20,399 --> 00:45:21,859
<i>It depends on you.</i>

504
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:25,899
<i>It's up to you to be a demon, an immortal, or a mortal.</i>

505
00:45:25,899 --> 00:45:27,799
<i>I'd like to ask you this today.</i>

506
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:31,433
<i>What are your thoughts on being mortal?</i>

507
00:45:31,433 --> 00:45:33,481
<i>It's good to be a mortal.</i>

508
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:32,890
