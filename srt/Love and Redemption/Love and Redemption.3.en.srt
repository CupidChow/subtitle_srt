19
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,220
Greetings, Deities. <br> <i>(T/N: A term for deities or respect for experienced cultivators)</i>

20
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,946
The Lutai Town under my governance was always attacked by demons.

21
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:07,640
That's the reason I put up a notice to invite deities from the cultivating sects like you all.

22
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,827
Deities, you all are here in time.

23
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:11,959
Words can't express my gratitude.

24
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,639
Village Chief, you're too courteous.

25
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,274
This is our responsibility.

26
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,980
You should let us see the corpses of the victims.

27
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,917
Please.

28
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,399
He was killed on Mount Lutai yesterday.

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,898
Five of them were traveling together.

30
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:34,240
But we only managed to find one body.

31
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,563
<i>D-Demons!</i>

32
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:39,799
<i>There are four people left in the mountains, including my wife and child.</i>

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,683
Some brave guards and hunters went up the mountains to find them.

34
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:45,919
But they didn't find a single body.

35
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,879
Mount Lutai is the only path the townsfolk could use,

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,320
but now, all of us are trapped here.

37
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,440
- What should we do now? <br> <i>- Please help us!</i>

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,999
Everyone, calm down.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,439
We're here.

40
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,526
We will slay the demons.

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,240
- Thank you, Deities. <br> <i>- Thank you.</i>

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,711
So, according to the information and the wounds,

43
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:16,960
I'm sure the culprit is the Gudiao on Mount Lutai.

44
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,919
Xuanji, don't touch him.

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,919
Father, I don't think a bird was behind the wounds.

46
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,359
I think a dog was the cause.

47
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,719
Don't simply just speak.

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,839
I'm not.

49
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,039
Sect Leader Chu. Master Dong Fang. The wounds are strange, indeed.

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,719
Look at them.

51
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,959
Although there are peck marks on his right side,

52
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,080
there are bite marks on his left side.

53
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,879
Gudiao is a bird.

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,220
It can't leave any bite marks behind.

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,620
We were too careless.

56
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,379
We didn't observe the wounds closely.

57
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,680
The wounds were caused by another demon.

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,060
Xuanji is observant indeed.

59
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,999
Look at her. The young talents are amazing.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,620
Actually, I've noticed that long ago. I just didn't want to say them out.

61
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,500
I'm sure there are other demons besides Gudiao on Mount Lutai.

62
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm sure there is more than one demon?

63
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,924
Everyone, don't panic. Please don't panic.

64
00:04:24,924 --> 00:04:27,079
Village Chief, with our capabilities,

65
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,503
we can handle them if we devise a careful plan.

66
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:33,260
Please bring us to the villagers who have seen the demons

67
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:36,154
so that we may understand the situation better.

68
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:37,319
Okay. Let's hurry.

69
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,909
- Follow me. <br> - Please.

70
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,245
Xuanji, you and Hero Yu

71
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:53,340
can go and get the things required to capture Gudiao.

72
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,456
Xuanji.

73
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,851
This is for you.

74
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:07,179
What is this?

75
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:08,620
This is a Lightning Baton.

76
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,159
It can teleport you around.

77
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,501
Just hold it in your palm and just think about the place you want to go.

78
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:17,100
You can master this with just a few uses.

79
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,420
Although we'll try our best to protect you later,

80
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,117
we may not be able to protect you all the time.

81
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:25,700
This item can help you to escape from danger.

82
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,820
Thank you, Senior Brother Hao Chen.

83
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,300
Gudiao?

84
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,799
What do we need to capture it?

85
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,562
Sifeng?

86
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,200
Sifeng, how did you manage to find the items required?

87
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,639
Saltwater will hurt its eyes.

88
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,079
- And... <br> - Be careful.

89
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,439
Sorry.

90
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,679
So, saltwater will hurt its eyes.

91
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,879
- Sir. <br> - That way, we can capture it, right?

92
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,359
You wanted salt in sacks, right?

93
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,464
Thank you, Sir.

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,906
Sifeng,

95
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,780
you asked someone else to buy them for you?

96
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,460
So what if I did?

97
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,599
<i>Fine. It's better this way.</i>

98
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,234
<i>I can try and use the Lightning Baton Senior Brother Hao Chen has given me.</i>

99
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,014
Sifeng!

100
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,720
So, this is your room?

101
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,189
Do you think this is the best time for us to chat?

102
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,959
Not really.

103
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,499
I'm sorry. Did I interrupt your bath? I'll leave right away.

104
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,640
I...

105
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,800
I think my Lightning Baton went missing.

106
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,159
I think it's in the bathtub.

107
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,760
I'll leave once I find it.

108
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,820
Where is it?

109
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,600
♫ <i> The flower petal accidentally kissed your shoulder as it fell </i> ♫

118
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,580
Ting Nu, stop being stubborn.

119
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,807
Although you were an immortal medic once, that doesn't mean anything.

120
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:41,540
The heavenly realm punishes you without mercy.

121
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,421
In their eyes,

122
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,438
demons will always be demons.

123
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:49,520
We will never reach the same level as them.

124
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,140
In the past, my Left-Hand Lieutenant

125
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,159
only tried to retrieve the Divine Weapon for the Devil Star,

126
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,959
but he was set up by the heavenly realm.

127
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,518
He was trapped under Fenru City with the Four Dimension Chains.

128
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,659
And 1,000 years have passed since then.

129
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,039
Now, tell me.

130
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,380
How do I unlock the Four Dimension Chains?

131
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,292
You're keeping quiet?

132
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,719
Stop!

133
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,648
Stop it now!

134
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,100
I'll tell you!

135
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,880
What? There are other demons?

136
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,539
This is troublesome.

137
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:27,340
We only wanted to obtain Gudiao's horns for the Weeping Tears.

138
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,059
But now, there's another demon.

139
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,879
How can we defeat them?

140
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,180
Linglong, will they lock me up in Mingxia Cave again?

141
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,880
Little Six, you better think of something! <br> <i>(T/N: Linglong's nickname for Minyan, 6th Senior Brother)</i>

142
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,389
Think of something?

143
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,853
I remembered Senior Brother Hao Chen said that Gudiao loves human tongues.

144
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:50,639
It will approach people when it smells blood.

145
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,300
I don't feel anything anyway.

146
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,980
By then, I'll just bite my tongue and try to lure it.

147
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,719
Okay?

148
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,026
So...

149
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:01,167
You are digging your own grave.

150
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,339
That will attract Gudiao,

151
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:10,100
but it'll boost its power tremendously as well.

152
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,140
Do you guys think you can survive?

153
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,420
I'm sure it's not that bad, right?

154
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,780
Can you kill it then?

155
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,719
We can't kill it by ourselves.

156
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,533
What should we do then?

157
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,979
The Four Dimension Chains were created by the immortals,

158
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:33,320
using the earthly energies accumulated from the four highest peaks in the world.

159
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,820
No one can cut it or break it.

160
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,500
You can only unlock them

161
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,959
by gathering the Four Spirit Keys.

162
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,051
In the last thousand years, the Four Spirit Keys

163
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:49,100
have been protected by the Five Great Sects for a long time.

164
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,140
The keys are in their hands?

165
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,460
Where did they put them?

166
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,900
That's all I know.

167
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,973
I'm not lying.

168
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,693
I've told you everything I know.

169
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:13,780
If I find out that you're lying,

170
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,800
I'll decimate the entire merfolk clan.

171
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,360
<i>According to the location of the victims' bodies,</i>

172
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,740
<i>Gudiao is most active by the mountainside and the nearby pond.</i>

173
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,639
<i>As for the other demon, we have no clues.</i>

174
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,500
<i>We must be cautious when we ascend the mountain.</i>

175
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,909
Xuanji, are you tired?

176
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,135
I'm not.

177
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,657
Xuanji!

178
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,239
Xuanji!

179
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,479
Are you okay?

180
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,799
It hurts.

181
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,997
- What's wrong? <br> - I sprained my ankle.

182
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,685
It hurts.

183
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,060
Master, Xuanji sprained her ankle. She can't walk anymore.

184
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,779
This troublesome girl. I told you to train hard. Look at you.

185
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,300
You're injured now and you're dragging everyone down.

186
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,423
Senior Brother, I think that's enough.

187
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:22,048
Just let them rest here.

188
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:23,999
We'll lure Gudiao out.

189
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's fine, too.

190
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,003
Hero Yu, please stay here and take care of them.

191
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,203
Xuanji, take this whistle.

192
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:36,403
Blow the whistle when you're in danger.

193
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,170
Hao Chen, let's proceed.

194
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,606
Yes.

195
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,319
I almost died! Why did you take so long?

196
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,734
Sorry, Linglong. I forgot about you.

197
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:55,940
Xuanji, did you really sprain your ankle?

198
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:57,535
No. I was acting just now.

199
00:14:57,536 --> 00:14:59,079
You're a bad actor, you know?

200
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,327
Did you forget that you can't feel anything? How could you pretend to be in pain?

201
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:05,760
Oh right! I forgot about that.

202
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,060
Linglong and Minyan, you two should get ready.

203
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,899
After I set up the formation and lure Gudiao here,

204
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:14,420
you two can remove its horns when it's trapped in my formation.

205
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,475
Linglong, use this to protect yourself.

206
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:22,854
This?

207
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,655
Isn't this your family heirloom?

208
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:27,287
My ancestors were blacksmiths.

209
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,399
This dagger is stronger than ordinary weapons.

210
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,759
Take it. Use it if you meet a demon.

211
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,239
But...

212
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,479
Didn't you say you'll give this to...

213
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,719
That's right.

214
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,919
It's an engagement gift for my future wife.

215
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,435
Don't think too much.

216
00:15:41,436 --> 00:15:44,039
I'm just lending it to you. You need to return it to me.

217
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,732
You're only lending it to me? And I need to return this?

218
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:48,408
You can give this to your future wife, for all I care!

219
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,599
Report! Some cultivators are ascending Mount Lutai!

220
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,157
What? Hurry!

221
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:57,399
Inform all demons to leave this hideout right away!

222
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,119
- Remember to destroy all clues! <br> - Yes!

223
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,601
Hurry!

224
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:19,418
Run!

225
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,431
Uncle Ting Nu is here.

226
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,813
Inform the people of our tribe.

227
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:44,414
Ask them to leave immediately.

228
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,612
The formation is done.

229
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,480
What a strong demonic aura.

230
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,291
Demonic aura?

231
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,540
Xuanji!

232
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,833
Xuanji, are you okay?

233
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,366
You're bleeding.

234
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:05,981
Gudiao's power will increase when it sees blood.

235
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:08,439
I can't hold it off for long. Go now!

236
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,119
But Sifeng, this...

237
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,960
- Just leave! <br> - Let's go!

238
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,449
- It's actually a Celestial Dog? <br> - Capture it.

239
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,430
You stay here.

240
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:19,291
Wait! Didn't you say that Gudiao will reach its human form soon?

241
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,210
You can't deal with it alone. I'll go with you.

242
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,540
- It's easier for me to go alone. <br> - Yu Sifeng!

243
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,438
Wait.

244
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,360
I think something's in the water.

245
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,179
It's another demon!

246
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,766
Wait!

247
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,685
Why are you helping the demon?

248
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,216
It's the scent of Gudiao!

249
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,317
I think it's approaching us.

250
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,570
Xuanji!

251
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,540
We'll be fine. It's too big to fit.

252
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,400
I think it's going to break through soon.

253
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,794
We're in a dire situation.

254
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:07,519
There's no time. We'll deal with the nasty beast for now.

255
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,415
Protect Xuanji!

256
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,313
Sifeng!

257
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,149
Hurry! Scatter the salt!

258
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,320
Xuanji, stay here.

259
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,480
Linglong! Linglong!

260
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,839
Minyan!

261
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,113
Linglong!

262
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,293
Sifeng!

263
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,212
This is bad!

264
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,959
Hurry!

265
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,643
Go!

266
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,959
Sifeng!

267
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,272
Linglong!

268
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,800
I'll kill you!

269
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,369
Linglong!

270
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:46,180

288
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,359
Xuanji, you're awake?

289
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,066
How do you feel? Do you feel uncomfortable?

290
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:17,007
You scared me, you know?

291
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,995
Everyone is fine, right?

292
00:24:19,995 --> 00:24:23,358
Everyone is fine. Why don't you lie down a little longer?

293
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,908
Linglong, I'm hungry.

294
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:32,980
You little glutton. I'll get you some food.

295
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,699
Xuanji, what exactly happened in the cave?

296
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:44,220
Did something happen?

297
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,865
I...

298
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,330
I think I had a dream.

299
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:51,911
In the dream, I...

300
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,325
I...

301
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,300
I can't remember anything.

302
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,220
Xuanji, how about this?

303
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,880
Follow what I do. See if it'll help you in recovering your memories.

304
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,119
Wait! Don't point that at me.

305
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,778
Point it over there.

306
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,182
Xuanji, listen.

307
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:37,540
You were so amazing while we were in the cave.

308
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,279
You drew a circle just like that and you vanquished the Gudiao.

309
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,940
I vanquished the Gudiao?

310
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,237
How is that possible? I...

311
00:25:47,237 --> 00:25:50,357
I don't have the capability to vanquish the Gudiao.

312
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,844
Wait.

313
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,999
Don't tell me that wasn't a dream? That was reality?

314
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,559
But how did something so bizarre happen to me?

315
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,400
Or...

316
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,020
I...

317
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,999
Am I the freak they spoke about?

318
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,759
Of course not, Xuanji.

319
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,333
There's an explanation for this.

320
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:19,881
Some immortals or something like that,

321
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:22,359
they love to wander in the human realm and uphold justice.

322
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,097
But it's inappropriate for them to show themselves.

323
00:26:24,098 --> 00:26:25,485
Thus, their primordial spirits

324
00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:27,239
will possess humans and humans will become their vessels.

325
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,835
So, I'm sure that was the case.

326
00:26:29,836 --> 00:26:32,279
That's why you can't remember anything.

327
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,940
- Is that so? <br> - Xuanji, I'm sure that's the case.

328
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,780
Think about this. You don't even know the basics of Yang Juegong's Technique.

329
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:39,279
You can't even summon your sword.

330
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,100
But you managed to vanquish a huge creature.

331
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,952
Do you believe in that?

332
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,370
And... we did try it again just now.

333
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,851
You didn't exhibit any strange power.

334
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,040
According to what you've said,

335
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,199
it'll be great if the immortals can help me out often.

336
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,522
That way, I won't drag you down.

337
00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:02,879
And I can protect all of you when you are in danger.

338
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,800
Let's not think about that.

339
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:06,680
And we mustn't tell anyone about this.

340
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,599
If this happens again, our elders will spread rumors about you.

341
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,880
Maybe they'll lock you up again.

342
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,799
Xuanji, listen.

343
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,460
This is a secret between us.

344
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,239
You mustn't tell anyone about this, okay?

345
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,689
- Aunt! Senior Brother Hao Chen! <br> - Xuanji.

346
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,459
It's good that you're awake.

347
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:36,080
I wonder who came to save you from that Gudiao?

348
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,959
Xuanji and Minyan, what did you witness in the cave?

349
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,239
I...

350
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,949
The Gudiao knocked us out.

351
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,769
- We didn't see anything. <br> - Didn't you say...

352
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:51,682
Xuanji, I told you to train harder, right?

353
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:54,582
You were knocked out in an instant because you were too weak.

354
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,759
And you only woke up after two days.

355
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,759
How could you say that about me?

356
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,638
You didn't train hard, either.

357
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,098
I didn't train hard?

358
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,698
I'm an expert in Yang Juegong's Technique now, you know?

359
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:06,390
But you were knocked out as well.

360
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,359
I was knocked out because I wanted to protect you and Linglong.

361
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,151
- You... <br> - Stop it.

362
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,380
Aunt. Senior Brother.

363
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,240
Eat now.

364
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,764
Little Six, you're arguing with Xuanji even though she just woke up.

365
00:28:21,764 --> 00:28:24,531
I'll seal your mouth if you say anything else.

366
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,124
We were blessed. All of you are safe.

367
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,038
We finished the Hairpin Tournament Mission as well.

368
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:36,036
Our sect leader and Master Dong Fang have returned after capturing the Celestial Dog.

369
00:28:36,037 --> 00:28:39,573
But Hao Chen and I will check out the mountain.

370
00:28:39,574 --> 00:28:43,001
You told me that there's a water demon in the cave.

371
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:45,473
But we didn't find it when we were there.

372
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,149
I think that demon was trying to help us.

373
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:49,439
Demons are demons.

374
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,127
They will never help humans.

375
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:54,148
You mustn't be cheated by their appearances.

376
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,200
Seems like someone vanquished the Gudiao in one blow.

377
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,480
Even my master wasn't capable of this feat.

378
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,140
Moreover, Gudiao was a massive beast.

379
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,701
The only ones who are capable of this feat

380
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,500
are either the immortals or the Asuras.

381
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,419
Aunt Ying Hong, you don't need to fret.

382
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:43,138
There are many things that we haven't witnessed within the three realms.

383
00:29:43,138 --> 00:29:47,488
But the Asuras were wiped out 1,000 years ago.

384
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:49,579
Maybe Xuanji and the rest were lucky.

385
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:53,260
They met some immortals who were trying to help them out.

386
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,540
I hope so.

387
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,860
But it still concerns me, knowing that such a power has appeared in our realm.

388
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,240
We should be cautious and notify the other sects as well.

389
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:19,998
There are no demons in this cave.

390
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:23,715
Minyan said the water demon either perished together with the Gudiao,

391
00:30:23,716 --> 00:30:27,876
or escaped through the water tunnel.

392
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,719
Let's scout the mountain again.

393
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,275
Okay.

394
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:42,035
Why do I get hungrier every time I eat?

395
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,960
Where're my noodles?

396
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,180
Miss, your noodles.

397
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,252
- Thank you. <br> - Enjoy.

398
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,319
Sifeng, you're awake as well?

399
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,643
I was long awake. You were the only one who slept for two days.

400
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,640
You must be hungry then.

401
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,420
Come, try this.

402
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,278
This is delicious.

403
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,783
Is this as delicious as the noodles?

404
00:31:21,784 --> 00:31:23,260
You only know how to eat.

405
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,480
This is the medication I've made.

406
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,740
Did you make this just for me?

407
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,700
I made it since I needed it as well.

408
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:35,121
I didn't want to owe you a favor.

409
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,679
But you gave me the entire bottle.

410
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:41,954
You gave me the entire bottle

411
00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:44,260
because you were afraid that it wasn't enough for me, right?

412
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,820
But you're injured as well.

413
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,260
Don't move. I'll apply the medicine for you.

414
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,511
My hand is fine.

415
00:32:35,994 --> 00:32:37,980
Let's go.

416
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,420
I want to visit Mount Lutai again

417
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:44,361
to see if there are any remains of Gudiao's horns.

418
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:48,394
Sifeng, wait for me.

419
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:50,740
You were worried about me as well.

420
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,906
Linglong and Minyan said they wanted to go as well.

421
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:54,719
Why don't we go together?

422
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,820
She said that they may lock me up again

423
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,295
if we don't obtain any Weeping Tears.

424
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:03,908
If that happens, I won't be able to see you again.

425
00:33:03,908 --> 00:33:05,144
But don't worry.

426
00:33:05,144 --> 00:33:08,453
I'll help you find your mask before they lock me up again.

427
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,373
Because I know the mask is very important to you.

428
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,678
Let's go.

429
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,659
Useless.

430
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:27,599
You can't even keep an eye on a merman.

431
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,999
You better send someone to retrieve him.

432
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,980
If he speaks in front of the cultivators,

433
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,615
he'll reveal the secret about the Tianxu Sect's existence.

434
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:37,620
Yes, Hall Master.

435
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:42,679
- The person responsible... <br> - He defeated Gudiao in one blow.

436
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,820
I have never seen someone like that within the Five Great Sects.

437
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,039
Don't tell me it's the God of War general? Or is it the Devil Star?

438
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,959
My Lord, among all the cultivators,

439
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,143
there's one who was not included in the name list.

440
00:33:59,144 --> 00:34:02,647
She's Chu Linglong, the daughter of Shaoyang Sect's sect leader.

441
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:05,896
According to my investigation, Chu Linglong's birthday

442
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:09,606
was at 9:00 p.m., on the fourth day of the fourth month 16 years ago.

443
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:13,773
It matches the time of the Devil Star and God of War's reincarnation.

444
00:34:13,773 --> 00:34:16,199
Chu Linglong?

445
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,140
Test her out.

446
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,691
Yes, My Lord.

447
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,169
There's nothing left.

448
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:28,893
There's nothing left of the Gudiao.

449
00:34:28,894 --> 00:34:31,006
How are we supposed to make Weeping Tears?

450
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:33,827
Xuanji is done for!

451
00:34:33,827 --> 00:34:36,440
Linglong, don't cry. We'll think of something.

452
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,379
Tell me then! I'm desperate!

453
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:40,619
Linglong, stop crying.

454
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,079
It's fine.

455
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,423
Even if I have to be locked up in Mingxia Cave again, it's fine.

456
00:34:46,424 --> 00:34:47,888
You dumb girl!

457
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:51,120
It's fine even if you can't see me for the rest of your life, right?

458
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,418
Linglong! Linglong!

459
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,120
Linglong!

460
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,813
Did I say something wrong?

461
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:01,520
Why was she angry with me?

462
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,792
You don't want to be locked up in Mingxia Cave.

463
00:35:03,793 --> 00:35:05,933
But why did you say it was fine?

464
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:09,536
It's true that I don't want to be locked up in Mingxia Cave,

465
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:12,180
but I didn't want Ling Long to cry, either.

466
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,561
I thought she would feel better after I told her those words.

467
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:18,940
It's fine for them to lock me up in Mingxia Cave,

468
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,687
as long as Linglong doesn't feel sad.

469
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:22,808
You're a dummy indeed.

470
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,213
But I was thinking about this.

471
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:32,798
If I were to end up in Mingxia Cave again,

472
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,496
I won't be able to enjoy good food.

473
00:35:35,497 --> 00:35:38,777
That's why I want to eat everything I can before they send me back.

474
00:35:38,777 --> 00:35:41,234
I'll buy you anything you want to eat.

475
00:35:41,235 --> 00:35:44,200
- Really? <br> - Yes.

476
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,843
It's my compensation for the lost Gudiao's horns.

477
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,200
Sifeng, you're so kind.

478
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,239
Will you buy me anything I want to eat?

479
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,113
Let go of my arm.

480
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,948
Sir, all your dishes are here.

481
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:32,399
This is too valuable.

482
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,823
- It's fine. <br> - We're a small shop. <br> - Keep the change.

483
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,875
Thank you, Sir.

484
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:40,414
Enjoy your meal.

485
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:42,535
Come, try them.

486
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,900
Sifeng, why can't I smell anything?

487
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,099
Look.

488
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:00,588
There are so many delicious foods,

489
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:02,509
but I can't smell them at all.

490
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:10,560
And now, I can't identify if the songs on the street are good or not.

491
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,721
And the color of the sunset.

492
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:15,479
And the incoming breezes.

493
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,644
I can't feel anything.

494
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:20,093
I'm really envious of other people.

495
00:37:20,093 --> 00:37:22,439
They can feel everything.

496
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,690
I'm sure their lives are great.

497
00:37:32,948 --> 00:37:35,959
Hey, I think we should be more careful.

498
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,480
Why? I thought all the demons were slain?

499
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,015
- What was that? <br> - Let's check it out.

500
00:37:51,915 --> 00:37:53,021
Capture him!

501
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,711
- Go! <br> - Go!

502
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,920
But people are used to their lives.

503
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,360
They take their senses for granted.

504
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,440
And they forget the fact that they enjoy such privileges.

505
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,460
Actually, many feelings are connected to each other.

506
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Through food, you'll experience different feelings as well.

507
00:38:14,702 --> 00:38:16,751
This is a sweet snack.

508
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,460
When you eat it, you'll feel satisfied.

509
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,049
This is happiness.

510
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,780
This is delicious.

511
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,280
This is lotus seed.

512
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,111
The core is very bitter.

513
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,940
When you eat it, you'll feel terrible.

514
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,120
Just like how you feel

515
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,300
when you're not happy.

516
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,580
Sifeng, this is too bitter for me. This is terrible.

517
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,319
This is a loquat.

518
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,254
It has a sour and bitter taste.

519
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,679
Some feelings are inexplicable.

520
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,160
Sometimes, you don't dare to say the things you want to say.

521
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,820
You can experience those types of complex feelings

522
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,488
when you eat a loquat.

523
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,072
Sifeng, even though you've told me so much,

524
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:48,173
I don't understand a thing.

525
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,499
Sifeng, you're smiling.

526
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,413
You look great when you smile.

527
00:39:57,414 --> 00:40:00,034
Just like this one...

528
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,518
Iced wine.

529
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:05,292
Although it's cold from the start,

530
00:40:05,293 --> 00:40:08,364
it gets sweet and mesmerizing when you get to taste them.

531
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:11,245
Sifeng, your smile is just like the wine.

532
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:13,839
That's why your smile looks great.

533
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,869
You need to smile more often. Just like this.

534
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,969
Do you want me to continue or not?

535
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,523
Sometimes,

536
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,002
you want to taste something badly.

537
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:35,320
But you can't eat it even when it's in front of you.

538
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,144
This is what we call...

539
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,350
yearning.

540
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,550

541

548
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,670
Si Feng, after all that you've said,

549
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,760
I think I understood something.

550
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,020
But if that's the case,

551
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,000
it's even harder for me to return to Mingxia Cave.

552

553

♫ <i> I can wait a thousand years alone </i> ♫

554
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,721
Why aren't you speaking?

555
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,580
<i>The water demon on Mount Lutai has been captured!</i>

556
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,799
Come and have a look!

557
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,222
Look at the water demon from Mount Lutai.

558
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:33,623
We've captured the water demon!

559
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,679
Sifeng, I think that's the water demon we encountered in the cave.

560
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,079
This is a merman.

561
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,399
Merman?

562
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,902
I heard that merfolk are great in weaving cloth and singing.

563
00:42:01,903 --> 00:42:04,330
People will be mesmerized by their songs.

564
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:06,583
Are they evil then?

565
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,556
All demons are different.

566
00:42:09,557 --> 00:42:14,919
Some demons harm humans because they want to consume humans

567
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,920
in order to increase their powers.

568
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,716
But merfolk are kind and gentle.

569
00:42:20,717 --> 00:42:22,957
They won't harm humans.

570
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,399
Are you crazy? What did you say?

571
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,863
You want to save the demon?

572
00:42:29,864 --> 00:42:31,519
Celestial Dog and Gudiao were the demons

573
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,020
that had harmed humans on Mount Lutai.

574
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,565
Merfolk have nothing to do with this.

575
00:42:36,565 --> 00:42:37,999
Merfolk are kind.

576
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,779
And they're not aggressive. He's innocent.

577
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:43,780
But he's a demon. Aren't all demons evil?

578
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,996
Demons are just like humans.

579
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,260
There are good and evil demons as well.

580
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,839
The merman doesn't deserve this.

581
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,519
I will try to save him.

582
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,919
You just need to pretend that you don't know anything.

583
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,599
The townsfolk said that the merman was an evil demon.

584
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,878
And they bullied him and pelted him with stones.

585
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:07,999
But when we were in the mountains, he didn't try to harm us at all.

586
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,598
He even tried to help us.

587
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,208
Father said that everything happens for a reason.

588
00:43:13,209 --> 00:43:17,159
Maybe that's the reason why fate has lead us to him again.

589
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,920
Sifeng, I'll follow you and save him.

590
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,159
I can keep watch.

591
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,924
Okay. Count me in.

592
00:43:25,925 --> 00:43:28,025
Since I need to take care of Xuanji.

593
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,415
Must you save him?

594
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,639
Fine.

595
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,039
I don't care anymore.

596
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,079
I treat you as my brother.

597
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,385
I won't stand here and do nothing.

598
00:43:45,385 --> 00:43:47,196
I'll follow you.

599
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,380
Follow me.

600
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,369
We're here to save you.

601
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,399
Four of you, go and capture the merman.

602
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,802
I'll meet Chu Linglong who's born on the 4th day of the 4th month myself.
