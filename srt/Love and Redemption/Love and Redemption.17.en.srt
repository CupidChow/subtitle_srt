Hero Yu, Madam needs to see you.

Please proceed to her chamber.

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,869
Now?

22
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:03,954
Yes.

23
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:05,976
Madam is sincere about this.

24
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:08,267
She said she needs to discuss something with you.

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,225
Okay.

26
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:11,807

00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:37,270
With a solemn posture and a generous heart,

30
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,910
it shows his high rank.

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,470
You may go now.

34
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,922
Yes.

35
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,830
Greetings, Madam.

36
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,904
I wonder what the matter is?

37
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,715
Was my song beautiful?

38
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,159
Why are you staring at the ground?

39
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,174
Everyone said that I'm the most beautiful woman in the world.

40
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:35,685
Look. The flower and I, which one of us is more beautiful?

41
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,747
This scent...

42
00:03:38,747 --> 00:03:42,072
It's the Serpent Perfume of the Zitong Cult.

43
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,061
What cult?

44
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:47,092
I don't know anything.

45
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:50,971
Madam, where did you get this?

46
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:52,719
Do you want to know?

47
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,747
You must promise me one thing then.

48
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:59,579
The wine that you brought has a potent aftertaste.

49
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:04,475
But I can't manage to recreate the same taste no matter what I do.

50
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:09,266
Can you tell me the secret behind that?

51
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,419
- Let me go! <br> - Qing Rong!

52
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:19,556
- Qing Qi! <br> - Qing Rong! What happened?

53
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:21,920
Qing Qi, you came just in time.

54
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,009
I originally wanted him to teach me how to brew wine,

55
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:26,679
but he was trying to violate me.

56
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,980
Kill him for me.

57
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,579
If not, I'll be too ashamed to live in the world.

58
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,259
Madam, you're framing me.

59
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:37,030
You animal! How dare you try to violate my wife!

60
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,349
My Lord, I will never do such an outrageous act.

61
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:42,181
I saw it for myself! How dare you deny it!

62
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,013
Prepare yourself!

63
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,083
Uncle Dong Fang, what are you trying to do?

64
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,386
He tried to violate my wife! I'll kill him no matter what!

65
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:52,332
That's impossible! Sifeng wouldn't do that!

66
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:53,879
Don't try to find excuses for him!

67
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,600
Qing Rong is gorgeous.

68
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:59,386
Every one of them has been eyeing her.

69
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:02,181
He was staring at Qing Rong during the feast.

70
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:03,735
I knew he was eyeing her,

71
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:06,737
but I didn't expect him to commit such an audacious act!

72
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:09,406
- Uncle Dong Fang, calm down! <br> - My Lord.

73
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,411
I'm not willing to argue.

74
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:17,142
Please think about this in a calm manner.

75
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:21,683
Many disciples of yours were chased out because they disrespected Madam.

76
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:24,062
Who do you think is the problem here?

77
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,959
My Lord, you are always upright and honest.

78
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,746
But why are you so muddle-headed and letting someone to manipulate you

79
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,757
when it comes to this?

80
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,319
- Qing Rong. <br> - You believe in him instead of me?

81
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,141
- No! <br> - You're useless to me.

82
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:39,490
- Never find me again. <br> - Qing Rong!

83
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,613
All of you, scram!

84
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:45,304
Qing Rong, wait for me!

85
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,279
How did this happen?

86
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,899
Sifeng, I'll dress your wound.

87
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,190
- I'm fine. <br> - Let's go.

88
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,825
Does it hurt?

89
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:01,559
You would've been framed if I didn't pass by.

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,539
Madam Dong Fang is really something.

91
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,450
Why was she acting like that?

92
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,710
You never saw what happened,

93
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,279
yet you said I was framed?

94
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,559
Do you believe in me that much?

95
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,550
Of course! I know your character the best.

96
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,759
Even if Madam Dong Fang is really gorgeous

97
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,080
and you do have feelings for her,

98
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,880
you'd handle it accordingly.

99
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:25,715
You wouldn't commit such an audacious act.

100
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,039
Have feelings for her?

101
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,338
Chu Xuanji, it's meaningless to me

102
00:06:36,338 --> 00:06:41,070
no matter how beautiful other women are.

103
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,070
Don't you understand?

104
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,090
Is it because disciples from Lize Palace cannot marry?

105
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:53,293
You still don't understand?

106
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:55,039
You removed my mask.

107
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,858
From now on, I don't need to wear any mask anymore.

108
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:01,619
I've broken the rules.

109
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:04,030
That means I've forsaken Lize Palace.

110
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,350
So, it's okay for me to marry someone.

111
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,261
But you said Lize Palace wanted to disown you

112
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:18,812
because you broke the rules.

113
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:22,780
You should return to Mount Shaoyang with me.

114
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,810
Why can't you understand what I'm trying to say?

115
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,318
If I do return to Mount Shaoyang with you, what identity will I hold?

116
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,539
You'll be my friend!

117
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,422
Since young, my father told me that

118
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:36,849
we must help our friends out as much as possible.

119
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,199
So, he'll let you stay there.

120
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,757
Wrong.

121
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,890
We'll be peers then.

122
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,595
You're still wrong.

123
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:48,386
I'm still wrong?

124
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,430
What is it then?

125
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,159
I know now.

126
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,669
You'll join the Shaoyang Sect

127
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:59,850
and become one of us.

128
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,779
As long as you join our sect, you can stay with us officially.

129
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,704
But you'll become my junior if you do so.

130
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,979
<i>Clearly, she doesn't understand what a relationship is.</i>

131
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:13,350
<i>But why was she the only person who could remove my mask?</i>

132
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,610
Never mind. Let's get down to business.

133
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,180
Sit down.

134
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,450
Xuanji, seems like we need to stay here for some days.

135
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,275
We need to solve Master Dong Fang's problem.

136
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:33,131
After that, we can find Minyan and Linglong.

137
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:37,923
Because Master Dong Fang has been bewitched by his wife.

138
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,900
So, it's true that Uncle Dong Fang was bewitched?

139
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,359
Yes.

140
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,759
During tonight's feast,

141
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,919
I gave Master Dong Fang the antidote with the Tasteless Wine.

142
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,273
Xuanji, your family is close to Master Dong Fang.

143
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:56,844
Have you ever heard of news regarding his wife?

144
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,279
I remember that when I was young, my father told me that

145
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,839
there was a cult on Mount Zitong.

146
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,297
They always captured young women in order to brew their concoctions.

147
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:17,359
That time, Uncle Dong Fang went to destroy the cult

148
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,878
and he saved the only surviving girl in the cave.

149
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,289
He brought her back and made her his wife.

150
00:09:24,904 --> 00:09:27,289
If they captured young women,

151
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:31,220
it's impossible for the cult to leave them alive.

152
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,997
How could a young and weak woman manage to survive the ordeal?

153
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,646
You're saying that...

154
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:41,590
Madam Dong Fang belongs to the cult.

155
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,519
If not, how would she know how to use the Gu Poison of a cult?

156
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,159
When someone is bewitched, they'll become hot-tempered.

157
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,529
<i>Such impudence! I have the same rank as your father!</i>

158
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:52,119
<i>How dare you disobey me!</i>

159
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,818
<i>Why is the wine tasteless?</i>

160
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:57,949
In the end, they'll lose all control and they'll be manipulated.

161
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,180
The condition will become worse during a full moon night.

162
00:10:02,272 --> 00:10:06,039
In the end, if Madam casts the last spell,

163
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,355
Master Dong Fang will become her puppet.

164
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:11,028
Fuyu Island is in danger.

165
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,779
When will the next full moon appear?

166
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,516
- The day after tomorrow. <br> - The day after tomorrow?

167
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,690
You're finally willing to see me.

168
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,480
Why are you only willing to meet me

169
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,630
during a full moon night?

170
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,090
Listen, you mustn't drink with someone else next time.

171
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,017
Tell me if you want to drink.

172
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:49,528
I can accompany you.

173
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:52,799
I can drink with anyone I wish.

174
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,693
If you're not willing to accompany me, I can leave right now.

175
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:57,588
Wait! Qing Rong, don't joke around.

176
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:58,959
Why would I do so?

177
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,715
I'll be very happy whenever you want to see me.

178
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:04,726
Stop acting like this, okay?

179
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,370
I've prepared some wine for you.

180
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,930
Come, drink it.

181
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,399
Thank you.

182
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,599
Let me play a song for you.

183
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,013
- You can skip the song. <br> - No.

184
00:11:35,014 --> 00:11:38,124
I feel like playing it right now.

185
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,910
I didn't know you were into playing songs.

186
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,410
There are many things that you do not know about me.

187
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,874
That's right.

188
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,870
We've been a couple for so many years,

189
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,970
yet you still remain mysterious.

190
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,190
I first met you in that cave.

191
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,581
After one glance,

192
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:38,110
I knew I couldn't forget you.

193
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,030
From that day onward,

194
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,298
I swore to the heavens.

195
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:47,470
You'll be my most precious in the world.

196
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,159
What a joke.

197
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,581
I almost gave up on becoming a cultivator.

198
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:59,132
Even becoming an immortal can't compare to the times when we're together.

199
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:01,990
I really think that

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,650
I'm the happiest man in the world.

201
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,590
Because I got to be together with you.

202
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,479
What about you? Qing Rong?

203
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,750
We have been married for more than a decade.

204
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,770
How I wish you wouldn't play your song tonight.

205
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,150
So, you knew everything.

206
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,688
Uncle Dong Fang was so kind towards you.

207
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:02,219
Why are you trying to harm him?

208
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:03,512
Tell me.

209
00:14:03,513 --> 00:14:06,383
Tell me why you're doing this.

210
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:10,754
If I'm not mistaken, you weren't captured by the cult,

211
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:13,385
you're the leader of the cult.

212
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,039
After your cult was destroyed, you had no way to escape.

213
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,377
That's why you pretended to be pitiful in order to save yourself.

214
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:21,928
Master Dong Fang is intelligent.

215
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,639
Maybe he knew the truth all along

216
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,611
but he still tolerated you.

217
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:29,102
Why are you trying to harm him?

218
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,830
Qing Rong, I've put down the past.

219
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:36,692
Why can't you just forget about the past?

220
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,959
What a joke!

221
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,007
You eliminated my entire cult.

222
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:43,338
How could I forget that?

223
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,519
And you all.

224
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,679
Your so-called righteous sects have slain many people as well!

225
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,950
Why can't we do the same thing when you are doing it?

226
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:59,158
You are just bullying the weak by using righteousness as an excuse!

227
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,598
Not only that,

228
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:07,084
you even locked me up on this island.

229
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:09,195
I can't go anywhere.

230
00:15:09,196 --> 00:15:11,854
You treat me as your pet

231
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:14,675
and you want me to feel grateful for that?

232
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:16,578
I wanted you to know

233
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:19,989
what it felt like to have a fate worse than death.

234
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:23,419
It's a pity that you discovered my plot.

235
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:25,159
But it's fine.

236
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,182
I've had enough of living like this.

237
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:31,433
You can do anything you want.

238
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,879
Master, let me kill her on your behalf

239
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,864
in order to appease your hatred.

240
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,437
Just let her go.

241
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,861
Qing Rong, no matter if you believe it or not,

242
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:54,789
I've been keeping you on Fuyu Island in order to protect you.

243
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,010
I didn't expect you to misunderstand me this badly.

244
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,392
Just leave.

245
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:07,074
I've lost today.

246
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,650
You can take my life.

247
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,398
Qing Rong, what are you doing?

248
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,049
You asked me to leave?

249
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,865
I'm homeless now.

250
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,619
Where else can I go?

251
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,479
It's better if you kill me.

252
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,910
Qing Rong, of course, I'm not willing to let you leave.

253
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,875
But you're suffering here,

254
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:36,146
so how could I force you to stay by my side?

255
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,761
Actually, I'm just worried that

256
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:43,946
you only care for my appearance.

257
00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:49,279
I'm afraid that one day when I grow ugly and old,

258
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,425
you'll be reminded of my true identity.

259
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:54,185
Don't you understand my love for you?

260
00:16:54,186 --> 00:16:57,239
Even if you want me to die, you can just tell me to do so.

261
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,899
I'm willing to die for you.

262
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,470
I don't want you to die.

263
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,263
Do you believe this?

264
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:08,598
I'll give you the antidote even if they're not around.

265
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,370
Of course, I do.

266
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,860
Qing Rong, I know you still love me. Am I right?

267
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:25,159
Of course.

268
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,854
I have your child.

269
00:17:26,854 --> 00:17:30,279
How could I bear to kill the father of our child?

270
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,396
- Are you speaking the truth? <br> - Yes.

271
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:34,759
I always thought you didn't like children?

272
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,570
Silly boy.

273
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,875
Qing Rong.

274
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:42,001
I don't wish to see them.

275
00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:45,632
I only want to be with you alone.

276
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,279
Okay. All of you, leave.

277
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,890
Come.

278
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,924
But...

279
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:06,439
Everyone, I hope you can keep that a secret.

280
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,140
Uncle Dong Fang, I...

281
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,990
I've gotten to the bottom of this.

282
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,599
My wife was just pranking me.

283
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,590
It's not a good thing if people know about this.

284
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,287
Hero Yu, it was a misunderstanding.

285
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:22,798
Here, I'll apologize to you on behalf of my wife.

286
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,227
Master, Madam almost killed you.

287
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:28,898
Are you really going to let her off?

288
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:32,124
I've taken the antidote. I'm fine now.

289
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,359
She's very pitiful as well.

290
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,000
Moreover, a couple shouldn't have any overnight feuds.

291
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,910
You will understand this soon.

292
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:47,202
You two, just treat it as if you two haven't been here.

293
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:48,999
Master Dong Fang, don't worry.

294
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,054
We won't tell anyone.

295
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:53,386
Thank you.

296
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,479
Master Dong Fang is still very confused.

297
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,279
Tomorrow, when he feels better,

298
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,799
we'll ask for permission to leave the island.

299
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,650
We'll find Minyan and Linglong after that, okay?

300
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,719
But do you think Madam was really pranking him?

301
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,656
- I don't think she's pranking him. <br> - You don't know anything,

302
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:17,296
yet you're not as ignorant as I think.

303
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:20,576
I don't understand what she's trying to do.

304
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,691
Does she love or hate Uncle Dong Fang?

305
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:26,514
She wants him to live, yet she wants him to die.

306
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:28,773
Uncle Dong Fang is pretty weird as well.

307
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:32,480
He wants her to leave, yet he wants her to come back.

308
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,747
A relationship is between two persons.

309
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:37,042
It's hard for outsiders to understand what's going on.

310
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,199
If you get into a relationship, you'll experience both good and bad.

311
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,639
Sometimes, it's sweet. Sometimes, it's bitter.

312
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,913
It's unpredictable.

313
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:47,959
I think Uncle Dong Fang is quite pitiful.

314
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,897
Madam Dong Fang is evil,

315
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,680
but he's still trying to protect her.

316
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,479
Even the kindest person will be disliked by someone.

317
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,367
Even the evilest person will be loved by someone.

318
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:02,359
As long as they're willing, they won't think they're pitiful.

319
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,987
Instead, they'll feel satisfied.

320
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,940
Anything that has to do with feelings is difficult.

321
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:15,771
It's more difficult than my training.

322
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,370
I don't want to encounter something as troublesome as that.

323
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,291
Sifeng?

324
00:20:24,581 --> 00:20:27,071
Sifeng, why are you standing here?

325
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,916
I was thinking that the night scenery is beautiful.

326
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:37,512
I heard that Master Dong Fang has hidden some top-grade Flower Wine.

327
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:40,500
Why don't we steal some of them?

328
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,559
Steal? It's not good to steal.

329
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,740
But why not?

330
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,350
We did him a huge favor.

331
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,450
Stealing some wine isn't a big deal.

332
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,023
- You have a point. Let's go. <br> - Let's go.

333
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:54,328
What a pity.

334
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:57,997
Dong Fang Qing Qi almost became my puppet,

335
00:20:57,997 --> 00:21:01,507
but the two rascals spoiled my plan.

336
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,054
That Yu Sifeng, he was actually unfazed by my beauty.

337
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:12,425
And I didn't expect him

338
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:14,833
to recognize my bewitching spell.

339
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,727
We don't have much time.

340
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:20,818
I can only think of other ways.

341
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,334
Don't tell me you're going to leave?

342
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,242
You promised me that you'd leave with me.

343
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,671
And that,

344
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,750
you'll leave with our child, too.

345
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,170
So many flower petals!

346
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,510
They're so beautiful!

347
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,996
Xuanji.

348
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,192
Sifeng!

349
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,830
This vat of wine smells the best.

350
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,480
<i>[Pure Flower Dew Wine]</i>

351
00:22:40,134 --> 00:22:41,597
It's so fragrant!

352
00:22:41,597 --> 00:22:44,011
This is Pure Flower Dew Wine.

353
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:46,201
We must let it settle down before we drink.

354
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:48,432
Sifeng, I knew you were the best.

355
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,203
You can overcome any obstacles in the world.

356
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,580
Actually, there is one thing I cannot overcome.

357
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,430
Are you willing to help me out?

358
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,551
Your affairs are my affairs.

359
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:03,002
Tell me. How can I help you?

360
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,959
The thing that's been troubling me

361
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,970
is hidden within the bottom of this wine jar.

362
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:12,402
You'll see it after we finish the wine.

363
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:15,359
I heard that the sea view on Fuyu Island is great.

364
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,839
Why don't we enjoy some wine by the sea?

365
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,690
Sure. Let's go.

366
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,870
Yu Ning? Pian Pian?

367
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,288
How could the two of you do this?

368
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:30,493
That's the only jar of Pure Flower Dew Wine.

369
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,139
And you got to it first.

370
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:34,699
How about we share the wine?

371
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:37,659
Sure. Sifeng, we won't drink it by the sea then.

372
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:39,019
Let's drink it in the wine cellar.

373
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:41,779
We came without notice. Are we interrupting you guys?

374
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:43,530
Of course.

375
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,819
Not at all. The more, the merrier.

376
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:51,450
Sifeng, let's go.

377
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,620
It's meaningless if we drink it like this.

378
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:02,260
Why don't we play Rock-Paper-Scissors?

379
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,439
What do you think?

380
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,503
Sure. But we need to lay down the rules.

381
00:24:05,504 --> 00:24:07,679
Those who win can take one sip.

382
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,519
Those who lose can only stare in silence.

383
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,308
I'll definitely take the first sip.

384
00:24:13,308 --> 00:24:15,037
Me first.

385
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,630
Sifeng won.

386
00:24:21,371 --> 00:24:22,779
Sifeng, that's enough!

387
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,530
You're more of an alcoholic than me.

388
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,990
You finished half of the wine in one sip.

389
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,687
- Who's next? <br> - Me.

390
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,270
Sifeng won again.

391
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,484
You!

392
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,385
Take it easy.

393
00:24:55,385 --> 00:24:57,672
Although the Pure Flower Dew Wine is sweet when you drink it,

394
00:24:57,673 --> 00:25:00,003
it has a huge kick.

395
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,190
You're something. There's only a little bit left.

396
00:25:06,802 --> 00:25:09,792
I'll play with Xuanji next.

397
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:11,345
Sure.

398
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:19,359
I won!

399
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,676
You won.

400
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,610
It's mine now.

401
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,239
You drink it.

402
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,140
<i>Oh no, the words have become solid inside the wine jar.</i>

403
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,919
<i>They can't be removed.</i>

404
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,174
<i> [You don't know that I fancy you.]</i>

405
00:25:33,175 --> 00:25:35,201
But I won the match.

406
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,552
That wine is mine.

407
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,622
The moonlight is intoxicating indeed.

408
00:25:42,623 --> 00:25:44,833
I can't drink this.

409
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:48,750
There's a heart inside. Look.

410
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,932
It's true.

411
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,799
There's a heart indeed.

412
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,565
Xuanji, look.

413
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,430
There's nothing inside though.

414
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,010
I don't see anything.

415
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,900
Let's go. We didn't manage to drink.

416
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,100
I'm tired now. Let's go.

417
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,820
Let's go.

418
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,040
Why are you leaving?

419
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,650
Sifeng, why are they leaving?

420
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,204
It's good that they're gone.

421
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:39,539
Troublemakers.

422
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:43,699
Sifeng, are you drunk?

423
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:45,470
I'm not drunk.

424
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,279
You're the one who's drunk.

425
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,870
Me? I haven't had one sip.

426
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,599
It's all because of you.

427
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,446
Dumb Xuanji.

428
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,489
Okay, I'm dumb.

429
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,489
You're drunk. We should return early.

430
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:03,041
Come.

431
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,860
You're not allowed to go.

432
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,710
My problem hasn't been solved yet.

433
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,850
What problem?

434
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,050
You are my problem.

435
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,064
Xuanji, you always ignore everything

436
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,360
and try to drill yourself into my heart.

437
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,200
You make me feel uneasy.

438
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,440
And I always dream about you.

439
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:50,598
Tell me. What should be your punishment?

440
00:27:50,598 --> 00:27:52,479
You feel uneasy?

441
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,030
And you always dream about me?

442
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,522
Sifeng, I haven't seen you for four years.

443
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:01,600
I always dreamed about you, too.

444
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,272
Does this frustrate you?

445
00:28:05,272 --> 00:28:08,585
You feel that way as well?

446
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,410
You don't need to answer me yet.

447
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,550
Listen to my heart.

448
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,610
You can answer after that.

449
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,232
<i>Why is his heart beating so fast?</i>

450
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:34,703
<i>Don't tell me he's sick?</i>

451
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,091
This...

452
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,642
Sifeng, why is your heart beating so fast?

453
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:54,680
Are you sick?

454
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,319
Let's find a physician.

455
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,670
There's a window on top. We can exit from there.

456
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:05,880
♫ <i> Throw away the paper parasol, the pain of yearning, <br>when it was just a dream </i> ♫

471
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,610
Sifeng.

472
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,039
Sifeng, why are you ignoring me?

473
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,625
Speak to me.

474
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,020
What are you doing?

475
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,824
Xuanji, you should know that

476
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,710
you have to be responsible for me once you removed my mask.`

477
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:01,260
I removed your mask. Of course, I need to be responsible for you.

478
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,946
Is that so?

479

It's too fragrant.

481
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,530
Sifeng, this...

482
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,679
What's wrong with you?

483
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,280
The flowers are too fragrant.

484
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,310
They're irritating my nose.

485
00:31:34,951 --> 00:31:36,319
Smell this.

486
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,350
Smell this. Isn't it fragrant?

487
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,970
- Am I right? <br> - It's pretty fragrant.

488
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,823
Stop fooling around!

489
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,376
You're bad!

490
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,000
Chu Xuanji, do you know what this is?

491
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,152
Sifeng, you drank too much.

492
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:30,890
This is Fuyu Island's Love Stone.

493
00:32:30,891 --> 00:32:33,999
It fell from the heavenly realm a few hundred years ago.

494
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,996
As stated in the books,

495
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:41,319
if two people, who are fated to be together, approach this stone,

496
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,628
the stone will glow.

497
00:32:46,628 --> 00:32:50,398
What has it got to do with us?

498
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,750
I want to try this with you.

499
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,560
It's fake. Stupid rock.

500
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,199
I'm going to smash it.

501
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,940
Sifeng, don't do that!

502
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,319
This belongs to Fuyu Island. We shouldn't touch it.

503
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,861
Just ignore the stupid rock. It'll be bad if someone saw you.

504
00:33:44,861 --> 00:33:48,137
Hurry, let's return.

505
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,529
Let's go.

506
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,516
Sifeng.

507
00:34:02,516 --> 00:34:04,740
Sifeng, you're awake?

508
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,379
Here's some hangover soup. You should drink it.

509
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,083
I'll drink it by myself.

510
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,554
It's fine.

511
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,989
What sound is that?

512
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,379
I think someone came to the island.

513
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,826
Is it Linglong and Sixth Senior? Let's have a look.

514
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,676
Deputy Chief?

515
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,069
What a coincidence.

516
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,970
Greetings, Deputy Chief.

517
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,840
What did I say before you left?

518
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,732
Our master has such high expectations for you.

519
00:35:13,732 --> 00:35:16,220
But the mask couldn't hold you down.

520
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,891
You found a way to remove the mask.

521
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,099
The little girl is all grown up now.

522
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:27,559
I almost couldn't recognize you.

523
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,439
You're so lucky.

524
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,774
Did she remove the mask for you?

525
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:33,239
Are you going to blame Sifeng again?

526
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,961
I removed the mask. It has nothing to do with him.

527
00:35:35,962 --> 00:35:38,552
You should come at me.

528
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,112
Miss, you're not from Lize Palace.

529
00:35:41,113 --> 00:35:44,020
I don't dare to approach you.

530
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,619
But... did you really remove the mask?

531
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:49,099
Of course.

532
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,061
Yu Sifeng, I want to congratulate you.

533
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:57,210
You're the first person who managed to remove that mask in Lize Palace.

534
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,227
What do you mean by that?

535
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:03,812
Sifeng was injured. I was afraid something might happen to him.

536
00:36:03,812 --> 00:36:06,302
That's why I removed the mask.

537
00:36:06,302 --> 00:36:09,090
Good. Very good.

538
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,148
There's an old rule in Lize Palace.

539
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:16,170
If someone can remove that mask,

540
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,730
Lize Palace will not try to make him stay.

541
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,250
Yu Sifeng, it seems like this is your happy ending.

542
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,928
But you need to return the mask to Lize Palace.

543
00:36:26,928 --> 00:36:29,579
You need to give an explanation to the palace master.

544
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,982
Where's the mask?

545
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,780
Deputy Chief, I lost the mask while I was fighting the Purple Fox

546
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,110
in Mount Gao.

547
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,139
You lost it?

548
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,794
What is this then?

549
00:36:55,442 --> 00:36:57,652
The mask is crying.

550
00:36:57,652 --> 00:37:00,710
That means your curse hasn't been dispelled.

551
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,119
That's a different story.

552
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,814
Yu Sifeng, you should return and explain it to our palace master personally.

553
00:37:07,814 --> 00:37:12,259
Deputy Chief, I still have many questions left unanswered.

554
00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:13,844
Please give me more time.

555
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:16,575
I will try to solve everything.

556
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,577
Sorry, Xuanji.

557
00:37:27,174 --> 00:37:29,864
I can't accompany you to find Linglong and Minyan.

558
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:33,550
Wait here. Those from Shaoyang Sect will pick you up.

559
00:37:34,192 --> 00:37:36,742
You mustn't go on your own.

560
00:37:37,492 --> 00:37:39,722
Must you return?

561
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,823
I'll follow you then.

562
00:37:43,823 --> 00:37:45,974
I'm worried about you.

563
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,659
This is my personal matter.

564
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:54,423
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

565
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:56,870
I'll surely return for you.

566
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,590
Xuanji, let me tell you a secret.

567
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,610
It's really difficult to be a human.

568
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,340
But you...

569
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,090
You're the reason why I'm willing to become one.

570
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,259
Ruo Yu, return with Yu Sifeng.

571
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,670
Yes.

572
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,154
Wait.

573
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,688
What else?

574
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:49,119
Listen. I'll pick up Sifeng at Lize Palace in a few days.

575
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,518
Miss, don't you know the rules of Lize Palace?

576
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:55,351
No women are allowed in Lize Palace.

577
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:57,665
I'll wait outside then.

578
00:38:57,665 --> 00:39:02,883
And I want you to promise me that Sifeng won't be harmed.

579
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,578
Don't think that everyone in Lize Palace has a mild temper.

580
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:08,750
Yu Sifeng is a disciple of Lize Palace.

581
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,234
Anything he receives has nothing to do with you.

582
00:39:12,234 --> 00:39:14,417
I'm not as mild-tempered as Sifeng.

583
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:16,499
If you can't promise me that,

584
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:19,476
- Sifeng will stay behind. <br> - Stay behind?

585
00:39:19,476 --> 00:39:21,372
On what basis?

586
00:39:21,373 --> 00:39:24,161
Do you know what you need to do after you remove the mask?

587
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,999
I know. I need to be responsible for him.

588
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,296
I removed the mask. I'll be responsible for him.

589
00:39:29,297 --> 00:39:31,158
How? Tell me.

590
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:33,189
You need to marry him.

591
00:39:33,774 --> 00:39:35,285
Are you willing to do so?

592
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,343
Deputy Chief!

593
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:39,007
<i>I need to marry him?</i>

594
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,018
<i>So, Sifeng meant we must get married?</i>

595
00:39:42,018 --> 00:39:45,002
<i>So, that's the problem.</i>

596
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:46,871
<i>It's my fault. I didn't understand him completely.</i>

597
00:39:46,872 --> 00:39:50,622
Miss Chu looks unhappy with that.

598
00:39:53,382 --> 00:39:54,639
I agree.

599
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,963
If marrying him is the only way for him to escape punishment,

600
00:39:57,963 --> 00:39:59,972
I'll marry him.

601
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,905
Sifeng, you've done so much for me.

602
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,684
It's okay.

603
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:11,615
I can do this for you.

604
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:17,270
Miss Chu, if you do so willingly,

605
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,220
the mask will become a smiling mask.

606
00:40:19,221 --> 00:40:21,091
But it's not smiling.

607
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,180
Stupid mask! I've agreed to marry him!

608
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,840
Why aren't you smiling?

609
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:28,813
- You're not doing it willingly. <br> - Nonsense!

610
00:40:28,814 --> 00:40:32,239
Deputy Chief, please give Xuanji and me some time.

611
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,976
I've given you ample time.

612
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,437
Take him away.

613
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,412
Don't touch him!

614
00:40:49,298 --> 00:40:50,691
I don't understand.

615
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:53,158
How could you let a mask decide someone's fate?

616
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,519
That's the dumbest rule I have ever heard of.

617
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,290
Today, I'm going to destroy this stupid mask.

618
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,979
The mask was made by the bark of the Kunlun Tree. It's tough.

619
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,565
How could she destroy it without any effort?

620
00:41:12,565 --> 00:41:13,951
<i>Dingkun Sword?</i>

621
00:41:13,952 --> 00:41:16,039
<i>Why does she have the Dingkun Sword?</i>

622
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,930
Now that the mask is gone, you have no way to punish Si Feng.

623
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,485
The mask was destroyed.

624
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:28,119
That adds another level to Yu Sifeng's misdeeds.

625
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,042
I won't let you take him away!

626
00:41:30,043 --> 00:41:33,509
What? Are you trying to attack me?

627
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,830
Xuanji, calm down.

628
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,219
You've offended me too many times.

629
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,027
Don't blame me for disrespecting your father.

630
00:41:46,027 --> 00:41:47,743
You're just a mantis. How dare you try to stop a cart! <br> <i>(T/N: Chinese idiom - to overrate oneself and attempt something impossible)</i>

631
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:49,513
Brace yourself!

632
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,690
Deputy Chief!

633
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,903
Xuanji!

634
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,664
Xuanji?

635
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,703
Spell of Tranquility, calmness among all else, return to tranquility.

636
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,801
Xuanji!

637
00:42:50,285 --> 00:42:53,655
Deputy Chief, what exactly happened?

638
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,352
You actually ignored your status as an elder

639
00:42:56,353 --> 00:42:58,559
and fought against your junior.

640
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,479
Sect Leader Chu's daughter

641
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,730
forced me to release Sifeng with the Dingkun Sword in her hand.

642
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:07,121
I was taken aback.

643
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,760
Are you talking about the divine weapon

644
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,350
which fell into the human realm?

645
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,839
Deputy Chief, you misunderstood her.

646
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,537
That sword was given to her by my master.

647
00:43:20,538 --> 00:43:23,639
Although it's made from rare materials,

648
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,159
- it's not a divine weapon. <br> - That's right.

649
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,370
Xuanji's cultivation is just ordinary.

650
00:43:29,371 --> 00:43:32,301
I'm sure she wouldn't be able to master a divine weapon.

651
00:43:32,301 --> 00:43:35,123
Fine. You already said it.

652
00:43:35,123 --> 00:43:37,079
I'll treat it as my mistake.

653
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,899
Okay, let's skip that. We should get back to business.

654
00:43:40,899 --> 00:43:44,599
Everyone knows that the Destiny Pearl is in my hands now.

655
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,241
But the disciples that I've sent to Xuanyuan Sect haven't returned yet.

656
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:50,919
No one knows exactly what happened.

657
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,244
The most important thing now is the spirit key within the Destiny Pearl.

658
00:43:56,244 --> 00:43:58,250
Spirit key?

659
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,759
Why am I in the dark?

660
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,222
Deputy Chief, we're in a plight.

661
00:44:03,222 --> 00:44:07,230
I hope everyone can be honest and not hide anything from each other.

662
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,348
1,000 years ago, the heavenly realm sent four spirit keys

663
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,430
to the four righteous sects.

664
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,970
Fuyu Island, Lize Palace, Xuanyuan Sect, and Dianjing Valley Sect.

665
00:44:17,974 --> 00:44:19,153
Each sect holds one spirit key.

666
00:44:19,153 --> 00:44:21,479
And they're hidden within each sect as a treasure.

667
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,995
According to Xuanji's news, Tianxu Hall knew about that fact long ago.

668
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,866
And they're aiming for our spirit keys.

669
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:30,650
Yes.

670
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:34,457
After all this time, the demons aren't weak and feeble anymore.

671
00:44:34,457 --> 00:44:36,686
They've become a huge threat.

672
00:44:36,686 --> 00:44:41,079
It's fine if they just want to save Wu Zhiqi with the spirit keys.

673
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,650
I'm just afraid that they're after something more.

674
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:49,324
I heard that they wanted to revive the Devil Star.

675
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,399
The Devil Star?

676
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,265
What a joke.

677
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:55,702
I think it's impossible as well.

678
00:44:55,703 --> 00:44:59,287
The Devil Star was vanquished 1,000 years ago.

679
00:44:59,288 --> 00:45:00,930
How could they revive it?

680
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:04,761
It's just their wishful thinking.

681
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,487
But, speaking of which, we need to be more careful with the spirit keys.

682
00:45:09,488 --> 00:45:11,278
How about this?

683
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:16,926
We'll formulate a plan after Dianjing Valley Sect's sect leader gets here.

684
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:30,710
