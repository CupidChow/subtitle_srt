00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,119
Xuanji!

21
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,239
Minyan, have you found Linglong?

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,873
No!

23
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:57,984
Let's slay these demons before anything else.

24
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,199
How dare you barge in when you have so few people?

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,839
You're digging your own grave!

26
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,900
I need to give you a warm welcome since you made it here.

27
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,145
Attack!

28
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,460
Senior Hao Chen?

29
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,530
I'll punish you when we return.

30
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,700
Demon, how dare you hurt my junior sister?

31
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,559
You're digging your own grave.

32
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,916
You sound pretty arrogant.

33
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:28,373
Don't think you can escape by breaking through my Soul Sonar.

34
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,220
You became a demon instead of a human when you had the chance.

35
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,750
Attack!

36
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,536
Yu'er?

37
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,284

38
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,199
Linglong!

39
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,234
Linglong!

40
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,825
Let her go!

41
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,739
Scoundrel! What did you do to her?

42
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:03,600
Zhong Minyan, you lost to me before.

43
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,252
You're overestimating your abilities.

44
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:06,601
Are you anxious?

45
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,483
It's a pity that you're too late.

I'm sure Second Senior is inside!

50
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,887
Xuanji!

51
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,179
Xuanji!

52
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,470
Xuanji, are you okay?

53
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,779
You made me worried.

54
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:37,919
You were almost crushed by the closing entrance.

55
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,151
- I just wanted to save him. <br> - You need to care for your own safety!

56
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,662
Do you understand?

57
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,494
Xuanji, are you okay?

58
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,359
Hero Yu, I have several questions.

59
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,118
Where did you get the news?

60
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,279
How did you manage to find this place before us?

61
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,279
Why did you bring my junior here without informing the sect leaders?

62
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,533
And why did you save that demon spirit?

63
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:11,844
Don't tell me you know that demon spirit?

64
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,079
I have the Sound Bell with me.

65
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,919
That's why we came here earlier than you.

66
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,359
We wanted to save Linglong.

67
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,385
We came here right after we got the news.

68
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:22,707
We didn't have time to report the news.

69
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,577
As for that demon spirit,

70
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:27,840
I have never seen her before.

71
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,942
I was standing in front of her by coincidence.

72
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:32,764
Senior Hao Chen, you're thinking too much.

73
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:36,380
You're full of deceit and you're always hiding something.

74
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,523
Xuanji, it's okay if you become friends with an honest guy like Minyan.

75
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:42,524
I won't reject that.

76
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:46,370
But for fake people like him,

77
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,039
we should avoid them.

78
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,430
Senior Hao Chen, Sifeng isn't like that.

79
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,151
This is bad. This place is going to collapse.

80
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:58,798
Let's leave.

81
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,004
Your fellow disciples have ruined my new hideout.

82
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:08,759
I can only bring you to the headquarters.

83
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,139
Guards!

84
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,100
Bring him away. Give him a warm welcome.

85
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,330
Yes!

86
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,879
My Lord, she's with the disciples of Shaoyang Sect.

87
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,100
I've seen her before.

88
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,899
No! I'm a demon spirit!

89
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:25,330
I'm trying to seek refuge in Tianxu Hall.

90
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:30,053
You're trying to seek refuge?

91
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:31,404
Sure.

92
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,119
I'll grant you your wish.

93
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,730
- Lock her up in a cell! <br> - Yes!

94
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,092
No! Don't lock me up! Let me go!

95
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:40,479
I'm really here to seek refuge!

96
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,079
My Lord, our plans were disrupted before we got the chance

97
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,071
to send the severed hand in exchange for the spirit key.

98
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:48,222
If our Hall Master knows about this, we'll...

99
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:51,460
I still have other plans.

100
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:54,211
Your master won't be able to blame me.

101
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,239
Junior Sister, how is she?

102
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,686
Senior Brother, don't worry.

103
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,199
Linglong has not been poisoned and she doesn't have any serious injury.

104
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,519
She'll be fine.

105
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,599
I think she was just shocked. She'll be fine after some rest.

106
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,010
- Good. <br> - This is great.

107
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:32,103
It's good that Linglong is fine.

108
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,354
We should let her sleep now.

109
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:38,060
That's great.

110
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,746
That bad Wu Tong is too much.

111
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,077
I wonder where Second Senior is right now?

112
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:45,937
We managed to save Linglong, but we lost Minjue.

113
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:49,047
What is Wu Tong plotting?

114
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,890
- Minyan! <br> - Sixth Senior!

115
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,226
- Sixth Senior! <br> - Minyan!

116
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,799
Senior, this is Five Poisons Palm!

117
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,399
It is a very potent skill.

118
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,398
If we don't neutralize the poison soon, he'll be in danger.

119
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,159
I heard that we need five types

120
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,758
of poisonous herbs to dispel its poison.

121
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,056
Yes. But first, we need to figure out the five poisons in his body right now.

122
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:16,754
Only then can we make the cure. We need some time for this.

123
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:19,044
I hope Minyan can stay strong.

124
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,246
Minxing, bring him to the room beside us.

125
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:25,847
- Yes. <br> - Here.

126
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,686
Sixth Senior, don't worry.

127
00:10:32,686 --> 00:10:34,485
We will neutralize your poison.

128
00:10:34,486 --> 00:10:37,016
And we will find a cure for you.

144
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,079
Sifeng?

145
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,639
You're awake?

146
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,783
Have you identified the five poisons found within Minyan?

147
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:21,239
Yes. We've made the cure as well.

148
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,722
But inside it, there's one special ingredient called Yin Yang Grass.

149
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,545
Its poisonous nature will change regularly.

150
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:29,180
And different times will have a different effect on its nature.

151
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,651
What will the consequences be then?

152
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,291
If it has a Yang nature,

153
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:38,079
it can neutralize Minyan's poison when you mix it with the other four poisons.

154
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,470
But if it has a Yin nature, it will clash with the other poisons.

155
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:44,980
And this will cause Minyan to die instantly.

156
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,341
Do we have a way to find out about its nature then?

157
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:53,919
Sect Leader, maybe you don't know this.

158
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,360
This is precisely why we're worried.

159
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,959
There's no way to tell which nature it has.

160
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,500
That's why we need someone to test the concoction.

161
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:04,124
It's just that it is concocted with poisonous herbs.

162
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,584
It will harm the test subject as well.

163
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,439
Especially...

164
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:12,444
If it has a Yin nature,

165
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:16,320
it will reduce the test subject's power to nothing.

166
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,397
And I haven't figured out a solution yet.

167
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,788
But time is not on Minyan's side.

168
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,152
- I'll be the test subject. <br> - No!

169
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:26,639
The concoction is very poisonous.

170
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,359
If it has a Yin nature, it will reduce your power to nothing.

171
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,667
Now, I mustn't let anyone else be in trouble.

172
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:34,959
But you need a test subject somehow.

173
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,044
Xuanji, I know.

174
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:39,222
You're most concerned about Minyan.

175
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:42,219
But this is a special case. You'll be in danger if you do this.

176
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,374
Sixth Senior took great care of Linglong and me.

177
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,959
Now, it's my turn to do something for him.

178
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,527
Let me be the test subject.

179
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,599
No!

180
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,186
Sifeng!

181
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,410
- Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng!

182
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,407
Sifeng, you...

183
00:13:58,408 --> 00:14:01,092
It's my chance to help my brother out.

184
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:03,199
Of course, it needs to be me.

185
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,260
Sifeng! Sifeng!

186
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,610
Sifeng, are you okay? Please don't scare me.

187
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,930
Sifeng!

188
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,701
Sifeng!

189
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,691
Sifeng!

190
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:41,725
Sifeng!

191
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,725
How is it?

192
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,678
It has a Yang nature. This will work.

193
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,080
Swallow this Vitality Pill.

194
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:01,580
Sifeng, you don't look too well.

195
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,750
Let me take you back to your room.

196
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,825
I'm fine.

197
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:08,287
I just need to recuperate on my own.

198
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,964
I'll return by myself.

199
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:12,039
Hurry and give Minyan the cure.

200
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,889
No, I must take you back first.

201
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,719
Xuanji, this is a potent poison. We mustn't be careless.

202
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,654
All of us are here. Don't worry.

203
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:23,890
Take Sifeng back and take care of him.

204
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:26,927
Sifeng, let's go.

205
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,999
Xuanji, I'm fine.

206
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,836
You should return now.

207
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,302
No. You need to rest well.

208
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:51,128
Why didn't you let me drink the concoction?

209
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:54,678
Sixth Senior is my senior. Logically, I should be the test subject.

210
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,377
Minyan is my good brother as well.

211
00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:04,867
Why can't I be the test subject?

212
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,960
I wonder how he's doing right now? You should go and check.

213
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,559
But what about you?

214
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,372
I'm fine.

215
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,767
I need to recuperate.

216
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:20,900
It's not convenient for me when you're here.

217
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,282
- I... <br> - Go now.

218
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,600
But...

219
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,550
But you must tell me if you feel uncomfortable, okay?

220
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,141
Okay.

221
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,443
Aunt Yinghong, how's Sixth Senior?

222
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,488
The poison is too strong.

223
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,421
Although the poison has been neutralized,

224
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:13,371
his body can't force out the remaining poison.

225
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,239
Sect Leader. Aunt Yinghong.

226
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,878
Rumor has it that the Freezing Pond in Fuyu Island can help people to recover.

227
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:24,007
Why don't we try it?

228
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:26,425
The pond may be able to force the poison out of Minyan's body.

229
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:28,652
We can try that.

230
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:31,959
Okay.

231
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:35,790
I'll ask Master Dong Fang right now.

232
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,135
It's freezing!

233
00:17:41,823 --> 00:17:44,568
The Freezing Pond is cold indeed.

234
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:48,953
The poison will disappear after a few days.

235
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:52,363
But this place is extremely cold as well.

236
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:57,319
During this period, we need someone to keep an eye on him.

237
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,639
I'll stay here and take care of Sixth Senior.

238
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,431
I'm not afraid of the cold. I'll be fine.

239
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,459
<i>Sifeng!</i>

240
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,040
Sifeng.

241
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,358
I came to visit because I heard that you tried the poisonous concoction.

242
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,679
How are you feeling?

243
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,439
I've adjusted my internal breathing. I'm fine now.

244
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,759
That's good.

245
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,868
If our master hears about this, he'll throw a fit again.

246
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,248
I've experienced the harshest punishment in Lize Palace.

247
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,719
There is nothing to fear.

248
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,835
You're pretty optimistic.

249
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,136
By the way, how is Yanran doing?

250
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:46,656
I've given her some of my powers.

251
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:48,780
She'll be fine.

252
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,490
I haven't left my room today.

253
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:52,206
I wonder how Minyan is dong?

254
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:54,799
The poison was neutralized, but there are residues left.

255
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,960
Elder Chu of the Shaoyang Sect sent him to the Freezing Pond in order to force out the poison.

256
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,169
I met Senior Hao Chen on my way here.

257
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,855
He told me that Xuanji has skipped all her meals

258
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,365
in order to accompany Minyan.

259
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:10,592
She thinks that it's fine since she has no feelings.

260
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:13,260
That place is extremely cold. Her body won't be able to take it.

261
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,802
- I'll take a look. <br> - Sifeng!

262
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,484
Xuanji, you've been here for the whole day.

263
00:19:25,485 --> 00:19:27,519
Why don't you go back and rest?

264
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,540
I'm not tired.

265
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,540
First Senior, I think you should leave.

266
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,837
I don't think your body can take it.

267
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,080
I've been outside for a long time.

268
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,759
You mustn't stay here anymore. Go now.

269
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,379
I don't feel cold at all.

270
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:57,597
Just leave now.

271
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,096
<i>By then, I'll tell Master about my proposal.</i>

272
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:04,568
<i>- And you can show him this love lot. <br> - Proposal?</i>

273
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:07,419
<i>It's just a misunderstanding. I may not be married to you in the future.</i>

274
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:09,599
<i>You can give your love lot to anyone else on the streets.</i>

275
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,363
<i>You can give it to anyone you like. Except for me.</i>

276
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,870
- Sixth Senior! <br> - Minyan!

277
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,159
Minyan!

278
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,678
- Sixth Senior! <br> - Minyan!

279
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,039
Sixth Senior!

280
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,190
Minyan, are you okay?

281
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,070
Sixth Senior!

282
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,200
Xuanji, keep an eye on him.

283
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,737
I'll find Aunt Yinghong.

284
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:46,514
Hurry!

285
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,479
<i>Little Six! LIttle Six! Little Six!</i>

286
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,144
Sixth Senior!

287
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,960
- Linglong! <br> - Sixth Senior!

288
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,540
Sixth Senior, are you okay?

289
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,199
Linglong!

290
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,371
Linglong, you can reject my love,

291
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:14,342
but no one will take you away from me!

292
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,040
Little Six!

293
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,274
I'm Linglong. I'm here. I'm here.

294
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,679
Little Six!

295
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,249
I'm here.

296
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,158
You... You should get better,

297
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:37,390
so that my father will let us get married.

298
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:47,601
Little Six, do you feel better?

299
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,595
Please stay strong.

300
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,838
<i>Yu Sifeng, you don't know when to back down.</i>

301
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,639
<i>You wanted to get close to Xuanji.</i>

302
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,499
<i>Don't blame me for this.</i>

303
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,364
Sixth Senior.

304
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,869
<i>Didn't you say the mask will become a smiling mask?</i>

305
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,839
<i>Why is it crying?</i>

306
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,690
<i>Sifeng, what color is this?</i>

307
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,399
<i>The hydrangea is blue.</i>

308
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,286
<i>My favorite color will be blue then.</i>

309
00:23:19,287 --> 00:23:21,370
<i>This Heart Lantern is truthful.</i>

310
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:26,250
<i>Xuanji, it means that there's someone you love.</i>

311
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,038
<i>Little Six,</i>

312
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:39,670
<i>please get better so that my father will let us get married.</i>

313
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,174
<i>From now on, the curse will trigger whenever your feelings are hurt.</i>

314
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:20,518
<i>Even death isn't as painful as the curse.</i>

315
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:24,976
<i>So, this is how it feels.</i>

316
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,499
<i>This is great!</i>

317
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,042
<i>I can always stay together with Sifeng!</i>

318
00:24:56,043 --> 00:24:58,273
<i>Sifeng, you're the best!</i>

319
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,199
<i>- Look! <br> - Stop fooling around.</i>

320
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,615
<i>Are you blushing?</i>

321
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:03,512
<i>- You're blushing. <br> - I'm not.</i>

322
00:25:03,513 --> 00:25:05,477
<i>I'm not blushing.</i>

323
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,510
Sifeng!

324
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,283
The Lover's Curse!

325
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:24,929
The Lover's Curse is acting up!

326
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:26,831
Sifeng, are you okay?

327
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:31,842
<i>You should eat more if it's good.</i>

328
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:40,729
Sifeng!

329
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,290
<i>I'll change your dressing for you.</i>

330
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:54,687
<i>That's why you need to dress your wound.</i>

331
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,138
<i>It won't hurt after that.</i>

332
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,603
<i>We can stay together forever.</i>

333
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,050
<i>Together forever with you?</i>

334
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,000
Sifeng!

335
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,124
Sifeng!

336
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,546
Sifeng, are you okay?

337
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:34,039
What should we do?

338
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,000
Those who were struck by the Lover's Curse

339
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,170
end their lives because it is too painful.

340
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,110
<i>Sifeng!</i>

341
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,774
<i>Xuanji, don't go!</i>

342
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,383
Sifeng!

343
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,679
Why are you so silly?

344
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,925
You did so much for her!

345
00:27:09,925 --> 00:27:12,159
But she doesn't care at all!

346
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,884
Stop it.

347
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:15,719
Stop it now.

348
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,334
Did I say anything wrong?

349
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,225
You sacrificed your life because of her!

350
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,919
It's not Xuanji's fault.

351
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,559
Sifeng, I beg you!

352
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,429
Let's return and plead with the master.

353
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,119
You're his favorite disciple. He'll surely help you out.

354
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,042
Okay? Sifeng!

355
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:37,110
Once the Lover's Curse triggers, there's no cure.

356
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:40,026
There's no cure?

357
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,374
The master was right.

358
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,285
She's a calamity to your life.

359
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,030
It's all because of Chu Xuanji.

360
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,811
All because of her.

361
00:27:55,811 --> 00:27:58,476
She's the reason you're in pain!

362
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,919
I'm going to kill her. I'm going to kill her!

363
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,239
How is it? Is Sixth Senior getting better?

364
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,756
The poison has been forced out.

365
00:28:22,756 --> 00:28:25,190
His pulse is stable. I think he should be fine.

366
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,528
That's good.

367
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,250
Minyan hasn't eaten for a few days.

368
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,059
Get him some food from the kitchen.

369
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,843
Okay, I'll get some soup.

370
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,372
Sifeng?

371
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,002
Sifeng!

372
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,209
Sifeng! Sifeng!

373
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,563
Sifeng!

374
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,162
Sifeng!

375
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,927
Sifeng!

376
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,606
Sifeng!

377
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,063
Sifeng!

378
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,280
Sifeng, are you still unwell because of the poison?

379
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,230
I'm fine.

380
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,380
Sifeng,

381
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,540
<i>I haven't thanked you yet</i>

382
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:41,130
<i>for saving Linglong and Sixth Senior.</i>

383
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,320
<i>Sifeng, thank you.</i>

384
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,450
By the way,

385
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,790
<i>Aunt Ying Hong wanted me to bring some soup for Sixth Senior.</i>

386
00:29:48,793 --> 00:29:51,684
<i>I'll give you some later.</i>

387
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,100
No need for that.

388
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,036
I need to rest.

389
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,013
<i>That's fine. Sifeng, you can rest.</i>

390
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:05,064
<i>I'll visit you tomorrow.</i>

391
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,865
Master, why did you stop me?

392
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,537
Little Silver Flower,

393
00:30:30,824 --> 00:30:34,217
do you remember what I'd told you?

394
00:30:34,217 --> 00:30:36,387
If you hurt Xuanji again,

395
00:30:36,387 --> 00:30:38,999
I'll sever our ties.

396
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,660
I...

397
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,839
I remember that.

398
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,709
So, why did you

399
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,270
still try to harm her today?

400
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,461
- Do you admit your mistake? <br> - I didn't do anything wrong!

401
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:54,112
Chu Xuanji was the one who put you in this situation!

402
00:30:57,945 --> 00:31:01,495
Master! Master!

403
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,059
She didn't ask for me to like her.

404
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:15,375
If you want to kill someone because

405
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,075
she didn't give you the answer you wanted,

406
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,733
no one would love you.

407
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:28,199
You don't have the right to love as well.

408
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:30,882
I'm not a person like that.

409
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:33,878
And I don't allow my spirit beast

410
00:31:33,878 --> 00:31:36,455
to do that as well.

411
00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:38,725
But I don't understand.

412
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:43,449
If she doesn't die, you'll die because of her sooner or later!

413
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:47,318
So,

414
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,570
you're saying that you must kill her?

415
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,819
Yes!

416
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:57,260
I'm going to kill her!

417
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,997
Fine.

418
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,990
You're not fit to be my spirit beast anymore.

419
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,591
Today,

420
00:32:07,782 --> 00:32:10,521
I'll sever one of my arms

421
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:13,662
and terminate my blood contract with you.

422
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:16,152
Master!

423
00:32:16,152 --> 00:32:17,910
You were struck by the curse because of her.

424
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,250
Now, you want to disown me as well?

425
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,190
I'm not doing this because of her.

426
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,810
I'm doing this for myself.

427
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,300
Master, please don't hurt yourself!

428
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,123
If something happens to you, I can only pay for that with my death!

429
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,720
After the blood contract is terminated, you and I are unrelated anymore.

430
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,490
No!

431
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,832
I don't want you to terminate our contract!

432
00:32:49,832 --> 00:32:54,110
I know my fault now! I really do!

433
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,030
Master, I promise I won't try to hurt Chu Xuanji anymore!

434
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,796
Master, please don't hurt yourself or abandon me!

435
00:33:00,797 --> 00:33:04,759
I want to stay beside you forever!

436
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,250
I want to be your guardian!

437
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,102
Fine.

438
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:13,832
Remember your promise.

439
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,537
Leave now.

440
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:20,097
I want to be alone for now.

441
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,558
<i>Whenever the Loveless Curse triggers,</i>

442
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:04,231
<i>it will consume one Green Feather mark.</i>

443
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:06,964
<i>When all the three Green Feather marks disappear,</i>

444
00:35:06,965 --> 00:35:09,719
<i>you'll bleed to death.</i>

445
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,279
<i>Master, when the three Green Feather marks disappear</i>

446
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,364
<i>and a Red Feather mark forms on your chest,</i>

447
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:17,535
<i>it'll be too late by then.</i>

448
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,552
<i>Sifeng.</i>

449
00:35:26,553 --> 00:35:28,603
<i>Sifeng, are you awake?</i>

450
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,490
<i>Sifeng, are you awake?</i>

451
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,439
What's the matter?

452
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,647
Sifeng, you didn't look well yesterday.

453
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:44,164
I'm a bit worried.

454
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:46,920
I brought you some medicine.

455
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,970
I'm fine now. You can keep the medicine.

456
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:53,010
Sifeng, just let me in.

457
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:56,888
Let's just speak in this way.

458
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,049
Sifeng, have you been unhappy these few days?

459
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:05,660
I feel like you're acting weird.

460
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,772
When did you learn how to observe people's expressions?

461
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,887
I don't know how to do that.

462
00:36:12,888 --> 00:36:14,830
I don't know about others,

463
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,530
but I know when you're unhappy.

464
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,606
Sifeng.

465
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,049
Sifeng.

466
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,033
You're overthinking.

467
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:34,044
I'm not unhappy.

468
00:36:34,044 --> 00:36:36,528
But I have something to tell you.

469
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:40,228
Now that Linglong and Minyan are safe,

470
00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:42,718
it's time for me to return to Lize Palace.

471
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,602
Sifeng, are you going to leave?

472
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:52,902
Of course.

473
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:55,000
That's where I belong.

474
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,350
But you'll be punished if you return.

475
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,600
You don't need to worry about that.

476
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,679
How could I not worry?

477
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,768
And you said that we'd be together forever.

478
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,689
Why are you leaving now?

479
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,780
I...

480
00:37:14,054 --> 00:37:16,524
Sifeng, I don't want you to go.

481
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,057
Don't try to stop me or persuade me.

482
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:28,923
I've decided.

483
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,900
There's no reason for me to stay.

484
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:39,439
Sifeng, are you leaving because you're unhappy that I avoided you?

485
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,370
I've thought about it. Sifeng, I can give you anything you want.

486
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:45,161
I can give you my true heart as well.

487
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,548
If you don't believe me...

488
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,279
Chu Xuanji, who do you think I am?

489
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,640
I... I just want to make you happy.

490
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,710
I'm willing to do anything.

491
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,050
So, Sifeng, please don't leave. Okay?

492
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,530
You're willing to do anything?

493
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,490
Sifeng, what are you doing?

494
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,999
Are you willing to do this as well?

495
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,799
You said you wanted to marry me without any careful considerations.

496
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,420
Do you know what I'm going to do next?

497
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,379
Sifeng, you didn't mention that you were going to do this.

498
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,340
Sifeng,

499
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,730
should I kiss you during moments like these?

500
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,344
Chu Xuanji, that's enough!

501
00:39:35,344 --> 00:39:38,034
You're still distracted in this situation.

502
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,883
Sifeng! I...

503
00:39:40,883 --> 00:39:42,719
Xuanji, you're here as well?

504
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,079
I'm here to change the flowers in Sifeng's room.

505
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,839
These Snow Flowers were freshly picked.

506
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,919
They look the best when you put them in a room.

507
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,634
Thank you.

508
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:51,919
Why are you thanking me?

509
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,319
Most of my fellow female disciples

510
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,190
are jealous that I get to change flowers for Yu Sifeng from Lize Palace.

511
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,360
Chu Xuanji, return now.

512
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:08,085
- Sifeng... <br> - Return now.

513
00:40:08,085 --> 00:40:09,494
No, she...

514
00:40:09,495 --> 00:40:12,685
I...

515
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,959
Linglong, do you know? Sifeng is too much!

516
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,998
He chased me out and kept Yuning in his room.

517
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:40,966
You know, in my heart, I feel...

518
00:40:40,966 --> 00:40:43,766
I feel a hint of anger.

519
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:45,139
Yes. I feel angry.

520
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:48,090
It's the feeling that you've described before.

521
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,599
But why am I angry?

522
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,942
Linglong, please wake up.

523
00:40:52,943 --> 00:40:54,599
Please tell me the reason why.

524
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,850
What should I do in order to make Sifeng stay?

525
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,275
Linglong.

526
00:41:04,303 --> 00:41:07,177
Linglong? Linglong?

527
00:41:07,177 --> 00:41:08,551
Linglong, you're awake?

528
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,560
Linglong!

529
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,155
Linglong!

530
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,721
Linglong, can you hear me?

531
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,103
Linglong!

532
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:19,699
Linglong, say something! You're scaring me!

533
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:21,526
Linglong!

534
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,159
Sifeng, you're leaving? Why don't you stay here for a couple more days?

535
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,119
- Sifeng! <br> - Xuanji?

536
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,839
- Sifeng! <br> - What's wrong?

537
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,439
Sifeng!

538
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,374
I think something's wrong with Linglong.

539
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,201
Her primordial spirit has been removed.

540
00:41:49,202 --> 00:41:51,881
Only her soul is left.

541
00:41:51,882 --> 00:41:54,089
That's why she's in that state.

542
00:41:56,048 --> 00:41:58,198
Is she in any danger?

543
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,670
Her soul is still intact. She's safe for now.

544
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,456
But if her primordial spirit

545
00:42:04,457 --> 00:42:06,900
doesn't return to her body within a month,

546
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,378
Linglong will not be able to take it.

547
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,722
Wu Tong.

548
00:42:14,723 --> 00:42:16,359
I'm sure Wu Tong is behind this.

549
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,973
Where are you going?

550
00:42:17,974 --> 00:42:20,890
I'll find Wu Tong and retrieve Linglong's primordial spirit.

551
00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:24,019
- Second Senior is with him as well! <br> - Xuanji, don't be reckless.

552
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:26,755
You don't even know where Wu Tong is. How are you going to find him?

553
00:42:26,756 --> 00:42:28,899
I'll search in Mount Gao and Xuanyuan Sect.

554
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:31,239
I'll search for places with demons around.

555
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,811
As long as I can find one demon, I'm sure I'll be able to find Wu Tong.

556
00:42:33,811 --> 00:42:36,321
Tianxu Hall wants us to panic and act recklessly.

557
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,936
You mustn't act recklessly now.

558
00:42:37,936 --> 00:42:41,851
We should formulate a complete plan before we save Linglong.

559
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,467
A complete plan?

560
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:46,542
You said so yourselves. Tianxu Hall is plotting against us!

561
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:48,811
How can we formulate a complete plan against them?

562
00:42:48,811 --> 00:42:52,002
Xuanji, you're not allowed to go!

563
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:57,710
Wu Tong didn't kill Linglong.

564
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,050
He removed her primordial spirit.

565
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:02,781
That means he has ulterior motives.

566
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:07,187
No one is to leave the island before we figure out what's going on.

567
00:43:07,187 --> 00:43:11,200
If you leave Fuyu Island,

568
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,397
- I will sever my ties with you! <br> - Father!

569
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,896
Why is Linglong clenching her fist?

570
00:43:24,897 --> 00:43:27,122
She's been clenching her fist since she came back.

571
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,682
<i>[Spirit key in exchange for the primordial spirit.]</i>

572
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,483
"Spirit key in exchange for the primordial spirit."

573
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,107
They want the spirit key.

574
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:51,947
Despicable!

575
00:43:51,947 --> 00:43:54,257
What a ruthless act!

576
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,891
He's holding my daughter as his hostage.

577
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:00,636
If I don't give him the spirit key,

578
00:44:01,178 --> 00:44:04,608
Linglong will have no hope.

579
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,990
But if I do give him the spirit key,

580
00:44:09,706 --> 00:44:13,096
I'll let down the world.

581
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,415
I know what you're thinking,

582
00:44:37,415 --> 00:44:39,865
but forcing your way through isn't a good idea.

583
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,990
It's fine if they want something else,

584
00:44:44,655 --> 00:44:46,799
but they want the spirit key.

585
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,999
Even if Father agrees, the other sect leaders won't agree to it.

586
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,219
What should we do if we can't solve this dilemma?

587
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:57,354
There's no time left for Linglong. She only has one month.

588
00:44:57,355 --> 00:45:00,032
Now that the Five Great Sects are on Fuyu Island,

589
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:01,792
they will definitely think of something.

590
00:45:01,793 --> 00:45:05,003
Even if the other sect leaders disagree, you still have your father,

591
00:45:05,004 --> 00:45:09,980
your fellow disciples in Shaoyang Sect, Minyan, and me.

592
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,199
Don't worry.

593
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,840
You're not alone.

594
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:14,622
Everyone will try to help.

595
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,510
Sifeng, you said I still have you?

596
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,250
Does that mean you're staying?

597
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:24,213
Linglong is in a terrible situation now.

598
00:45:24,214 --> 00:45:26,344
How could I just leave?

599
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,884
Sifeng, you're the best.

600
00:45:28,885 --> 00:45:31,735
I feel relieved whenever you're with me.

601
