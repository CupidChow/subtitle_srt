Xuanji!

19
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:47,740
Xuanji, you put your trust in the wrong person.

20
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,122
But now that you've realized it, it's still not too late.

00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,169
- Master, this is bad! <br> - What happened?

22
00:01:57,169 --> 00:01:59,385
Wu Tong attacked us with the demons of Tianxu Hall.

00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,819
Linglong and Minyan have been surrounded.

37
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,681
It's you?

38
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,839
What happened to Xuanji?

39
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,154
Her God of War's power has awakened.

40
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,319
Xuanji.

41
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,820
At this time?

42
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,858
Those useless demons from Lize Palace can't even defeat you?

43
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:13,547
Wu Tong,

44
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:18,964
today I'm going to turn you into dust!

45
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,179
I already knew that you were the God of War from the heavens.

46
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:37,859
I put in so much effort to find the scales of Candle Dragon from Mount Buzhou.

47
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:40,219
The scales of Candle Dragon can withstand holy power.

48
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:41,898
It's especially used against it.

49
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:44,881
Now, I've made them into a shield.

50
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:47,763
I want to see how powerful you are.

51
00:04:48,378 --> 00:04:50,179
Scales of Candle Dragon?

52
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:53,442
I never thought that the things I used before

53
00:04:53,442 --> 00:04:56,170
will be used against me now.

54
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:00,139
Not only the things you've used before are used to fight you,

55
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,250
even your lover, Yu Sifeng, is against you.

56
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,610
Fine.

57
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,909
Today, I'll kill every demon that is here right now.

58
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,930
Ninth Heaven Fire!

59
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,681
Get into your formation.

60
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,799
There's a cave there. Let's get in!

61
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,999
- Follow me! <br> - Take shelter!

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,060
- Xuanji. <br> - Master.

63
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,391
- Let's go. <br> - Let's go.

64
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,721
Let's go now.

65
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:51,253
Retreat!

66
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,400
Hurry up.

67
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,186
Linglong.

68
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:11,579
Xuanji is too powerful. She's a monster!

69
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,641
What nonsense are you talking about? Xuanji is protecting us.

70
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,817
She is the God of War who once killed demons and monsters.

71
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:19,630
Haven't you heard of that?

72
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,184
Xuanji, stop now!

73
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:27,953
- Hao Chen! <br> - Hao Chen!

74
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,892
Xuanji!

75
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:40,705
Enough, Xuanji! The demons have retreated.

76
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:42,530
Stop hurting others.

77
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,274
Xuanji.

78
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:56,861
Xuanji!

79
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,059
Xuanji! What's wrong with her?

80
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:03,531
Sect Leader, I think she's fine. But Ninth Heaven Fire is very powerful.

81
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:06,009
We have to send her back and get rid of this pure fire.

82
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,299
All right. Hurry up.

83
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:08,710
Hurry up.

84
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:16,290
Don't worry. Xuanji will be fine.

85
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:22,510
Linglong, what's wrong?

86
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:24,926
I'm fine.

87

Sifeng.

95
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:04,073
Sifeng.

96

Sifeng.

97
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,641
Sifeng.

98
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,808
Sifeng, didn't you say that you'd take care of yourself

99
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:16,500
so that you wouldn't get hurt?

100
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,060
Sifeng.

101
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:25,099
You said that you'd be with me and never leave me.

102
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,485
Sifeng. Sifeng!

103
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,016
Xuanji, you had a bad dream.

104
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:46,150
I...

105
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:49,729
I dreamed about Sifeng.

106
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:58,568
I already told you that demons are cunning.

107
00:08:58,568 --> 00:09:00,173
You can't trust them.

108
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,594
In order to revive the Devil Star and disrupt the three realms,

109
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,592
nothing is too extreme for them.

110
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:09,739
Pretending to be kind and acting selflessly

111
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:12,819
are just tricks they use to appeal to you.

112
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,092
It's fake.

113
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,050
Everything is just a trick?

114
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,397
Of course.

115
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,587
Yu Sifeng has never treated you sincerely.

116
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:30,139
He approached you since the beginning

117
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,800
to get close to the forbidden ground

118
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,308
to find out what is sealed inside it.

119
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,418
He approached you because you are the daughter of Shaoyang Sect.

120
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:40,939
He approached you because you are innocent, kind and

121
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:43,579
put up no defense against others.

122
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,858
When he found out that you can wield the Dingkun Sword,

123
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:48,478
he guessed that you were the God of War.

124
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:52,387
God of War is the demon clan's biggest enemy.

125
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:56,600
So, he advanced on you gradually to get close to you and soften you.

126
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,621
Then he made you fall in love with him so that you couldn't leave him.

127
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:03,410
Then he could easily affect your feelings

128
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,259
so that you'd lose the will to protect the three realms

129
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:09,019
or even work for the demon clan.

130
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,402
Everything he did

131
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,128
was to make you waver and use you.

132
00:10:23,531 --> 00:10:26,421
I didn't want you to go to the real world for your trial back then

133
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,532
because you were kind and can't distinguish between good and evil.

134
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,530
I never thought that you'd still fall into the trap of the demon clan.

135
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:40,973
Now, you've finally realized the truth.

136
00:10:41,658 --> 00:10:45,430
Just think of it as a test for you in this life.

137
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,019
I'll stay by your side

138
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:52,915
and help you pass this trial in order for you to become a deity.

139
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:02,280
A deity?

140
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:04,279
You are the God of War.

141
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,900
You belong to the heavens.

142
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,437
Of course, you have to go back in the end.

143
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:18,023
Forget it.

144
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:19,870
Have a good rest.

145
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,972
I'll go out first.

156

Was Sifeng sincere towards me?

161

Xuanji,

162
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:46,473
demons are never sincere.

163
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:49,615
People from Lize Palace are always wearing masks.

164
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:52,518
Everything we saw was fake.

165
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:56,800
You still remember what happened to Uncle Dongfang, right?

166
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,019
Sixth Senior.

167
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:08,632
Sifeng was not sincere towards me?

168
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,467
Is everything fake?

169
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,209
Sifeng is a demon

170
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,142
and he indeed lied to us.

171
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,941
But he risked his life so many times for us.

172
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:22,647
And he even gave up his life to save you.

173
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:26,609
So I think that Sifeng must be sincere towards you.

174
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:29,105
Are you trying to get Xuanji killed?

175
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:30,791
Don't listen to him, Xuanji.

176
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:34,060
Yu Sifeng is a Twelve Feathers Rose Gold Bird and the first disciple of Lize Palace.

177
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,930
He must have known about Lize Palace's plan to attack Dianjing Valley.

178
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,088
If he was sincere towards you,

179
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:45,211
he would have kept quiet and just watched while our sects bled to death.

180
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:47,481
Things have already turned out to be like this.

181
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,239
Xuanji,

182
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:54,091
stop lying to yourself.

183
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:59,451
I have to find Sifeng and ask him in person.

184
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:01,219
You want to be tricked by him again?

185
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:04,554
I don't want to be tricked, but I have to get to the bottom of this.

186
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:08,427
Whether he was sincere or not, I have to hear it from him.

187
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:11,139
But everyone saw it very clearly during yesterday's battle.

188
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,801
Lize Palace is an accomplice of Tianxu Hall.

189
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:17,553
Everyone who is in contact with Tianxu Hall will become evil.

190
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:21,281
Even if Yu Sifeng was not evil in the past, he's a demon now.

191
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:23,640
He is now Tianxu Hall's accomplice.

192
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,485
I won't let you be in contact with anyone from Tianxu Hall.

193
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:29,979
Linglong, I know that you are worried about me.

194
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:32,179
Sifeng is someone I care for.

195
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,819
I am sincere towards him.

196
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:36,217
I don't believe that he is a part of Tianxu Hall.

197
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:38,969
Linglong, Xuanji's God of War power has awakened.

198
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:40,850
Tianxu Hall won't be able to hurt her.

199
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,754
Maybe it's better if she can talk to Sifeng in person.

200
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:48,259
Tianxu Hall can't hurt her but Yu Sifeng can.

201
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,250
What if Tianxu Hall made use of Yu Sifeng?

202
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,059
Then, Xuanji will be trapped.

203
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,619
Have you ever considered Xuanji's safety by suggesting this?

204
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:57,979
Those people worked for Tianxu Hall because Tianxu Hall has something on them.

205
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:01,579
Sifeng has always been smart. He won't become someone else's puppet so easily.

206
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:03,873
May I beg for your audience?

207
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,809
Greetings, God of War.

208
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,430
<i>Greetings, God of War!</i>

209
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,077
We've committed a grave crime

210
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:16,819
by not realizing sooner that you were here, God of War.

211
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:19,623
Our valley master has ordered me to invite you and

212
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:23,506
Lord Teng She to stay in the main hall as a form of apology.

213
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,561
Don't. Just call me Xuanji, Elder Kou.

214
00:15:26,561 --> 00:15:29,425
I... I haven't recovered yet.

215
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:33,496
Please tell Valley Master that I'll visit him another time.

216
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:38,672
But Lord Teng She said that you've already fully recovered.

217
00:15:40,843 --> 00:15:44,019
Have you recovered already? Have you done the things I asked you to?

218
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:48,318
This minor injury is nothing to me.

219
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:50,522
You, too. You've recovered your power.

220
00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:52,948
Now, you just need to use your power to heal.

221
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,761
They gave me a peach.

222
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:02,987
I can't just reject their generosity, right?

223
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:05,341
- Do you want it? <br> - You...

224
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:09,593
God of War, every sect leader is waiting for your arrival.

225
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:13,635
Sect Leader Chu has been waiting a long time for you, too.

226
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,433
Okay, I'll go with you.

227
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:22,079
God of War, after you.

228
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:30,485
Stop right there.

229
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:34,966
The main hall is a place of discussion. Only people from a sect can enter.

230
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:37,640
You have been expelled from Shaoyang. Don't make things hard for us.

231
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,790
- But... <br> - God of War, after you.

232
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,947
After you.

233
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:43,119
Xuanji, we'll wait for you in your room.

234
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,285
Go.

235
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:55,641
What is the meaning of this?

236
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:58,418
This is the God of War's residence.

237
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,699
You can't stay here. You better wait for her in the courtyard.

238
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:05,088
I am Xuanji's senior. She is Xuanji's sister. We are not outsiders.

239
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:06,592
You've been expelled by Shaoyang.

240
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,259
So, you are no longer her senior.

241
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:10,849
As for her sister,

242
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,913
you'll just make Shaoyang look bad by staying in Shaoyang.

243
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:15,699
You better wait in the courtyard.

244
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,063
This young lady of Shaoyang had a colorful past with that Wu Tong.

245
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:22,428
No wonder she can be rescued from Tianxu Hall.

246
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:24,579
She is not rescued. She was just saving herself.

247
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,929
What did you say?

248
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:28,220
Don't be so cynical.

249
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,187
Make yourself clear.

250
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:32,601
Forget it. Let's go.

251
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:37,376
Apologize. Or else, don't blame me for what I'll do.

252
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:39,768
Hero Zhong, tell us then.

253
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,885
What should I apologize for?

254
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:45,310
Tell us about it so that we know what to apologize for.

255
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:50,153
Linglong.

256
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,927
<i>[SHENJI PAVILION]</i>

257
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,960
Father.

258
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,510
Father, are you okay?

259
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,565
I'm fine.

260
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:48,262
Go and listen to the valley master.

261
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:55,186
During yesterday's battle, many of us were either injured or killed,

262
00:18:55,186 --> 00:18:57,368
and we lost our last spirit key.

263
00:18:57,368 --> 00:19:02,474
If it wasn't for you, Dianjing Valley would've been annihilated by now.

264
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,899
I never thought that Sect Leader Chu's daughter would have such power.

265
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:10,216
I never thought that there would be a deity among us.

266
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:11,873
I've been disrespectful to you.

267
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:13,970
- I've been disrespectful to you. <br> - I...

268
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,494
I just found out about it as well yesterday.

269
00:19:17,494 --> 00:19:21,983
My daughter was just a normal girl.

270
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,299
I don't know how she became like this.

271
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:31,244
This might be something that we mortals can never understand.

272
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:35,121
No matter what, the appearance of the God of War

273
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:37,818
must be a blessing from the heavens.

274
00:19:37,818 --> 00:19:39,659
We invited you here today because:

275
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:42,105
First, we want to thank you for what you did yesterday.

276
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:43,747
Second...

277
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:48,497
Second, I have a request for you.

278
00:19:48,497 --> 00:19:52,431
If you need me to do anything, just tell me about it.

279
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,086
- Valley Master Rong. <br> - Please lead us

280
00:19:56,086 --> 00:20:00,261
to destroy those demons and protect the human realm.

281
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:01,810
This...

282
00:20:02,652 --> 00:20:05,810
<i>Please lead us</i>

283
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,430
<i>to destroy those demons and protect the human realm!</i>

284
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:18,281
Valley Master Rong. Uncle Dongfang.

285
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:20,210
This is too sudden.

286
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,710
This is too great of a responsibility

287
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:25,105
for me to bear.

288
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:27,279
Please find another one to do so.

289
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:33,636
Sect Leader Chu, if the God of War doesn't agree, we won't get up today.

290
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,699
Okay.

291
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:42,119
Xuanji, I'll kneel down and beg you, too.

292
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:45,139
What are you doing, Father?

293
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:46,979
Father, are you okay?

294
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,539
Why are you like this?

295
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,699
What's wrong, Father?

296
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:53,218
Why are you like this?

297
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,011
- Father. <br> - He was hurt by Yu Sifeng's master.

298
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:59,042
He should be resting in bed but he's forcing himself right now.

299
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,970
Father.

300
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,406
Could it be that there's a Gu bug inside his body?

301
00:21:04,406 --> 00:21:07,803
It must be because of that Rose Gold Bird. What should we do now?

302
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:08,859
No, Father.

303
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:10,690
Teng She! Teng She!

304
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,419
Come and take a look at him!

305
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,963
Father!

306
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,349
Hurry up!

307
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,912
Father.

308
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,419
Isn't this the Intracavitary Sparrow? It's very common.

309
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:30,738
It feeds on the organs of the host.

310
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:34,019
It'll bring the host great pain until death is a much better option.

311
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:35,539
Can he be treated?

312
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:36,899
You were once...

313
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:40,065
Since you can recognize it, it means that you know how to treat it.

314
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,630
- You are really... <br> - Hurry up!

315
00:21:49,826 --> 00:21:51,159
Yes.

316
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,809
He can be treated.

317
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:56,480
No need to treat him. Just take that sparrow out.

318
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,557
Father, get up first.

319
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,441
Get up first.

320
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:26,419
Father.

321
00:22:27,234 --> 00:22:31,139
Xuanji, take a good look.

322
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:34,190
This is how vicious and cruel the demon clan is.

323
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,419
This is their nature.

324
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,040
If we don't eradicate them, how can we bring peace to the three realms?

325
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,538
Xuanji.

326
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,560
- Xuanji. <br> - Father.

327
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,721
We are not trying to force you to be our chief.

328
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:52,770
But you are our only choice.

329
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,241
The demons took advantage of our feelings

330
00:22:56,241 --> 00:23:00,193
and planted spies to get the upper hand.

331
00:23:00,193 --> 00:23:03,681
We have all suffered a serious loss.

332
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:07,782
Now, only three sects are left out of the five sects.

333
00:23:07,782 --> 00:23:12,504
The loss of our sect is just a surface wound.

334
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:15,577
If this continues, I'm afraid that

335
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:20,615
we'll be divided and we can't stand together anymore.

336
00:23:21,427 --> 00:23:23,033
Xuanji,

337
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:25,265
you are the reincarnation of the God of War.

338
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:27,580
Within us three sects now,

339
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:33,040
you are the only one who can lead us.

340
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,045
- I... <br> - Do you understand our pains?

341
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:41,097
My child, just say yes.

342
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,550
Father.

343
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:55,255
Okay.

344
00:23:55,255 --> 00:23:58,347
I agree to be the chief.

345
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:02,779
Great.

346
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,202
Good.

347
00:24:04,202 --> 00:24:06,321
Good girl.

348
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,282
Good.

349
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:14,497
From today onward, we'll have a chief.

350
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:16,742
Get me the Spirit Scroll.

351
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,139
Everybody.

352
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:33,819
This Spirit Scroll has all the names of the disciples

353
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:36,186
who died in the hands of the demons.

354
00:24:36,186 --> 00:24:38,544
There's a total of 372 people.

355
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:41,001
Their bones have gone cold now.

356
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:43,977
But those demons are still roaming the earth.

357
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,497
Please lead us to eradicate Tianxu Hall,

358
00:24:48,497 --> 00:24:51,179
annihilate Lize Palace and avenge them.

359
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:54,459
<i>Eradicate Tianxu Hall! Annihilate Lize Palace!</i>

360
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:59,778
<i>Avenge them!</i>

361
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,299
Annihilate Lize Palace?

362
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,379
Yes.

363
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:12,731
Please give your order.

364
00:25:12,731 --> 00:25:14,330
I...

365
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:23,779
Do you still have the illusion that Lize Palace is good?

366
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:25,459
Are you not willing to seek revenge for us?

367
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:27,010
I...

368
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:34,369
Xuanji has another plan. Don't misunderstand.

369
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:37,089
Tianxu Hall and Lize Palace are accomplices.

370
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:39,266
They have all four spirit keys now.

371
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:42,978
Then their next step must be reviving the Devil Star.

372
00:25:42,978 --> 00:25:45,695
If we only think about revenge right now,

373
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:48,659
it'll just drag us down.

374
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,554
And we'll give them an opportunity to do so.

375
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:53,165
What do you mean then, Elder Hao Chen?

376
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:59,396
Our first priority is to foil those demons' plan.

377
00:25:59,396 --> 00:26:03,299
If they want to revive the Devil Star, their last barrier

378
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,538
is the forbidden ground of Shaoyang.

379
00:26:05,538 --> 00:26:09,650
So, I suggest for the Shaoyang Sect to go back and protect the forbidden ground.

380
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,452
The rest should gather your people and meet us at Shaoyang.

381
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:14,832
By doing so, we can protect the forbidden ground together

382
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:19,363
and discuss our plan to avenge our people.

383
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:25,570
I was thinking of the same thing, too.

384
00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:29,442
Okay.

385
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:32,057
We'll let them live for a few more days then.

386
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:36,315
We'll discuss it when we are all gathered at Mount Shaoyang.

387
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:39,433
But we know that

388
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:43,539
you are very close with the Twelve Feathers Rose Gold Bird.

389
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:46,866
I hope that the Shaoyang Sect can give us a promise

390
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:50,185
to stay away from that demon from now on.

391
00:26:50,185 --> 00:26:52,556
Give us peace of mind.

392
00:26:55,267 --> 00:26:56,694
Valley Master Rong,

393
00:26:56,694 --> 00:27:00,280
Xuanji has already agreed to be our chief. Right?

394
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,591
In the past, Xuanji was kept in the dark, too.

395
00:27:02,591 --> 00:27:04,785
Now that she knows about Yu Sifeng's identity,

396
00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:08,654
I believe that the next time she meets Yu Sifeng,

397
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:13,254
she'll burn him to ashes to avenge the people who we've lost.

398
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,619
<i>[LIZE PALACE]</i>

399
00:28:15,658 --> 00:28:18,748
Sifeng, are you feeling better now?

400
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:26,169
This is the cure for the Lover's Curse. Eat it.

401
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:28,577
Don't make me worry about you again.

402
00:28:28,577 --> 00:28:30,370
Master,

403
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,041
didn't you say that there was no cure for the Lover's Curse?

404
00:28:34,238 --> 00:28:37,990
There's no such thing as a curse without a cure.

405
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,326
It's just that you have to pay for it with another thing.

406
00:28:41,326 --> 00:28:45,059
Lover's Curse is activated based on your feelings.

407
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:48,930
This cure is for you to clear your mind.

408
00:28:50,483 --> 00:28:54,273
After you eat it, you'll forget about everything.

409
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:56,997
You'll forget about that person forever

410
00:28:56,997 --> 00:29:01,562
and your Lover's Curse will be broken.

411
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:03,433
You can't get this in the mortal world.

412
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:06,635
There's only one of these in Lize Palace.

413
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:08,449
Eat it.

414
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,810
I can't eat it,

415
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,890
and I don't want to forget about her.

416
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,778
You are still not willing to forget about her?

417
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,098
As soon as she heard that you were a Rose Gold Bird Demon,

418
00:29:53,098 --> 00:29:55,490
she immediately chose to stand on their side.

419
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,729
Can't you see where she stands?

420
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,947
I am the one who lied to her first.

421
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:02,333
It's not her fault.

422
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,705
Lize Palace has been at peace for hundreds of years.

423
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:12,109
Master, do you really want to destroy it?

424
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,369
Another thing,

425
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:20,375
are you really the one who killed Xuanji's mother?

426
00:30:22,043 --> 00:30:24,683
It was her fault for being a busybody

427
00:30:24,683 --> 00:30:27,063
who wanted to take Hao Feng away from me.

428
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:31,532
In this world,

429
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:35,097
nobody can separate me and Hao Feng.

430
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,953
Those who forced her and made her kill herself,

431
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:42,205
don't they deserve to die?

432
00:30:43,531 --> 00:30:46,188
I was avenging your mother!

433
00:30:49,658 --> 00:30:51,482
Master...

434
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,432
Forget it.

435
00:30:58,252 --> 00:31:00,473
Do you want to see your mother?

436
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,693
Sifeng, this is your mother.

437
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:27,155
Has she always been here?

438
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,796
But why...

439
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,055
didn't you tell me about it before this?

440
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,408
I was waiting.

441
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:39,636
I was waiting for her to wake up

442
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,955
so that I could tell you everything about us.

443
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:50,986
What kind of a person was my mother?

444
00:31:50,986 --> 00:31:54,381
She is the best woman in this world.

445
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:59,073
I remember that when I first met your mother, I was your age.

446
00:31:59,073 --> 00:32:01,540
It was my first trial in the outside world.

447
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:35,081
When I saw her again, she was seriously wounded

448
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:36,859
after a fight with someone.

449
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:40,009
I saved her and treated her wounds with care

450
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:42,411
and we fell in love.

451
00:32:46,387 --> 00:32:48,384
<i>Is this a phoenix?</i>

452
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,539
<i>It doesn't look like one.</i>

453
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:51,979
<i>No.</i>

454
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:54,070
<i>This is a Rose Gold Bird.</i>

455
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,667
<i>Let me put it on for you.</i>

456
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:18,542
We hid our relationship pretty well at first.

457
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:20,605
She got pregnant

458
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:24,747
and we were looking forward to you.

459
00:34:24,747 --> 00:34:30,254
But on the day of her labor, our old palace lord found out about it.

460
00:34:30,254 --> 00:34:34,908
He rushed to us in a fury and almost killed you on the spot.

461
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,502
After that,

462
00:34:37,502 --> 00:34:41,438
he changed his mind because you inherited the Twelve Feathers bloodline.

463
00:34:42,491 --> 00:34:46,231
Then he took you back to Lize Palace without a second word

464
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:49,201
and he forced me to wear the Loveless Mask.

465
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:51,670
I was so lucky.

466
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:56,031
Your mother understood and cherished me. She had no regrets.

467
00:34:56,031 --> 00:35:00,332
She didn't abandon me even when she found out that I was a Rose Gold Bird.

468
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,450
Her only regret was you were not by her side,

469
00:35:08,662 --> 00:35:11,994
until those despicable people from the sects went looking for her.

470
00:35:11,994 --> 00:35:13,937
They knew that she had a union with a demon.

471
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:16,018
They forced her to tell them about my whereabouts.

472
00:35:16,018 --> 00:35:17,564
In order to...

473
00:35:18,227 --> 00:35:20,548
protect us,

474
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,984
your mother...

475
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,239
Ever since I brought her back, every day

476
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:33,434
I look for a way to revive her.

477
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:35,837
Now...

478
00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:39,217
I finally found the way.

479
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:44,237
Sifeng, I already gave your mother the 1,000-year-old stalactite.

480
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:46,770
After she wakes up,

481
00:35:47,149 --> 00:35:51,273
she'll be very happy when she sees you.

482
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,944
Master...

483
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:14,959
Until now, you still call me master.

484
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:20,396
I know. You hate me because I didn't tell you about this earlier.

485
00:36:20,396 --> 00:36:24,130
We are not allowed to have a wife and child in Lize Palace.

486
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:28,699
The old palace lord used your mother to force me to swear an oath.

487
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:32,690
I couldn't tell you about this until you'd become an adult.

488
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,757
Then you can go through your trial earlier

489
00:36:36,757 --> 00:36:39,677
and become our clan's hope.

490
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:44,591
In this world, there is no father who will abandon their own child.

491
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,709
You've always treated me very kindly.

492
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,719
Can you...

493
00:36:55,036 --> 00:36:57,258
call me father?

494
00:37:10,323 --> 00:37:12,142
Forget it.

495
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,059
Twenty years have passed.

496
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:17,861
There's no point in forcing you.

497
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:28,017
Father.

498
00:37:37,307 --> 00:37:39,282
What did you say?

499
00:37:39,282 --> 00:37:42,310
Father, I've been unfilial.

500
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,297
I've caused you much trouble.

501
00:37:52,507 --> 00:37:54,813
Hurry up and get up.

502
00:37:57,891 --> 00:37:59,761
My good child.

503
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,285
I am...

504
00:38:05,372 --> 00:38:07,453
very happy.

505
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,322
Hao Feng, did you see that?

506
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:21,267
Our child has grown up.

507
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:23,510
He called me father!

508
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,961
It's almost time.

509
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:32,254
When you wake up, the three of us can chat with each other happily.

510
00:38:32,618 --> 00:38:34,008
Hao Feng.

511
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,387
Finally you came out, Senior.

512
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:08,015
You broke the rule by burning the Crimson Tusk by yourself.

513
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:09,729
What do you want?

514
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:13,817
Burning the Crimson Tusk means that something major is going to happen.

515
00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:16,935
It's time for Lize Palace to have a new master.

516
00:39:16,935 --> 00:39:20,379
Deputy Chief, how could you say something like that?

517
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:23,410
Deputy Chief is just being loyal.

518
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,077
Are you trying to revolt?

519
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:27,089
Guards! Take them to the Discipline Hall!

520
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:28,530
My fellow elders,

521
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,014
do you want to hear me out first before making the decision?

522
00:39:33,262 --> 00:39:36,098
Lize Palace's identity has already been exposed.

523
00:39:36,098 --> 00:39:40,719
Lize Palace is supposed to take preventive measures for our future now.

524
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,316
But my senior, the head of this palace,

525
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:46,959
is hiding underground to accompany a dead person.

526
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,190
He has no care for the safety of Lize Palace. Should we change him out?

527
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,802
- You want to change the palace master? <br> - Yes.

528
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:56,539
I have the same thought, too.

529
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:59,626
I'm sick of being a palace master anyway.

530
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:01,239
I'll use this chance...

531
00:40:02,255 --> 00:40:04,425
to step down from my position.

532
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:08,513
Let's call for a meeting!

533
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,985
Sifeng, stand here.

534
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,877
I've been leading Lize Palace for 20 years.

535
00:40:48,877 --> 00:40:54,059
But during these 20 years, I've been living in a state of ignorance.

536
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:59,643
No wonder someone wants me to step down from my position.

537
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:03,588
Palace Master,

538
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:07,865
Lize Palace has been so peaceful because of you.

539
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,235
How can you say that you are living in a state of ignorance?

540
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:14,025
All these years, the deputy chief is the one handling everything.

541
00:41:14,025 --> 00:41:17,258
How can you say that it's all thanks to the palace master?

542
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:20,079
You are just lying brazenly.

543
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,270
- Elder He! <br> - Enough.

544
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:25,739
I know myself the best.

545
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:27,953
Stop arguing.

546
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:30,139
I'm sick of being a palace master already.

547
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:34,710
It's time to hand over Lize Palace to someone with a clear mind.

548
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,502
Listen to my order, Yu Sifeng.

549
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:14,550
From today onward, you'll be the new master of Lize Palace.

550
00:42:17,675 --> 00:42:22,628
I'll hand over the palace lord's Gold Feather Medallion to you.

551
00:42:25,347 --> 00:42:28,145
The Crimson Tusk is burning and I've already passed down my decree.

552
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,994
You are the successor of the Twelve Feathers bloodline.

553
00:42:30,994 --> 00:42:33,754
No one else comes from a better bloodline than yours.

554
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:36,850
I'm passing down the Gold Feather Medallion to you today.

555
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:39,389
You are the new master of Lize Palace.

556
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:41,900
Come! Let's greet our new master today.

557
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,540
Wait.

558
00:42:54,326 --> 00:42:57,439
Junior, I've already stepped down from my position.

559
00:42:57,439 --> 00:43:00,529
What is it? You are still not satisfied?

560
00:43:00,529 --> 00:43:04,460
Yu Sifeng has no right to become the palace master.

561
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,092
You are out of your mind.

562
00:43:07,947 --> 00:43:11,117
We can't trust the words of a lunatic.

563
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,187
Are you courting death?

564
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,418
Why are you angry?

565
00:43:25,418 --> 00:43:28,672
I know that you don't think of yourself as being crazy.

566
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,949
But let me ask you a question.

567
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:34,789
After giving us your answer, I'm sure that the elders will make up their mind.

568
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:36,305
What do you want to ask?

569
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:38,532
After stepping down from your position,

570
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,279
what are you going to do?

571
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:45,093
Hao Feng and I love each other.

572
00:43:45,093 --> 00:43:48,406
Of course, I'll travel far and wide with her.

573
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,210
Why are you laughing?

574
00:44:10,595 --> 00:44:12,555
Shut up!

575
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,698
Where did you learn this from?

576
00:44:21,698 --> 00:44:24,880
The old palace master taught me this to defend against you.

577
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,026
He asked me to keep an eye on you so that you won't lose your mind.

578
00:44:29,026 --> 00:44:32,290
I'm not crazy!

579
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:37,993
Senior, if Hao Feng was still here, she would hate you.

580
00:44:37,993 --> 00:44:40,138
You love each other?

581
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,983
I think you've really gone crazy.

582
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:46,379
Nonsense. Nonsense!

583
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,713
Senior,

584
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,189
I'm here.

585
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:59,697
In your mind, Hao Feng was so loyal to you and never abandoned you.

586
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,737
She even took down the Lover's Mask for you.

587
00:45:02,737 --> 00:45:05,141
But the reality is,

588
00:45:05,141 --> 00:45:10,121
she only loved you before she found out that you were a demon.

589
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:19,960
