18
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,972
Where have you been?

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,460
Why did you get back so late?

20
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,460
Look at you.

21
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,200
You're covered in sweat.

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,700
Come here.

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,199
You haven't said where you have been.

24
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,470
I went to the flower valley.

25
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:31,970
I wanted to pick some flowers and make a scented sachet for you.

26
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,160
But I couldn't find any suitable ones.

27
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:37,700
Oh, the flower valley.

28
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,161
No wonder your hands are cold.

29
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:40,560
Here.

30
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,780
Drink some tea.

31
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,560
Warm up your body.

32
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,040
Have a dessert.

33

<i>Your favorite dessert isn't rice cake,</i>

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,580
I'll take a walk with you tomorrow.

36
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,530
I'll bring along some slaves to play with you, too.

37
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,940
I've been busy these days. I haven't kept you company.

38
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,739
By the way, the disciple from Shaoyang Sect under the cliff, Chen Minjue...

39
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,240
What's wrong?

40
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,780
Eat slowly.

41
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,640
Here.

42
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,982
That Chen Minjue has been ignored for days.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,530
Someone has to send him some food.

44
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,580
We can't let him starve to death.

45
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,524
I need him to restrain Zhong Minyan.

46
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:13,500
I will go then. I can send food for him and take a stroll on my way.

47
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,800
Okay.

48
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,000
You just have to send this for him.

49
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,600
Master, we've brought the items.

50
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,421
This is a little gift for Shaoyang Sect's Leader Chu.

51
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:43,620
- Handle with care. <br> - Yes.

52
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,840
Right.

53
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:51,697
Both of you know the way.

54
00:04:51,697 --> 00:04:53,680
Go with them.

55
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,740
Stop!

56
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,259
You're just the entourage. Who told you to come over?

57
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:08,100
Take it away.

58
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,520
We've been searching around for so long, but not a single demon could be seen.

59
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,720
Looks like it's another fruitless day.

60
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,380
Sifeng, how are you feeling now?

61
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,700
Ting Nu said you've just recovered. Your qi might not circulate well.

62
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,560
You must tell me if you feel unwell.

63
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,380
Don't worry. I won't push myself.

64
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:42,599
How come there's a fire on that mountain?

65
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,046
What caused such a big fire?

66
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,900
Let's go take a look.

67
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,140
Our entire orchard is destroyed!

68
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,939
All right, stop crying! This is a fire from the heavens.

69
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,799
There's no use in crying.

70
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,839
We're lucky to survive. Hurry and go!

71
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,239
Uncle, what's going on?

72
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,959
You say this mountain fire is a fire from the heavens?

73
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,260
It's a fire from the heavens. I saw it with my own eyes.

74
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,575
A large fireball fell right on the ground.

75
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,350
There's nothing left.

76
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,790
What sins did we commit for God to kill us?

77
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,080
- Hurry and go! <br> - Let's take a look.

78
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,119
Hurry up!

79
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,198
We must put out the fire quickly, and save some of the trees and fields.

80
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,657
I'll set up a formation to draw water and make it rain.

81
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:32,847
But Sifeng, using secret arts to set up a formation may sap your vitality.

82
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:35,300
It's all right. I'm just putting out the fire.

83
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,040
The fire has gone out.

84
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,380
Who the hell put out the fire from me, the god?

85
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:10,440
Deity?

86
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,300
Two mortals?

87
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,060
You've got a lot of nerve.

88
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,159
I think I've seen you somewhere.

89
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,060
In the Mirror of Origin.

90
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,720
You're the heavenly beast, Lord Teng She from the heavens.

91
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,758
Was it you two who set up the rain formation and soaked me?

92
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,340
We didn't know you were here.

93
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,699
I was in a rush to put out the fire, and so I've bothered you.

94
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,279
Please don't blame us for putting out the fire.

95
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,707
I passed by the mortal realm

96
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,087
and noticed this place needed a heavenly trial,

97
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:59,180
so I started a fire on the mountain.

98
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,820
This is the fate of nature.

99
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,979
But because of you two being nosy, the heavenly law is broken.

100
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,420
What should you do? Offer up your lives as penance?

101
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,819
What nonsense is that?

102
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,221
Who are you to decide the fate of the living beings here?

103
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:17,350
Is it simply because you are a god?

104
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,491
After suffering the fire from the heavens, this land will become a land of fortune.

105
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:24,140
The future inhabitants living here will be thrice blessed.

106
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,940
They should be thanking me.

107
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,030
You've quite the courage, you stinky woman.

108
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,276
Then, what about the people who lived here originally?

109
00:08:32,276 --> 00:08:36,780
Do you know it was because of you that they have become homeless, injured, or dead?

110
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,439
This is fate! Fate! Do you understand? You idiot!

111
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,553
- You... <br> - Cut the crap.

112
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,479
Hurry up and say whatever you've to say. Don't get in my way.

113
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm in haste to find someone!

114
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,241
Sifeng! Sifeng! Sifeng!

115
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,600
He died so easily?

116
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,760
Mortals are weak indeed.

117
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:17,180
Dingkun Sword!

118
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,695
Dingkun Sword?

119
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:23,000
You are the God of War?

120
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:27,900
I actually bumped into you here.

121
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,439
You've lost your aura after becoming a mortal. I almost didn't recognize you.

122
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:33,580
Heaven helps those who help themselves.

123
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,820
1,000 years have passed.

124
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,740
I've been looking for a chance to have a proper fight with you

125
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,280
and see who is better. Bring it on!

126
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,920
I won't fight with you.

127
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,640
I'm going to kill you.

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,440
Xuanji!

129
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:14,680
Sifeng!

130
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,160
Sifeng, are you all right?

131
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,880
I thought you were dead! I thought he killed you!

132
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,320
I'm fine.

133
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,960
I'm glad you're fine.

134
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,298
Didn't you want to get a powerful spirit beast?

135
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:30,199
If a beast from the heavens becomes your spirit beast,

136
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,340
would that be good enough?

137
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,719
That's not fair!

138
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,180
You're insulting a heavenly beast! This won't end here!

139
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,429
But, Sifeng, I don't really like him.

140
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,514
He's not nice at all.

141
00:10:43,514 --> 00:10:46,884
If he becomes my spirit beast, will he behave well?

142
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:50,414
Never! Stinky woman, just drop that idea!

143
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:53,663
Of course. Once you become his master, he'll be your spirit beast.

144
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:56,020
He can't go against his master's commands.

145
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,753
After this, he won't bother you into fighting him.

146
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:01,920
He'll listen to you.

147
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,000
Lord Teng She, don't cause a disturbance in the mortal realm anymore.

148
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,204
Sounds good.

149
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:12,100
What should I do?

150
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,060
Xuanji, give me your hand.

151
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,050
Don't you dare!

152
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,780
I'll turn you two into skewers!

153
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,479
What is this?

154
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,619
Why have I never seen you use it?

155
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:48,023
This is a Blood Soul Pearl made up of your blood and his.

156
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:50,561
This flying snake is very mischievous and hard to tame.

157
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:53,240
It'll be easier with this pearl.

158
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,653
I...

159
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:58,862
No. I'll fight you to the death.

160
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:02,019
Xuanji, squeeze it.

161
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,100
Squeeze again.

162
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,100
Call his name.

163
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,020
Teng She.

164
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,240
I, Teng She, pay respect to Master.

165
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,780
All done.

166
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,388
Both of you have created a blood pact.

167
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,620
From now on, you're his master.

168
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,410
You...

169
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,660
You're my spirit beast in the future, okay?

170
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,878
We're family now.

171
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,720
Sir, please come in.

172
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,839
Little Silver Flower is my spirit beast.

173
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,901
She's experienced in being a spirit beast.

174
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:57,440
She'll teach you some manners.

175
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,878
Xuaji and I are going in to see if there's a private room.

176
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,341
We'll get some water to clean your face.

177
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,790
It's the same for you.

178
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,740
<i>[Xi'an Wine House]</i>

179
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,517
His spirit beast is a stink rat snake?

180
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,993
Asking a stink rat snake to teach me is a humiliation!

181
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:17,314
I'm not a stink rat snake.

182
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,502
I'm a Chinese krait snake.

183
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:21,239
Who cares what kind of snake you are?

184
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,020
I'm a stupid snake if I don't leave now.

185
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,921
- You don't need a sword to fly? <br> - Of course!

186
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:39,341
I'm a heavenly beast.

187
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:40,579
A god.

188
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,399
How can I be compared to a lower creature like you?

189
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,299
It's useless. Without master's consent, you can't go far

190
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:49,319
before your qi fails you, and your blood goes the wrong way.

191
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,260
How far can I go then?

192
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,460
That's the furthest you can go.

193
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,430
Sifeng.

194
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:36,705
Chu Xuanji, why is your face so dirty?

195
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:38,219
I can't clean it.

196
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:41,500
I'll help you clean it then.

197
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,860
Come here.

198
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,400
Come here.

199
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,600
It's not done yet.

200
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,120
What happened to your brow?

201
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,719
It was burned by the fire before. Now it's gone.

202
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,400
What should I do? Is it hideous?

203
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,085
- Yes, very ugly. <br> - Really?

204
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:20,620
Is it not?

205
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,260
Is it ugly?

206
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,200
Say it again.

207
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:29,720
Serves you right.

208
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,340
Come here.

209
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,523
Sifeng,

210
00:16:57,523 --> 00:17:00,040
you know how to draw on brows?

211
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,679
I was forced to learn it.

212
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,579
Eldest Brother Liu told me that it might come in handy.

213
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,659
I never imagined it to be useful now.

214
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:13,599
This is my first time drawing for you, so I'm not good at it yet.

215
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,439
I'll draw a nice brow for you eventually.

216
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,199
- Don't move. <br> - It's ticklish.

217
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,519
I might give you a yaksha eyebrow.

218
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,020
Almost done.

219
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,037
Sifeng, my father used to tell me

220
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,160
that he helped my mother with her brows too when they were young.

221
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,260
Your father and mother are different.

222
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,880
Done! Take a look.

223
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:58,919
So pretty. Sifeng, you're so great.

224
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,692
- So clever. <br> - Sir.

225
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:02,787
- Take a look outside quickly. <br> - What's the matter?

226
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:04,529
The gray-haired man who came with you

227
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:06,766
is going to destroy the whole street.

228
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,320
Teng She?

229
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,260
Teng She!

230
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,660
Why is he...

231
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,320
I'm in a bad mood today, so you'll have to suffer.

232
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,880
Teng She!

233
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,389
Teng She, what are you doing? Stop!

234
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,179
You want me to stay by your side, right? Fine!

235
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,000
I won't let you have a day of peace.

236
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:06,479
Where does this troublemaker come from?

237
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,160
<i>Indeed, where did he come from?</i>

238
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,079
Listen. Every injustice has its perpetrator.

239
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,239
The person right there is Chu Xuanji. She's my master.

240
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:17,399
Everything was done under her command. Go talk with her.

241
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,559
Oh right! Don't let her off.

242
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,436
- Why did you let your servant hurt others? <br> - When did I...

243
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:23,299
I didn't!

244
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:25,358
Stop there! Compensate me for my stock! Compensate me for my wine!

245
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,740
I'll pay for it. All right, I'll pay for all the losses.

246
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,900
Okay.

247
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,599
Fine.

248
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,140
You've money, is that it?

249
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,766
You mortals. Good then.

250
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:39,560
I'll demolish the entire street!

251
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,115
- Stinky woman, what are you doing? <br> - Teng She!

252
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:51,519
Didn't Little Silver Flower teach you that

253
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,679
as a spirit beast, you're not allowed to hurt your master.

254
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,361
You'll hurt yourself instead

255
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,159
and the consequences are grave.

256
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,679
I don't believe it! Fine.

257
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,800
I won't cast any spell. I'll use my fists.

258
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,959
What's wrong? Is it a massage?

259
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,580
Come, here.

260
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,280
I was so worn out lately. Come, here.

261
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,559
I'm exhausted.

262
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,879
- I'm going to eat. <br> - Stop there!

263
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:38,759
You haven't apologized for what you did.

264
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,099
As my spirit beast, you can't behave the way you do

265
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:43,799
to bully the weak and do as you wish.

266
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,640
You want me to apologize?

267
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,600
- I refuse! <br> - Are you going to apologize or not?

268
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,620
Apologize my...

269
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,839
He got on his knees to apologize for what he did to all of you just now.

270
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,939
Don't worry. He will never do it again.

271
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:05,639
Stinky woman.

272
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,700
Throw away the pearl and fight one-on-one with me if you dare!

273
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,304
Stop right there! Come back!

274
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:15,800
Don't go!

275
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,900
I have my pride!

276
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,280
Don't you laugh! I'm telling you...

277
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,300
Time to eat.

278
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:42,926
You!

279
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,700
How can you be so violent when you're at fault?

280
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,334
Being insolent after making mistakes? Starve yourself then!

281
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:49,915
Do as you like!

282
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:53,340
Just leave your wound like that!

283
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,640
How can you laugh?

284
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,360
Why is your spirit beast so obedient, but mine is like that?

285
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:14,839
Of course.

286
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,639
Not everyone can get a spirit beast as good as me, right?

287
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,014
Don't quarrel with him all the time. You should get along with him.

288
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:24,799
Look at him huddling himself there, refusing to eat and drink.

289
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,860
Doesn't he look like a stray puppy that you just picked up?

290
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,297
A little.

291
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:33,638
You see... If you just picked up a stray puppy,

292
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:36,118
wouldn't it bare its teeth at you?

293
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:39,202
It wants to bite you, but it can't. Neither can it eat.

294
00:22:39,202 --> 00:22:41,178
Isn't it quite pathetic now?

295
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:43,460
What do you think you should do?

296
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,278
I'll put it in my arms and rub its head.

297
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,473
That's right.

298
00:22:49,473 --> 00:22:52,399
Treat him like a dog and tame him.

299
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:56,246
He's not even a human, so we can't train him like one.

300
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:59,039
If he doesn't behave well, just spank him on his butt.

301
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,999
If he does, give him a hug then.

302
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,769
He's not a human anyway. We can't train him like a human.

303
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:07,021
Here. This is a breed guide to spirit beasts.

304
00:23:07,022 --> 00:23:08,615
I'm giving it to you now.

305
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:11,419
Do what the book says, and you'll master it eventually.

306
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:13,239
You're so smart.

307
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,680
Okay.

308
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,919
This is Shaoyang's secret vulnerary.

309
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,945
It's very effective. Even though I'm very mad today,

310
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,639
we still have to treat your wound.

311
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,600
Otherwise, it may get worse.

312
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,569
Listen. Don't ever think a small favor like this can make me give in.

313
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:43,443
I'm a heavenly beast.

314
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:46,078
I despise mortals' behavior.

315
00:23:46,078 --> 00:23:48,319
Who told you to give in?

316
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,660
Although you're my spirit beast, we can still be friends.

317
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,800
From now onward, I'll protect you.

318
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,260
What are you doing?

319
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,059
You treated me like a dog, and rubbed my head?

320
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,179
Only King and Heavenly Emperor can touch my head!

321
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,350
All right.

322
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,779
Are you hungry? I don't know what you like to eat

323
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:10,426
but Little Silver Flower said you like eating.

324
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:12,460
Wait here. I'll get it for you.

325
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:20,959
Put it away! What are you doing?

326
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,359
Who do you think I am?

327
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,239
I've been a god for thousands of years!

328
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,980
The stink rat snake that just crawled out from the snake nest and I are different!

329
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,719
- That's not what I meant. <br> - That's not what you meant?

330
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,949
What's this?

331
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,079
You want to tame me like a pet?

332
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,279
Chu Xuanji, I'm telling you! It's better to die than be humiliated!

333
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,366
All right. Don't be mad.

334
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:44,759
Let's bury the hatchet, okay?

335
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,520
What's done is done.

336
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,160
I'll reluctantly keep you as spirit beast.

337
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,705
You'll reluctantly keep me as spirit beast?

338
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:04,239
I'm obviously the one in agony here, okay?

339
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,161
Hurry and break the blood pact!

340
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:08,502
No!

341
00:25:08,503 --> 00:25:11,099
You know it well that unless you cut off my arm,

342
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:13,900
this blood pact can't be undone.

343
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,680
It is what it is now, and there's no room for us to regret.

344
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,839
I don't care!

345
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,486
Let me tell you, Chu Xuanji.

346
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:25,519
No matter what, I will leave.

347
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,040
Little Snake, catch it.

348
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:31,099
You're not a fool. Now that the blood pact has been made,

349
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:32,679
why still throw a tantrum?

350
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,237
Besides, she won't embarrass you as an owner

351
00:25:35,238 --> 00:25:37,134
and this is more intriguing than staying in the heavens.

352
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,159
I know you sneaked to the mortal realm.

353
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,980
You said you passed by the mortal realm and set the woods on fire,

354
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,580
but most likely you caused the accident.

355
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,519
I know you're worried the heavens will look into it.

356
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,999
That's why you did it.

357
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,260
However, Xuanji got you out of a fix anyway.

358
00:25:52,023 --> 00:25:52,999
Mind reader!

359
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,589
You can read minds!

360
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,615
Of course, I don't know how to read minds.

361
00:25:56,615 --> 00:25:59,421
But the heavens never interfere with mortal affairs.

362
00:25:59,422 --> 00:26:01,288
You said you came for the God of War.

363
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:05,219
So, it appears that Lord Teng She is such a wild and unruly god.

364
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:06,660
You!

365
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,900
You're all dismissed.

366
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,980
I'm tired.

367
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,852
Drink with me.

368
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:26,919
How did it go?

369
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,680
Did you get the ring from Tianxu Hall?

370
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,836
We searched everywhere but found nothing.

371
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:34,582
They seem to have been more careful now.

372
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,718
The trip isn't utterly fruitless.

373
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,359
Xuanji got herself a spirit beast.

374
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:41,860
- Spirit beast? <br> - Spirit beast?

375
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,345
Why isn't he coming in?

376
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:45,320
Teng She.

377
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:49,150
Let me introduce you.

378
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:51,659
This is my best friend, Ting Nu.

379
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:54,619
This is Liu Yihuan, Eldest Brother Liu.

380
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:57,620
- This is... <br> - Lord Teng She.

381
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,846
You're quite knowledgeable.

382
00:27:03,847 --> 00:27:06,140
At least you know me.

383
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:08,540
You...

384
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,820
You stole the celestial eye? How dare you!

385
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,600
You're from the heavens?

386
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,966
I'm the most promising officer in the heavens.

387
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:27,739
If I report to the heavens about what happened here,

388
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:30,840
all of you would be in serious trouble.

389
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:37,579
I've been on the run for so long to avoid being caught by the heavens.

390
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:39,444
I'm doomed.

391
00:27:39,444 --> 00:27:41,188
I'm so scared.

392
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:45,120
If you're scared, quickly tell the woman to let me go.

393
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,520
Do you take me for a fool?

394
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,318
You are Chu Xuanji's spirit beast now.

395
00:27:51,318 --> 00:27:53,580
There's no way you can tell on me!

396
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,519
It's even more dangerous to let you go. Little Xuanji, well done!

397
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,340
Don't ever let him go for my sake.

398
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,927
You people...

399
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:04,580
You! I remember you now.

400
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,055
You're the merman medic banished to the mortal realm, aren't you?

401
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:09,399
Lord Teng She, it's very kind of you

402
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,564
to remember an insignificant merman like me.

403
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,519
Shut up! You're all demons.

404
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,959
Where did you keep Wu Zhiqi?

405
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,894
I want to fight with him!

406
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,934
Teng She, you're too noisy!

407
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:20,259
Treat my friends better!

408
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:23,620
And also, why do you want to fight with everyone?

409
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,440
One day, I'm going to arrest each and all of you!

410
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,360
Lord Teng She, would you like me to pick a room for you?

411
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,940
I'll take whichever room I like!

412
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,438
You silly snake, you can't get out this way.

413
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:21,341
How about this? Since we're of the same species,

414
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:24,839
- I'll give you a hand. <br> - What can you do?

415
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,379
You can't cast a spell to hurt your master,

416
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:32,160
but I wonder if you can use poison.

417
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,700
Here is a bottle of Soul Entry that I stole from Liu Yihuan.

418
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,201
Do you want to give it a try?

419
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:40,920
This is a great idea.

420
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,753
No. That stinky woman is the God of War.

421
00:29:46,754 --> 00:29:49,819
If I stealthily poisoned her to death, isn't it a dirty trick?

422
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:52,380
Besides, if I kill her,

423
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,719
who else can I fight with?

424
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,376
That's why I say you're stupid.

425
00:29:56,376 --> 00:29:58,499
I didn't tell you to kill her with poison.

426
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:00,593
She won't die if you control the amount of poison you use.

427
00:30:00,594 --> 00:30:05,200
When she passes out, you can just cut off her arm.

428
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,522
Never mind. I think I shouldn't give you the poison.

429
00:30:11,522 --> 00:30:14,299
I want! I want it!

430
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:18,556
Okay. Remember, don't tell anyone that I helped you.

431
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:22,025
Otherwise, if my master knows about this, he'll never forgive me.

432
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:26,186
Don't worry. Since you went all out to help me, I, Lord Teng She,

433
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:28,800
am not an unfaithful person.

434
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:30,856
Okay.

435
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,100
Go then.

436
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,539
Teng She, why aren't you sleeping yet?

437
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:53,090
Stinky woman, this is such an exciting moment, how can I fall asleep?

438
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,139
You have such a powerful spirit beast now.

439
00:30:56,139 --> 00:30:58,620
Let's have a drink or two to celebrate!

440
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,540
Have you decided to stay?

441
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,546
Drink it first! Perhaps, I'll feel happy after two cups and decide to stay.

442
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,560
- Cheers. <br> - Cheers.

443
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,460
Nice wine.

444
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,720
- One more. <br> - One more cup.

445
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,019
It's really good.

446
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:30,859
Drink some more.

447
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:33,386
You can have the whole jug.

448
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,480
Why isn't she drunk yet?

449
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,119
Teng She.

450
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,507
What happened to your face?

451
00:31:53,507 --> 00:31:55,075
What happened to my face?

452
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:56,609
It's very handsome.

453
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:58,750
Handsome?

454
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:01,539
You're...

455
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:03,500
What?

456
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,580
My handsome face...

457
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,900
Teng She!

458
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,825
Wake up!

459
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:37,500
Wake up!

460
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,940
Ghost!

461
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,439
Come back!

462
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,979
Look at me. It's me, Teng She.

463
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:45,619
Quick. Give me the cure for your Soul Entry.

464
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:47,420
Soul Entry?

465
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,739
You're poisoned with my Soul Entry?

466
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:52,439
Yes. Hurry and give me the cure!

467
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,559
- I'm so hideous! <br> - Impossible.

468
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,959
If you're poisoned by Soul Entry, you would be dead by now.

469
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,580
Besides,

470
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,460
my Soul Entry is right here.

471
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,320
But my Seven Venoms Face Wrecker is gone.

472
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,379
Have you mistaken Seven Venoms Face Wrecker as Soul Entry and consumed it?

473
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:12,660
No. I don't care whatever it is!

474
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,345
Give me the cure!

475
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:17,679
This Seven Venoms Face Wrecker is the first bottle I made. There's no cure for it.

476
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,740
- Teng She. <br> - No cure?

477
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,346
But don't you worry! My Seven Venom Face Wrecker

478
00:33:22,346 --> 00:33:25,060
is made up of the stingers of seven different poisonous wasps.

479
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,180
Those poisoned will only have a swollen face,

480
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,100
festered wound which will form scabs,

481
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,519
and become uglier and uglier. But it's not fatal.

482
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,999
You won't die.

483
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,840
If you really die,

484
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,500
it's caused by the shame of your ugliness.

485
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,120
You...

486
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,160
But, Teng She,

487
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,739
why would you steal a bottle of poison and drink it?

488
00:33:56,739 --> 00:33:58,700
I guess he intended to poison you,

489
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,379
but stole the Seven Venoms Face Wrecker instead.

490
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:04,339
And he never expected that the spirit beast would suffer the backlash.

491
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:07,780
He has truly shot himself in the foot.

492
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:11,380
Is that really what you wanted to do?

493
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:15,045
So what if I have done it?

494
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:17,061
So what if I haven't done it?

495
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:18,759
It's all because of you, stinky woman!

496
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,537
If you didn't rack your brain and conspire to make me your spirit beast,

497
00:34:23,537 --> 00:34:26,280
would I end up like this?

498
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:33,013
I, Lord Teng She, used to be the most promising

499
00:34:33,013 --> 00:34:35,599
and handsome officer in the heavens.

500
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,364
But now I'm being tortured by mortals and became so hideous!

501
00:34:40,365 --> 00:34:42,260
I want to die!

502
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,974
There's a song about secret arts in the heavens.

503
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:46,414
You can sing it, too, right?

504
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:48,383
You've become Xuanji's spirit beast

505
00:34:48,383 --> 00:34:50,606
because fate brought you together.

506
00:34:50,606 --> 00:34:53,018
I thought you were a god who was willing to accept failure,

507
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:54,939
so I showed you some respect. But never had I expected you

508
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:57,706
to think of such a cheap shot.

509
00:34:57,706 --> 00:35:00,020
I see you in a different light now.

510
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,600
Xuanji, since he won't die, just leave him alone.

511
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,200
Eldest Brother Liu, is there really no way to help him?

512
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,440
It's not completely impossible.

513
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,176
Quickly tell me how you can cure me!

514
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:22,139
That depends on whether your master is willing to save you or not.

515
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:25,219
You're Xuanji's spirit beast now, and you share a blood pact.

516
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:27,815
So Xuanji's blood is certainly the best cure.

517
00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:31,344
If Xuanji is willing to use her blood to force out your poisonous blood,

518
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:34,459
- then your poison will be cured. <br> - Don't do it, Xuanji.

519
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:38,620
A spirit beast that hurts his master deserves some kind of punishment.

520
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,899
Don't worry.

521
00:35:40,899 --> 00:35:42,676
I won't beg her to save me.

522
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:47,020
If I beg her to save me, I'll be admitting her as my master.

523
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,700
I would rather be ugly forever.

524
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,840
Stinky woman! What are you doing?

525
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,519
You're still my spirit beast now.

526
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:13,320
I told you, I'd protect you.

527
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,740
Even if you give me your blood, I still won't accept you as my master.

528
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,150
I'm not saving you to make you stay.

529
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:28,580
I just can't bear to see your ugly face!

530
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,479
I'm warning you, stinky woman!

531
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:34,619
Don't force me!

532
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:38,724
Hurry! Open your mouth! Finish it and return to the heavens.

533
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:40,460
What did you say?

534
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:44,019
Since you're so unwilling, I don't want to force you, either.

535
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:47,819
I have a lot of things to do every day. I don't have time to bicker with you.

536
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:51,161
But if you really want to cut off my arm, I'm unwilling to do that as well.

537
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:54,233
How about this? I allow you to leave me indefinitely.

538
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:56,079
A mortal's life is very short.

539
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,171
A day in the heavens is a year in the mortal realm.

540
00:36:58,171 --> 00:37:01,800
Stay there for a dozen days, and you can regain your freedom.

541
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:05,747
Are you really willing to let me go?

542
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,520
If I let you save me,

543
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,740
wouldn't I lose my face then?

544
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,010
Face?

545
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,031
You've lost your features now, what face do you want?

546
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:21,400
Think carefully.

547
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:26,034
At first, I kept you as my spirit beast because I wanted to save my friend.

548
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:28,212
I didn't expect you to be so unwilling.

549
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:32,199
Perhaps there's no fate between us. I can't insist on it.

550
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,319
After all, you're not the only one in the world

551
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,399
who can be my spirit beast.

552
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,879
You don't want me, I don't want you, either!

553
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,400
Hurry up! Finish up your cure, and go back to the heavens happily.

554
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,540
Let's go, Sifeng.

555
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,383
Hurry up!

556
00:38:01,383 --> 00:38:04,125
It's just a minor injury.

557
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,560
Don't move.

558
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,899
Had I known earlier, I wouldn't have helped you get Teng She.

559
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:13,120
I didn't know it would be so troublesome.

560
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:16,280
I don't mind your troubles.

561
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:22,120
I just regret that you put all your attention on him.

562
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,950
You are even jealous of a spirit beast?

563
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:30,880
Jealousy is jealousy.

564
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:34,260
It doesn't matter who the other person is.

565
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,100
Aren't you going to comfort me?

566
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,480
Is this okay?

567
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,720
I don't want this kind of comfort.

568
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,280
I want this kind of comfort in the future.

569
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,440
Sifeng.

570
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,399
Teng She is leaving soon anyway.

571
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,480
Nobody will disturb us anymore.

572
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,900
You really gave up on him?

573
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,380
There's no point in forcing him.

574
00:39:31,098 --> 00:39:34,360
What if he's willing to stay?

575
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:36,859
How is that possible?

576
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:41,457
I've heard some rumors about Teng She.

577
00:39:41,457 --> 00:39:44,339
Perhaps I know a way to help you.

578
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,300
What is it?

579
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:51,340
Both of you have similar interests.

580
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,900
Teng She, aren't you leaving?

581
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,439
I won't ask you to stay for a meal then.

582
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,200
Hurry and go.

583
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,539
What's this? It smells so nice.

584
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:45,758
It's just a dish made of old hen soup simmered for a dozen hours.

585
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:48,619
I put some pickled bamboo shoots, abalone and sausages.

586
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:51,080
Si Feng, I want to eat that.

587
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,620
And what is this?

588
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,296
This is a specialty here, Spring Carp.

589
00:41:00,296 --> 00:41:02,639
I used perilla to remove the fishy smell, and added some veined rapa whelk.

590
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,380
Taste it first.

591
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,800
Delicious.

592
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,979
What else is in there?

593
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:20,579
A roasted leg of lamb cooked until golden brown on one side.

594
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:23,360
Then, I cut off the other side and put in star anise and orange peel.

595
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,859
Added in a pinch of red chili and a pinch of cumin.

596
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,700
I'll grill it over low flame. We can eat it tonight.

597
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,240
But someone can't eat it.

598
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:36,387
Why?

599
00:41:36,387 --> 00:41:39,180
I can leave after I eat.

600
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,240
Aren't you going back to the heavens? Hurry and go then.

601
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,060
So delicious.

602
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,338
Is everything in the mortal realm as good as this?

603
00:41:56,338 --> 00:41:57,687
Certainly!

604
00:41:57,687 --> 00:42:00,346
Only a few mortals can cook so well.

605
00:42:00,346 --> 00:42:02,880
Sifeng is one of them.

606
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,740
It seems like the mortal realm is nice, too.

607
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,100
Aren't you going back to the heavens? Go on your way.

608
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:14,299
Will I leave just because you tell me to?

609
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:15,853
Something is wrong with me.

610
00:42:15,853 --> 00:42:18,181
I like to do the exact opposite of what others tell me to do.

611
00:42:18,181 --> 00:42:22,040
You want me to leave, I won't leave then.

612
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,906
- You're really staying? <br> - After all,

613
00:42:24,906 --> 00:42:27,499
you mortals only live for several decades.

614
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:29,619
I'll play with you for a period of time.

615
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:31,139
What harm is there?

616
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:33,159
But you have to promise that I'll have delicious food every day.

617
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:36,719
If there's no delicious food, then I might just leave.

618
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,559
You're really staying?

619
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,759
Why do you have so much to say? I won't repeat my words!

620
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,999
Okay then. Since you're staying, enjoy yourself.

621
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,540
Here.

622
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,440
Sifeng, you should have some, too.

623
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:55,070
You two...

624
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:56,359
Enough.

625
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,720
Just a normal routine.

626
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,755
Suit yourself then. Continue.

627
00:43:00,755 --> 00:43:02,860
Just leave me the good food.

628
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,539
Food in the mortal realm is good.

629
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:08,219
Food in the heavens is not.

630
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,825
It's like eating mud, and it's tasteless.

631
00:43:10,825 --> 00:43:15,813
Yes. Pretty things are usually fake.

632
00:43:15,813 --> 00:43:17,320
That's right.

633
00:43:18,394 --> 00:43:21,819
You know the saying, too? The king often says that

634
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:27,365
those that look pretty and alluring are usually unreliable.

635
00:43:28,323 --> 00:43:29,863
Bailing?

636
00:43:29,863 --> 00:43:33,679
When I was in the Mirror of Origin, I saw the king, too.

637
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:36,820
But who is he?

638
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,180
So you're really that stupid that you don't even remember the king?

639
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,535
Tell me!

640
00:43:49,535 --> 00:43:50,779
You're ignorant.

641
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:53,207
The king is King Bailing.

642
00:43:53,207 --> 00:43:55,899
If he didn't plead for you, you would've died long ago.

643
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:58,840
How could you be sitting here asking me who the king is?

644
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,858
The king pleaded for me?

645
00:44:01,858 --> 00:44:03,360
Yes.

646
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:11,080
At that time, Old Guy said that you were madly in love with the king.

647
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,559
But after you fell from the heavens to go through trials, did you leave everything behind?

648
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:19,318
You found this pretty boy in an instant and forgot about the king?

649
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:21,779
Bai... I love the king?

650
00:44:21,779 --> 00:44:25,120
Who is the Old Guy? He made it up, right?

651
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:29,290
It's because it was an unrequited love, so you got mad

652
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,938
and hated the entire heavens.

653
00:44:30,938 --> 00:44:34,479
You even plotted a rebellion, that was why you were banished,

654
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,420
and have to go through trials again.

655
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,160
Have you forgotten all of these?

656
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,059
Are you saying that Xuanji was sent to the mortal realm as she fell in love and broke the rules?

657
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:46,860
Why? Are you jealous?

658
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:49,858
The king is a god.

659
00:44:49,858 --> 00:44:54,140
He can't be compared to a mortal like you.

660
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,038
So what if he is a mortal? If I wasn't banished to the mortal realm,

661
00:44:58,038 --> 00:44:59,559
I wouldn't have met Sifeng.

662
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,640
I don't care who he is.

663
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,136
In this whole world, Sifeng is the best.

664
00:45:04,136 --> 00:45:07,800
If you look down on food made by mortals, stop eating then!

665
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,739
Whatever. As long as you promise he'll make good food for me every day.

666
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:15,326
Whether you love the king or the pretty boy, it's none of my business.

667
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:17,346
As for the matter of saving your friend,

668
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:23,080
I can force myself to do you a small favor.

669
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,100
Give me the food! It's all mine!

670
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:43,990
