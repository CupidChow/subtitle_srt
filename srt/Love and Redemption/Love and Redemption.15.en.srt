Let me see your Destiny Pearl.

19
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,639
Don't try to have any ideas about it.

20
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,034
I know something's inside it.

21
00:01:59,034 --> 00:02:02,500
The Spirit Key of Xuanyuan Sect is hidden in that pearl.

22
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,160
I've been looking for it for a long time. Just give it to me.

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,749
The Spirit Key is very important. We can't let a demon like you hold it.

24
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,157
I'm different from the demons in Tianxu Hall.

25
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:16,200
I'm just trying to save Wu Zhiqi with the Spirit Key.

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,520
I can give you the Spirit Key,

27
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,980
but only on one condition.

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,559
What condition?

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,820
You're the only person who knows how to cast spells in Mount Gao.

30
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,140
I'm sure the others have no idea about the Mirror of Origin.

31
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,621
I think the mirror shard is in your hand.

32
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,400
You can use the mirror shard to exchange for your Spirit Key.

33
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:42,260
Mirror of Origin?

34
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,684
I've never heard of it.

35
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:45,196
Mount Gao is a huge place.

36
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:48,319
You can look for the mirror shard yourself.

37
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,002
- I don't know anything. <br> - You're lying.

38
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,832
I saw it.

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,352
- Xuanji! <br> - Linglong!

40
00:02:55,447 --> 00:02:57,587
Xuanji, are you okay?

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,491
Why did you come up here? It's dangerous, you know?

42
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:02,999
Didn't I ask you to wait for us down below?

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,793
Someone would've become

44
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:08,060
the wife of a bandit chief if I didn't come and rescue her.

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,084
By the way, you said you didn't know about the Mirror of Origin. Right?

46
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:17,220
How do you explain the mirror inside your Maze Formation?

47
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,439
Dumb girl! Keep quiet!

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,540
So what if that's the mirror shard?

49
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,356
I'll take both the Spirit Keys and the mirror shard.

50
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:27,144
You!

51
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,243
Tianxu Hall?

52
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,720
Are they all dead?

53
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,918
They...

54
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,449
You demons! You will pay for this!

55
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,125
Kill them!

56
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,799
Weren't you amazing just now?

57
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,335
Burn them with your Samadhi Fire then!

58
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:54,039
I... I can't use it right now.

59
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,460
So, you're just an amateur.

60
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,860
I can see colors now.

61
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,980
- Wu Tong? <br> - What a busy scene. Long time no see.

62
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,300
Wu Tong?

63
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,399
All the people I'm looking for are actually here?

64
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,577
Wu Tong, why are you here?

65
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:32,319
What?

66
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,159
You didn't expect me to be alive, right?

67
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,120
Sorry to disappoint you.

68
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,736
I'm quite tough.

69
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:40,000
I told you before.

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,879
I'll drill a hole in you if I see you again.

71
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,920
There's more than one hole in my body.

72
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,859
Come on.

73
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,900
My arms are always open for you.

74
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,039
Wu Tong, it's been a long time.

75
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,159
I didn't expect you to join the demons in Tianxu Hall.

76
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,135
I was forced to a dead end by your so-called righteous sects. I was almost dead.

77
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:03,465
Only the demons gave me a place to hide.

78
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,195
Why can't I join them?

79
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:10,060
But I have to thank you for this.

80
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,600
If not, I wouldn't be the glorious person I am right now.

81
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,519
You're welcome. You deserved everything due to your evil deeds.

82
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,620
You don't need to find excuses and blame others for your mistakes.

83
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,180
It's been so many years, but I didn't expect

84
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,170
Lize Palace and Shaoyang Sect to still be in a good relationship.

85
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:34,620
This is so interesting.

86
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,199
You became a lackey of Tianxu Hall.

87
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,808
You felt proud even though you were just their lackey.

88
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:40,356
Isn't that more interesting?

89
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:43,020
All of you, listen up.

90
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:49,079
I will make those who insulted me pay a thousandfold.

91
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,198
If you don't want to end up like the old guys in Xuanyuan Sect,

92
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:54,658
you better give me the Spirit Key.

93
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,538
Xuanyuan Sect?

94
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:00,760
Don't tell me you've...

95
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,335
It's a pity that you didn't get to witness it for yourself.

96
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:07,733
Your Sect Leader Zhu Shi, he was killed by his own disciples.

97
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:09,700
I made them kill him in exchange for the antidote.

98
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,423
You didn't see how hardworking they were

99
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:15,199
in order to obtain the antidote.

100
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,320
You!

101
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,444
This is just the start.

102
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:20,559
Just wait and see.

103
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:23,612
I'll reduce all your righteous sects into ashes

104
00:08:23,612 --> 00:08:25,992
in order to appease my hatred!

105
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,280
Take them down! Leave none of them alive!

106
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,545
Bring them and retreat! Cover me!

107
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:12,264
What are you trying to do?

108
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,520
Protect the Spirit Key! Go now!

109
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,188
Run!

110
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,399
<i>- Stand down! <br> - Who is this?</i>

111
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,079
<i>Who exactly are you?</i>

112
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,702
<i>Why are you always appearing in my dream?</i>

113
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:09,423
<i>You think you're great after you've slain many Asuras?</i>

114
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:11,900
<i>Even the Heavenly Emperor can't save you now!</i>

115
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,399
<i>What did I do wrong? </i>

116
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,180
<i>You were in the wrong!</i>

117
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,440
<i>Dingkun Sword!</i>

118
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,768
- Linglong. <br> - Little Six.

119
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,420
Are you okay?

120
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,280
I'm okay.

121
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,927
Over there.

122
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,660
Sifeng!

123
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,643
Sifeng!

124
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,877
Sifeng, please wake up!

125
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:26,475
Sifeng!

126
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,938
Sifeng, you...

127
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,347
Sifeng!

128
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,215
Sifeng!

129
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,279
Sifeng!

130
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,200
Sifeng, are you okay?

131
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:20,762
This...

132
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,342
Sifeng!

133
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,700
Sifeng, are you awake?

134
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,210
Sifeng!

135
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,900
You're finally awake!

136
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,080
Xuanji, are you okay?

137
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,439
Are you hurt anywhere?

138
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,980
Don't worry. I'm fine.

139
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,598
The water flushed us into this valley.

140
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:27,438
That's why Wu Tong wasn't able to pursue us.

141
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,079
That's good.

142
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,559
Don't move.

143
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,860
I'm applying medicine to you.

144
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,816
I've dressed up all your wounds except for this area.

145
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,304
Don't worry. I've checked your body.

146
00:13:43,304 --> 00:13:45,374
There are no other wounds.

147
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,237
Xuanji,

148
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,300
did you see anything else

149
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,120
besides my wounds?

150
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,490
What do you mean?

151
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:01,842
Listen, I need to dress up this wound for you.

152
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,483
That way, you'll heal faster.

153
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,780
Chu Xuanji,

154
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,620
why do you always remove a man's clothes without any care?

155
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,300
You're a lady. It's impolite for you to do so.

156
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,759
I...

157
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,054
But when you did the same thing four years ago,

158
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:36,552
you said we mustn't be shy when it comes to applying medicine.

159
00:14:36,553 --> 00:14:38,913
Remove your clothes now.

160
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,000
You... What exactly are you trying to do?

161
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,700
I want to help you.

162
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,053
No need.

163
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:46,959
I don't need your help.

164
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,200
I'll do it myself.

165
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,860
I'll inspect my wounds over there.

166
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,118
Sifeng, I told you not to move.

167
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:03,460
Your wounds won't be able to heal if you move around.

168
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,409
My mask!

169
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,580
Where's my mask?

170
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,999
Your mask?

171
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,690
You were bleeding underneath your mask.

172
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:23,360
I thought you were seriously injured.

173
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,480
I removed the mask because I was anxious.

174
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,096
You removed it?

175
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,740
Did you really remove it?

176
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Sifeng, did I do something wrong again?

177
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,102
I'm so dumb.

178
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:46,500
I forgot about the rules of your sect. I shouldn't have removed your mask like that.

179
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,020
Don't worry.

180
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,324
It's outside. I'll get it back for you.

181
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:53,117
Xuanji!

182
00:15:54,383 --> 00:15:55,514
I...

183
00:15:55,515 --> 00:15:57,580
Sifeng, what's wrong?

184
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,740
Do you feel uncomfortable?

185
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,529
I'm just happy.

186
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,900
Sifeng! Sifeng!

187
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,179
Sifeng, what's wrong?

188
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,467
Are your wounds hurting again?

189
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:15,382
Sit down now. Slowly.

190
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:18,237
Come.

191
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,500
Sifeng, are you okay?

192
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,280
I'm so happy right now.

193
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,300
Do you know?

194
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,440
I was worried that you couldn't remove the mask.

195
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,394
I thought...

196
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,820
I would have to wait for a long time.

197
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,320
Sifeng, you're not angry?

198
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,340
You wouldn't even let me touch your mask in the past, you know?

199
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,679
- But this time... <br> - Silly girl.

200
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,120
You knew it all along, didn't you?

201
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,428
I didn't mean what I said.

202
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,226
I wished you would look at it and touch it.

203
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,260
I hoped you would remove the mask.

204
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,884
I originally thought that this great fortune

205
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:10,580
would not embrace me this soon.

206
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:15,286
Why is removing the mask sometimes good

207
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:18,330
and sometimes bad to Lize Palace?

208
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:20,909
I don't understand.

209
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:25,420
Silly girl, it's complicated.

210
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,281
You just need to know that

211
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,060
only the person whom the holder treasures the most can remove the mask.

212
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,452
If that person can remove it,

213
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:37,660
the mask will become a smiling mask.

214
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,308
It becomes a blessing and it's a good thing.

215
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:46,120
But if that person can't remove it, it'll be a sad story.

216
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,260
And it'll become a crying mask.

217
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,160
Until...

218
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,660
Until what?

219
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,437
That's not important.

220
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,449
The important thing is...

221
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,880
you've removed the mask.

222
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,554
I know.

223
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,060
I know we're thinking the same thing.

224
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,000
We'll return to Lize Palace

225
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,660
once we leave this place.

226
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,542
We'll meet my master together and give him an explanation.

227
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,220
Will your master punish you again?

228
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,900
I need to return to Lize Palace

229
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,100
and give an explanation no matter what.

230
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,621
Only then...

231
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,660
Only then can I account for you.

232
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,210
After that,

233
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,980
we'll be together forever.

234
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,420
Together forever with you?

235
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:41,020
♫ <i> The flower petal accidentally kissed your shoulder as it fell </i> ♫

236
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,840
♫ <i> It's the sun that always causes problems from nothing </i> ♫

237
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,648
Sifeng,

238
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,940
why did your face change color?

239
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,420
Are you blushing?

240
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,620
I'm not.

241
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,060
You are.

242
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,394
- You are. Look. <br> - I'm not.

243
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:04,199
- You're blushing. <br> - I'm not.

244
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,300
Look at your blushing face.

245
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,759
This is great! I can be with you forever!

246
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,900
Sifeng, you're the best!

247
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,460
- Look! <br> - Stop it.

248
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,361
You're blushing!

249
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:19,061
I'm not.

250
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,861
Xuanji, you said you can see colors now.

251
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,060
Tell me then. What color did you see?

252
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,900
Red color.

253
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,377
You can see colors now?

254
00:20:38,377 --> 00:20:41,977
I saw your face turning red.

255
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,540
Look, it's still red.

256
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,786
Sifeng!

257
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,800
Xuanji, stop it.

258
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,340
Xuanji, can you identify other colors besides red?

259
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,407
Linglong said the wedding dress is red.

260
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:13,931
And eyebrows are black, am I right?

261
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:15,344
Yes.

262
00:21:17,003 --> 00:21:21,507
Sifeng, are your eyebrows the same as what was written in the book?

263
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:24,608
Are they as black as ink?

264
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,439
You're right. They're black.

265
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,600
What's the color of your lips then?

266
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,375
They're red as well.

267
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,594
But why are our lips and the wedding dress different in color?

268
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,339
Both of them are red.

269
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,252
The wedding dress is bright red in color. It's dazzling.

270
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:52,580
Our lips are pinkish-red in color.

271
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,619
They're gentle and elegant.

272
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,540
There are so many different hues to a color?

273
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,799
Sifeng, what color is the land then?

274
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,281
The land is yellow in color.

275
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:10,942
Sifeng, there are so many colors in the world.

276
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:13,683
Which color is the best?

277
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,700
Red. Because women look best when they wear a red wedding dress.

278
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:33,359
Sifeng, did I do the right thing by removing your mask?

279
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,660
Of course.

280
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,549
Since I did something right, shouldn't you grant me a request?

281
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:41,650
No problem.

282
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,611
I'll change your dressing for you then.

283
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,266
It must be painful.

284
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,059
It is.

285
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,481
That's why you need to dress up your wounds.

286
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,802
You won't be in pain after that.

287
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,100
Tell me if it's too painful.

288
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,684
Yanran, are you okay?

289
00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:54,220
I'm fine.

290
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,200
Your mask...

291
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,599
It fell by itself. I have nothing to do with it.

292
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,560
Don't blame me for this.

293
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,859
You should try and patch it together.

294
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,543
Never mind.

295
00:24:10,544 --> 00:24:12,571
The mask has been broken.

296
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:14,812
It won't return to its original state.

297
00:24:15,506 --> 00:24:17,766
I will return and accept my punishment.

298
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,540
I wonder how Sifeng and the rest are doing?

299
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,520
We shouldn't waste any time.

300
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,220
Let's go.

301
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,995
Let's go.

302
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,260
<i>- Did you discover anything? <br> - No.</i>

303
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,979
Stop wasting time here.

304
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:48,339
<i>Our leader asked us to search from the top to the bottom.</i>

305
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:51,140
<i>We must find those cultivators and obtain the Spirit Key.</i>

306
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,530
<i>Yes!</i>

307
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,587
Let's go.

308
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,179
I wonder if Xuanji and the rest are safe?

309
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:19,676
You have the Sound Bell with you, right?

310
00:25:19,676 --> 00:25:21,499
Try and see if you can contact them.

311
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:23,093
You're right.

312
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:28,299
Xuanji, can you hear me?

313
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:30,990
Linglong, how are you doing?

314
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,951
I'm with Minyan. We're fine.

315
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:34,640
Where are you? We'll look for you.

316
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,642
No need. Don't come and find us.

317
00:25:36,643 --> 00:25:39,652
Sifeng and I are at the bottom of a valley.

318
00:25:39,652 --> 00:25:41,979
The undercurrent took us to an unknown location.

319
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:43,537
You don't need to find us.

320
00:25:43,537 --> 00:25:45,561
You should leave Mount Gao now.

321
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:47,105
How could I just leave without you?

322
00:25:47,106 --> 00:25:49,599
Moreover, I don't know the location of Ruo Yu and Yanran.

323
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,708
We don't know where we are, but we're safe.

324
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:53,614
We'll find a way out later.

325
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:57,331
It's dangerous for you to stay there.

326
00:25:57,332 --> 00:25:59,023
You should report to Fuyu Island.

327
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,639
Ruo Yu and Yanran should be fine.

328
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,559
We'll try to contact them after we leave this place.

329
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,675
Okay. You be careful then.

330
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:08,099
<i>The Spirit Key is hidden inside the Destiny Pearl in Xuanji's hand.</i>

331
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,964
<i>You should rush back to Fuyu Island and hand it over to the elders there.</i>

332
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:14,005
See you on Fuyu Island.

333
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:16,919
It's good that they're fine.

334
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,639
I didn't expect the Destiny Pearl to attract demons from Tianxu Hall.

335
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,608
And I didn't expect Wu Tong to be one of them as well.

336
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:27,235
I'm afraid Xuanyuan Sect is gone now.

337
00:26:27,236 --> 00:26:30,183
If it weren't for Mount Gao's complex structure,

338
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:32,142
we would've been gone as well.

339
00:26:32,143 --> 00:26:34,959
Tianxu Hall is far stronger than we thought.

340
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,961
If our sects don't work together against them,

341
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:42,437
they'll become a big threat.

342
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:45,239
Sifeng, are your wounds hurting again?

343
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,459
You were severely wounded. You need some food to recover.

344
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:50,799
Wait for me. I'll find you some food.

345
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,016
Be careful.

346
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:54,980
Don't worry. I have no problem finding food.

347
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,759
Chu Xuanji has the Spirit Key indeed.

348
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,106
We've surrounded the entire mountain, but we couldn't find anyone.

349
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:16,954
I was thinking that you might be hiding here.

350
00:27:16,954 --> 00:27:19,134
I was right.

351
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:22,503
Wu Tong, you gave up on being a human.

352
00:27:22,504 --> 00:27:23,995
You became the lackey of demons instead.

353
00:27:23,995 --> 00:27:25,959
You wretch!

354
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,631
Take them down!

355
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,600
Linglong!

356
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,839
Wretch, you're finally in my hands!

357
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,970
You pervert! Let me go!

358
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,218
You're still as stubborn as ever.

359
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,720
Where's Chu Xuanji?

360
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,735
Minyan!

361
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,239
- Despicable! <br> - I'm despicable?

362
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,999
The Five Great Sects are despicable for trying to hunt me down!

363
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,835
I still have debts to settle with the Five Great Sects.

364
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:36,138
As long as you're in my hand, I'm sure your sister will show up.

365
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,660
Kill him!

366
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,485
Let go of me!

367
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,511
Linglong!

368
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,519
Linglong! Linglong!

369
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,209
<i>Strange. Is this a barrier?</i>

370
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:14,077
<i>I can't cast any spells.</i>

371
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:16,517
<i>I can't leave as well.</i>

372
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,820
The Four Sacred Beasts are here to report the current situation.

373
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,672
King Bailing is not here.

374
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:35,873
Just leave the report here.

375
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,087
It's Flying Snake again.

376
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:58,608
It can't stop creating trouble.

377
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,540
This is too much!

378
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,775
King Bailing only wanted you to keep watch over me so that I would not create trouble.

379
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:19,020
But now, I have something to do in the human realm!

380
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,007
Our king said that if you leave this place, you'll wreak havoc down below.

381
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,361
That's why you won't be able to leave.

382
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,999
It's glowing.

383
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,639
It's glowing!

384
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,040
Look, it's glowing! You know what this is, right?

385
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,840
When the God of War was punished, her sword was sent to the human realm, too.

386
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,079
Her Dingkun Sword is hard to control.

387
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,760
King Bailing had no choice but to seal it away,

388
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,960
and he gave the medallion to me.

389
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,908
That's why I became Lord Flying Snake.

390
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,799
Someone is trying to take the Dingkun Sword!

391
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,020
Let me leave and check that out!

392
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,959
My Lord, you're the guardian of Dingkun Sword. This is not a joke.

393
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,300
- Please stop joking around. <br> - Glow!

394
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,019
Glow now!

395
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:10,306
Hurry up and glow!

396
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:14,835
Lord Flying Snake, if you do this again, I'll call for Lord Green Dragon.

397
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,595
Fine. I won't argue with you.

398
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:24,736
I'll go back to sleep.

399
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:30,560
Listen, I'm not doing this because I'm afraid of that Green Dragon.

400
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,060
- Xuanji! <br> - Sifeng!

401
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,620
- Are you okay?<br> - I'm fine.

402
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,465
The lightning is trying to strike me! Let's go in!

403
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,902
Why would it try to strike you?

404
00:34:20,903 --> 00:34:22,808
I don't know. Seems like there's a barrier around us.

405
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:25,446
We're isolated from the outside world. We can't cast any spells.

406
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:27,626
Look! There are no other living beings here

407
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:28,925
and we can't leave as well.

408
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:30,965
Actually, we don't need to worry.

409
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:33,151
We need to be here for a few days no matter what.

410
00:34:33,152 --> 00:34:35,180
It's the same with or without the barrier.

411
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,018
Think about it. We came out of the pool.

412
00:34:38,018 --> 00:34:42,480
I'll see if we can leave using the same route after my wounds are healed.

413
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,139
We still need to be here for a few days?

414
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,676
It's lucky that I'm smart.

415
00:34:48,676 --> 00:34:50,629
I've gathered many fruits.

416
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,439
We will starve to death without them.

417
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,604
Xuanji, you're the best.

418
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:57,745
I'll wash them for you.

419
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,289
Is it nice?

420
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:13,680
It is.

421
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,800
You should eat more then.

422
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,848
It's delicious.

423
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,609
It's that good?

424
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,479
Sifeng, this is very bitter.

425
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,800
It's not nice at all.

426
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,620
Apricot kernels are bitter naturally.

427
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,400
I'm afraid your tummy has to suffer for a few days.

428
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,183
That will be the saddest thing in life.

429
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:54,069
I figured you would be hungry in the mountains.

430
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,019
I brought a bun.

431
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:57,675
You should eat this.

432
00:35:59,715 --> 00:36:01,995
This will be so delicious.

433
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,100
Sifeng, you should have some as well.

434
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,740
No thanks.

435
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,860
I only eat the buns from Yongfang Court.

436
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,660
You're being particular even when we're in this situation?

437
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,456
I'll rather be particular than to compromise.

438
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:16,192
If I must choose,

439
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:20,420
I would choose wild fruits over buns that are not from Yongfang Court.

440
00:36:20,908 --> 00:36:23,588
Do you know what I feel like eating now?

441
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:25,768
Osmanthus cake with lotus seed from Liufengzhai.

442
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,499
It's sweet, delicious, and fragrant.

443
00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:31,035
This is the cake.

444
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,688
Delicious.

445
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:41,848
This will be the most delicious Peach Chicken from my house then.

446
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:44,189
The Eight Treasure Duck from Guangyun Court.

447
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,438
Roasted deer.

448
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:48,780
The beef noodles in Kelaiju Inn are great as well.

449
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,260
With so many delicious dishes, and with some Drunken Dragon from Liuxianlou.

450
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,607
Cheers!

451
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,580
- This is so delicious! <br> - Eat this then.

452
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,415
I won't eat that. I'll leave it for you.

453
00:37:07,415 --> 00:37:08,953
I'll eat this.

454
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,429
Sifeng.

455
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,480
Cover yourself.

456
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,120
Let's sleep together.

457
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,000
You're really testing me all the time.

458
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,040
I'm not a saint.

459
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,839
Do you know how happy I was when I knew that

460
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,220
you could remove my mask?

461
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,440
If you continue this,

462
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,600
I won't be able to stand it anymore.

463
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,880
I know now.

464
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,600
I know you can pass your message to other people with this.

465
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,841
Is this the thing you use to contact Chu Xuanji?

466
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,891
Seems like it is.

467
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,432
How do you use this?

468
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:47,333
Ask Chu Xuanji to hand over the Spirit Key right now.

469
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,319
No way.

470
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,843
Wretch, how dare you reject me!

471
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:56,284
You're in my hands.

472
00:39:56,284 --> 00:39:58,513
If you don't follow my orders,

473
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:01,359
I have more than a thousand ways to deal with you.

474
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,600
I will let you suffer so much that you will wish you were dead.

475
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:07,959
I will make you suffer until you follow my orders.

476
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,580
Do you want to try it now?

477
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:15,400
You better listen to me right now.

478
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,020
I hate lackeys like you the most!

479
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,905
I hate it even more when I'm threatened by a lackey!

480
00:40:51,906 --> 00:40:54,926
You'll never get the Spirit Key!

481
00:40:54,926 --> 00:40:57,107
Young Lady, you're overestimating yourself.

482
00:40:57,107 --> 00:40:59,219
The Tianxu Hall has countless demons inside.

483
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:02,381
Do you think I can only obtain the Spirit Key by holding you as a hostage?

484
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:04,568
I'm just teasing you.

485
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:08,849
It's more interesting when you don't listen to me.

486
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:11,159
We've been missing our marks lately.

487
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:13,620
- What should we do? <br> - This mustn't continue on.

488
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,048
- Let's walk around. <br> - Yes.

489
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,216
Why is there a person here?

490
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,335
- Let's have a look. <br> - Let's go!

491
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,992
So beautiful!

492
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,684
Sifeng, what color is this?

493
00:41:54,684 --> 00:41:57,176
The hydrangea is blue.

494
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,683
This is blue?

495
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,140
It's nice.

496
00:42:01,141 --> 00:42:03,305
My favorite color is blue!

497
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:07,066
You have decided to like the color blue?

498
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,804
I liked it since I was young.

499
00:42:08,805 --> 00:42:12,605
I'll bring it with me and I'll show it to Linglong and Sixth Senior.

500
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,359
Xuanji, let's check if there's an exit over there.

501
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,620
- Okay. <br> - Let's go.

502
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,640
This is strange.

503
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,184
We were washed ashore by the same pool.

504
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:44,344
But now, we can't even touch the water.

505
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,778
We've been stuck here for some days.

506
00:42:53,778 --> 00:42:55,959
We couldn't contact Linglong and Minyan as well.

507
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,892
What should we do?

508
00:43:00,192 --> 00:43:02,639
We should try and seek another exit.

509
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,539
I think something is hidden in here.

510
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,879
That'll explain the barrier.

511
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,840
I'm sure the barrier has a weakness.

512
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,200
Xuanji, where's my mask?

513
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,343
The mask? Didn't you say you don't need it anymore?

514
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:22,724
We still need to find it?

515
00:43:22,724 --> 00:43:26,263
I need to bring it back in order to give my master an explanation.

516
00:43:26,263 --> 00:43:28,784
Maybe, it could even help us out.

517
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,719
The mask is made from the bark of the Undying Tree.

518
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,361
It's filled with spiritual energy.

519
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,702
Maybe it can help us break through the barrier.

520
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,199
Sifeng, didn't you say the mask will become a smiling mask after it was removed?

521
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:53,781
Why is it crying?

522
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:06,010
