Sifeng!

21
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,919
Sifeng, don't leave!

22
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:03,459
I was heartless and careless in the past. I know I hurt you.

23
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,874
It's my fault.

24
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,703
But...

25
00:02:06,703 --> 00:02:09,099
But, Sifeng, you mustn't leave me like this!

26

You can teach me or reprimand me.

27

But please don't leave me, okay?

28
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,620
I've recovered my six senses now.

During all my nine tribulations,

there's one person who told me that

she would remember me every single time.

In the end? It was only my wishful thinking.

35
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:49,821
Sifeng, I don't remember anything about our previous nine lives.

But... I just wanted the ferryman to bring me some lotus seed pods.

I'm just here to pick them up.

59

It's too late for you to regret.

00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:36,670
Sifeng, you became naughty.

61
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,549
Xuanji, I told you that

62
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,599
I'll teach you how to fall in love with me.

63

Of course, I'm happy for them.

84
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,539
It's just that love fades away when destiny gets to its end.

85
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,099
It's an unpredictable road.

86

When destiny gets to its end?

87
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,139
Tell me... Do you think our fates are predetermined?

88
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,363
Why are you asking this suddenly?

89
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,660
I'm worried about Linglong.

90
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,340
If our fates are really predetermined,

91
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,069
I'm really scared of the fact that

92
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:49,480
we weren't predestined to be together.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,714
That's why I wanted to find some clues within the mirror shards.

94
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,044
But there's no clue at all.

95
00:06:57,044 --> 00:07:00,339
The shards only contain fragments of the past.

96
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:03,059
Our current lives have nothing to do with it.

97
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:05,870
Minyan, Linglong and you are childhood friends.

98
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,413
Many people are envious of that fact.

99
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:11,059
Now, we've found Ting Nu.

100
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:12,784
We will reach Mount Buzhou soon.

101
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:14,939
And everyone will save Linglong together.

102
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,620
You should think about how you're going to treat her when she returns.

103
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,003
I didn't expect you to be this good at consolations.

104
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:24,290
I'm not trying to console you.

105
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,395
I believe that it will happen.

106
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:28,934
If you want to talk about consolations,

107
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:31,558
Ruo Xue is the best.

108
00:07:31,558 --> 00:07:33,397
Ruo Xue?

109
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,461
Ruo Xue is my younger sister. We are orphans.

110
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,848
She's a very obedient girl.

111
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:45,998
No matter how much she suffers outside,

112
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,321
she'll always say it's fine

113
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:51,111
when she returns home.

114
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:53,104
You've never mentioned her before.

115
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:56,055
Where's your sister?

116
00:07:57,555 --> 00:08:00,443
We can't see each other often.

117
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:04,550
It's all because I didn't fulfill my responsibility as her brother.

118
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,885
Minyan, you can eat them.

119
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,780
Why are you hiding in here?

120
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,219
<i>I want to hide in here.</i>

121

What's wrong?

123
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,212
Are you angry at Sifeng again?

124
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,105
<i>My master is so dumb!</i>

125
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:52,873
<i>He didn't learn his lesson at all.</i>

126
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:54,859
<i>He was so disappointed in her,</i>

127
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:58,899

128
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:02,379
<i>But he doesn't want to listen to me at all.</i>

129
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:05,470
<i>He doesn't even want to look at me.</i>

130

You.

131
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:09,990
You're a dummy, too.

Miss. Mister. Today is the Qixi Festival.

You two are a perfect match.

135

You two mustn't miss out on them when you're on the Magpie Bridge.

Sure. Make one for us.

Let me pay for them.

Sure. Anything you say.

Okay. Please wait.

00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,530
Excuse me. Your figurines are ready. You two can make your wishes now.

159
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:13,858
Let's go.

160
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,790
♫ <i> In the end, we're unable to escape from our fate </i> ♫

♫ <i> The expressions concealed under the mask </i> ♫

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,380

163

165

♫ <i> Unseal all the memories that are buried in dust in your heart </i> ♫

♫ <i> Retrieve the beauty that are colorless in your eyes </i> ♫

♫ <i> Unseal all the memories that are buried in dust in your heart </i> ♫

170

172
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,520
♫ <i> Love as colored glass&nbsp; </i> ♫

173
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,479
Little Phoenix, have you thought this through?

174
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:52,890
You want to fall at the same spot for the tenth time?

175
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,546
Eldest Brother Liu, can't you be more optimistic?

176
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:59,699
Maybe I won't fall this time.

177
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:02,620
The past is the past.

178
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,659
They're not me, I'm not them.

179
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,879
They only know how to tolerate and wait.

180
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,453
I won't let Xuanji wait until the last second before I tell her

181
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,670
how much I care about her.

182
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,070
Now, you're much better at flirting than me.

183
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,579
But don't forget, the person you love isn't ordinary.

184
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:26,935
She's the God of War.

185
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,933
Xuanji is Xuanji.

186
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:36,223
She's not the God of War in this life.

187
00:13:39,747 --> 00:13:41,819
Why are you lying to yourself?

188
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:45,059
Xuanji encountered the Dingkun Sword and the Mirror of Origin.

189
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,699
It's fated that she won't stay as someone ordinary.

190
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:50,859
She'll become the God of War sooner or later.

191
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:53,939
What will you do if she does become the God of War one day?

192
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:56,145
Eldest Brother Liu, that's enough. Stop talking about that.

193
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:58,514
This isn't my matter alone.

194
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,441
I will definitely lead a peaceful life with Xuanji.

195
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,752
That's for the best.

196
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:14,830
I used the celestial eye, yet I can't see the future of you two.

197
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,434
You better be careful.

198
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,619
I thought Purple Fox's primordial spirit

199
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:49,363
had returned to her body as well, but I was wrong.

200
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,447
Look.

201
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,019
- This shard... <br> - Her primordial spirit is still inside.

202
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,899
Sifeng and I had returned to our bodies.

203
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,424
Why is she still trapped within?

204
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:03,615
I'm afraid she's not trapped.

205
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,852
She just doesn't want to recognize reality.

206
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:10,872
If this continues, she'll forget about reality.

207
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:15,019
Her primordial spirit will dissipate, and she'll never wake up.

208
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,345
- How do we save her? <br> - There's only one way.

209
00:15:17,345 --> 00:15:20,786
Either you or Sifeng has to enter the mirror again.

210
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,378
You two went in there before. You won't be fooled by it.

211
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:25,258
Only you two can save her.

212
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,459
No. This is too dangerous.

213
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,039
Sixth Senior, Purple Fox is following us to Mount Buzhou.

214
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,499
I can't just abandon her.

215
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,699
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

216
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:36,859
Ting Nu, let me in.

217
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,984
Xuanji, let's go in together.

218
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:42,125
Sifeng.

219
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,553
Did you forget that you said you were going to depend on me?

220
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,439
<i>Wu Zhiqi, you spend your days drinking in this remote place.</i>

221
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:22,233
<i>Isn't it a waste of your abilities?</i>

222
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:25,893
<i>Why don't you come with me and assist the King of Asura in invading the heavenly realm?</i>

223
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:30,479
<i>It's glorious for us demons to conquer the three realms, isn't it?</i>

224
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,579
<i>Yuan Lang, you said you were going to have a drink with me today.</i>

225
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:36,152
<i>Yet you didn't drink at all.</i>

226
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:38,243
<i>Aren't you too petty?</i>

227
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,230
<i>Little Fox, bring me some wine.</i>

228
00:16:56,194 --> 00:16:59,106
This is Purple Fox in the past.

229
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:01,839
That man who's drinking is Wu Zhiqi.

230
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,880
- Who's Yuan Lang then? <br> - I think it's his friend.

231
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,535
<i>Yuan Lang, let's drink.</i>

232
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,446
<i>Why don't you consider my proposal regarding the war?</i>

233
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:20,498
<i>Come to the Demon Citadel if you have thought it through.</i>

234
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:24,300
<i>We'll fight together with the Devil Star, Demon Maleficent Star.</i>

235
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,169
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

236
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,857
<i>Wu Zhiqi, don't listen to that villain.</i>

237
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:41,758
<i>You're not allowed to join the war.</i>

238
00:17:41,758 --> 00:17:45,299
<i>I don't like violence,</i>

239
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,132
<i>but there's nothing here, not even a pretty lady.</i>

240
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,572
<i>I'm so bored.</i>

241
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:52,759
<i>Are you blind?</i>

242
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,579
<i>Aren't I a beauty?</i>

243
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:56,419
<i>I've trained for so long for your sake,</i>

244
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:58,199
<i>and I finally acquired a human form.</i>

245
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,125
<i>I managed to transform into the look you like.</i>

246
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:02,740
<i>Isn't this enough?</i>

247
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,259
<i>Little Fox,</i>

248
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:07,966
<i>have you never seen yourself in the mirror after you acquired your form?</i>

249
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:09,559
<i>Here.</i>

250
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,301
<i>Take a good look. You're ugly.</i>

251
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,939
<i>I've asked other people about this.</i>

252
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:21,730
<i>Everyone said that I am a beauty.</i>

253
00:18:22,713 --> 00:18:25,003
<i>Why are you so heartless?</i>

254
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,019
<i>Can't you even praise me once?</i>

255
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:30,419
<i>I hate praising people the most.</i>

256
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,899
<i>Moreover, you want me to praise an ugly demon like you?</i>

257
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:35,459
<i>No way in hell.</i>

258
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:37,265
<i>Either you transform into your original appearance,</i>

259
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:40,420
<i>or you get out of my sight.</i>

260
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,970
<i>Are you saying that you'll ask me to leave</i>

261
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,512
<i>if I don't return to my fox form?</i>

262
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,018
<i>Yes. The further you are, the better.</i>

263
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:54,309
<i>I don't want to see you again.</i>

264
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:58,112
<i>You're so noisy and annoying.</i>

265
00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:00,460
<i>It's much better without you around.</i>

266
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,300
<i>Are you serious about that?</i>

267
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,971
<i>Fine.</i>

268
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,745
<i>I'll leave.</i>

269
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:21,278
<i>I'll never return once I leave.</i>

270
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,800
<i>You better not regret it.</i>

271

♫ <i> If you are not the one I'm meant to be with </i> ♫

00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:06,998
Is that phantom Purple Fox?

281
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,646
Yes.

282
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:10,711
Don't leave Wu Zhiqi.

283
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:14,330
You'll never be able to see him again if you leave.

284
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,279
Don't leave him!

285
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,225
Return to his side right now!

286
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:21,180
He's just trying to make you angry.

287
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,431
Don't leave this place!

288
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,399
<i>She's gone?</i>

289
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,466
<i>That's good.</i>

290
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:15,956
<i>I have nothing to worry about now.</i>

291
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,760
Wu Zhiqi!

292
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,451
Wu Zhiqi, don't leave yet!

293
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:41,865
Wait for her.

294
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:46,516
The little fox is just throwing a tantrum.

295
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:48,536
She'll return to you!

296
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:50,239
30 minutes.

297
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,906
No, she'll return to you within 15 minutes.

298
00:21:53,907 --> 00:21:59,852
- Just wait for her. Please wait for her! <br> <i>- Flirting with each other, more than once.</i>

299
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:03,559
<i>- With a fateful promise,</i> <br> - She'll return for sure!

300
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,959
<i>- it lasts an eternity.</i> <br> - I beg you!

301
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,738
- Please wait for her! <br> <i>- It's hard for us to meet,</i>

302
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:13,320
<i>but everything is not working out.</i>

303
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,264
<i>How do we reunite?</i>

304
00:22:15,265 --> 00:22:16,830
I beg you!

305
00:22:19,954 --> 00:22:23,359
<i>- Time to leave!</i> <br> - I beg you! Don't leave!

306
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:29,066
Let's try this again. Let's try this again.

307
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:32,242
I'm sure it will work this time!

308
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,185
She's using her primordial spirit in order to reverse time.

309
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:44,236
If this continues, she'll disappear.

310
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,238
Purple Fox, that's enough. You should return with us.

311
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:53,769
Go away!

312
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:59,077
Purple Fox, your primordial spirit will be gone if you continue this.

313
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,759
- Go away! <br> - Just ignore me!

314
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,933
I don't need your concern!

315
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,722
Wu Zhiqi!

316
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:26,432
Purple Fox, I saw my past in the mirror as well.

317
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:29,666
That's why I understand what you're going through.

318
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:32,533
But the answer you're looking for is in the real world.

319
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:37,216
If you trap yourself here, you'll only be more frustrated.

320
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,993
Let's leave together, okay?

321
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:44,420
We'll find Wu Zhiqi together.

322
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,410
♫ <i> My hair turns white from yearning, <br>hope as little as dropping off the clif </i> ♫

323
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:56,130
♫ <i> My prayers withered as flowers at the end of the show, <br> let fate incite this mortal love affair yet firmly suppressing it </i> ♫

324
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,960
♫ <i> The tribulation in this life, how to resolve it, <br> allowing memories to leave scars </i> ♫

325
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,433
I... I'm so dumb!

326
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:04,340
I'm so dumb!

327
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:12,760
♫ <i> I have no regrets as you have bound me to you </i> ♫

328
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,846
Purple Fox!

329
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,880
This is great. You're finally awake.

330
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,399
You saw my most embarrassing moments.

331
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,817
It's fine.

332
00:24:39,818 --> 00:24:42,910
You'll be a beauty no matter what you do.

333
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,565
Xuanji, you promised me that you'll help me save Wu Zhiqi

334
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:50,336
when we were inside the mirror,

335
00:24:50,336 --> 00:24:52,069
am I right?

336
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,200
I promise.

337
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,759
Xuanji, don't promise that yet.

338
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,712
You're a cultivator. Your role is to slay demons.

339
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:04,039
Wu Zhiqi is the Left Lieutenant of the demon tribe.

340
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,479
And you still want to find him? That's impossible.

341
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,748
Sixth Senior, I've already promised Purple Fox.

342
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:12,765
And although I don't know Wu Zhiqi personally,

343
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:15,784
he has been locked up for 1,000 years for what he has done.

344
00:25:15,784 --> 00:25:17,691
I think that's more than enough.

345
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:19,502
So what if you find him?

346
00:25:19,502 --> 00:25:22,319
1,000 years ago, Wu Zhiqi left without a care.

347
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,069
What makes you think that you can keep him by your side?

348
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:28,480
I must go.

349
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,351
I told you before.

350
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:33,342
I will surely save Wu Zhiqi.

351
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,809
If I can't save him,

352
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:37,839
I'll stay there and accompany him.

353
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,635
I'll accompany him no matter how long it takes.

354
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,440
I want him to know that

355
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,719
I'm the only person good to him in this world,

356
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:53,269
and I will always stay beside him.

357
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:56,808
You're not the naive demon I knew anymore.

358
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,519
Fine. I won't try to persuade you again.

359
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,204
But you must remember this.

360
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:05,175
You need to deal with the consequences.

361
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,759
Sifeng, please persuade Xuanji.

362
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,669
We've promised Purple Fox that we'll go to Mount Buzhou together.

363
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:14,526
And she helped us to find Ting Nu.

364
00:26:14,526 --> 00:26:17,797
That's why we must keep our promise.

365
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,611
Fine.

366
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:24,882
Since you are so insistent, my words are useless.

367
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:26,881
Let's do this together then.

368
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,720
Oh right! Ting Nu,

369
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,090
tell us how to enter Mount Buzhou.

370
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,785
Mount Buzhou is not in the human realm.

371
00:26:40,786 --> 00:26:43,599
We need to prepare ourselves before we enter the mountain.

372
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,862
Let me make some preparations. You will depart tomorrow.

373
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,701
Eldest Brother Liu.

374
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,652
Little Phoenix, you're generous indeed.

375
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:06,239
You even gave her your precious hairpin.

376
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,749
I traded my future for it, you know?

377
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:11,910
Xuanji is right. It's a great deal for me.

378
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,850
My goodness. What smell is this?

379
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,479
I know now. It's the foul stench of love.

380
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:22,199
- It stinks. <br> - What? Can't we do this?

381
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,968
Just go.

382
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,298
Let's go.

383
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,602
You're leaving when it's this late?

384
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,318
Why aren't you asleep yet?

385
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:08,909
I'm preparing for Mount Buzhou.

386
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:12,630
But I still don't understand one thing.

387
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,002
What?

388
00:28:15,002 --> 00:28:18,325
Tianxu Hall planned this out because they want to awaken the power of the God of War.

389
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:22,845
But how could they be sure that Xuanji would fall for it?

390
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:27,676
Don't tell me they knew that Xuanji would meet with the celestial eye's bearer?

391
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,399
Who knows what those scoundrels are planning?

392
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,230
Maybe they used it to their advantage because Little Phoenix found me.

393
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,724
No.

394
00:28:42,724 --> 00:28:45,219
I can't sleep.

395
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:48,109
I need some wine.

396
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,216
Mr. Liu, you're late.

397
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,579
I haven't got the chance to strike.

398
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:05,655
Please ask your leader to give me more time.

399
00:29:05,655 --> 00:29:07,659
I will awaken the powers of the God of War.

400
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:12,285
Mr. Liu, our leader knows what happened inside the manor.

401
00:29:12,285 --> 00:29:17,976
You used the celestial eye to stop her awakening.

402
00:29:17,976 --> 00:29:20,299
I was forced to do so.

403
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:22,019
You were forced to do so?

404
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:24,637
Mr. Liu, you lied to us.

405
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,425
It makes perfect sense for us to show you some colors.

406
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:30,197
But our leader is magnanimous. He's giving you a second chance.

407
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:34,099
You'll never see your daughter if you mess this up again.

408
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:36,319
Fine. Tell me.

409
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,011
What do you want me to do?

410
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:42,298
Kill Yu Sifeng and enrage Chu Xuanji,

411
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:46,069
so that you may awaken her powers.

412
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,385
No way.

413
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:51,156
I will never hurt Little Phoenix.

414
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:54,852
Do you think you have the right to negotiate with us?

415
00:29:54,852 --> 00:29:57,292
You better not be too much!

416
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,058
You just used the celestial eye. You're weak and feeble.

417
00:30:04,058 --> 00:30:06,608
Do you want your daughter to die?

418
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,559
- Who are you? <br> - I'm a friend of Mr. Liu.

419
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,555
If you don't believe me, you can ask him.

420
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,370
He's...

421
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,055
He's from Tianxu Hall.

422
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,570
Liu Yihuan, why are you meeting someone from Tianxu Hall?

423
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,798
Everyone, I'm sorry.

424
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,915
He's from Tianxu Hall? Tell Wu Tong to meet me.

425
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:52,631
I only follow my leader's order. I don't know any Wu Tong,

426
00:30:52,632 --> 00:30:54,453
God of War.

427
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:57,396
- You know her identity? <br> - I know many things.

428
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:01,630
Since the God of War is here, I'll capture you for my leader!

429
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,734
Be careful! That's Xuanyin Chain!

430
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,638
Xuanji, are you okay?

431
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,199
You old fox, how dare you betray us!

432
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,239
How dare you join hands with them!

433
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,704
Who's the old fox here?

434
00:31:20,705 --> 00:31:22,507
You're the old fox!

435
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:25,410
I betrayed Tianxu Hall? I was never with Tianxu Hall.

436
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,139
You stole my beloved and ruined Mount Gao, and you call me old?

437
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:30,151
You're old!

438
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,550
He's dead?

439
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,265
- So, it's a fish. <br> - He's dead?

440
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,249
So weak.

441
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,290
So, you're the God of War?

442
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:54,036
You're not that beautiful.

443
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,737
Enough. We mustn't stay around.

444
00:31:57,738 --> 00:31:59,846
Let's speak after we return.

445
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,968
So, you were the one behind everything.

446
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,130
Everyone, I'm sorry.

447
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,244
But I couldn't just ignore Yu'er.

448
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,060
I've harmed you.

449
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,159
Eldest Brother Liu was forced to do so.

450
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,027
Besides, I managed to recover my six senses

451
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:32,446
because he gave us the Mirror of Origin.

452
00:32:32,446 --> 00:32:35,279
He even used his celestial eye to save Sifeng.

453
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,550
No matter what, he did help us out.

454
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,119
Eldest Brother Liu, you don't need to blame yourself.

455
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,352
I just didn't expect Tianxu Hall to know that Xuanji was the God of War.

456
00:32:47,353 --> 00:32:53,026
And they did all this because they want her to regain her powers.

457
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:54,219
Oh right!

458
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:56,959
Didn't you say that the nemesis of the Devil Star is the God of War?

459
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,519
But why are they trying to let Xuanji regain her powers?

460
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,080
The only logical explanation is that the God of War's power

461
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,454
is vital to the Devil Star's revival.

462
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,200
It's a pity that I only got to see the God of War

463
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,732
when I was treating her wound.

464
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:16,259
I know almost nothing about her.

465
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,325
One part of the God of War's memories will always be blurry.

466
00:33:20,326 --> 00:33:23,396
My guess is that the heavens sealed away that part.

467
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:24,991
Maybe not.

468
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,363
The heavens love to kick up a cloud of dust.

469
00:33:27,363 --> 00:33:30,879
They said the God of War was a gorgeous beauty.

470
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,862
- But just look at Xuanji. <br> - I...

471
00:33:32,862 --> 00:33:35,137
So, maybe

472
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,391
they didn't seal her memories at all.

473
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:41,302
Purple Fox, seems like you don't like the God of War.

474
00:33:41,303 --> 00:33:43,719
She hates the God of War because

475
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,471
rumor has it that Wu Zhiqi was captured by the heavens

476
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:49,411
because he fell in love with her.

477
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:52,119
Wu Zhiqi doesn't love her!

478
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,750
Wu Zhiqi was framed by the devious Yuan Lang.

479
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,739
Who's Yuan Lang?

480
00:33:58,739 --> 00:34:01,019
I think I saw him in your memories.

481
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:03,370
Yuan Lang is scum.

482
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,325
1,000 years ago, the demons lost the war.

483
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:10,830
He was the reason Wu Zhiqi was captured by the heavens.

484
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,898
Yuan Lang thought he could escape punishment by doing that.

485
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:18,208
That poor monkey doesn't even know who the one responsible was.

486
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:22,157
It's a pity that Yuan Lang is too cunning and devious.

487
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:25,365
I couldn't find him even after 1,000 years.

488
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:29,659
Maybe he's hiding in Tianxu Hall?

489
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,154
Impossible.

490
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:33,915
He was marked with a sinner's mark.

491
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,855
He can never enter Mount Buzhou.

492
00:34:35,855 --> 00:34:40,439
If he is hiding inside Mount Buzhou, I'd tear him to pieces.

493
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,978
Mount Buzhou?

494
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,619
Tianxu Hall's headquarters is in Mount Buzhou!

495
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,330
I finally know where Yu'er is right now!

496
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,759
Linglong's primordial spirit, Yu'er,

497
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,113
the captured Wu Zhiqi, secrets of Tianxu Hall,

498
00:34:57,113 --> 00:35:00,650
all questions will be answered in Mount Buzhou.

499
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,663
We just killed Tianxu Hall's messenger.

500
00:35:02,663 --> 00:35:04,771
They'll notice soon.

501
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:07,942
You should depart tomorrow morning.

502
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,787
Oh right, Ting Nu. You should tell us

503
00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:15,456
how to reach the entrance of Mount Buzhou.

504
00:35:15,456 --> 00:35:18,445
In the west, there's a town called Qingmu Town.

505
00:35:18,445 --> 00:35:20,239
It's at the base of Mount Buzhou.

506
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,940
Find two mountains with the same altitude from the North and South.

507
00:35:23,941 --> 00:35:27,931
The altar to Mount Buzhou is located at the peak of the northern mountain.

508
00:35:27,931 --> 00:35:29,302
Okay.

509
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,326
These Birth Candles were made from

510
00:35:33,326 --> 00:35:35,912
Merman's Tears, Dragon Scales, and Sansheng Wood.

511
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:38,605
I only made five of them as the ingredients are very rare.

512
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:40,505
Mount Buzhou is not located in the human realm.

513
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:45,289
You can enter Mount Buzhou if you light this candle.

514
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,512
Purple Fox, didn't you grow up in Mount Buzhou?

515
00:35:51,512 --> 00:35:53,159
Do you need the Birth Candle as well?

516
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,925
I've retained my human form for 1,000 years.

517
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:59,011
Of course, I need the candle if I want to enter Mount Buzhou.

518
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:01,312
There's nothing strange about this.

519
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,526
We only have five.

520
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,618
Where's mine? I need to go there to save Yu'er!

521
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,439
I told you. The ingredients were very rare,

522
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:20,299
and Mount Buzhou is a dangerous place.

523
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:22,119
You're injured. You mustn't go.

524
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:24,357
I need to save Yu'er no matter how dangerous it is!

525
00:36:24,357 --> 00:36:26,083
I–

526
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,118
Eldest Brother Liu, this will be a dangerous trip,

527
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,679
and you're seriously injured. If you insist on going there,

528
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,359
you'll be a burden to everyone.

529
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,830
Don't worry. I'll save Yu'er.

530
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,667
I can't even help during crucial moments like these.

531
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:46,826
I'm really useless.

532
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,686
Sifeng,

533
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,394
I'll leave Yu'er to you.

534
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:59,543
You must save her, okay?

535
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:02,128
Don't worry.

536
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,603
I was marked with the sinner's mark as well.

537
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:10,081
I can't enter Mount Buzhou.

538
00:37:10,082 --> 00:37:13,071
Hero Liu and I will hide once you depart tomorrow

539
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:14,419
so that Tianxu Hall can't find us.

540
00:37:14,419 --> 00:37:17,710
When you return, I'll find a way to contact you.

541
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,239
You must wear these bracelets, too.

542
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,596
The bracelet will show you the duration of the candle.

543
00:37:25,596 --> 00:37:29,620
You must leave that place before the candle is used up.

544
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,290
We understand. You're so naggy.

545
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,804
<i>There are signs of spells used by the Shaoyang Sect.</i>

546
00:37:57,805 --> 00:38:00,289
<i>Xuanji and the rest were here indeed.</i>

547
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:11,769
<i>Although the Mirror of Origin was shattered, I'm still too late.</i>

548
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,482
<i>Xuanji, will I fail to stop you again?</i>

549
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,177
Why are we stopping here? Have we arrived at our destination?

550
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,918
You are country bumpkins indeed.

551
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:38,563
Mount Buzhou is a forbidden ground.

552
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:42,399
If you use powers to enter the place, the mountain god will punish you.

553
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,950
That's why we need to travel on foot.

554
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,770
Come. Over here.

555
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,264
You can't suppress her forever.

556
00:39:02,264 --> 00:39:04,531
The God of War will awaken soon.

557
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:07,922
King Bailing needs to fret over her again.

558
00:39:26,372 --> 00:39:28,800
My Lord, what are you looking for?

559
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,159
Tales of the Three Realms.

560
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:33,740
Are you talking about this book?

561
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,449
Yes!

562
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,040
You can see me?

563
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,764
Of course I can.

564
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:48,477
The Siming Hall is the place where fate converges.

565
00:39:48,477 --> 00:39:51,422
Your spell of deceit won't work here.

566
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,299
I haven't finished writing it yet.

567
00:39:54,299 --> 00:39:56,050
If you want to read it,

568
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:00,026
you'll have to wait until I'm almost done with it.

569
00:40:00,026 --> 00:40:01,359
Give it to me!

570
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,162
Why are you stealing it from me?

571
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,524
That's all?

572
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:14,079
Where are the stories of the God of War?

573
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,679
I told you I haven't finished writing.

574
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,477
I'm still in the conceptual phase.

575
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:19,908
Conceptual phase?

576
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,290
That means you have the stories inside your head, right?

577
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,219
Tell me about it!

578
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:28,979
Her armor can disappear and re-appear at will.

579
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:30,951
Tell me the reason I can't find her!

580
00:40:30,951 --> 00:40:34,201
Teng She, there are so many immortals here.

581
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:38,880
Of all the immortals, why are you trying to fight with the God of War?

582
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,281
Although there are many immortals here,

583
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:44,416
none of them can defeat me.

584
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,499
- Will you tell me or not? <br> - No.

585
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:54,730
You won't? Fine.

586
00:40:55,326 --> 00:41:00,036
Do you believe that I'll burn this book?

587
00:41:00,036 --> 00:41:02,939
- You dare to do so? <br> - Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

588
00:41:02,939 --> 00:41:05,199
- You! Don't do it! <br> - Tell me!

589
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,619
Don't burn it!

590
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:09,967
I'll tell you everything!

591
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,771
My Lord, please calm down!

592
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:14,300
Put it down!

593
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,750
Extinguish it.

594
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,799
In dramas, there are always a male lead and a female lead.

595
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:25,479
It's the same for my story.

596
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,041
Nine hundred years ago, during the wedding of the God of Gold,

597
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:33,140
the God of War caught the bouquet which King Bailing tossed.

598
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,425
She believed that King Bailing would marry her,

599
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:38,918
and she even picked a Love Flower for him.

600
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,707
<i>It's my fault for letting you go.</i>

601
00:41:57,707 --> 00:41:59,985
<i>I didn't detect your feelings for me.</i>

602
00:41:59,986 --> 00:42:02,596
<i>That's why I'm in this plight.</i>

603
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:07,280
<i>I'm sure there's a way for me to redeem myself.</i>

604
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,959
What?

605
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,750
The God of War and King Bailing?

606
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:17,680
You mean that cold King Bailing who puts on a long face every day?

607
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,058
He even gave her a Love Flower?

608
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,810
Is this your own story?

609
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,279
Are you listening or not?

610
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,620
Stop asking me, if you're not.

611
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,551
Fine. I'll listen.

612
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:33,964
If the God of War and King Bailing do fancy each other,

613
00:42:33,964 --> 00:42:36,165
why were they separated then?

614
00:42:36,165 --> 00:42:40,024
After the war between immortals and demons ended, the world was devastated.

615
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,405
We needed the strength of the Southern immortals

616
00:42:42,405 --> 00:42:44,519
in order to restabilize the heavens.

617
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,083
That's why King Bailing married the daughter of the Southern Lord.

618
00:42:48,084 --> 00:42:51,900
King Bailing had no choice but to marry the princess of the South.

619
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,765
But the God of War was enraged when she knew about that.

620
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:58,653
After that, she became eccentric.

621
00:42:58,653 --> 00:43:02,431
Besides speaking to the Crimson Birds by the Heavenly Pond,

622
00:43:02,432 --> 00:43:04,442
she has never spoken with anyone else.

623
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,759
- After that? <br> - After that...

624
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,639
One day,

625
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:12,020
Wu Zhiqi, the Left Lieutenant,

626
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,100
stole the Juntian Hoop and Chehai Hook.

627
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,939
And the God of War broke into the Demon Citadel in search of him.

628
00:43:17,939 --> 00:43:20,733
But when she returned, she was possessed by anguish.

629
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:22,884
Thus, she began to have inner demons.

630
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,019
Guess what's next?

631
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,506
She went to the Southern immortals and slew the Southern Lord.

632
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,470
How did she fight? Was she strong?

633
00:43:32,471 --> 00:43:33,759
And it became a huge problem.

634
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,888
After that, Queen Bailing forced King Bailing

635
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:40,219
to execute the God of War in order to avenge her father.

636
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:43,499
The Heavenly Court was in turmoil then.

637
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:47,985
But at the same moment, King Bailing wanted to protect the God of War.

638
00:43:47,985 --> 00:43:51,716
He went to the Altar of Banishment to persuade the God of War.

639
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,268
The Heavenly Emperor gave her one last chance since she had made huge contributions.

640
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:59,127
She'll be able to return here if she goes through ten tribulations.

641
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:02,359
I told King Bailing about the God of War's nine tribulations before.

642
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,470
But he threw a tantrum and said that it's none of his concern.

643
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,320
Actually, I know that he couldn't bear to give up on her.

644
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,877
Their relationship is very complicated.

645
00:44:10,877 --> 00:44:14,477
Our king has to face his tribulation this time.

646
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,039
- Is that all? <br> - Yes.

647
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,624
I've been speaking for a long time, you know?

648
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:29,399
I asked you how strong she was!

649
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,298
Why did you tell me her entire love story?

650
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:34,498
Violence isn't an interesting topic.

651
00:44:34,498 --> 00:44:36,480
Love.

652
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,848
Love is the essence of the Tales of the Three Realms.

653
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,945
I don't believe it.

654
00:44:43,946 --> 00:44:46,549
The God of War is a great general.

655
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:50,705
She won't rebel against us just because of something like this.

656
00:44:50,706 --> 00:44:52,799
I'm sure there's another reason behind it.

657
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,159
You made up this story.

658
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,289
Story writers like you love to make up stories.

659
00:44:58,289 --> 00:44:59,779
Mind your words.

660
00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:01,539
That's the truth.

661
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:03,719
What do you know? You have never been in a relationship.

662
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,899
Listen, the God of War is a woman.

663
00:45:06,899 --> 00:45:10,499
Women will turn their jealousy into hatred.

664
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,259
No fun at all.

665
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,439
You don't know how to appreciate this.

666
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,284
What a barbarian. Barbarian!

667
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:39,950
