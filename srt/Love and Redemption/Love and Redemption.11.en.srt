This has always been a trap!

35
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:31,782
They said this Kunyin Pill could increase one's skills.

For now, our disciples are being controlled by the Kunyin Pill.

Since our sect has taken the pill,

how can we ask for their help?

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,775
I'm glad that you're up.

164
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,978
You gave me this?

165
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,534
Isn't this the Antipoison Pill?

166
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:12,499
It's not.

167
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:14,419
This is the Truth Pill.

168
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:18,339
It took Lizhe Palace hundreds of years to come up with one.

169
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:21,219
How could you waste such a precious thing?

170
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:22,900
Did...

171
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,484
Did I give you the wrong pill?

172
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:28,059
Will it affect you?

173
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,619
You fool.

174
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:32,239
Of course, it'll affect me.

175
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,940
- Then... This... <br> <i>- Fool?</i>

176
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,565
<i>Is the Truth Pill starting to take effect?</i>

177
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:41,735
<i>Oh no!</i>

178
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,492
I'm in trouble.

179
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:51,899
You're right.

180
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,619
I'm a fool.

181
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:55,859
And I always cause trouble for you.

182
00:16:55,859 --> 00:17:00,167
That's why you're avoiding me.

183
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,179
No. I've never seen you as a burden,

184
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,278
and I've never thought of avoiding you.

185
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,412
In my heart,

186
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:14,219
I've always wanted to be with you.

187
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,017
Really?

188
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,339
- Then why did you... <br> - Forget about the past.

189
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,299
I'm telling the truth.

190
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:27,679
Don't you know what you gave me?

191
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,271
I...

192
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,879
I gave you the Truth Pill.

193
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:35,639
Are you telling the truth, Sifeng?

194
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:36,679
Yes.

195
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,434
I'll answer your questions with truths.

196
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,652
From now on, stop talking to me.

197
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,819
Sifeng, why can't I talk to you?

198
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:49,759
Because you don't want to tell me the truth, do you?

199
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,600
Did you lie to me?

200
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,354
That's right. I wasn't telling the truth.

201
00:17:57,354 --> 00:18:00,699
Chu Xuanji, don't go too far.

202
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,379
I won't.

203
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:04,380
I just want to know

204
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,019
if you meant it when you said that you don't want to see me

205
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,516
and refuse to be my friend?

206
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,383
That's not the truth!

207
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,879
Ever since I met you,

208
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,660
I've been lying to myself.

209
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,839
I want to see you so badly.

210
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,720
You're my most important friend and I don't want to lose you.

211
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,006
I knew it. You haven't changed, Sifeng.

212
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:33,539
But, Sifeng,

213
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,760
why did you say that we should stay away from each other?

214
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,739
<i>If you ever fall in love again,</i>

215
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:47,879
<i>the Lover's Curse will grow in your body.</i>

216
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:51,259
<i>There'll be three Green Feather marks on your wrist.</i>

217
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:53,419
<i>Whenever you get hurt by love,</i>

218
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:57,279
<i>each Green Feather mark will turn into a Red Feather on your chest.</i>

219
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,249
<i>When all three Green Feather marks turn into Red Feather marks,</i>

220
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,762
<i>your blood will flow backward. And you'll die.</i>

221
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:09,486
Because...

222
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,930
Because... Because I...

223
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,352
I...

224
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,659
Because of what?

225
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:27,531
Say it.

226
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,628
Sifeng.

227
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,993
Because...

228
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:34,369
Go ahead.

229
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:38,425
Say it, Sifeng. I want to hear the truth.

230
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,720
Because...

231
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,570
Because...

232
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,286
Because it's none of your business.

233
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,399
Sifeng, has the pill's effect gone away?

234
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,019
Why so soon?

235
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:04,519
I should've asked you more questions.

236
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:07,923
That's very inappropriate of you.

237
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,619
Was it inappropriate?

238
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:15,694
Now that I know the truth, you can't lie to me anymore.

239
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,980
I think we should be concerned about the others.

240
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,179
The rain in the forest is probably strange.

241
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,066
It makes one lose consciousness.

242
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:28,369
It gives one a hallucination and makes him succumb to them.

243
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,619
Maybe it's because I wasn't born with six senses.

244
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:36,938
This rain doesn't affect me.

245
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,237
Who's that?

246
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,780
Xuanji?

247
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,460
Sifeng?

248
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,199
I knew it. Demon spirits wait for humans to lose their will

249
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,979
before capturing them with the blood vine.

250
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:55,819
Linglong, that's smart of you.

251
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:58,371
You kept yourself out of the rain with this farmer's hat.

252
00:20:58,371 --> 00:21:00,699
Do you know the whereabouts of Minyan and the others?

253
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:02,459
I can't find Little Six anywhere.

254
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:04,819
And I don't know what this demon spirit is up to.

255
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:07,827
But I saw someone being hanged upon a tree.

256
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,539
<i>Judging from his outfit, he seemed to come from a nearby village.</i>

257
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:23,245
<i>It seemed that he was hanged to death without any struggle.</i>

258
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:27,099
Are Sixth Senior, Ruo Yu, and Yanran in grave danger?

259
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:29,139
He's hanged on a tree with a vine.

260
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:31,819
Did you see anything else on the tree?

261
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:33,891
Nothing at all.

262
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,539
Sifeng, do you have any clue?

263
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,730
The vine.

264
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,180
The bewitching rain.

265
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,150
That reminds me of something.

266
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,420
- What is it? <br> - Jialuo blood vine.

267
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,100
It can release a kind of bewitching rain

268
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,980
which gives humans hallucinations.

269
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,020
It then wraps itself around them and drinks their blood.

270
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,020
It eventually bears Jialuo blood fruits.

271
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,160
The fruit can make a cultivator powerful.

272
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,679
Someone is coveting blood fruits.

273
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,060
That's why he planted the blood vine.

274
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,580
That means they're going to drink Little Six's blood.

275
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,500
- What do we do? <br> - Don't panic.

276
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,160
Linglong, we can't delay anymore.

277
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,080
Let's make some farmer's hats first.

278
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,593
They can keep us dry. We'll go look for them afterward.

279
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:47,779
Do you remember you once told me that you'll dote on me,

280
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:51,059
love me, and adore me?

281
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,859
I do.

282
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:57,739
Do you remember you told me on our wedding day

283
00:22:57,739 --> 00:23:00,979
that I'd always be your only one?

284
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,139
I do.

285
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:04,410
But now you're lying to me! You're hurting me!

286
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:07,530
- Are you an unfaithful man? <br> - Yes.

287
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:12,505
Since you know you're unfaithful, what should you do?

288
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:18,545
I should take my own life.

289
00:23:18,545 --> 00:23:21,768
Fine, do it here then.

290
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,940
Your daughter is here, Father.

291
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,960
Father.

292
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,694
Father.

293
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:43,619
Your daughter is here.

294
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:46,044
Daughter? But I don't have a daughter.

295
00:23:46,044 --> 00:23:47,879
Don't you remember, Father?

296
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:51,539
You gave me away to the hunter family when I was born.

297
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,299
On my fifth birthday,

298
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,713
I found out that I'm not their biological daughter.

299
00:23:55,713 --> 00:23:59,619
That's why I looked forward to celebrating my birthdays with you

300
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:01,739
and receiving a birthday cake from you.

301
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:04,379
But you never came.

302
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:06,059
For my seventh birthday,

303
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:09,779
I got myself a piece of birthday cake with the apricots that I picked.

304
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:14,219
But the hunter's child bullied me.

305
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,179
He seized my cake and threw mud on it.

306
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:19,619
He called me a parentless brute.

307
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:21,259
I cried for help.

308
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,379
But everyone stayed out of it.

309
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,219
And I saw you peeking outside the courtyard.

310
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:28,099
I cried out loud for your help.

311
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,739
But you're like others.

312
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:33,245
You just stayed out of it.

313
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,612
Do you remember it now?

314
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,539
I do.

315
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:48,519
Do you deserve to be my father?

316
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,199
I don't.

317
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:55,298
Then tell me, what should you do?

318
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,000
I should take my own life.

319
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,238
Do it with this scarf then.

320
00:25:51,518 --> 00:25:53,379
Little Six!

321
00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:56,459
Little Six! Little Six!

322
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,259
It's not him.

323
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:06,714
We must find Sixth Senior and the others now.

324
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,659
I remember this tree.

325
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:19,879
We went this way. Why are we back here?

326
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:21,619
Is it a hallucination?

327
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:23,939
It's not. Because the trees are moving.

328
00:26:23,939 --> 00:26:27,199
Moving? How could the trees be moving?

329
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:29,779
- This... <br> - There's only one tree that moves.

330
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:31,419
It's called the Migu tree.

331
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:33,299
I read about it from the Demon Manual.

332
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,939
Jialuo blood vines and Migu trees grow together.

333
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:39,499
They reinforce and resist one another.

334
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:42,259
Are these all Migu trees?

335
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:44,419
No, there's only one.

336
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:47,659
There's only one Migu tree every hundred miles.

337
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:50,059
This forest is just its imaginary root

338
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:52,579
and the real Migu tree contains spiritual power.

339
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:54,379
The blood vine covets the power.

340
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:57,139
Thus, it wraps its root around the real Migu tree.

341
00:26:57,139 --> 00:26:58,539
The blood vine loves blood.

342
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:00,679
Let me lure it here with my blood.

343
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:01,819
I have spiritual powers, too.

344
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:03,619
Surely it'll drag me to the real tree.

345
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:05,819
You just remember where I'll be dragged to.

346
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:07,179
That won't do.

347
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:09,279
I know you're eager to save them.

348
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,975
I've got an idea.

349
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,255
Look over there.

350
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,259
Those are rain butterflies.

351
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:22,339
We just need to make the Migu tree bloom

352
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:24,039
and let the rain butterflies smell the flowers.

353
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,979
They'll lead us to the main tree.

354
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:30,699
And we'll get rid of the root of the blood vine and save them.

355
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:33,299
But it's obvious that the tree isn't blooming.

356
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,410
That's why the rain butterflies are all here.

357
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,499
The Migu tree has a special characteristic.

358
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:40,630
It loves songs. They make it bloom.

359
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,899
Their spiritual powers are not bad.

360
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:42,379
The blood fruits smell nice.

361
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:44,760
This should do.

362
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,250
It worked.

363
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,556
Xuanji, here.

364
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,599
- You're up. <br> - Linglong, great. You're all right.

365
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,779
Of course, I'm all right. I saved you after all.

366
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,678
Can you get up?

367
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,281
Both of these blood fruits are wasted.

368
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,493
Pay with your lives!

369
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,941
Watch out, everyone!

370
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:23,070
Watch out!

371
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,724
Linglong!

372
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,600
Sifeng!

373
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,574
Sifeng!

374
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,937
Let go of Sifeng! Come at me!

375
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,055
Sifeng.

376
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,300
Sifeng. Wake up, Sifeng.

377
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,819
Sifeng! Wake up.

378
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,581
Are you all right?

379
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,139
Sifeng.

380
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,820
<i>Sifeng! Sifeng! Wake up!</i>

381
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,259
<i>You shouldn't be here. Why don't you wake up?</i>

382
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:24,700
<i>What are you afraid of?</i>

383
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,340
<i>Why don't you look at me?</i>

384
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,900
<i>Are you afraid of me?</i>

385
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,040
<i>Sifeng, look.</i>

386
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,432
<i>I'm here. Wake up and you'll see me.</i>

387
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,357
<i>Sifeng, I'm here to save you.</i>

388
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,528
<i>I'm right here!</i>

389
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,220
Sifeng.

390
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,713
I'm all right. Use the Five Elements Spell to summon the Golden Touch.

391
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,000
Dragon Cut!

392
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:28,349
<i>Whenever you get hurt by love,</i>

393
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:32,300
<i>each Green Feather mark will turn into a Red Feather on your chest.</i>

394
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,979
<i>When all three Green Feather marks turn into Red Feather marks,</i>

395
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:39,213
<i>your blood will flow backward and you'll die.</i>

396
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:57,016
Sifeng.

397
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,860
We're saved.

398
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,820
Yes, we're saved.

399
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,833
Xuanji!

400
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,140
- Linglong! <br> - Sifeng!

401
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,999
Are you all right? How are you?

402
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,460
- Xuanji! Are you all right? <br> - Linglong!

403
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,380
- I'm okay. <br>- Did... Did you...

404
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:19,820
This isn't the place to talk.

405
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,119
We'll deal with those demon spirits first. Let's go.

406
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,900
Demon spirits are formless. Quickly use the Demon Slayer Charm.

407
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,220
We're in the middle of nowhere. Where can we get the charm?

408
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,736
I have it.

409
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,894
It's you! Your formation has killed many!

410
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:00,460
I'm going to kill you in the name of God!

411
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,538
Please spare her!

412
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,456
Who are you?

413
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,628
Wait! This is my friend.

414
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,660
Eldest Brother Liu, what's wrong with you?

415
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,484
Little Phoenix, it's a long story.

416
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,940
It's all her fault. Admit that you're wrong.

417
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,880
It's none of your business!

418
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,300
None of my business?

419
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,140
If I hadn't saved you from the bad guys,

420
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,380
you'd be hiding from me, wouldn't you?

421
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,220
And they controlled and made you hurt people again.

422
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,676
If I hadn't gotten here in time, you'd be dead by now!

423
00:35:33,676 --> 00:35:35,848
You're so annoying, Old Man!

424
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,139
I'm a good-looking and charismatic young man.

425
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,319
And you called me an old man?

426
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,999
Eldest Brother Liu, is this Yu'er?

427
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,820
Sifeng, who is this Eldest Brother Liu?

428
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,540
Why is he on this demon spirit's side?

429
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,100
We're from the same sect. He's my senior.

430
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,919
Little Phoenix, you need not cover up for me.

431
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,140
Let me introduce myself.

432
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,288
I'm Liu Yihuan, the abandoned disciple of Lizhe Palace.

433
00:36:02,288 --> 00:36:03,299
I see.

434
00:36:03,299 --> 00:36:07,278
Eldest Brother, what's your relationship with this demon spirit?

435
00:36:11,645 --> 00:36:13,480
This is my daughter.

436
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,320
Her name is Yu'er.

437
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,860
Your daughter?

438
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,380
She's a demon spirit.

439
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,020
You seem very young. She doesn't look like your daughter.

440
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,676
- Did you... <br> - Don't misunderstand me.

441
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:28,440
It's just that I take good care of myself.

442
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,060
As for Yu'er, she's really just half-demon.

443
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,460
She had an accident some time ago

444
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,180
and she died and became a demon spirit.

445
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,380
She's a naughty and immature kid. I apologize.

446
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,179
Anyway, an eye for an eye.

447
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:46,220
Your daughter has killed many people. She should be executed.

448
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,580
That won't do!

449
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,509
She's died once. She can't die again.

450
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,900
You gave birth to her with a demon.

451
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,060
That's irrational of you.

452
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,259
And it's wicked of you that you let your daughter hurt people.

453
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:58,819
You're so irrational and wicked.

454
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:01,180
Even though you're a friend of Sifeng, we're not going to help you!

455
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,160
That's very rude of you, Miss!

456
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,840
Moreover, she didn't mean to hurt them.

457
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,690
Look.

458
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,980
Do you see it?

459
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,279
This... This is the charm used to control demon spirits.

460
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,899
Someone is controlling these demon spirits.

461
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:25,660
They're forced to do evil and grow Jialuo blood fruits.

462
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,494
Yu'er, tell me. Who forced you to do this?

463
00:37:28,494 --> 00:37:30,445
I'll teach him a lesson.

464
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,007
Say it.

465
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,660
- I'm not going out! <br> - What's wrong?

466
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,800
Help me, please! Help me, please!

467
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,132
What's going on?

468
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,355
Someone has summoned her back.

469
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,112
I can still smell the aura of those demon spirits.

470
00:37:54,113 --> 00:37:55,779
They're not far from here. Let's go after them.

471
00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:57,610
Let's go!

472
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,660
The blood fruits have all been used up.

473
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,620
Give me yours.

474
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,460
There're some troublemakers in the forest.

475
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,340
They've ruined the blood vine.

476
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,555
Please have mercy on me and give me some time.

477
00:38:35,555 --> 00:38:37,100
What did you say?

478
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,740
Give you more time?

479
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,580
Who would give me mine?

480
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:45,672
If there's no blood fruit, I'll use you to cultivate my pill!

481
00:38:49,524 --> 00:38:51,142
Over there!

482
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,193
Let me go!

483
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,684
Help!

484
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,815
Help! Help!

485
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,700
You...

486
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,740
It's Elder Ling Shi of Xuanyuan Sect.

487
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:44,306
Don't you ruin my plan!

488
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,500
My pill. My pill!

489
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,140
As a sect elder,

490
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,220
how could you control the demon spirits and kill the innocent?

491
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,819
You've gone astray!

492
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:57,300
It's too late. There's no blood fruit left.

493
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,399
There's no blood fruit left!

494
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,693
He won't tell the truth because he's been bewitched by evil.

495
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:03,739
We're juniors.

496
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:06,419
- There's none left. <br> - There's nothing we can do.

497
00:40:06,419 --> 00:40:11,614
Instead, we should let Elder Zhu Shi interrogate him.

498
00:40:12,386 --> 00:40:14,480
That's a very strong demonic aura.

499
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,351
Watch out, everyone!

500
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,059
Xuanji, are you all right?

501
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:05,940
Sifeng, you're bleeding.

502
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,320
Just a small scratch. It's nothing serious.

503
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,979
- Sifeng! <br> - It's nothing serious.

504
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:13,339
Sifen, why do you risk your life for her?

505
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:15,519
Lu Yanran, stop talking nonsense.

506
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:16,819
I'm worried about you!

507
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:19,419
Why do you risk your life for Chu Xuanji?

508
00:41:19,419 --> 00:41:20,939
- I... <br> - Little Six.

509
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:23,459
Little Six, don't scare me!

510
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:26,579
Or I'll tell Father on you!

511
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,841
Wake up, Little Six!

512
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:31,426
Don't scare me!

513
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,939
Minyan,

514
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:37,026
you frightened me.

515
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:43,706
Linglong...

516
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,572
were you crying for me?

517
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,239
No.

518
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:55,999
The wind made my eyes water.

519
00:41:55,999 --> 00:42:00,097
We feel the same way about each other. Why don't you admit it?

520
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,200
You must have injured your head.

521
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,500
That's why you mistook me for Xuanji.

522
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,395
I, Zhong Minyan, only care about Chu Linglong.

523
00:42:18,395 --> 00:42:19,626
I'm not apologizing.

524
00:42:19,626 --> 00:42:21,999
You feel the same way about me. Why don't you admit it?

525
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:23,599
We care about each other.

526
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,958
Can we stop lying to ourselves?

527
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,299
You confessed to my sister

528
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:31,319
and now you're doing this to me. Are you making fun of us sisters?

529
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:35,276
If you let Xuanji down, I'll kill you.

530
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,252
Linglong.

531
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,619
Xuanji, let's make things clear today.

532
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,024
- I... <br> - Min Yan.

533
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,819
You should think before you say it.

534
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:53,522
- What do you mean? <br> - You've upset, Xuanji.

535
00:42:53,522 --> 00:42:57,735
If you don't care about Xuanji's feelings, I won't forgive you.

536
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,899
Eldest Brother Liu,

537
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:07,643
are you all right?

538
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,488
Yu'er is all right.

539
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,473
That's Xuanji.

540
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,060
You're stubborn, indeed.

541
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,119
Sifeng!

542
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,179
Sifeng, why is everyone upset?

543
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:32,540
Why did Linglong fight with Sixth Senior again?

544
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,179
You really live up to your name.

545
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:38,139
I've heard and seen it all.

546
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:40,739
They're upset because of you.

547
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:42,540
- Eldest Brother Liu. <br> - I...

548
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,299
This is an urgent situation.

549
00:43:44,299 --> 00:43:46,339
Let's find Yu'er's charm stone first.

550
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:50,227
That's right, Old Man. Stop minding other people's business.

551
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,405
Yes, the charm stone.

552
00:43:54,405 --> 00:43:57,059
It's an explosion. Surely it'll still be in there.

553
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:58,772
Let's go.

554
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,233
Sifeng, I...

555
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,610
Eldest Brother Liu.

556
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,960
This is it. The charm stone that controlled the demon spirits.

557
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,179
Yes, this is it. Break it and Yu'er will be free.

558
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:49,285
Wait.

559
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:52,534
This demon spirit has hurt many. We can't let her go just like this.

560
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,099
A demon spirit was born a demon.

561
00:44:57,099 --> 00:44:59,927
According to the rule of five sects, we can't just let her go.

562
00:45:05,462 --> 00:45:09,179
Yu'er made the mistake because she was forced by Elder Ling Shi.

563
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:12,399
Now that Ling Shi has runoff and other demon spirits are dead.

564
00:45:12,399 --> 00:45:15,940
There's no reason for us to kill Yu'er. She's one of the victims, after all.

565
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,739
Sifeng is right.

566
00:45:21,739 --> 00:45:25,239
Demon spirits made up of the remaining spiritual power of demons.

567
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:27,152
They've died once.

568
00:45:27,152 --> 00:45:31,979
If we kill them again, there's no way for them to turn good.

569
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,101
I don't see it as a righteous act.

570
