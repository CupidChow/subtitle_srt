Sifeng.

26
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:36,749
He's hurt by the Candle Dragon. How did this happen?

27
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,080
Sifeng, are you feeling better now?

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,120
Why are you here?

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,307
Are you here to question me or are you here

30
00:03:05,307 --> 00:03:08,455
to use me to threaten someone else again?

31

I'm here to save you.

32
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:17,200
God of War, aren't you afraid that your father,

33

senior, and those sects will laugh at you again

34
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,978
for being entwined with a demon like me?

35
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:29,262
Yes. Of course, I'm afraid.

36
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:32,732
I kept butting heads with my father to tell him that you are not a part of Tianxu Hall.

37
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:36,559
But what about you? What are you doing?

38
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:43,410
Since you don't believe me, why are you here to save me?

39
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,748
If it wasn't because they wanted to get your demonic core, I wouldn't care.

40
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:50,398
I'll let you stay in Mingxia Cave forever.

Xuanji, where are you taking Yu Sifeng?

45
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,940
Please forgive me. I can't let you extract his demonic core.

Hold Senior Hao Chen here.

49
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,136
Let's go.

50
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:22,090
What is the meaning of this? Wait for a moment.

52
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,660
The connection is back.

53
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,915
This is bad. Sifeng is in danger.

54
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:48,021
Chu Xuanji!

55
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,669
Sifeng, let's leave through this secret ground.

56
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,780
Others will be trying to invite the spirit of Candle Dragon.

57
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,540
- They won't think that we'll use this way. <br> - Through the secret ground?

58
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,980
Aren't you afraid that I'll steal your Crystal Lamp using this chance?

59
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,191
Yu Sifeng, can you not be like this?

60
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:05,820
Now, I really don't know what is real and what is not.

61
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,499
I've said it. No matter if you are a demon or a monster,

62
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:13,241
what can I do? The only thing I can do is to make sure that you are not hurt.

63
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:16,620
If you really want to take the Crystal Lamp, what else can I do besides stopping you?

64
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,418
I can't kill you, can I?

65
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,529
Chu Xuanji, I'll explain it one last time to you.

66
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,791
I only lied to you once.

67
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,412
I've never lied to you about anything else before this.

68
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,260
I don't care about Tianxu Hall.

69
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,299
The Crystal Lamp and Devil Star have nothing to do with me.

70
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,821
No matter if you believe me or not,

71
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:41,390
from now on, I won't explain it to you again.

72
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,891
But, of course, you don't need my explanation.

73
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:52,540
- Sifeng! <br> - Master!

74
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,199
Master, are you okay?

75
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:59,859
Chu Xuanji, look at what you did! You hurt him so deeply.

76
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,767
Little Silver Flower.

77
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:05,339
Master, she hurts you so much and you are still helping her?

78
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:07,020
I'm not helping her.

79
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,620
The two of us are no match for the God of War.

80
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,354
I'm just doing this to save our lives.

81
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:17,010
Stop talking. We need to leave now.

82
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,860
Or else, we'll be too late.

83
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,320
Are you really that kind?

84
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,213
Let's go.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,675
Master.

86
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,351
Today is the third day.

87
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,519
We are going to succeed soon.

88
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,720
A few mortals trying to invite the spirit of the Candle Dragon?

89
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,367
Stop wasting your energy.

90
00:06:55,577 --> 00:06:59,285
Demon, how did you come in?

91
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:02,498
I came in the same way Yu Sifeng came in.

92
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:05,644
But I really have to thank him.

93
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:10,710
Without the Candle Dragon, this secret ground looks quite nice.

94
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,538
As long as I'm here, I won't let you get near the Crystal Lamp.

95
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:20,310
Fine. Then, you can all die!

96
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,939
Master!

97
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:48,420
What a loving relationship between the master and disciples.

98
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,021
If that's the case, all of you can die together!

99
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,740
I'm on the purple cloud to Heaven. Ninth Heaven,

100
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,700
I hereby welcome the spirit of the Candle Dragon!

101
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,691
Demon, dream on!

102
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,863
Old man, die!

103
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:51,656
You'll reach the bottom of the opposite mountain through here.

104
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,919
Sifeng!

105
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:59,120
Xuanji, move aside!

106
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,300
Father, what is happening now?

107
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,122
Xuanji, you didn't disappoint us.

108
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:06,060
You brought Yu Sifeng here.

109
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,420
Chu Xuanji, you put on a show to purposely lure Sifeng here. Right?

110
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,480
It's not like this! Sifeng!

111
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,721
Xuanji, have you forgotten about your oath with me?

112
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,280
You and the demons will be sworn enemies.

113
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,340
Today, use the power of the God of War

114
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,762
to extract the demonic core of this 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird!

115
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,920
- Everybody, start the formation! <br> - No!

116
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,362
No! No! Sifeng!

117
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,620
Father, no! Father!

118
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,340
Sifeng!

119
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,540
- Sifeng! <br> - Xuanji, we are all mortals.

120
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,700
Only you can hurt the 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird. Kill him now!

121
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,260
Father! Senior! Please let Sifeng go.

122
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,320
He's not an evil demon. Please let him go!

123
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,980
Xuanj, have you forgotten how your mother died?

124
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,621
Now, you want to watch while your father dies in front of you?

125
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:01,755
Father!

126
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,940
Xuanji, if you continue to hesitate,

127
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,970
Sect Leader will be devoured by this strong spiritual power.

128
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,390
Xuanji, do it now!

129
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,620
Stop it!

130
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:15,580
Stop it now!

131
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,532
Father, I don't want you to die! I don't want Sifeng to die, either!

132
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,281
Xuanji, what are you doing?

133
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:29,500
Stinky woman, I was confused by your senior just now. I didn't stop him.

134
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,490
Stop talking. Help me break the formation now!

135
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,376
- Sifeng! <br> - Xuanji!

136
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,072
Sifeng.

137
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,260
Sifeng! Are you okay?

138
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,120
Sifeng!

139
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:08,740
Sifeng!

140
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:18,385
Since you swore an oath to be my sworn enemy,

141
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:20,411
why are you so foolish?

142
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:23,242
Why did you risk your life to save me?

143
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:24,592
You heard it?

144
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:27,300
I was just lying. How could you believe it?

145
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,260
I didn't mean it.

146
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,152
Sifeng.

147
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,313
My primordial spirit.

148
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:05,069
I've been waiting for you here for too long.

149
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,409
Devil Star?

150
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:39,159
Black Devil's Snare. The Demon Citadel Flower.

151
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:50,530
This is bad. It is absorbing our cultivation.

152
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,522
Only the Devil Star can make the Demon Citadel Flower bloom.

153
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:58,202
My primordial spirit, come to me.

154
00:12:58,202 --> 00:12:59,460
This is bad.

155
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,540
The Devil Star is going to be revived.

156
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,802
Could it be that the one in front of us is the real Devil Star?

157
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:11,495
It's you. So you are the Devil Star, Demon Maleficent.

158
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:14,675
Xuanji, the Devil Star is right in front of you!

159
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:17,092
Kill him now!

160
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:23,515
Impossible. Devil Star's soul is being sealed inside the Crystal Lamp.

161
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:25,942
How could it be Sifeng?

162
00:13:25,942 --> 00:13:28,890
Crystal Lamp is just sealing the Devil Star's soul.

163
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,554
Devil Star can only be awakened when the soul and spirit are joined together.

164
00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:37,914
Moreover, only Demon Maleficent's blood can make the Demon Citadel Flower bloom,

165
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:40,220
and it feeds on humans' cultivation!

166
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:01,307
<i>Xuanji!</i>

167
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,818
<i>Who are you?</i>

168
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,745
<i>This is not my blood. This is Xuanji's blood.</i>

169
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,777
<i>Don't tell me that Xuanji is...</i>

170
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,440
Sifeng.

171
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:20,092
You...

172
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,008
<i>How can this happen?</i>

173
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,996
Xuanji!

174
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:44,325
That's right. I'm the Devil Star, Demon Maleficent.

175
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:48,700
You think that I'm just here for the Crystal Lamp.

176
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,843
Actually, I'm here to kill this God of War.

177
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,500
Since you've already found out about my real identity, now

178
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,486
I have to kill all of you.

179
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,493
Sifeng, what nonsense are you talking about?

180
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:12,597
Hurry up and kill him!

181
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:14,169
Father.

182
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:37,255
Stop! All of you!

183
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,168
Sifeng,

184
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,769
didn't you say that you've only lied to me once?

185
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,380
Didn't you ask me to give you some time to settle everything

186
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,922
and then you'll come to me and explain everything to me?

187
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:13,961
Why?

188
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:16,420
I trusted you again and again.

189
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,200
Why did you lie to me again and again? Why?

190
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:29,140
Chu Xuanj, I never thought that you really loved me so much.

191
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:33,444
You believed in everything I said.

192
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:40,850
As long as I can get what I want, no matter how many times I lie to you,

193
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,777
I think you'll still believe in me wholeheartedly.

194
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:50,534
I'm really touched.

195
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,080
Sifeng.

196
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,110
Sifeng!

197
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,921
Demon, don't go!

198
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:27,574
Hurry up and take down the barrier now.

199
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:35,958
Xuanji, how long are you going to be so foolish?

200
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,580
Chase after him! We can't let him run away!

201
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,960
<i>Without the power of the God of War, I won't be able to touch it.</i>

202
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:30,369
Junior Yinghong.

203
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:34,467
Lize Palace.

204
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,340
Why can't I transfer my energy to it?

205
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,639
All the nerves inside her body are broken.

206
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,481
Auntie Yinghong!

207
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:59,361
Junior Yinghong!

208
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:00,901
How did this happen?

209
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:03,709
It must be because of Yu Sifeng!

210
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,460
Impossible.

211
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,731
Auntie Yinghong.

212
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,940
Don't touch her! If it wasn't because of you letting that demon go,

213
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,960
she wouldn't be like this now!

214
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,286
Master!

215
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:20,500
Master, this is bad. Master Heng Yang...

216
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,840
What happened to my master?

217
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,400
He...

218
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:43,559
Senior!

219
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,298
Senior Duan Qing!

220
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:50,551
Senior. Senior!

221
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,813
Master.

222
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:57,273
- Master. <br> - Master!

223
00:19:57,273 --> 00:19:59,196
Master!

224
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:03,595
- Master. <br> - Master.`

225
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:05,499
Master!

226
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:09,418
Master.

227
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:27,286
Master!

228
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:29,451
Master.

229
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,123
Yu Sifeng.

230
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:40,004
<i>Auntie Yinghong</i>

231
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,616
<i>can't cast any spells anymore.</i>

232
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:48,564
<i>This is all because of me.</i>

233
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:52,340
<i>She is hurt because of me.</i>

234
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,040
Stinky woman, why are you here?

235
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,342
I was looking everywhere for you.

236
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,079
It's like this. I think something is wrong with that Devil Star situation.

237
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,059
How about this? Allow me to leave for two days.

238
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,577
I'll go back to the heavens to check the 1000-year-old scroll.

239
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:11,816
I'll find out what happened.

240
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,953
Why aren't you talking?

241
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:20,392
If you say nothing, I'll take it as you've agreed.

242
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:22,002
I'll get going now.

243
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:29,592
Stinky woman, you were not like this in the past.

244
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:33,458
Don't worry. I'll get to the bottom of this when I'm in the heavens.

245
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,509
Maybe I'll be able to return your lover to you.

246
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:51,646
Xuanji, Master and the others are waiting for you at Shouyang Hall.

247
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:06,761
My Lord, Demon Maleficent stars are going to come together soon.

248
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:11,250
Only one more step for them to become one.

249
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,959
He's going to appear soon.

250
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:19,870
He was near to the Crystal Lamp just now.

251
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:28,019
I never thought that Yu Sifeng was Demon Maleficent, the Devil Star.

252
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:31,059
At first, we planned to extract his demonic core to show to the public.

253
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,690
If it wasn't because our plan to kill him was foiled,

254
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,219
we would have already destroyed the Devil Star.

255
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:40,931
Now that we set the tiger free, this world will soon fall into chaos.

256
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,825
This is all because of our God of War.

257
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:49,740
God of War, we respect you as a deity and we let you lead us,

258
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,699
but you sided with the demons and freed Yu Sifeng again and again.

259
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:55,441
For what?

260
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:58,545
Shaoyang Sect needs to give us an explanation for today's incident.

261
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,212
Kong Tong.

262
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,170
Today's incident happened

263
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,505
because I didn't teach my daughter well.

264
00:23:07,505 --> 00:23:11,523
That's why she made this grave mistake.

265
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,720
I'm willing to bear full responsibility for it.

266
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,900
Father.

267
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,131
Are you just going to settle this with just a pretty sentence?

268
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:22,356
Stop forcing my father.

269
00:23:22,356 --> 00:23:24,794
I'm the one who let him go. Blame me instead.

270
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:27,580
Xuanji, shut up.

271
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,883
You swore an oath about breaking up with Yu Sifeng forever.

272
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:35,020
And if you break your promise,

273
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:40,585
your father will be ripped to death on the street.

274
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,522
Today, I'm going to fulfill that oath.

275
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:47,677
I want to let you see the mistake that you've committed.

276
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,580
Father! No!

277
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,580
Sect Leader!

278
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,060
- Sect Leader Chu. <br> - Sect Leader!

279
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,839
Father!

280
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,277
I'm the one who enraged you.

281
00:24:01,277 --> 00:24:03,759
You can chop off my fingers or kill me.

282
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,499
Stop forcing my father!

283
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:08,936
You are the God of War. Who can hurt you?

284
00:24:08,936 --> 00:24:10,575
Everybody,

285
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:13,046
I should have

286
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,120
killed myself as an apology today.

287
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,672
But the demons are still out there.

288
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:21,344
I still have a duty to fulfill.

289
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:23,966
So, I'll not take my life yet today.

290
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:28,289
After we get rid of those demons, you can

291
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,041
punish me however you want.

292
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:35,337
Today, I'll break one of my fingers as a vow to that,

293
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:39,574
But after today, I will be ashamed

294
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,193
to lead the Shaoyang Sect.

295
00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:01,953
Hao Chen, although you are young, you are very mature.

296
00:25:01,953 --> 00:25:05,708
Your cultivation is very advanced as well.

297
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:09,358
From now on, I'll hand over

298
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:11,863
the Shaoyang Sect to you.

299
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,989
Sect Leader, you can't do that.

300
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:18,019
If you don't accept it,

301
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:21,770
who else has the right to take up this position?

302
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,636
Actually, I will have passed down the position as sect leader to you anyway.

303
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:28,769
I'm just doing it earlier.

304
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:32,220
Hao Chen, I believe in you.

305
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,577
You won't disappoint the world

306
00:25:34,577 --> 00:25:39,458
and also the hope that all sects put on Shaoyang.

307
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,195
Okay.

308
00:25:53,195 --> 00:25:55,529
You are injured today.

309
00:25:55,529 --> 00:26:00,090
So, I'll keep the Sect Leader Medallion for you for now.

310
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,570
<i>[Shaoyang]</i>

311
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,503
<i>Greetings, Sect Leader!</i>

312
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,952
Changing the sect leader is none of our business.

313
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:31,545
But everybody saw that this God of War has feelings towards that Yu Sifeng.

314
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:33,866
She even sacrificed her own master and auntie.

315
00:26:33,866 --> 00:26:35,799
How can we believe her?

316
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,299
That's right! If this continues,

317
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:39,601
there's no point in changing the sect leader.

318
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:42,571
Who says that Xuanji has feelings towards that demon?

319
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,932
Xuanji and I are real lovers who are destined to be together.

320
00:26:48,932 --> 00:26:52,994
Everybody has already known about it in Fuyu Island.

321
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:54,120
Senior Hao Chen, I...

322
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,740
Xuanji,

323
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,721
I know that you don't like to mention us being destined together.

324
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:04,459
You are afraid that people might misunderstand it as the reason for us to be together.

325
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:06,986
Since we already have feelings towards each other,

326
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:09,401
there's no need for us to care about what others think.

327
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:11,798
It's already enough if we can spend

328
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,568
the rest of our lives together.

329
00:27:13,568 --> 00:27:18,384
In Fuyu Island, God of War told us herself that the wedding was void.

330
00:27:18,384 --> 00:27:21,824
Sect Leader Hao Chen, don't fool us.

331
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:29,513
Xuanji, looks like we have to tell everyone about us now.

332
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:35,545
If that's the case, let's tell everyone about our engagement

333
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:38,659
so that others won't misunderstand anymore.

334
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:42,257
We can let them know that the mercy you've shown Yu Sifeng

335
00:27:42,257 --> 00:27:45,396
is just out of your past friendship.

336
00:27:45,396 --> 00:27:50,547
Hao Chen is the destined partner for my daughter.

337
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:52,570
At first, I already planned to conclude

338
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,759
their marriage after coming back from Dianjing Valley.

339
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,099
Besides, they've spent so much time together at Xuyang Peak.

340
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:01,364
They love each other.

341
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:03,478
I hope that everyone

342
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,620
can believe in Shaoyang one last time.

343
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,469
If the God of War continues to keep quiet, how can we...

344
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:12,779
How can we continue to trust Shaoyang?

345
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:16,260
Yes, Xuanji. All of us are waiting for your decision.

346
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,448
Okay.

347
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:42,907
From now on,

348
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:46,618
Yu Sifeng and I

349
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,412
will break up once and for all.

350
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:19,730
<i>Auntie Yinghong!</i>

351
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,724
<i>Junior Yinghong!</i>

352
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:31,520
♫ <i> Destiny foreshadows in this lifetime</i> ♫

353
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,320
<i>Xuanji, I like you.</i>

354
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,560
<i>I like you more than anyone and anything.</i>

355
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,790
♫ <i> Yet forget the previous lifetime's promise&nbsp; </i> ♫

356
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:54,580
♫ <i> The ending has been set, the twist of fate&nbsp;can't be&nbsp;seen&nbsp; </i> ♫

357
00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:00,000
♫ <i> In the end, we're unable to escape from our fate </i> ♫

358
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,100
♫ <i> The expressions concealed under the mask </i> ♫

359
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:06,796
<i>As long as I can get what I want,</i>

360
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:09,571
<i>no matter how many times I lie to you,</i>

361
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:12,340
<i>I think you'll still believe in me wholeheartedly.</i>

362
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,335
<i>I'm really touched.</i>

363
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:23,310
♫ <i> With you, I watch how the flowers flourish and wither </i> ♫

364
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,339
- Xuanji. <br> - Xuanji!

365
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:33,753
You've locked yourself in here for the whole day and night.

366
00:30:33,753 --> 00:30:36,299
This Ice Blade Punishment is not a game.

367
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:39,179
All of your six senses have recovered. You won't be able to endure it.

368
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,285
Xuanji, this incident is my fault, too.

369
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:45,416
If you want to talk about punishment, we should be punished together.

370
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:48,779
Xuanji, can you open the barrier first?

371
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:52,385
Xuanji, since you've seen Yu Sifeng's true color,

372
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:55,059
you shouldn't punish yourself for him.

373
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:58,414
Since he can do that thing to Auntie Yinghong and your master,

374
00:30:58,414 --> 00:31:01,539
it means that he's no longer the person we know.

375
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:03,799
He is the Devil Star, Xuanji!

376
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:08,177
Stop it! Can you let me stay here alone?

377
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:09,739
Go away.

378
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:11,578
Go!

379
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,243
- Xuanji. <br> - Xuanji.

380
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:18,470
Linglong.

381
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,920
Senior Hao Chen, Xuanji...

382
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,440
I know. You can leave first.

383
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,400
♫ <i> When the moon rises, memories come flooding back, <br> as if waking from a dream&nbsp; </i> ♫

384
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,380
Let's go.

385
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,970
♫ <i> With you, I watch how the flowers flourish and wither </i> ♫

386
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:50,530
♫ <i> Unseal all the memories that are buried in dust in your heart </i> ♫

387
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:56,290
♫ <i> When the moon rises, memories come flooding back, <br> as if waking from a dream&nbsp; </i> ♫

388
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:07,240
♫ <i> My love does not cease, unchanged whether in life or death, <br> love as colored glass&nbsp; </i> ♫

389
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,946
Xuanji.

390
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,930
He helped me get back my six senses.

391
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:18,579
And he taught me what it meant to be sincere,

392
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:21,609
but he lied to me

393
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,594
again and again.

394
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:28,808
This is my fault.

395
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:31,660
I killed my master,

396
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,240
and I hurt Auntie Yinghong.

397
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,089
This is not totally your fault.

398
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:40,290
Demons are very good at disguising themselves.

399
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,121
I stopped you from regaining your six senses

400
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:46,682
because I didn't want you to be in pain and to suffer.

401
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:48,099
This is my fault.

402
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:52,659
I should've stayed by your side since the beginning.

403
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:56,266
I shouldn't have let you leave my side.

404
00:32:57,073 --> 00:33:01,140
That way, you wouldn't have run into the trap of false display of affection.

405
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,017
Fake one.

406
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,624
All those that happened to me

407
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,190
are all fake?

408
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:19,169
Aren't you clear about that already?

409
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:21,241
People's hearts are unpredictable.

410
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:23,205
You were born without one.

411
00:33:23,205 --> 00:33:25,610
It's even harder for you to see through it.

412
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,629
You don't belong in the outside world.

413
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:32,187
And you shouldn't have been involved with people and issues that don't matter.

414
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:36,153
But luckily, it's still not too late.

415
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:40,121
From now on, you just need to listen to me.

416
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:43,749
No matter if you are happy or sad, crying or laughing,

417
00:33:44,538 --> 00:33:47,078
I'll stay forever by your side.

418
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,034
I won't let you go again.

419
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,469
For those demons who lied to you,

420
00:33:53,469 --> 00:33:56,062
we just need to kill them together.

421
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,200
But why?

422
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,351
Why does my heart

423
00:34:04,351 --> 00:34:06,324
hurt so much?

424
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,720
You were once the God of War who hated all evils in this world.

425
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,454
You shouldn't be lenient towards him.

426
00:34:19,454 --> 00:34:22,248
But you've been corrupted by the feelings in this world.

427
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:24,708
That's why you led yourself astray.

428
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,959
Your heartache...

429
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:32,213
is a demon that he planted inside your heart.

430
00:34:32,213 --> 00:34:36,855
You should have gotten rid of it and become who you were once.

431
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:42,611
The God of War will not ache for her enemy.

432
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,757
Kill him...

433
00:34:45,757 --> 00:34:49,981
and everything will end.

434
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:07,375
I won't...

435
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,780
I won't let him hurt anyone anymore.

436
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,492
Forget it.

437
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,433
You are exhausted now.

438
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:21,972
You should rest more.

439
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:26,652
There are a lot of things that I'll tell you later on bit by bit.

440
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:45,281
Do you know that you have belonged to me since the beginning?

441
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:48,444
Although I'm late,

442
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:51,956
maybe I'm not too late yet.

443
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,151
This time,

444
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:00,739
I have to bring you back no matter what.

445
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:04,640
I've kept the palace of the God of War for 1,000 years for you.

446
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,962
It's time for you... to go home.

447
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:13,339
You are in love with Yu Sifeng now

448
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:17,826
because you'd forgotten about the relationship we had.

449
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:23,212
You've forgotten how dependant you were on me and how obedient you were.

450
00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:24,842
Maybe...

451
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,020
there are things that I shouldn't let you forget.

452
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:48,625
At first, I planned to hide in Mount Shaoyang

453
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,689
to find a way to break the barrier of the secret ground.

454
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:56,145
But I never thought that I'd personally witness Yu Sifeng

455
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:58,623
rouse the power of the Devil Star.

456
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:20,153
<i>That's right. I'm the Devil Star.</i>

457
00:37:20,153 --> 00:37:24,926
This Black Devil's Snare blooms from Sifeng's blood.

458
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,504
There's really a mark there.

459
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,899
When Devil Star, Demon Maleficent, fought the heavens,

460
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:57,384
King Bailing left this scar on his shoulder.

461
00:37:57,384 --> 00:37:59,018
This is the mark of the heavens.

462
00:37:59,018 --> 00:38:01,538
It'll never be gone.

463
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:05,899
Together with this Black Devil's Snare that should've been extinct,

464
00:38:05,899 --> 00:38:09,400
all of these signs point to Yu Sifeng.

465
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,360
Could it be that

466
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,703
he's the Devil Star who I've been looking for all along?

467
00:38:14,703 --> 00:38:16,100
But you told me before that

468
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,712
the Devil Star has the strongest malignant aura among the Asuras.

469
00:38:19,712 --> 00:38:21,408
He has been sealed for 1,000 years.

470
00:38:21,408 --> 00:38:25,059
All his hatred and anger for 1,000 years will swallow up everything,

471
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:27,971
and he'll become a bloodthirsty demon that will be born for revenge.

472
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:31,978
But Sifeng is not like that right now.

473
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:36,994
Devil Star's soul is still sealed inside the Crystal Lamp.

474
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,418
It makes sense that his demonic aura and malignant aura are still in slumber.

475
00:38:41,418 --> 00:38:43,150
But...

476
00:38:43,793 --> 00:38:46,022
his soul is not back with him yet.

477
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:48,905
How did he know that he was the Devil Star?

478
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:09,059
Yuan Lang.

479
00:39:09,922 --> 00:39:11,660
Yuan Lang.

480
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,112
Yuan Lang.

481
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:33,531
You are still the same.

482
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:35,776
You are Maleficent?

483
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:45,307
You better call me Sifeng.

484
00:39:45,978 --> 00:39:49,630
Demon Maleficent has been forgotten for too long.

485
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,560
I don't remember much.

486
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,532
When I was outside of Shaoyang's secret ground,

487
00:39:53,532 --> 00:39:58,451
I felt a connection with my soul that is sealed inside the Crystal Lamp.

488
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,659
He showed me her,

489
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:07,237
the God of War who killed me and

490
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:10,198
sealed up my soul when my guard was down.

491
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:13,775
The funny thing is,

492
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:17,007
I now have this kind of relationship with her.

493
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:21,830
Now that I remember, I won't forget about it again.

494
00:40:27,586 --> 00:40:32,128
What is your plan then?

495
00:40:34,585 --> 00:40:36,472
Now...

496
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:40,921
the God of War and the other sects have found out about my identity.

497
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:43,058
I need to break the Crystal Lamp as soon as possible

498
00:40:43,058 --> 00:40:45,704
to get back my lost power.

499
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:48,072
How about you give me those spirit keys?

500
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:52,849
Then, we can go and meet our old friend, Wu Zhiqi.

501
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:56,730
I believe that he'll help me, too.

502
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:01,066
You want to go to the Demon Citadel to unlock the Dimension Chain?

503
00:41:05,218 --> 00:41:09,818
You've always wanted me to do it, right?

504
00:41:09,818 --> 00:41:12,585
It was none of my business before this.

505
00:41:12,585 --> 00:41:14,193
Of course, I wouldn't do it.

506
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:17,113
But now, I can only retrieve my soul

507
00:41:17,113 --> 00:41:21,027
by saving Wu Zhiqi and getting my Juntian Hoop and Chehai Hook back.

508
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:23,128
Besides, I'm a demon.

509
00:41:23,128 --> 00:41:27,920
I'm the only one who won't be affected by the malignant aura in the Demon Citadel.

510
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,342
You have all the spirit keys now.

511
00:41:30,342 --> 00:41:32,300
What are you waiting for?

512
00:41:33,106 --> 00:41:35,317
Of course, we have to wait.

513
00:41:35,317 --> 00:41:38,739
We have to wait until the full moon when the moon is at its highest.

514
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:41,900
The gate of Fenru City will only be opened by then.

515
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,930
Only then can Wu Zhiqi escape when we unlock the Dimension Chain.

516
00:41:47,615 --> 00:41:51,274
Now is not the best time to enter Mount Buzhou.

517
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:00,458
The best time?

518
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,528
Are you saying that Wu Zhiqi and I

519
00:42:05,528 --> 00:42:08,960
won't be able to open the gate of Fenru City?

520
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,065
Why should we wait until then?

521
00:42:13,065 --> 00:42:16,419
We've been waiting for so many years. This is nothing.

522
00:42:16,419 --> 00:42:19,049
The closer we are to our target, the calmer we should be.

523
00:42:19,049 --> 00:42:22,854
We need to make sure that nothing will go wrong.

524
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,489
You better rest well.

525
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:32,278
The most important thing is for you to recuperate now.

526
00:42:32,278 --> 00:42:34,354
I won't disturb you anymore.

527
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,500
You don't believe that Yu Sifeng is the Devil Star?

528
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,180
Whether he's the Devil Star or not, I need time to prove it.

529
00:42:52,798 --> 00:42:55,582
No matter if he's the Devil Star or not,

530
00:42:55,582 --> 00:42:58,561
before his demonic and malignant aura is awakened,

531
00:42:58,561 --> 00:43:03,633
he is still Yu Sifeng.

532
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,100
Master, why did you admit that you were the Devil Star?

533
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,161
Those anomalies were caused by Chu Xuanji's blood.

534
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:25,121
I know. You purposely hit Chu Xuanji

535
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:29,140
to stop her blood for her to hide her true identity.

536
00:43:29,867 --> 00:43:33,127
Actually, Chu Xuanji is the real Devil Star.

537
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:37,729
Master, you can't put yourself in danger because of that Chu Xuanji.

538
00:43:37,729 --> 00:43:41,289
Don't tell anyone about Chu Xuanji's connection to the Devil Star.

539
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:43,163
Master.

540
00:43:47,547 --> 00:43:51,386
Master, you don't even trust me now?

541
00:43:51,386 --> 00:43:52,940
You put a Gag Spell on me.

542
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,097
This is a serious matter. I'm afraid that you might accidentally spill it.

543
00:43:56,097 --> 00:43:58,589
Xuanji can't be the Devil Star.

544
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:02,250
Something must have gone wrong.

545
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,880
Maybe Wu Zhiqi will know something about it.

546
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,425
Back then, the God of War was ordered to take down Wu Zhiqi.

547
00:44:09,425 --> 00:44:12,921
But after meeting him, she went on a rampage in the heavens.

548
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:15,033
Something is wrong.

549
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:18,353
I can borrow the Devil Star's identity

550
00:44:18,353 --> 00:44:21,200
to meet Wu Zhiqi.

551
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,988
Master, have you forgotten?

552
00:44:23,988 --> 00:44:26,780
Chu Xuanji swore an oath to cut away any ties with you.

553
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,033
She is so heartless, but you keep on helping her.

554
00:44:30,033 --> 00:44:32,099
Your Lover's Curse has been activated twice.

555
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:35,340
If it's activated again...

556
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,239
Master, the most important thing now

557
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:44,957
is to take the Heartless Pill and forget about Chu Xuanji.

558
00:44:44,957 --> 00:44:50,019
You can't risk your life again and again for her without any care.

559
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:51,838
I don't do this

560
00:44:52,771 --> 00:44:54,815
just for her.

561
00:44:55,594 --> 00:44:57,427
How can I...

562
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,444
let the Rose Gold Bird clan

563
00:45:01,444 --> 00:45:05,073
and the safety of three realms be destroyed under Yuan Lang's wild ambition?

564
00:45:05,073 --> 00:45:09,331
The identity of the Devil Star can be used to stop his evil plan.

565
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:12,445
By the way, before we left Shaoyang,

566
00:45:12,445 --> 00:45:16,086
I asked you to get me Xuanji's blood.

567
00:45:16,086 --> 00:45:17,824
Give it to me now.

568
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,796
I'll make up a plan here.

569
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:34,772
Go and tell Eldest Brother Liu and Ting Nu that

570
00:45:34,772 --> 00:45:39,223
I need their help to find Wu Zhiqi.

571
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,781
Yes, Master.

572
00:45:52,120 --> 00:46:00,930
