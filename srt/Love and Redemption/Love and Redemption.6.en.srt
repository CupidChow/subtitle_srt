It has taken me a lot of work.

42
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:16,620
But no matter how well-guarded it is, I still found it in the end.

43
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,310
Someone has broken into the forbidden ground. Hurry!

44
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,560
This is the ancient Torch Dragon?

45

I never thought that they'd use the Torch Dragon to guard a Spirit Key.

Darn it. Is Ling Shi trying to get me killed?

The barrier is intact.

I wonder who the one is that broke into the forbidden ground again.

49
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:52,468
Luckily, you and your master have already reinforced this barrier before this.

Even the curious ones will not be able to get past the Torch Dragon.

I'll lay down a few more Defensive Formations with Uncle Lu Yang

52

Shi Feng from Xuanyuan Sect wins.

It's quite strange.

Sifeng! All the best, Sifeng! You have to win!

<i>Wu Tong, remember this.</i>

<i>I made the exception to accept you because you looked so sincere.</i>

<i>If you can't come first this time, you can leave us.</i>

60
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,550
<i>I'll definitely get first place.</i>

61
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,940
All the best, Sifeng! Sifeng, defeat him!

62
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,718
Sifeng!

63
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,940
All the best!

64
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,290
Great!

65
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,450
It's a spell again!

66
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,366
I remember that I already said this the last time. Spells are not allowed.

67
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:11,944
I can forgive you the first time, but a second time is unforgivable.

68
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:15,529
Wu Tong, you already broke the rule just now.

69
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:20,400
I think this round should go to Yu Sifeng from Lize Palace.

70
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,104
You useless thing! Good-for-nothing! Are you that incapable?

71
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:28,900
If you can't come first, you can leave us.

72
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,747
Master, I still have other skills.

73
00:08:31,747 --> 00:08:34,177
Sect Leader Chu, let me compete again.

74
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:36,260
Yu Sifeng did not defeat me. I didn't lose.

75
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,940
You broke the rule and you still want to compete. You have no shame.

76
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,020
Does Dianjing Valley Sect have no rules?

77
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,898
- You... <br> - Say no more!

78
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:48,030
Dianjing Valley Sect has lost in this round.

79
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,620
Master!

80
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,540
Sect Leader Chu, let me compete again!

81
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,397
Tell me. Do you know how to write the word dignity?

82
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:01,720
- Shut up! <br> - I...

83
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,375
Forget it. He's so fierce. Let him be.

84
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,659
It's okay. Let me.

85
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Even your master has already asked you to leave. Why are you still here?

86
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:13,539
Since you like to talk so much, I'll shut you up forever.

87
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,200
Be careful!

88
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,390
Xuanji!

89
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,820
<i>Don't be too arrogant. Try dying.</i>

90
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,260
Stop right there! Don't run!

91
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:39,970
Chase after him! Don't let him run away!

92
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,850
Stop right there!

93
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,915
How is she?

94
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:55,786
I've patched up her artery. She should be fine now.

95
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:57,340
I'll perform acupuncture on her later.

96
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,820
But, Aunt Yinghong, why is she still unconscious?

97
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,226
She was bleeding so much just now.

98
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:07,247
Linglong, calm down first. Master Yinghong has said that she'll be fine.

99
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:09,990
Xuanji will definitely wake up.

100
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,299
It's all because of Wu Tong. We have to find Wu Tong to avenge her!

101
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:19,318
Enough. Stop disturbing your aunt.

102
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:20,620
Let's go out first.

103
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,042
Aunt Yinghong.

104
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:23,810
She'll be fine.

105

<i>[SHOUYANG HALL]</i>

106
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,073
Sect Leader, we were incapable. Wu Tong got away.

107
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,685
What?

108
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,942
Barricade all exits right now. Don't let him get away!

109
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:46,404
Yes!

110
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,000
Senior Brother Chu, how is Xuanji?

111
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:54,848
Luckily, she's not fatally wounded,

112
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:58,408
but we don't know when she will wake up.

113
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:04,787
Sect Leader Chu, I'm really ashamed for what happened today.

114
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:08,581
I have a high-quality medicine for wounds that was passed down by our great master.

115
00:12:08,581 --> 00:12:10,834
Later, I'll ask my disciple to send it to her.

116
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:14,195
Hopefully, it can help with her wound.

117
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,922
It's Dianjing Valley Sect's fault for not educating my disciple well.

118
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:22,342
That Wu Tong came to me out of the blue.

119
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,875
I wanted to lead him into the light.

120
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,072
But I never thought he would bring such disaster today.

121
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:30,639
If that's the case, Dianjing Valley Sect will no longer keep him.

122
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Today, I'm going to kick Wu Tong out from Dianjing Valley Sect

123
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,979
in front of every sect here.

124
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:39,955
From now on, Wu Tong and Dianjing Valley Sect are no longer related.

125
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:43,140
You are really good at passing the buck, Valley Master Rong.

126
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:47,329
You might have kicked him out,

127
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:50,550
but what about the competition ranking then?

128
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,614
To make up for all of you,

129
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:55,793
Dianjing Valley will withdraw from the competition this time.

130
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:58,745
It's a form of apology, too.

131
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,259
Although Wu Tong has been kicked out from Dianjing Valley,

132
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:03,753
he seriously wounded Xuanji and escaped to avoid punishment.

133
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:06,074
We can't let him off the hook so easily.

134
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,603
No matter where he runs,

135
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:11,481
I'll definitely catch him and bring him to justice.

136
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:13,730
Wu Tong is bad-tempered and vicious.

137
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,699
If we let him run loose, he'll be a disaster to the people.

138
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:21,359
In order to uphold justice, we have the responsibility to get rid of him for the people.

139
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:25,452
If that's the case, Dianjing Valley Sect will take the lead first.

140
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:28,854
From today onward, Dianjing Valley Sect, Shaoyang Sect,

141
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:31,965
Lize Palace, Xuanyuan Sect, and Fuyu Island

142
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:35,339
will work together to arrest Wu Tong.

143
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,226
If there is any resistance or people harboring him,

144
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:41,876
they'll be going against us five sects!

145
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,820
<i>[WANTED. REWARD: 500 SILVER]</i>

146

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,109
<i>Go.</i>

149
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,100
The head disciple of Lize Palace is really kind.

150
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,240
You even withdrew from the Hairpin Tournament for a girl.

151
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,810
Chu Xuanji was seriously wounded by Wu Tong

152
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,200
because she defended me during the competition.

153
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:45,348
Now, she is still unconscious and her life might still be in danger.

154
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:48,789
Out of moral responsibility, how can I not show care towards her?

155
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:55,095
What a noble and honorable excuse.

156
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,246
Yu Sifeng, you are the head disciple that the palace lord has high hope in.

157
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:02,894
You have to fight for Lize Palace's reputation.

158
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:06,794
If you don't want to make up for your mistake of losing your mask

159
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:09,814
by becoming first in the Hairpin Tournament,

160
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,710
so be it.

161
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,777
Is Xuanji getting better?

162
00:15:26,777 --> 00:15:30,419
Aunt Yinghong said that she'll wake up after resting for two days.

163
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,739
Sifeng, take care of Xuanji for us first.

164
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:34,674
We'll go and fetch the medicine for her.

165
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:36,085
Let's go.

166
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,840
Xuanji.

167
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,129
Xuanji!

168
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:11,805
<i>Who are you?</i>

169
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:46,818
<i>Xuanji, when are you going to wake up?</i>

170
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:50,258
<i>I'm afraid that I'll have to go back to Lize Palace</i>

171
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:52,964
<i>before I can bid my farewell to you.</i>

172
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:56,680
<i>Do you know that if you can wake up and smile,</i>

173
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,423
<i>I'll be able to go through any hardships when I go back?</i>

174
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:20,529
Hero Yu, you are so kind for coming here every day

175
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:22,604
to take care of Xuanji.

176
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:26,929
Thank you for saving the junior sister of our sect twice.

177
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:32,322
I never thought that there was still a righteous disciple like you in Lize Palace.

178
00:17:32,322 --> 00:17:35,645
Xuanji is my friend. I can't do much.

179
00:17:35,645 --> 00:17:38,651
I just hope that she can wake up soon.

180
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:41,147
Don't worry. She will.

181
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,249
This is weird. She was so seriously wounded.

182
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,025
But she's almost healed although it has just been a few days.

183
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:08,441
It's really surprising.

184
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,328
She has indeed recovered very quickly.

185
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:19,379
We've given her a lot of medicine and supplements

186
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:21,344
from various sects for the past few days.

187
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:23,727
They must have helped her recover.

188
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:27,849
Although she looks fine now, she has lost a lot of blood.

189
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:30,909
I think she'll still be unconscious for a while.

190
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:36,279
As long as she is fine. Junior Sister Xuanji is a very fortunate person.

191
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:40,143
Yu Sifeng.

192
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,267
Deputy Chief.

193
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:45,419
You still know that I'm the Deputy Chief?

194
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,077
I haven't seen you for so many days.

195
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:50,719
I thought you'd already forgotten about Lize Palace's rules.

196
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,805
I wouldn't dare.

197
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:56,039
You need to focus and pack your things, too.

198
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,780
Get ready to go back.

199
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,884
Deputy Chief, the Hairpin Tournament is not over yet. Right?

200
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:07,926
The game is already set. Xuanyuan Sect got lucky this time.

201
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:12,510
Lize Palace is really noble. We just gave away first place to others.

202
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,303
Nobody cares about that Hairpin Tournament.

203
00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:19,614
What is it? Are you reluctant to leave?

204
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:26,101
No. I just think that if we leave like this,

205
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:29,430
it'll look like Lize Palace is a sore loser.

206
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,261
Deputy Chief, how about we wait for a few more days?

207
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:38,142
Don't think that I don't know what you are thinking about.

208
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:41,539
Forget it. You are not my problem.

209
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:45,894
You are Palace Master's disciple. He'll punish you when you go back.

210
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,994
Your days of freedom will come to an end soon.

211
00:19:48,994 --> 00:19:53,601
I understand that you want to cherish your remaining time.

212
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,095
Xuanji,

213
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,349
in the end, I still can't wait until you wake up.

214
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:22,330
I don't know if you can hear me.

215
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,387
But I still want to tell you that

216
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:27,488
it was the happiest thing in my life to have been able to come out

217
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,238
and meet you here.

218
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,356
I'll remember our four-year promise.

219
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,462
No matter how hard it is, we'll meet again.

220
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,799
Sifeng, you are leaving?

221
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,288
The Hairpin Tournament has ended for a few days already.

222
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,273
I can't extend my stay anymore.

223
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:51,755
Xuanji will be sad when she wakes up with you gone.

224
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,001
The sound of this bell can travel for miles.

225
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:59,033
Linglong, please give this to her for me.

226
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:01,825
She can contact me with it when she wakes up.

227
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:03,401
Don't forget about it.

228
00:21:03,402 --> 00:21:05,777
Don't worry. I'll tell her.

229
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:07,864
Too bad we haven't caught Wu Tong yet,

230
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:12,280
or else we could watch him get punished to uphold justice for Xuanji.

231
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,331
I still think that this matter was not handled properly.

232
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:18,179
Wu Tong is just a normal disciple.

233
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,258
But now, the five sects are working together to make him a wanted criminal.

234
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:25,385
He should've thought of that when he hurt Xuanji back then.

235
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:28,446
He has only himself to blame.

236
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:30,020
I didn't mean that.

237
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,161
Wu Tong is very narrow-minded and he's an extremist.

238
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:35,674
It's not a good thing to corner him.

239
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:37,499
Or maybe I'm thinking too much.

240
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:40,268
Linglong and Minyan, please take care.

241
00:21:40,268 --> 00:21:42,966
- Farewell. <br> - You, too, my brother.

242
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:46,322
After Xuanji is awake, we'll go and visit you at Lize Palace.

243
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,365
Bring Yu Sifeng, the disciple who broke the rule in the hall!

244
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,180
<i>[LIZE PALACE]</i>

245
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:32,879
Yu Sifeng, as the head disciple of Lize Palace and

246
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:35,059
as the preferred successor of Palace Master,

247
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:38,379
not only were you not strict with yourself and weren't a role model to everyone,

248
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:40,937
you even lost your mask outside and showed your real face.

249
00:22:40,937 --> 00:22:44,919
You broke the rule and put Lize Palace in danger.

250
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:48,054
Do you know what the punishment you deserve is?

251
00:22:50,675 --> 00:22:54,477
The 13 Punishments. I accept the punishments with no objection.

252
00:22:54,477 --> 00:22:56,522
Take away his Head Disciple Token and

253
00:22:56,522 --> 00:22:58,819
send him into the 13 Punishments Tower of Oblivion at once.

254
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:00,751
Wait.

255
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,566
This is the first time he committed this mistake.

256
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:11,247
Besides, he didn't do it on purpose. He had a solid reason.

257
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:15,487
This is not a suitable punishment.

258
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,802
When I was cultivating myself two years ago in seclusion,

259
00:23:19,802 --> 00:23:23,882
Sifeng attended to me diligently.

260
00:23:23,882 --> 00:23:28,537
He made great contributions. I haven't even rewarded him yet.

261
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:31,489
He made a mistake this time but his merit offsets his fault.

262
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:33,510
As for his reward and punishment,

263
00:23:35,698 --> 00:23:37,714
they've cancelled each other out.

264
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:42,385
Palace Master. Based on Lize Palace's centuries of rules,

265
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:45,259
if a disciple loses his mask and shows his true face outside,

266
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,662
he has to be sent into the 13 Punishments Tower of Oblivion.

267
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:49,273
Even though he made a contribution,

268
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:53,129
you still have to discuss it first with two other palace lords and four elders.

269
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:56,547
How can you just cancel out the punishment like that?

270
00:23:56,547 --> 00:24:01,481
Looks like Palace Master is being biased towards his own disciple.

271
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,771
What is it?

272
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:17,385
Are you saying that his merit for helping me out in my cultivation

273
00:24:17,385 --> 00:24:21,306
is not enough to cancel out the punishment for losing his mask?

274
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:25,043
Losing his mask is not the only rule he broke.

275
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:29,040
He was very close with those disciples from Shaoyang Sect.

276
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,539
And his relationship with that Chu Xuanji

277
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,467
is not just a simple friendship.

278
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:39,705
He even withdrew from the Hairpin Tournament for her

279
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:43,929
and let Lize Palace lose the chance to become the head of the five sects.

280
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:46,445
Where does this rumor come from?

281
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,859
Impossible. This is not true.

282
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,094
Profound sentiments of friendship.

283
00:24:57,699 --> 00:25:00,419
I think he said it himself.

284
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:04,281
Yu Sifeng, do you still remember?

285
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,990
Yes, I do.

286
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:12,880
My feelings for Xuanji are indeed more than friendship.

287
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,626
I don't want to lie.

288
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,295
Yu Sifeng!

289
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,379
I think you've been possessed by an outsider.

290
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:36,419
Say it. Say that you are sorry.

291
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:42,519
You have been bewitched because you are young and ignorant.

292
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:45,712
Say it! Say that you are sorry!

293
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,379
He won't say it.

294
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:56,519
Palace Master, a disciple of Lize Palace can never fall in love with a woman,

295
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,079
and can never have a wife and family.

296
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,086
As the Head Disciple of Lize Palace, he lost to temptation

297
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:04,900
and was influenced by an outside woman. He destroyed his own future.

298
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,719
He has broken many rules. His punishment cannot be canceled.

299
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,906
Palace Master, he has to be sent into the 13 Punishments Tower of Oblivion!

300
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,657
Shut up!

301
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,139
What kind of a place is 13 Punishments Tower of Oblivion?

302
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:29,742
Since ancient times, how many came out alive after going in?

303
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:33,526
Moreover, Sifeng is a rare talent

304
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:36,031
that only appears once in a blue moon.

305
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,993
Don't you know that?

306
00:26:38,993 --> 00:26:42,386
I still want to teach him well

307
00:26:43,128 --> 00:26:45,540
and let him bring pride to Lize Palace!

308
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,599
If he goes through the 13 Punishments and dies inside it,

309
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,746
who will be able to lead Lize Palace in the future?

310
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,037
Palace Master, if he can't survive the 13 Punishments Tower of Oblivion,

311
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:04,294
how can he be the rare talent of Lize Palace?

312
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:06,539
If you really want to be biased,

313
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:09,730
we won't be able to enforce the rules of Lize Palace in the future.

314
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,671
Shut up!

315
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:23,111
Palace Master, the rules of Lize Palace are set by our great ancestors.

316
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:28,388
Palace lords need to discuss with the elders before any decision is made.

317
00:27:28,388 --> 00:27:32,520
Palace Master has no right to make the decision alone.

318
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,939
I'm getting a headache.

319
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:36,440
Terrible headache.

320
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:42,562
I can't discuss this further today.

321
00:27:42,562 --> 00:27:48,339
Take him into the prison first and we'll discuss it on another day.

322
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:51,199
Palace Master, we have to make a decision eventually!

323
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,336
Palace Master, it'll be hard to convince everyone if we do this!

324
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,946
Take Yu Sifeng into the prison first.

325
00:28:07,091 --> 00:28:09,725
A decision has to be made eventually.

326
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:12,706
How long can he delay this?

327
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:27,664
Eldest Brother Liu.

328
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,769
Little Phoenix.

329
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,271
What happened?

330
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,580
You brat.

331
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,520
I was still hoping that you could bring some wine for me.

332
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,059
Now, you are locked up by those two monsters as well.

333
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:48,539
No. You are the best disciple in Lize Palace.

334
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:52,747
Your eccentric master dotes on you the most, right?

335
00:28:52,747 --> 00:28:54,180
It's not his fault.

336
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,549
I'm the one who took off my mask and broke the rules.

337
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,068
Mask again. I can't believe Lize Palace.

338
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:05,791
Why are they always so violent about one mask?

339
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:09,864
They always say that only the disciples in the palace are your family.

340
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:13,261
Actually, this is just an inhumane place.

341
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:18,546
But you always followed the rules by the book, right?

342
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:20,242
Why did you take off your mask?

343
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:23,583
Did it fall off by itself or someone took it off?

344
00:29:31,027 --> 00:29:33,467
Something is wrong with you.

345
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:36,842
Wait.

346
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,480
Eldest Brother Liu, this is...

347
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,343
Spell of deceit.

348
00:29:51,343 --> 00:29:54,917
I've been here for so many years. Of course, I have to do something.

349
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:59,318
Let me tell you. I've cleared a path through all the prison rooms here.

350
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,873
Look.

351
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,779
The prison of Lize Palace is built on the Kushui River

352
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:09,540
and the bottom of it is surrounded by bitter water that we can't survive in.

353
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,056
It looks very well-guarded, but it's not.

354
00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:16,419
I've dug a secret tunnel that I can escape in.

355
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:20,298
Nothing is too hard for me.

356
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:25,662
So, you always sneaked out to see your daughter.

357
00:30:25,662 --> 00:30:30,209
You can sneak out but you continue to be locked inside here.

358
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:32,351
It's for your daughter, right?

359
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:40,394
I heard that the old palace master once forced you to make a vow

360
00:30:40,394 --> 00:30:42,379
on your daughter's life.

361
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:45,936
That's why you have been stuck here for decades.

362
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,900
Yes. If it wasn't for Yu'er...

363
00:30:57,194 --> 00:31:00,100
Don't talk about me. Let's talk about you.

364
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,073
What happened to your mask? Who took it off?

365
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:04,864
Was it a boy or girl?

366
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,692
Is she beautiful?

367
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,510
You are getting shy.

368
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,754
Come. Let's drink while we talk.

369
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,237
Here.

370
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:27,618
Take it and drink it.

371
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:35,259
Oldest Brother Liu, since young, whenever I saw you in prison,

372
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:40,300
you would always trick others to drink in order to uncover the others' secrets.

373
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,500
That part of you has never changed.

374
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,751
But you are the only one who will tell me about the outside world.

375
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,114
You always said that

376
00:31:50,114 --> 00:31:53,265
human feelings are troublesome and complicated.

377
00:31:53,265 --> 00:31:55,361
But they are also the most beautiful.

378
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:59,333
I think... I understand now.

379
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:03,070
Little Phoenix,

380
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,345
you always look so cold.

381
00:32:05,345 --> 00:32:08,946
But I know that you are the most open-minded person.

382
00:32:08,946 --> 00:32:11,781
You look a little bit like me in the past.

383
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:14,465
You met a girl you like, right?

384
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,588
No. If you had just taken off your mask,

385
00:32:30,588 --> 00:32:35,234
based on your position in the palace and how defensive your master is,

386
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:39,793
your master would definitely do everything he could to cancel your punishment.

387
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:45,894
But it'll be troublesome if you had really admitted that you like someone.

388
00:32:45,894 --> 00:32:48,899
I don't think you'll be able to escape the 13 Punishments.

389
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,870
When that time comes, even your master can't protect you.

390
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,172
You haven't admitted this to those old-fashioned men, right?

391
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,978
I can't lie to my master.

392
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:01,831
And I cannot deceive my own heart.

393
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:04,866
LIttle Phoenix, you are quite smart usually.

394
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:07,060
Why are you acting dumb at a time like this?

395
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,859
Do you know what kind of place 13 Punishments Tower of Oblivion is?

396
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:14,428
I know. I broke the rules. I'm willing to be punished.

397
00:33:14,428 --> 00:33:16,375
What do you know?

398
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,859
Let me tell you. In that 13 Punishments Tower of Oblivion,

399
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:22,620
all 13 floors are full of vicious beasts, monsters, and evil spirits.

400
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,620
Devilish formations that erode the soul and heart.

401
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:29,358
The one who is punished has to climb from the bottom to the top to be able to survive it.

402
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:33,487
All these years, those who could survive it are few and far in between.

403
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:35,706
Are you courting death?

404
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:39,091
Even though it's rare, it's not impossible.

405
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,786
You are a fool. You are betting with your life.

406
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,582
This won't do.

407
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,178
How about this?

408
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:55,809
You should just escape from the secret tunnel that I dug out.

409
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:59,010
Don't ever come back to Lize Palace anymore.

410
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,641
I can't leave.

411
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:04,629
If I leave, I'll become Lize Palace's traitor.

412
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:06,519
I'm indebted to my master.

413
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,860
Even if I have broken the rules,

414
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,537
I can't escape in fear of punishment and bring shame to him.

415
00:34:10,537 --> 00:34:15,763
Moreover, if I just run away, am I going to hide and run forever?

416
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,824
- Little Phoenix. <br> - Don't worry, Eldest Brother Liu.

417
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,178
Since there's a way out from the 13 Punishments,

418
00:34:22,178 --> 00:34:25,778
I'm going to escape using that way.

419
00:34:29,246 --> 00:34:32,892
I really don't know what to say to you.

420
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,559
Linglong, don't worry. Xuanji will be fine.

421
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:57,681
But she has been unconscious for so many days.

422
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,802
How can I not worry?

423
00:34:59,802 --> 00:35:01,915
What should we do now?

424
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,242
I'm so hungry.

425
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,433
- Xuanji, you are awake! <br> - Xuanji.

426
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:15,800
- Xuanji. <br> - Little Six, keep an eye on her.

427
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,745
- I'll call for someone. <br> - Okay.

428
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:19,346
Xuanji.

429
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,643
Sixth Senior Brother.

430
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:24,570
You are finally awake. You scared us.

431
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,039
Thank you, Sixth Senior Brother.

432
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,100
What did you say?

433
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,513
Aren't you the one who pulled me out from the water that day?

434
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,519
I was so scared when I fell that day.

435
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:42,379
I thought I was going to die.

436
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:46,140
Luckily, you pulled me out. Thank you.

437
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,570
No. It wasn't like that.

438
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,279
That day...

439
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:51,199
- Master. <br> - Father.

440
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,140
Xuanji.

441
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,442
Aunt Yinghong.

442
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,513
Senior Brother Hao Chen.

443
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,380
Xuanji has recovered. No need to worry now.

444
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,333
See? I knew that she would be fine.

445
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,281
It's good that she has recovered.

446
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:10,419
I really can't believe you!

447
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:14,088
You don't practice hard usually. That's why you couldn't react in time!

448
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,909
You made us all worry.

449
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,954
I'm sorry, Father.

450
00:36:17,954 --> 00:36:21,099
Father, Xuanji did it to save me. If you want to scold someone, scold me.

451
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:24,001
Sect Leader Chu, Xuanji was very courageous this time.

452
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:27,868
She stepped forward bravely when danger hit. You should compliment her.

453
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:31,900
Junior Sister Xuanji, how's your wound? Do you feel uncomfortable?

454
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,410
You've recovered well,

455
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,973
but your wound is quite deep.

456
00:36:35,973 --> 00:36:38,620
Weren't you afraid when the sword flew towards you?

457
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,500
I didn't think that much.

458
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,460
I just didn't want Linglong to get hurt.

459
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,933
Dummy. I'm tougher than you. A sword wound is nothing.

460
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:48,439
Don't do this again in the future. It's dangerous.

461
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:52,185
Enough. Say no more. Recuperate well.

462
00:36:52,185 --> 00:36:53,820
Take care of her, both of you.

463
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,833
We'll be leaving first then.

464
00:37:00,162 --> 00:37:02,234
- Xuanji. <br> - Linglong.

465
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:04,539
Where is Sifeng? Why isn't he here?

466
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:08,720
You've been unconscious for many days. The Hairpin Tournament has already ended.

467
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,379
I was unconscious for so long?

468
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:12,831
I thought it was just a dream.

469
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,659
- So, Sifeng has left? <br> - Yes.

470
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:17,979
He came here every day to take care of you but you didn't wake up.

471
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:20,057
In the end, he couldn't drag it out any longer.

472
00:37:20,057 --> 00:37:22,498
So, he went back to Lize Palace.

473
00:37:22,498 --> 00:37:24,419
I'm too useless.

474
00:37:24,419 --> 00:37:26,659
I was unconscious for so long just because of a sword wound.

475
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:28,524
I couldn't even bid farewell to him.

476
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:31,811
It's all right. We can still meet him, right?

477
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:33,499
- Junior Sister Xuanji. <br> - Junior Sister.

478
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:35,177
First Senior. Second Senior.

479
00:37:35,177 --> 00:37:38,303
What is it? Aren't you happy that we are here to see you?

480
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:40,299
Of course. I'm very happy.

481
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,859
Xuanji, you've really changed my mind about you.

482
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:46,052
You risked your life to take a sword for Linglong. You were so brave.

483
00:37:46,052 --> 00:37:49,979
You don't have any strong points usually but you are so unselfish in a critical time.

484
00:37:49,979 --> 00:37:52,086
How could you say that?

485
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,946
Xuanji, we know that you will be bored while recuperating.

486
00:37:56,946 --> 00:37:58,986
So, we brought you something.

487
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:05,583
Second Junior Brother, you even gave the treasure you got when you roamed the world to her?

488
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,559
Our junior sister is so unselfish. Of course, I have to be magnanimous, too.

489
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,919
Xuanji, I still have a lot of treasures. I'll show you later.

490
00:38:18,711 --> 00:38:22,222
Are you worried about Xuanji?

491
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,899
Yes. Xuanji is so slow when it comes to her training.

492
00:38:28,899 --> 00:38:30,499
How can I not worry?

493
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:33,353
She has never known what danger is since young.

494
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,999
She has escaped from death so many times.

495
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:38,728
Although it's already very lucky that she can grow up safely

496
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:41,029
and I shouldn't ask for more,

497
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,539
just like how her mother took care of her

498
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:47,427
and kept her by her side all the time when she was still alive,

499
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:49,969
accidents can still happen.

500
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:56,130
And her mother couldn't take care of her forever, either.

501
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:01,197
From now on, I really don't know how to educate her.

502
00:39:01,197 --> 00:39:04,529
So you are always so strict towards her

503
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:08,639
because you want her to know how to defend herself from being bullied

504
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,818
and being able to save herself in a sticky situation.

505
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:13,411
Right?

506
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,155
Actually, regarding Junior Sister Xuanji,

507
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:20,514
my master has different opinions from yours.

508
00:39:20,514 --> 00:39:23,179
My master can see that she is a talented person.

509
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:25,139
So, he asked me to request your permission

510
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:27,179
to let her be my master's disciple.

511
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:29,200
Really?

512
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,841
I wouldn't joke about it.

513
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:35,608
Although my master always stays at Xuyang Peak in order to

514
00:39:35,608 --> 00:39:37,489
reinforce the barrier of the forbidden ground,

515
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:40,139
he always talks to me about matters in Shaoyang Sect.

516
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:42,019
Although her six senses are not developed

517
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:45,115
and her personality is different from others,

518
00:39:45,115 --> 00:39:48,865
she never loses her pure heart.

519
00:39:48,865 --> 00:39:50,739
Xuyang Peak will suit her well.

520
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:53,738
And it's suitable for her to learn the Heartless Tactics.

521
00:39:55,219 --> 00:39:58,569
Senior Heng Yang is considered

522
00:39:58,569 --> 00:40:01,201
the most cultivated person in Shaoyang Sect.

523
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:03,348
Of course, he has his own view.

524
00:40:03,348 --> 00:40:06,521
If she can really enter Xuyang Peak

525
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:09,218
and become Senior Heng Yang's female disciple,

526
00:40:09,218 --> 00:40:13,619
she must be blessed from her past life.

527
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,579
So, you agree with this suggestion?

528
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:19,190
It'll be my honor. An honor.

529
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:22,578
When Xuanji is feeling better after a few days,

530
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:27,079
I'll summon her and tell her about this great news at once.

531
00:40:27,747 --> 00:40:29,247
Okay.

532
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,625
Xuanji, listen to me. Although Master looks so strict,

533
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:38,849
he worries about you the most.

534
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:41,594
The five sects are working together to catch Wu Tong.

535
00:40:41,594 --> 00:40:43,319
The five sects are working together?

536
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,060
- Isn't that awesome? <br> - What's so awesome?

537
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,155
So many people are looking for him, but they still can't find him. Right?

538
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:52,419
If I see Wu Tong, I'll poke a hole through his shoulder as well.

539
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:54,899
Let him have a taste of what it feels like.

540
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:57,168
Linglong, don't be so rash.

541
00:40:57,168 --> 00:40:59,321
Look. I'm fine now.

542
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:00,999
Just let Wu Tong go.

543
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,959
Don't provoke him anymore.

544
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,324
I think Wu Tong is narrow-minded and cruel.

545
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:09,679
If he can injure me, he might even kill someone one day.

546
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,420
We better stay away from him.

547
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,720
Why do you sound exactly like Sifeng?

548
00:41:16,413 --> 00:41:18,860
Because Sifeng told me the same thing.

549
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,179
He told me that

550
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:23,618
if we tie ourselves to a despicable man, we are the ones who will suffer in the end.

551
00:41:23,618 --> 00:41:26,179
I think Sifeng knows a lot of things.

552
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:29,133
I'm sure that he's right. Let's just take his advice.

553
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:33,494
I am your sister but you never take my advice.

554
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,299
What happened during the Hairpin Tournament?

555
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:40,540
Sifeng withdrew from the competition for you.

556
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,765
In the end, Senior Brother Shi Feng from Xuanyuan Sect

557
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,298
won the competition and got the hairpin.

558
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:47,220
Talking about this Hairpin Tournament...

559
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,100
Xuanyuan Sect is like a new force on the rise. A dark horse.

560
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,740
Xuanji, you didn't see

561
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,780
how proud those people from Xuanyuan Sect were.

562
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,841
They just acted like the master of all five sects

563
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:59,162
and started to order us around.

564
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:03,234
But Sifeng could have won.

565
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:08,185
Because of me, he...

566
00:42:20,183 --> 00:42:22,439
Father, you are looking for me?

567
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,541
Senior Brother Hao Chen.

568
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,072
Did I cause trouble again?

569
00:42:29,266 --> 00:42:33,048
Xuanji, do you know that everyone was very worried about you

570
00:42:33,048 --> 00:42:35,378
when you were wounded?

571
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:37,659
It's my fault for being too useless.

572
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:39,915
I made everyone worry about me.

573
00:42:39,915 --> 00:42:41,819
Then, do you want to improve yourself

574
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:44,129
so that they won't have to worry about you again?

575
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:46,881
Of course. I want to become more powerful.

576
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:50,571
Then, I'll be able to protect the important people around me.

577
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:58,169
Junior Sister Xuanji, do you want to come to Xuyang Peak to train together with me?

578
00:42:58,169 --> 00:43:00,948
- Xuyang Peak? <br> - Yes.

579
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:04,839
Uncle Master Heng Yang is willing to take you as his disciple.

580
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:09,488
He's willing to train you personally.

581
00:43:09,488 --> 00:43:11,310
Uncle Master Heng Yang?

582
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,899
I...

583
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:14,539
I'm so stupid.

584
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:16,980
But he still wants to take me as his disciple.

585
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,513
Has he become silly from age?

586
00:43:20,513 --> 00:43:22,099
Don't be so mannerless.

587
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,392
It's your blessing that Uncle Master Heng Yang

588
00:43:24,392 --> 00:43:26,799
is willing to accept you as his disciple.

589
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,630
I know. That's why I said

590
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:34,850
that he should accept an extraordinary disciple like Senior Brother Hao Chen.

591
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:37,714
Not a dummy like me.

592
00:43:37,714 --> 00:43:42,094
How do you know that you are not extraordinary?

593
00:43:42,094 --> 00:43:44,137
You are different from others.

594
00:43:44,137 --> 00:43:46,299
Your six senses are undeveloped.

595
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:49,373
Actually, that's your inborn talent, too.

596
00:43:49,373 --> 00:43:51,834
It's something that others don't have.

597
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:56,335
Having no six senses... is a good thing?

598
00:43:56,335 --> 00:43:58,458
Since God has already chosen a path for you,

599
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:00,728
no need to doubt yourself.

600
00:44:00,728 --> 00:44:03,770
You just need to find the right way and train hard.

601
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,870
I believe that you'll be able to achieve something great.

602
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:09,489
<i>Sifeng said the same thing, too.</i>

603
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:12,610
<i>Can I really become someone who's more powerful?</i>

604
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:21,689
Senior Brother, I'm willing to go to Xuyang Peak to train together with you.

605
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,511
Xuanji.

606
00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:52,299
Xuanji.

607
00:44:52,299 --> 00:44:55,861
<i>Xuanji. Xuanji.</i>

608
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:58,385
Sifeng, I am Linglong.

609
00:44:58,385 --> 00:45:01,732
The sound of this thing can really travel for miles.

610
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,739
<i>Linglong, how is Xuanji now?</i>

611
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:08,259
I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you that Xuanji is fine now,

612
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:10,095
but she was summoned by my father now.

613
00:45:10,095 --> 00:45:12,344
I'll tell you when she comes back, okay?

614
00:45:12,344 --> 00:45:13,739
Good.

615
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:18,610
Linglong, tell Xuanji that after she is done, to send me a message.

616
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,500
I'll wait for her.

617
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,180
<i>Don't worry.</i>

618
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:33,940

00:46:53,650 --> 00:47:00,300
♫ <i> You don't know where you're going until <br>you've been heartbroken </i> ♫

628
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,010
♫ <i> Concealed feelings deep in one's heart </i> ♫

00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:30,880
♫ <i> Before embracing, one must learn to let go first </i> ♫

634
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:37,680
♫ <i> The experience of an agonizing bone shaking pain </i> ♫

635
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:51,110
♫ <i> Like hands, like feet, like you, I can't be without </i> ♫
