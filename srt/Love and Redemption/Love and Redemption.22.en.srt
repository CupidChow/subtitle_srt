17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,570
Why are you trying to locate where the Tianxu Hall is?

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,950
I know now. It's because of Chu Xuanji again. Am I right?

19
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,630
Don't tell me you're trying to retrieve Linglong's primordial spirit?

20
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,595
Chu Xuanji, she has been locked up by Shaoyang Sect.

21
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:52,266
Master, it's useless even if you risk yourself doing this.

22
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:54,077
That's precisely the case.

23
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:57,279
I know she's very worried right now.

24
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:00,599
Master, didn't you say she was just a friend?

25
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,293
That Chu Xuanji, she fawns over her Sixth Senior for one moment,

26
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:07,519
and she's predestined to be with her senior in another.

27
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,501
- Master, are you still... <br> - So what?

28
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:12,057
She's my friend.

29
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:14,448
How can I just stand still and do nothing?

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,690
Give me the ring you obtained from Tianxu Hall.

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,250
South Superintendent sent me here to save you.

32
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,079
Save me!

33
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,979
- I'm with the North Superintendent! <br> - I can save you,

34
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,359
but South Superintendent is worried that you might be bribed by the human.

35
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:53,199
That's why you need to answer three questions to prove your identity.

36
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,199
Ask me then!

37
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,839
First question. Do you know who Wu Tong is?

38
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,759
Lord Wu Tong? Of course!

39
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,279
- He's the North Superintendent. <br> - Okay.

40
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:04,039
Second question. Where is Wu Tong right now?

41
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:07,269
Didn't he return to our headquarters after the Northern hideout was destroyed?

42
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,407
Didn't you know that?

43
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:11,019
Of course, I did.

44
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:12,276
I'm just testing you.

45
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,119
Last question. Where's the location of our headquarters?

46
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:17,367
Headquarters? I don't know that.

47
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:19,657
How could you not know its location?

48
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,599
I just joined our group.

49
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,430
I only heard that our headquarters isn't in the human realm.

50
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,921
I think it's in West...

51
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,396
Let me out! Is anyone there?

52
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:42,285
Let me out!

53
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,630
Xuanji, what are you doing?

54
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,519
Are you trying to disobey our sect leader now?

55
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,242
<i>I've spent much effort to seal Dingkun Sword's power.</i>

56
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:36,813
<i>But the seal is fading already?</i>

57
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,969
Senior Hao Chen, Father may ignore Linglong, but I won't.

58
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:46,215
Xuanji, why can't you understand the words that I've said?

59
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:48,360
Do you think Sect Leader doesn't care about Linglong?

60
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,266
Linglong is a trivial matter compared to the lives of all beings.

61
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:56,619
Your father is doing the right thing as a cultivator!

62
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:58,899
Xuanji, as the guardian of the secret ground,

63
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,486
you should understand this as well!

64
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:02,839
I don't understand!

65
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,456
Linglong's life is a life as well!

66
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:07,318
Why must we forsake Linglong?

67
00:05:07,318 --> 00:05:10,219
To me, the lives of all beings are too vague to me.

68
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:13,046
Linglong is the only one who has accompanied me all along.

69
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,939
I can't just ignore her!

70
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,600
Father and the rest may forsake her, but not me.

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,750
I must save her.

72
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,459
You're doing the exact opposite.

73
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,130
Xuanji, do you know you'll commit a grave mistake if you continue this?

74
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,917
Senior, humans aren't inanimate objects.

75
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:33,208
We mustn't be heartless. I did nothing wrong!

76
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,886
<i>I did nothing wrong!</i>

77
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,879
<i>Xuanji has been deeply influenced by her emotions and feelings.</i>

78
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,192
<i>I mustn't let her continue this.</i>

79
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:44,519
Fine. You can leave.

80
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,161
But you're not allowed to chase after Wolf.

81
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:49,259
You'll follow me back to Shaoyang and never leave again.

82
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,079
Senior! No one will save Linglong if I do that!

83
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,101
You've sworn to be the guardian of the secret ground.

84
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:58,139
Guarding the secret ground must always be your priority.

85
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,319
Now, the demons know that Devil Star's core is located in the secret ground.

86
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,959
It's a dire situation.

87
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,859
As a disciple of Xuyang Peak, you need to be responsible.

88
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:08,470
No! I want to save my sister!

89
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,259
Master and the rest should be able to protect the place. Why should I return?

90
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:13,893
Such impudence!

91
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,359
Senior, let me go! Let me save Linglong!

92
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:21,711
Xuanji, stop being stubborn.

93
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:23,320
This is what Sect Leader wanted as well.

94
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,453
You can't take Xuanji away.

95
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,078
She doesn't want to return.

96
00:06:29,078 --> 00:06:32,658
Yu Sifeng, you have interrupted the affairs of Shaoyang Sect on several occasions.

97
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,793
You've instigated her to disobey Sect Leader's orders.

98
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:37,123
Don't you think you're too much?

99
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:41,594
Senior Hao Chen, don't you think you're too heartless?

100
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,021
Now, Linglong has lost her primordial spirit and Minyan is still unconscious.

101
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:48,942
Xuanji will never be satisfied if you take her away.

102
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,550
Senior Hao Chen, please let her go.

103
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,272
You want me to let her go?

104
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:57,383
It'll depend on your ability!

105
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,626
Sifeng!

106
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,259
Linglong!

107
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,664
Linglong!

108
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:45,199
Yu Sifeng, do you think you can get yourself an unlikely relationship

109
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,610
by pestering Xuanji all the time?

110
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,794
Sifeng! Are you okay?

111
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:52,439
Sifeng, just ignore me!

112
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,979
Xuanji, don't tell me you're willing to return just like this?

113
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,370
I...

114
00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:00,325
Since you're not willing to do so,

115
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:03,250
I won't let him take you away.

116
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,459
Sifeng!

117
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,435
You've suffered internal injuries. Stop pretending to be strong.

118
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:15,933
Move away!

119
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,770
No way.

120
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,082
Yanran!

121
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,590
Stop!

122
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,983
Yanran, when did you get here?

123
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,649
Poison?

124
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:44,688
Why would a disciple of Dianjing Valley Sect use poison?

125
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:47,949
You're trying to hurt Sifeng! What's wrong with using poison?

126
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,859
Xuanji.

127
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:53,670
Aunt Yinghong? Hurry!

128
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,599
Hao Chen, Minyan is awake. He's in Linglong's room now.

129
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,999
Let Xuanji go and visit him.

130
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:03,119
Senior Hao Chen, I beg you! Please let me go!

131
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,792
I want to see how Sixth Senior is doing.

132
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,392
I grew up with Sixth Senior and Linglong.

133
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:09,399
I will only be relieved when both of them are fine.

134
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,688
Senior Hao Chen, I beg you! Please let me go!

135
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,592
Hao Chen, I'm your senior.

136
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:21,984
I'll make the decision for you. Release Xuan Ji right now.

137
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,210
Sifeng, let's go!

138
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,877
Sifeng!

139
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,371
You stay here.

140
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,628
Let me go!

141
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:42,213
Linglong, I'm Minyan.

142
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:45,829
Linglong, what's wrong with you? Look at me!

143
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:47,642
Linglong, I'm your Little Six!

144
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:51,206
What's wrong with you? Get up and look at me!

145
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,779
Linglong!

146
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,961
She's like that because her primordial spirit has been removed.

147
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,990
Linglong,

148
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:15,400
it's my fault.

149
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,203
I am useless.

150
00:10:17,203 --> 00:10:18,885
I am too useless!

151
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,532
I shouldn't have let Wu Tong take you away!

152
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:23,706
I should've saved you sooner!

153
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,119
Linglong, please wake up and scold me.

154
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,967
I won't talk back.

155
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:32,093
Linglong, I'll never make you angry again.

156
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:33,967
Please wake up, okay?

157
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:35,640
I'll make you happy from now on.

158
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,470
Linglong, please wake up. Okay?

159
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,150
Linglong, look.

160
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,550
I've been keeping the love lot with me.

161
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:53,199
This is our auspicious lot.

162
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,135
It says that we will have our happily ever after.

163
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:58,605
How could I give this lot to anyone else?

164
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:00,140
I'll use it to marry you.

165
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,277
I'll read it in public on the day of our wedding.

166
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:08,544
Linglong.

167
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:09,986
Linglong, please keep it.

168
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:11,844
Keep it. Don't reject me.

169
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:13,835
Keep it, okay?

170
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,318
Linglong, please keep it.

171
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:31,479
Sixth Senior, don't worry.

172
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,390
We'll retrieve her primordial spirit somehow.

173
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,354
Primordial spirit?

174
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,660
Sixth Senior, where are you going?

175
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,340
Minyan, we'll formulate a plan to save Linglong together.

176
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:45,820
Don't stop me if you're my brother.

177
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,539
Tell me then. Where are you going to find her primordial spirit?

178
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:50,140
I'll go to Tianxu Hall's hideout.

179
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:51,732
I brought her body out from that place.

180
00:11:51,732 --> 00:11:53,230
But she's still trapped inside there.

181
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:55,900
- I'll find her back! <br> - There's nothing left in there!

182
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,420
Wu Tong has escaped. All the demons have escaped.

183
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,094
- Her primordial spirit isn't there. <br> - I'll capture some demons then.

184
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,759
I'll ask every demon I encounter!

185
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,760
I'm sure I can find Wu Tong somehow!

186
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,920
I'll follow you.

187
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,500
Okay.

188
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,410
So, where do we start our search?

189
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,168
Stop!

190
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,940
Master.

191
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,174
Where are you going?

192
00:12:26,174 --> 00:12:28,839
We're going to Tianxu Hall's hideout to retrieve Linglong's primordial spirit.

193
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,954
Nonsense!

194
00:12:29,954 --> 00:12:33,859
Every sect is trying their best to deal with Tianxu Hall now.

195
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:37,245
You expect me to waste time worrying about you three?

196
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:40,014
Master, it's all my fault.

197
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:42,700
I didn't manage to protect Linglong.

198
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:45,302
Only my death can atone for this mistake.

199
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:47,906
Master, please give me a chance to atone for my mistake.

200
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:51,990
I'll save Linglong even if it means sacrificing my life.

201
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,388
Forget it. It's not your fault.

202
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:56,666
Get up now.

203
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,375
Minyan, we will save Linglong.

204
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,520
But you can't just go without a plan.

205
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,621
We're interrogating a demon from Tianxu Hall.

206
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:08,580
It's easier for us to act if we have some clues.

207
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,919
<i>Let me go!</i>

208
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,199
Why are you capturing me?

209
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,440
- Why are you doing this? <br> - Senior Hao Chen, let's talk.

210
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,600
- Why are you capturing me? <br> - Lu Yanran?

211
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,239
Let me go!

212
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,190
Senior Hao Chen, what are you doing?

213
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,452
She's very suspicious.

214
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:24,780
I've never seen pupils of Dianjing Valley Sect use poison.

215
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,070
I've invited Valley Master Rong here to verify her identity.

216
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:34,851
Senior, Yan Ran is indeed the disciple of Dianjing Valley Sect.

217
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:37,780
She traveled with us on our journey.

218
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,326
No! She's a spy from Tianxu Hall!

219
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:41,896
I saw it for myself!

220
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:43,967
Zhong Minyan, don't frame me!

221
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:45,724
Who's the spy here? I–

222
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,198
Minyan, I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.

223
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:51,879
Yanran did infiltrate Tianxu Hall, but it's not what you think.

224
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,599
Minyan, put down your sword. Let's talk this over.

225
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,439
There's no misunderstanding! She's with Tianxu Hall!

226
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,420
She followed Wu Tong's orders!

227
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,399
I saw it for myself! She killed our people without mercy!

228
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,340
You mustn't fall for her tricks!

229
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,100
Tell me! Where did Wu Tong hide Linglong's primordial spirit?

230
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,620
I didn't! I didn't kill your people!

231
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,900
Sifeng, I–

232
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,460
Minyan, put down your sword for now.

233
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,860
Maybe Valley Master Rong has different plans for her.

234
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,767
Don't be reckless.

235
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:23,552
No need for that!

236
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,129
She's not from my sect.

237
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:30,672
Although I do have a disciple named Lu Yanran,

238
00:14:30,673 --> 00:14:34,632
she doesn't look like her, and she has returned to our sect.

239
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:35,879
Who exactly are you?

240
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,820
Why are you pretending to be a disciple of my sect? What's your motive?

241
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,630
Don't tell me you're a spy from Tianxu Hall?

242
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,893
My identity is none of your business!

243
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:47,239
Senior Hao Chen!

244
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,390
How dare you use poison!

245
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,930
Remove your disguise and tell us your motive!

246
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,079
Lu Yanran is Little Silver Flower?

247
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,310
Sifeng, this...

248
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,840
Yu Sifeng!

249
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:04,879
Why did you hide the demon?

250
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,340
What's your connection with her?

251
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,522
Hero Yu, what exactly is going on?

252
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,910
Elders, I did hide something from you all.

253
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,895
Indeed. She's not Lu Yanran from the Dianjing Valley Sect.

254
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:24,138
She's my spirit beast, Little Silver Flower.

255
00:15:24,138 --> 00:15:27,759
She infiltrated Tianxu Hall under my command.

256
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,740
But she's not a spy.

257
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,240
Your spirit beast?

258
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,888
According to the Demon Manual,

259
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,712
spirit beasts can only acquire human form by feeding on human blood.

260
00:15:35,713 --> 00:15:38,383
They're vicious and evil.

261
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,029
Deputy Chief,

262
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:42,939
the Lize Palace actually allowed one of your disciples to keep this demon?

263
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,559
And you even let that demon pretend to be one of my disciples?

264
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,500
What's the meaning of this?

265
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,860
I don't know anything about this, and it has nothing to do with our sect.

266
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,755
Sifeng, explain yourself!

267
00:15:53,756 --> 00:15:56,186
Don't try and ruin our reputation!

268
00:15:56,186 --> 00:15:58,879
The Demon Manual was written by our ancestors.

269
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,429
They have limited knowledge.

270
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,440
Little Silver Flower is not a demon.

271
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,087
She acquired her human form because she consumed an immortal fruit.

272
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:08,558
And she has never harmed anyone before.

273
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:10,880
But the people have prejudices against her kind.

274
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,764
In order to avoid any misunderstandings,

275
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,755
I had to cover up her identity.

276
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:17,919
After that, Tianxu Hall wreaked havoc.

277
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,140
I thought that it would be easier for her to sneak into Tianxu Hall

278
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,186
since she's not a human.

279
00:16:24,187 --> 00:16:28,110
I was the one behind everything. I did it out of good intentions.

280
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,285
How do you explain the fact that she killed our people?

281
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:35,870
She's my spirit beast. We can sense each other.

282
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,510
I'd know immediately if she killed someone.

283
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,620
Here, I promise that

284
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,450
Little Silver Flower will never commit such atrocious acts.

285
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,995
Here, I also promise that

286
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:51,822
LIttle Silver Flower has always been loyal to Sifeng and never betrayed him.

287
00:16:51,822 --> 00:16:54,314
And she didn't kill anyone.

288
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,130
How can you be guarantors for her own acts?

289
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,300
Are you saying that I'm maligning her?

290
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:07,919
Are you saying that what I'd seen for myself was fake?

291
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,159
You don't believe me?

292
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:12,729
Minyan, it's not that I don't believe you.

293
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:14,580
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.

294
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,125
A misunderstanding?

295
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,390
Release it and everything will be clear.

296
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,911
Hero Yu, it's not that I'm suspicious of your character.

297
00:17:22,912 --> 00:17:24,915
But Tianxu Hall just attacked us

298
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,757
and they managed to steal two spirit keys.

299
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:29,684
Everyone on Fuyu Island is jittery.

300
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:33,059
I find it hard to believe your statements.

301
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,336
How about this? Release the spirit beast for now.

302
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:39,682
We'll decide what to do after our discussion.

303
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:43,390
Sorry, I'm unable to do that.

304
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,920
Yu Sifeng!

305
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,739
Are you... Are you trying to work together with the demons?

306
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:51,599
Did you forget your identity as a cultivator?

307
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,550
There's no demon for me to work together with.

308
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:56,540
What do you mean by this?

309
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,060
Why are you risking yourself to protect her?

310
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,776
Are you trying to ignore justice and righteousness because of your relationship with her?

311
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:06,499
Sixth Senior, I believe him.

312
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:07,973
I've been with Little Silver Flower for so long.

313
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:10,660
She has never exuded any demonic scent.

314
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,730
Father, please believe in Sifeng.

315
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,748
Xuanji, stop your nonsense.

316
00:18:16,748 --> 00:18:18,940
Why would Minyan lie to us?

317
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,660
How can you prove this when you were not around?

318
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,126
I–

319
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:29,159
Sixth Senior, I'm sure you're mistaken.

320
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,110
Xuanji, I wasn't mistaken!

321
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,920
You don't believe me as well?

322
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,260
I–

323
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,677
Sifeng, I treat you as my brother.

324
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:41,170
I won't suspect you, but I don't believe that demon.

325
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,099
Are you sure your sense is correct all the time?

326
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:45,773
I saw her killing someone personally!

327
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:47,826
She's with Tianxu Hall!

328
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,025
Don't let her trick you!

329
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:51,620
Release her.

330
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,389
I just want to know where Wu Tong is in order to save Linglong and Second Senior!

331
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,650
Minyan, both of us want to save Linglong,

332
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,271
but Little Silver Flower doesn't know where Wu Tong is.

333
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,398
It's no use forcing her.

334
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,826
My sense has never been mistaken.

335
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:16,430
I managed to find their hideout because of that sense.

336
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,439
It's all thanks to Little Silver Flower.

337
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,545
Minyan, Little Silver Flower was hurt because she was trying to protect me from Wu Tong.

338
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:25,723
You shouldn't blame her.

339
00:19:25,723 --> 00:19:29,694
My Lord! The demon in the cell was murdered!

340
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,918
There's Demon Corpse Poison on the weapon.

341
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,078
The poison entered his body and dissolved him.

342
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:48,899
He was actually murdered?

343
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,210
There are still demons hiding on Fuyu Island indeed.

344
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,810
Sect Leaders, look.

345
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,600
You didn't touch the weapon at all.

346
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,290
Why does your sleeve have the same poison on it?

347
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,952
Take him down!

348
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,639
Wait! This must be a misunderstanding!

349
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,440
Sifeng, what exactly are you doing?

350
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,370
What's going on?

351
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:22,170
Yu Sifeng, I'll treat it as if you acted rashly in order to protect the snake demon.

352
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,879
But now, all the evidence is saying that you're the culprit behind this.

353
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,140
How do you explain this?

354
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,706
I'm sure you're related to this!

355
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:30,917
It's definitely not Sifeng.

356
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:33,006
Sifeng, hurry and explain yourself!

357
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:34,823
Xuanji.

358
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,591
Elders, I did come to the cell before.

359
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:46,715
I just wanted to make the demon reveal Wu Tong's location.

360
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:50,610
But someone behind me murdered the demon.

361
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,764
As for the blood on my sleeve,

362
00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:57,030
I got the stain when I was trying to avoid the weapon.

363
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,038
I didn't expect the weapon to be coated with poison.

364
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,300
And I tried to pursue the assailant.

365
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,450
Where is he then? Did you catch him?

366
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,598
I lost him.

367
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,482
After that, many things happened

368
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:17,494
and I couldn't tell you in time.

369
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:21,350
But now, it is proven that there are demons hiding on Fuyu Island.

370
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,918
How can we trust your claim without any evidence?

371
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:26,803
You said there are demons hiding on Fuyu Island?

372
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:29,986
Most likely, it's the snake demon you're not willing to release.

373
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:32,900
Yet you're trying to protect her. You're very suspicious!

374
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,506
Everything I said was the truth.

375
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:36,441
I saw the demon's back.

376
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,859
Elders, please give me some time.

377
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,810
I'll capture the demon hiding on the island.

378
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,190
I'll find out the truth.

379
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,800
You'll go nowhere.

380
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,355
You're just trying to escape because I caught you red-handed.

381
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:49,275
That's not what I mean.

382
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:51,826
I just need a chance to prove my innocence.

383
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:54,864
I'm willing to join Sifeng on his search.

384
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:58,079
You don't need to involve yourself.

385
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,310
I want to help you.

386
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,930
Xuanji!

387
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,466
Yu Sifeng, I think you should explain yourself.

388
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:08,840
I still don't understand something.

389
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,696
You said you ordered your spirit beast to infiltrate Tianxu Hall.

390
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:14,486
What's the reason behind that?

391
00:22:14,486 --> 00:22:18,910
I wanted her to find out the location of their hideout

392
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,283
so that I could obtain more information.

393
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,574
But your spirit beast had infiltrated Tianxu Hall long ago.

394
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:27,232
She should've told you the location long ago.

395
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:30,603
Why didn't you mention it to anyone before?

396
00:22:30,603 --> 00:22:32,279
What's wrong?

397
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,115
Is it because you didn't have enough time?

398
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:36,765
Or is it because you didn't plan to tell us?

399
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:39,340
You're full of deceit.

400
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,039
I'm afraid your spirit beast was with Tianxu Hall in the first place.

401
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,190
You wanted to cover up for her, but your lies are full of flaws.

402
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,509
Senior Hao Chen, your deduction is illogical.

403
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,760
You still don't want to admit it?

404
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,905
How dare you do something like this!

405
00:22:56,906 --> 00:23:00,418
It's either you were bewitched by the snake demon or

406
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:04,700
you were Tianxu Hall's spy in the first place.

407
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,260
No! Sifeng is not a demon!

408
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,019
You are saying that he's the culprit without investigating the truth! This isn't right!

409
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:14,679
Xuanji, youngsters shouldn't interrupt when elders are talking!

410
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:15,710
Father, but you...

411
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,820
What's the point of defending him?

412
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,390
In my opinion, this is all because of that snake demon.

413
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,060
Sifeng, if you want to prove your innocence,

414
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,663
you should release the snake demon and let everyone judge her.

415
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:29,314
It's better for you and everyone else.

416
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,083
Little Silver Flower isn't a demon.

417
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:35,094
She's my spirit beast.

418
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:37,698
How could I let her suffer for no reason?

419
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:42,520
If I release her like this, I'm afraid she wouldn't survive.

420
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,321
Until when are you going to be stubborn?

421
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:47,580
Must you involve yourself in this matter?

422
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,279
Where did you hide her? Let her out!

423
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,336
Minyan, be rational.

424
00:23:53,336 --> 00:23:55,319
You're the irrational one here.

425
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,626
I need to wake you up!

426
00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:00,448
Sixth Senior!

427
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,150
Sect Leaders, look!

428
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,410
The black and white ring?

429
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,220
This ring belongs to Tianxu Hall.

430
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,230
You still dare to deny that you're a demon when you have this?

431
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,472
Little Silver Flower acquired this when she infiltrated Tianxu Hall.

432
00:24:28,473 --> 00:24:30,164
It isn't surprising that I have this.

433
00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:33,290
You! How dare you deny the truth!

434
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,891
Sifeng!

435
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,670
Sifeng!

436
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,365
Xuanji!

437
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:48,479
Deputy Chief, I'm impressed.

438
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,839
But Yu Sifeng is a disciple of the Lize Palace.

439
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,590
Deputy Chief, please find out the truth.

440
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,528
This concerns the very existence of all living beings.

441
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:01,346
Lize Palace will never show favoritism.

442
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,225
You rebel, you insist on doing this by yourself.

443
00:25:05,226 --> 00:25:08,016
Even Lize Palace can't protect you right now.

444
00:25:08,016 --> 00:25:12,710
Sect Leaders, you three may interrogate him.

445
00:25:13,627 --> 00:25:15,140
Si Feng!

446
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,590
Xuanji, that's enough.

447
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,675
Senior, Sifeng isn't a demon. He didn't do all those things.

448
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:25,739
He has nothing to do with Tianxu Hall at all.

449
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:27,420
We've engaged Tianxu Hall several times.

450
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,703
He has slain so many demons. He was hurt by them as well.

451
00:25:29,703 --> 00:25:33,180
How could he be a demon? They're arresting the wrong person.

452
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,231
It's no use even if you tell me all this.

453
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:39,002
The three sect leaders will make their own decisions.

454
00:25:39,002 --> 00:25:42,092
I've pleaded with Uncle Dongfang and the rest,

455
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:44,060
but they ignored me.

456
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,950
Senior, Sifeng will surely suffer inside the cell.

457
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,915
So are you asking me to plead with them?

458
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:54,335
- I... <br> - Do you know why I sealed your powers?

459
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:56,279
I didn't want you to act recklessly.

460
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,399
Are you still trying to involve the entire Shaoyang Sect in this?

461
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,410
But I know Sifeng was framed.

462
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:04,373
Only you think that he's framed.

463
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:06,927
Every piece of evidence is pointing towards him right now.

464
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:09,152
Even Lize Palace is staying out of this.

465
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:10,859
But you still insist on defending him.

466
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:15,040
Do you know how terrible it would be

467
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,950
if the other sects think that our sect is in cahoots with the demons?

468
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,460
But I know that Sifeng isn't a demon.

469
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,297
Senior, he doesn't have a demonic scent.

470
00:26:24,297 --> 00:26:26,158
It's the same for Little Silver Flower.

471
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,331
I've known her for so long. We've been through a lot together.

472
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:33,769
If he's a demon, I would've known it.

473
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:38,198
Did you forget that Wolf managed to deceive us with his disguise?

474
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:40,539
They have a way to cover their scent.

475
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,660
But it has flaws.

476
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,868
When Wolf was transforming, I could smell his demonic scent.

477
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:47,640
But it's different for Sifeng.

478
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:51,964
Senior, don't you believe me? I don't know how to tell lies.

479
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:56,199
But who knows? Maybe they have a better method to cover up their scent.

480
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,740
Xuanji, there's nothing certain in this world.

481
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,359
What we can do is prepare ourselves and take precautions.

482
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,539
- But... <br> - Enough!

483
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:08,439
If he's not a demon and he didn't commit any crime,

484
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,700
the three sect leaders will release him naturally.

485
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,352
If you believe in him, you should wait.

486
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:16,340
We will know the result soon.

487
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,578
But there's one thing. I won't allow you to plead for Yu Sifeng anymore

488
00:27:19,578 --> 00:27:22,600
and create trouble for your father. Do you understand?

489
00:27:23,068 --> 00:27:24,550
If so,

490
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,460
Senior, can you unseal my powers?

491
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,520
Impossible.

492
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,740
If it weren't for the fact that we can't leave the island,

493
00:27:33,741 --> 00:27:36,531
I wouldn't have let you stay here.

494
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:40,286
I won't unseal your powers before we return to Shaoyang

495
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:43,530
so that you won't act recklessly based on your impulse.

496
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,388
In the end, you still don't believe me.

497
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:48,500
You don't believe that Sifeng isn't a demon.

498
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:54,030
Don't worry, I will find the hidden demon and prove Sifeng's innocence.

499
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,046
Xuanji!

500
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,627
Deputy Chief.

501
00:28:08,627 --> 00:28:11,740
What has Yu Sifeng's matter got to do with you?

502
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,559
You're considerate.

503
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,151
Becoming his friend is not the reason I allowed you to follow him.

504
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:18,500
I don't dare to do so.

505
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,977
I'm doing this for Lize Palace's sake.

506
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:22,900
If it's for Lize Palace's sake, you should've disassociated from him.

507
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,597
If the other sects think that he's in cahoots with the demons,

508
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:27,639
just let it be.

509
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,510
It has nothing to do with Lize Palace. Do you understand?

510
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,785
Yes.

511
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:36,306
Dianjing Valley Sect is an expert in creating torture devices.

512
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:40,797
Yu Sifeng may be tough, but you aren't.

513
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:43,758
You should care for your own body.

514
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,199
You got to escape the 13 Punishments and leave Lize Palace once again,

515
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,910
even though you lost your mask.

516
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:56,589
Ruo Yu, I've done so much for you, you know?

517
00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:59,605
You still owe me some punishments.

518
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:02,410
Didn't you say you wanted to bring your sister out?

519
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:11,348
Kneel here and reflect on your actions.

520
00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:27,223
Why has it come to this?

521
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,710
Everything went wrong

522
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,166
after I lost you.

523
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,705
First, it was you. Now, it's Sifeng.

524
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:40,318
Why is he so insistent on defending that snake demon?

525
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,690
Why does he not believe in me?

526
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,040
I'm sure that demon snake knows something.

527
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,690
I can find out where Wu Tong is as long as he releases that demon.

528
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,217
Why isn't he trying to help me?

529
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,449
Linglong,

530
00:30:00,324 --> 00:30:02,754
I'll bring you back for sure.

531
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,808
I'll bring you back,

532
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,769
no matter where he's hiding you.

533
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,724
Look at your bad temper.

534
00:31:25,724 --> 00:31:29,410
Calm down. I won't keep you here for too long.

535
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,750
I thought of something interesting.

536
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,657
Do you know what this is?

537
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,460
It's the Soul Bell.

538
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:09,100
I'll absorb your primordial spirit and keep your soul intact.

539
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,973
Your life won't be in danger, but you'll be unconscious.

540
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:15,104
And it'll be easy for me to tame you.

541
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:19,434
When your body only listens to me,

542
00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:22,284
I'll give you back your primordial spirit.

543
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,830
I would rather die than become your puppet.

544
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:34,439
Kill me!

545
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,850
It's a pity that they've snatched your body,

546
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,510
but I can create another body for you.

547
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,902
You will be mine in the end.

548
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,815
My Lord, I found a Canna Lily Spirit that's going to acquire a human form soon,

549
00:32:55,815 --> 00:32:57,367
but it's experiencing heavenly tribulation.

550
00:32:57,368 --> 00:33:00,618
My Lord, is that spirit what you wanted?

551
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:02,899
Canna Lily Spirit?

552
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,754
Great.

553
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,105
It's so scary! Anyone there? Come and save me!

554
00:33:11,105 --> 00:33:14,095
The heavenly tribulation is too scary!

555
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,748
Did you help me get through it?

556
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:30,370
Did you save me? I'll repay you.

557
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,630
What do you want? I can give you anything.

558
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,459
Do you want me to marry you?

559
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:38,980
I want you to transform into the image I want.

560
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,679
Is that so? That's easy.

561
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,730
Can I come closer? I want to see the image inside your mind.

562
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,274
Is this the face you want? Are you satisfied?

563
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,530
Don't you like it?

564
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,395
The appearance is pretty good.

565
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,773
But you lack something.

566
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,855
I'll leave your soul intact. And leave half of your primordial spirit inside.

567
00:34:53,855 --> 00:34:56,610
You'll only remember that we met before.

568
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,701
I don't want anything else.

569
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,537
Only half of her primordial spirit entered the body?

570
00:35:17,538 --> 00:35:20,668
It's hard to contain it using a different body indeed.

571
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,110
So stubborn. This will have to do then.

572
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,544
You will be mine in the end.

573
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,610
Who are you? Why are you so close to me?

574
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,635
What are you laughing at? I'll scratch your face if you laugh!

575
00:36:03,636 --> 00:36:05,985
You little ingrate,

576
00:36:05,986 --> 00:36:10,056
I helped you to get through the heavenly tribulation, you know?

577
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,079
I would've survived even if you hadn't helped me.

578
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:23,088
But since you're a good guy, I won't hold it against you.

579
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,350
Good guy?

580
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,159
I'm not a good guy. I only mind my own business.

581
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,300
I saved you because you were destined to be mine.

582
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,439
I've named you as well. Your name is Linglong.

583
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:41,370
I thought you were a good guy. So, you're a tyrant.

584
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:45,754
But I like the name Linglong.

585
00:36:45,754 --> 00:36:47,639
I'll accept it for now.

586
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,595
As for me,

587
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,730
we can talk about it when you catch me.

588
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,290
I told you before. You are mine.

589
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,272
Where are you trying to go?

590
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,890
<i>Where is that demon hiding?</i>

591
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,342
<i>Why can't I smell it?</i>

592
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,172
You've searched the entire Fuyu Island.

593
00:37:53,172 --> 00:37:55,279
You searched all the places you could.

594
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,093
Did you find anything?

595
00:37:57,093 --> 00:38:00,043
Sixth Senior, you've been following me?

596
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:03,140
Master wanted me to look after you. He didn't want you to go overboard.

597
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,279
Do you think Master Dongfang doesn't know what you're up to?

598
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,310
He let you off because Master is around.

599
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,823
But you went to watch the training of his disciples.

600
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,386
That is a huge taboo.

601
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:16,180
I didn't want to watch their training.

602
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,120
I just wanted to see if I could sense any demonic scent from them.

603
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,780
No one can enter or leave Fuyu Island now. I'm sure the demon is still here.

604
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,357
I need to find it. If not, Sifeng will be in danger.

605
00:38:25,357 --> 00:38:26,839
Xuanji, that's enough.

606
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,335
That demon is in the cell.

607
00:38:28,335 --> 00:38:31,185
It's the snake demon Sifeng wanted to defend so much.

608
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:35,521
Everything will be solved as long as he releases her.

609
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:42,268
Sifeng knows that Linglong will never return if we don't retrieve

610
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,471
her primordial spirit within three months.

611
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:48,639
But he doesn't care at all.

612
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,260
Now, do you still think what Sifeng was right?

613
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,324
Sixth Senior, how could you think of Sifeng in that way?

614
00:38:55,325 --> 00:38:57,260
Sifeng cares about Linglong, too.

615
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,895
Like us, he's worried about Linglong as well.

616
00:38:59,895 --> 00:39:01,497
But you arrested the wrong person.

617
00:39:01,497 --> 00:39:03,030
It's useless if you interrogate him.

618
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,250
This...

619
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,900
I don't know what to think right now.

620
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,180
I only know that Little Silver Flower is our only clue.

621
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,010
Valley Master Rong and the rest will force an answer from him.

622
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,399
Master told me that they're torturing Sifeng right now.

623
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,839
But he's still very stubborn. He's asking for trouble.

624
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,359
They tortured him?

625
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,405
How could they do that?

626
00:39:27,405 --> 00:39:29,079
Xuanji!

627
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,216
Where is the stronghold of Tianxu Hall?

628
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:47,367
And where did Wolf take Qing Rong?

629
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,990
I'm not a demon from Tianxu Hall.

630
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,590
If I did work for the Tianxu Hall,

631
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:58,374
why do I need to reveal the deceit of your wife?

632
00:39:58,374 --> 00:40:02,030
Isn't it better for me to escape with her while holding the spirit keys?

633
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,136
Master Dongfang, think about it.

634
00:40:10,136 --> 00:40:14,896
Coincidentally, every evidence is pointing towards me,

635
00:40:14,896 --> 00:40:17,610
but the points don't make sense.

636
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:25,213
I could've stolen the Destiny Pearl from Xuanji.

637
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:28,784
Why do I need to attack my own hideout

638
00:40:28,784 --> 00:40:32,384
and save Linglong when it could've revealed my identity?

639
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,272
Tianxu Hall is full of devious plans.

640
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:43,858
Who knows? Maybe this is your plan to steal all four spirit keys from us.

641
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,638
I believed in Ouyang before.

642
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:48,309
And I believed in Qing Rong as well.

643
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:54,270
But now, I know that believing in others is the biggest mistake in my life.

644
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,150
Master Dongfang, I understand.

645
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,183
Once bitten, twice shy.

646
00:41:10,184 --> 00:41:12,674
But I'm not a demon.

647
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:15,692
Even if you hold me captive,

648
00:41:16,285 --> 00:41:19,595
you're only wasting your time.

649
00:41:19,595 --> 00:41:24,719
There are demons hiding on the island.

650
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,026
You're just trying to buy time.

651
00:41:28,026 --> 00:41:31,130
Fine, I'll grant you your wish.

652
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,390
Master Dongfang,

653
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,319
didn't we agree that we'd interrogate him together?

654
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,860
What now?

655
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,524
You did this out of your personal intention.

656
00:41:52,525 --> 00:41:57,150
Do you think your personal matters are more important than our sects'?

657
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,644
Valley Master Rong, it's not that serious.

658
00:41:58,645 --> 00:42:00,039
I did this out of personal intention, indeed.

659
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:05,180
But I just wanted to solve my matters on Fuyu Island.

660
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,860
I will always consider the bigger picture.

661
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:13,585
Moreover, isn't it our goal to find out their plans and location?

662
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:14,940
That's good to hear.

663
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,421
Now, it's time for us to be united.

664
00:42:18,421 --> 00:42:20,745
We mustn't create any unnecessary trouble.

665
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,796
Did he reveal anything?

666
00:42:22,796 --> 00:42:24,820
This is a heavy punishment.

667
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,684
If he's innocent, we'll...

668
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:30,513
Sect Leader Chu, the enemies will overwhelm us soon.

669
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:33,943
This is not the time for you to be merciful.

670
00:42:33,943 --> 00:42:36,746
If Tianxu Hall executes their plans,

671
00:42:36,746 --> 00:42:40,910
if they steal the spirit keys from Lize Palace and Dianjung Valley Sect

672
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:45,140
and unseal the Crystal Lamp, everything will be too late.

673
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:49,270
Moreover, he's a huge suspect. How is he innocent?

674
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:52,713
This demon is very tough.

675
00:42:52,713 --> 00:42:57,565
He won't tell us the truth if we don't torture him harshly.

676
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,740
Yu Sifeng,

677
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,039
these are the Hell's Nails. They're made for interrogations.

678
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,682
They can't kill you

679
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:14,319
but you will suffer unimaginable pain when they're in your body.

680
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,920
I won't stop until you can't stand the pain and tell us the truth.

681
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,294
Before I use them, I'll give you one last chance.

682
00:43:23,295 --> 00:43:25,050
You better know what's good for you.

683
00:43:25,051 --> 00:43:27,621
I've told you the truth.

684
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,290
If you still don't believe in me,

685
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:34,256
I have no words to say.

686
00:43:35,164 --> 00:43:38,014
Let's see how long you can last!

687
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,140
No one is to enter without Master Dongfang's permission.

688
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,930
Miss Chu, please return.

689
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,140
I...

690
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,932
Let me in. There's an emergency. I need to see my father.

691
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:02,119
Stop it now. Are you trying to force your way through?

692
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,450
You'll create trouble for Master if you continue this.

693
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,500
- Return with me! <br> - Sifeng is innocent!

694
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,364
He can't stand the torture! You can't do this!

695
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:15,240
Tell me honestly... Is Dianjing Valley Sect the next target of Tianxu Hall?

696
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,998
How do you plan your attacks?

697
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,161
Where is the stronghold of Tianxu Hall?

698
00:44:33,162 --> 00:44:36,892
Are there any other spies besides you?

699
00:44:36,892 --> 00:44:40,919
Yu Sifeng, if you're truly innocent,

700
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,088
you should release your spirit beast

701
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:46,438
so you can give us an explanation.

702
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,688
Give you an explanation?

703
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,390
The Five Great Sects were arrogant

704
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:07,232
and harbored selfish desires.

705
00:45:07,232 --> 00:45:10,030
All of you didn't treat Tianxu Hall seriously.

706
00:45:11,274 --> 00:45:16,404
Now that everything has gone to hell and the spirit keys are stolen,

707
00:45:16,404 --> 00:45:22,716
you are just trying to find an excuse for your mistakes.

708
00:45:22,716 --> 00:45:25,566
You wanted someone to be the scapegoat.

709
00:45:25,566 --> 00:45:30,932
My spirit beast and I will never be your scapegoats.

710
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:39,010
I'll endure the punishment myself.

711
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,112
Fine!

712
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:51,840
