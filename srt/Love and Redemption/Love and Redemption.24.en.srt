<i>[EPISODE 24]</i>

18
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,099
The demon clan has been running amok with a long list of crimes.

19
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:25,319
They even attacked Fuyu Island in the light of day.

20
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,019
They killed our fellow disciples and took our treasure.

21
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,899
The world is in a perilous position right now.

22
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:32,657
As cultivators,

23
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:35,732
we should destroy those demons to uphold justice for the people!

24
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:38,737
Am I right, everybody?

25
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:40,059
<i>Yes!</i>

26
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,299
But the demon clan is very cunning.

27
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,039
They can take the shape of humans. They are impossible to guard against.

28
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:51,639
If we want to defeat them, we have to check our own people first before checking the others.

29
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,139
Today, a disciple of Lize Palace, Yu Sifeng,

30
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:57,802
colluded with the demons in Tianxu Hall to bring chaos to the world.

31
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,299
He should be killed.

32
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:02,477
But we cultivators are always fair and square.

33
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:05,604
We won't kill an innocent without solid evidence.

34
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:09,579
So, we'll use the Demon Whip to prove his identity.

35
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:12,119
If he can take three whips from the Demon Whip,

36
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:14,494
he can prove his innocence and he'll be pardoned.

37
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,250
If he reveals his true demonic form under the whip,

38
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,526
we'll punish him on the spot without mercy!

39
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:24,168
<i>Punish him on the spot without mercy!</i>

40
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,560
Demon Whip!

41
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:51,460
Senior! Senior!

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,046
Senior, Sifeng is not a demon.

43
00:03:57,046 --> 00:04:00,105
You can't accuse him wrongly. Please let him go.

44
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,999
He sent a spirit beast to kill our disciple in Tianxu Hall. He was caught red-handed.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,160
We are here to test his real identity. Other things are unimportant now.

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,841
Sifeng sent Little Silver Flower to Tianxu Hall because of me.

47
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:13,679
He wanted to get the Mirror of Origin to help me restore my six senses.

48
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,483
So, he has nothing to do with Tianxu Hall.

49
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,419
Whether or not he's colluding with them, you can't vouch for him.

50
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:22,653
We'll find out after three whips of the Demon Whip.

51
00:04:22,654 --> 00:04:24,699
- Senior! <br> - Xuanji!

52
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,625
Stop fooling around.

53
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,667
Sifeng!

54
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,109
Sifeng! Sifeng!

55
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,219
- Sifeng. <br> - Sifeng!

56
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,363
Aunt Yinghong, let go of me!

57
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,899
Sifeng!

58
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,901
Please stop hitting him with the Demon Whip.

59
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,739
Yu Sifeng, tell me!

60
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,730
Are you a demon?

61
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,970
<i>[LONGYIN]</i>

62
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,820

63
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,887
said it many times.

64
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:48,970
This is just the answer that you want.

65
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,890
No matter what I say,

66
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,181
it'll be useless.

67
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:59,226
Two more whips.

68
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,998
Come on.

69
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:03,819
Okay.

70
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:06,610
No! Sifeng!

71
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,685
Sifeng!

72
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,470
No!

73
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,579
Stop!

74
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:16,860
Sifeng!

75
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,096
Sifeng! Sifeng!

76
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,777
You already hit him twice.

77
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:37,119
If he's a demon, he would've shown himself.

78
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:40,521
If you keep hitting him, he'll die!

79
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,039
Sifeng! Sifeng!

80
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:47,359
Master, please spare him.

81
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,919
Yes, Sect Leader. He has already been beaten twice.

82
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,672
But there's no trace of a demon at all. How about we stop?

83
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:55,239
I'm afraid that he'll die if you hit him again.

84
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,199
<i>[LONGYIN]</i>

85
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,206
My fellow sect leaders, what say you about the third whip?

86
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:03,159
We promised to give him three whips.

87
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,059
How can we just stop?

88
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:08,003
Even if he's not a demon, he's still harboring a demon.

89
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:10,138
If he doesn't hand in the demon, continue to whip him.

90
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,821
Since it has already been decided, let's not hesitate anymore.

91
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:15,619
Deputy Chief, what about you?

92
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:17,559
Lize Palace has never been biased.

93
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,933
It'll be bad if others talk behind our back.

94
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:21,956
If you want to whip him, go ahead.

95
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,477
Tell us.

96
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:31,995
If you tell us, your life will be spared.

100
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,770
One... One more whip.

101
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,570
<i>No such thing as worth it or not.</i>

Valley Master Rong,

119
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:45,919
I'll settle this for you.

00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,770
Xuanji, are you looking for death?

121
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,730
Come down now!

122
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,791

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,372
it doesn't matter.

126
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,550
Here.

127
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,848
Don't think that you'll be safe just because the Demon Whip is broken.

128
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:26,277
Let me tell you. Dream on.

129
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:28,619
I'm going to interrogate you with Hell's Nail.

130
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:31,019
I'll torture you for as long as it takes

131
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,453
until you admit to your crime.

132
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:34,974
Master!

133
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,267
Who dares touch my disciple?

134
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:16,570
Valley Master Rong, you are really determined to attack my disciple.

135
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,739
We didn't know that you were here.

136
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,350
- Sorry for not welcoming you properly. <br> - Don't be so pretentious.

137
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,221
If I was late any longer, my disciple would be dead.

138
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,106
- Ruo Yu. <br> - Here.

139
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:30,917
- Bring Sifeng back first. <br> - Yes, Palace Master.

140
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:38,339
Sifeng. Sifeng.

141
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:39,579
Let's go.

142
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:42,379
You weren't here. So, you didn't know that

143
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:45,709
your disciple was being suspected of colluding with the demon clan.

144
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:50,039
Are you saying that he killed a demon to silence it?

145
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,430
Look at this.

146
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,882
This demon was trying to escape after killing it with this secret weapon

147
00:12:55,882 --> 00:12:58,442
and he ran into me on the island.

148
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:08,695
The poison on this demon's hand is indeed the one used to silence the demon.

149
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,323
You are really fantastic.

150
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:18,592
Do you really think that Lize Palace is useless?

151
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,439
Don't be mad.

152
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,950
Even if your disciple is not responsible for killing that demon,

153
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,940
he sent his spirit beast to Tianxu Hall to kill our disciple.

154
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,229
He was caught red-handed.

155
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:29,841
Bring him here.

156
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,639
Is this the dead disciple you mean?

157
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,059
Take a good look at him.

158
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,194
Is he dead or alive?

159
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:44,625
Minyan, take a look at him.

160
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:49,005
How is this possible?

161
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:51,545
Aren't you dead? I saw it myself.

162
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:53,739
That day, I fainted after being stabbed.

163
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:57,576
But I woke up after that and I was lying on a mass grave behind the mountains.

164
00:13:57,576 --> 00:13:59,952
This is the secret art of Lize Palace.

165
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:02,939
You can stab the Qi acupoint to fake death.

166
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:06,499
My disciple taught this to his spirit beast

167
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,579
so that his spirit beast could escape Tianxu Hall

168
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,159
and save this person's life.

169
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,519
The funny thing is, all of you elders are so ignorant.

170
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,359
You are so self-righteous and requite kindness with enmity.

171
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,325
You accuse my disciple as a murderer!

172
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,872
Take him away!

173
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:31,128
Valley Master Rong, your Hell's Nail is amazing.

174
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:34,276
There's no need to target me.

175
00:14:34,277 --> 00:14:36,159
I'm not the only one who suspected Sifeng.

176
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,269
Since the misunderstanding has been resolved and we didn't kill your disciple,

177
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,248
do you want me to atone for it with my life?

178
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:47,537
Palace Master, we wrongly accused Sifeng over a false testimony.

179
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:50,671
I sincerely apologize to you.

180
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:53,666
I don't need your apology.

181
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:58,158
I just want to ask. Who insisted that my disciple was a demon?

182
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,668
Stand out!

183
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,994
What is it?

184
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:06,901
Nobody dares to admit it?

185
00:15:06,902 --> 00:15:09,824
Do you think that Lize Palace can be easily bullied?

186
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:15,766
Fine.

187
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,619
If you won't say it,

188
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:22,141
I'll use Dianjing Valley's Hell's Nail to force all of you to testify.

189
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,802
Dongfang Qingqi, how long are you going to keep quiet about this?

190
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,699
Master Dongfang, so you know

191
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:39,654
who the one is that wrongly accused my disciple.

192
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:41,057
Brother Dongfang,

193
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:43,780
since this incident stems from Madam,

194
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,130
we need to ask her in detail.

195
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:50,059
Bring Madam here.

196
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:51,449
Yes.

197
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,593
So, it's Madam Dongfang. Good.

198
00:15:58,593 --> 00:16:02,194
I want to hear your testimony again.

199
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:06,328
Madam, who is the demon?

200
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,425
Who is the demon?

201
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,767
You are the demon.

202
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:15,537
He is the demon.

203
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:17,794
I am a demon.

204
00:16:17,794 --> 00:16:20,603
- All of us are demons. <br> - Qing Rong.

205
00:16:24,346 --> 00:16:27,659
So, all of you tortured my disciple because of a word from this crazy lady?

206
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:29,281
She said that all of you are demons.

207
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:32,179
So, should I put all of you into prison

208
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:34,219
so that you can have a taste of Hell's Nail?

209
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,879
Palace Master, Qing Rong has been quite absent-minded lately.

210
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,578
Please don't blame her.

211
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:40,074
Don't blame her?

212
00:16:40,074 --> 00:16:45,578
Master Dongfang, your wife almost killed my disciple.

213
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:47,745
Now, she's acting crazy?

214
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:51,579
I think she's the most suspicious person to have colluded with the demons.

215
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:55,793
You don't dare to interrogate her because of Master Dongfang, right?

216
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,283
Fine!

217
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:58,979
I'll do it.

218
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:00,921
Palace Master, please have mercy on her.

219
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:04,652
You had no mercy when you tortured my disciple.

220
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:07,993
- I won't have mercy on your wife, either. <br> - You...

221
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,784
How dare you.

222
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,359
- Qing Rong! <br> - Brother Dongfang!

223
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,920
I want to see what answer I can get when

224
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,601
the Hell's Nail that was used

225
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:26,895
on my disciple is used on Madam Dongfang.

226
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:30,938
Tell me! Where is the demon of Tianxu Hall hiding?

227
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,499
Mount Buzhou.

228
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:40,157
I just know that they are at Mount Buzhou.

229
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:45,079
Do you hear that?

230
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,419
The answer that you want is inside Madam's head.

231
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:51,022
And you just tortured my disciple for nothing.

232
00:17:51,023 --> 00:17:54,276
All of you are really a bunch of useless beings!

233
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:55,718
Let's go!

234
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,773
Qing Rong.

235
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:02,300
Bear with it.

236
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,979
Why is it so painful? Why is it so painful?

237
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:11,625
Look. It's just a nail.

238
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,679
I already took it out. It won't be painful anymore.

239
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,685
But I...

240
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:19,606
But it's really painful.

241
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,633
I beg you.

242
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:26,545
Please find him

243
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:29,828
and ask him why he lied to me.

244
00:18:29,828 --> 00:18:31,699
I love him so much.

245
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:34,670
- Qing Rong! <br> - Why?

246
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,654
Qing Rong, why do you have to torture yourself?

247
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:43,259
Why do you have to be so foolish?

248
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:45,254
I am foolish.

249
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,946
But so are you.

250
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,539
You are foolish, too.

251
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:55,250
Both of us are foolish.

252
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,501
Qing Rong!

253
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,808
Qing Rong.

254
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,938
Qing Rong. Qing Rong.

255
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:12,668
Qing Rong!

256
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:32,896
It's really rare for you to come and find me so late at night.

257
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:35,966
Are you here to have tea and catch up with me?

258
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:40,576
Are you feigning ignorance with me?

259
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:44,319
You know Sifeng's identity better than anyone.

260
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,688
But you just allowed them to torture Sifeng.

261
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:53,825
Are you trying to go against me?

262
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:58,041
So, you are talking about Yu Sifeng.

263
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,577
You've wrongly accused me.

264
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:03,099
Those sects are already suspecting Lize Palace.

265
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:06,139
It was a disaster. If I sided with him,

266
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,250
Lize Palace would have looked too suspicious. Right?

267
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:13,736
Moreover, it is just a Demon Whip.

268
00:20:13,736 --> 00:20:18,370
No matter how they whip him, he won't turn into a demon. Right?

269
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:24,519
Let me warn you again.

270
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,008
If you destroy Sifeng,

271
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:31,808
I'll destroy you.

272
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:56,599
<i>Xuanji.</i>

273
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,963
<i>I won't allow you to hurt Sifeng!</i>

274
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:06,337
Chu Xuanji,

275
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,365
are you that person or not?

276
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,411
Sifeng, are you feeling better now?

277
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,550
Just some minor injuries.

278
00:21:47,487 --> 00:21:49,901
But you look

279
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:53,142
worse than I do.

280
00:21:55,334 --> 00:21:57,089
I misunderstood you.

281
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:59,720
I feel guilty as your friend.

282
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,850
This is not your fault.

283
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,552
You saw Little Silver Flower hurting someone with your own eyes.

284
00:22:06,207 --> 00:22:08,590
If I were you,

285
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,845
I would be suspicious, too.

286
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,510
Even when you were suspecting me,

287
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,210
you still risked your life to save me.

288
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:20,128
It's all because of Xuanji.

289
00:22:20,128 --> 00:22:23,549
She believes in you and kept on trying to find a way to save you.

290
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:26,140
She even risked her life for it.

291
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:31,279
Sifeng, I grew up with Xuanji since young.

292
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,798
There are things that I see more clearly than you do.

293
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,206
Xuanji really treats you differently.

294
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,493
This is the first time I saw her being so violent.

295
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,570
She was even ready to oppose my master.

296
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,345
She never did that before,

297
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:49,303
and it's because of you.

298
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,945
I can see that you are really special to Xuanji.

299
00:22:54,945 --> 00:22:58,739
I just think that you should know about this.

300
00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:00,730
So, I came to tell you about it.

301
00:23:09,343 --> 00:23:10,990
I hope that you can recover soon.

302
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:12,861
I won't disturb you anymore.

303
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:25,119
<i>Xuanji! You...</i>

304
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,819
<i>Everything I did today</i>

305
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:28,562
<i>is out of my own willingness.</i>

306
00:23:28,562 --> 00:23:30,166
<i>Dingkun Sword!</i>

307
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,568
<i>Without Sifeng,</i>

308
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,436
<i>whether or not I live or die,</i>

309
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,529
<i>it doesn't matter.</i>

310
00:23:50,686 --> 00:23:55,150
<i>Things that Xuanji did are enough to prove everything.</i>

311
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,183
<i>But I was still hung up about those non-essentials.</i>

312
00:23:58,992 --> 00:24:01,646
<i>Yu Sifeng,</i>

313
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:04,640
<i>you were really barking at the moon.</i>

314
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,576
Why were you so foolish?

315
00:24:06,576 --> 00:24:10,145
Do you know how upset I would be if I really

316
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:12,612
harmed you with my own hands today?

317
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:23,101
This is a very powerful bead.

318
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:26,409
Keep it with you to help you recover and as protection.

319
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:31,747
From now on, don't risk your life for unimportant people anymore.

320
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:41,461
All right now.

321
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,144
Rest earlier.

322
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,338
King Bailing, this is bad!

323
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:13,059
This is bad!

324
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:16,871
Heavenly Emperor invited you to attend Xi Wangmu's Yaochi Banquet together.

325
00:25:16,871 --> 00:25:18,259
I racked my brain

326
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:21,539
trying to find various reasons to help you put that off.

327
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,385
King Bailing, you better discard this mortal body and

328
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:26,630
let's go back to the heavenly realm.

329
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,733
I still can't go back yet.

330
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,525
King Bailing, you...

331
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:38,996
Xuanji has been affected by feelings in the human realm.

332
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:41,652
She doesn't even listen to me now.

333
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,026
Love is worrisome.

334
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:47,039
Love is scary.

335
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,373
If she continues, she'll lose control, become tainted,

336
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:53,317
and fall into the evil path.

337
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,780
I can't leave her behind right now.

338
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:01,014
I have to break this ill-fated relationship that she has with him.

339
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:04,359
King Bailing, God of War is very willful.

340
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,439
She won't change her mind.

341
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:10,079
Especially something to do with feelings. You know her best.

342
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,126
If you use force on her, she might create some huge troubles again.

343
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:18,517
Have you forgotten about what happened 900 years ago?

344
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,599
Ever since she destroyed her own life pillar,

345
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,210
she started to turn evil until she committed that grave crime.

346
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:16,986
You are right.

347
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,348
She is very willful.

348
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,274
She was like that in the past.

349
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,324
And she is like this now.

350
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:29,736
Maybe I should've let things run their course.

351
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,110
Forget it.

352
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,154
There are so many ways in this world.

353
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,901
I can use other ways to help her reincarnate.

354
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:44,244
If she wants feelings, I'll use feelings to help her reincarnate.

355
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:47,646
- King Bailing. <br> - As long as she can be safe in this life

356
00:27:47,647 --> 00:27:49,870
and keep the three realms in peace,

357
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,090
anything can be done.

358
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:54,446
King Bailing, are you going to...

359
00:27:54,446 --> 00:27:57,585
Yesterday, my master sent me a broken scroll of Sentimental Tactics.

360
00:27:57,585 --> 00:28:00,544
He said that Heartless Tactics can no longer suppress the secret ground.

361
00:28:01,302 --> 00:28:05,201
Since the Heartless Tactics doesn't work,

362
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:08,612
I'll study the Sentimental Tactic together with her.

363
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:14,811
That's why you gave the love flower to Xuanji.

364
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:18,155
So, you are trying to seduce her with a love token.

365
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:25,719
Are you really doing this just to break this ill-fated relationship of hers?

366
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,817
Si Ming,

367
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:33,351
I had only one goal when I descend to this mortal world.

368
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:35,433
To bring her back.

369
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:39,551
I know.

370
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:51,859
My master found these broken scrolls a few days ago.

371
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:54,819
He understands the mystery of turning Heartless Tactics to Sentimental Tactics.

372
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:58,906
He hopes that Junior Xuanji and I can go back to Xuyang Peak to practice it

373
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:01,485
so that we can protect the secret ground with greater power.

374
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:03,031
Good.

375
00:29:07,235 --> 00:29:09,512
This is a good thing.

376
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:12,497
Senior Heng Yang is always worried that

377
00:29:12,497 --> 00:29:17,576
he took the wrong path in this life and couldn't reach Nirvana.

378
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:21,339
Now, you and Xuanji can help him get this off his chest

379
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,539
and protect the secret ground at the same time.

380
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:25,892
This is really killing two birds with one stone.

381
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:27,730
But...

382
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,020
the cultivators of Sentimental Tactics

383
00:29:31,024 --> 00:29:34,881
should be connected with each other and share weal and woe together. (good and bad times)

384
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:38,461
I know a lot of seniors in Xuyang Peak who became couples after

385
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:42,590
training in Sentimental Tactics together.

386
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:45,678
Then, you and Xuanji...

387
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:48,865
Sect Leader, Junior Xuanji and I

388
00:29:48,865 --> 00:29:51,597
have been training together day and night.

389
00:29:51,598 --> 00:29:54,193
And we've developed feelings towards each other.

390
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:56,034
Junior Xuanji is naive and innocent.

391
00:29:56,034 --> 00:30:00,429
I'm willing to take her as my partner and protect her forever.

392
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,469
I hope that we can have your blessings.

393
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:06,477
Of course, I'll give you your blessings.

394
00:30:06,477 --> 00:30:11,092
Even the Love Stone approved of your ties with her.

395
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:14,285
It means that both of you are a match made in heaven.

396
00:30:14,285 --> 00:30:19,279
Besides, since young, Xuanji has always been different from others.

397
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,150
She needs someone

398
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,310
to take care of her and guide her.

399
00:30:25,311 --> 00:30:29,552
If that person is you, I'll be ecstatic.

400
00:30:29,552 --> 00:30:31,948
I really want to bring both of you together.

401
00:30:31,948 --> 00:30:36,239
When are you going to ask your master to come and propose?

402
00:30:36,924 --> 00:30:38,359
To show my sincerity,

403
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,317
I'll go back at once to Xuyang Peak to invite my master to Fuyu Island

404
00:30:41,318 --> 00:30:45,126
so that we can set this engagement in front of all sect leaders.

405
00:30:46,256 --> 00:30:47,733
Good.

406
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:49,344
Great.

407
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,757
Xuanji.

408
00:30:53,758 --> 00:30:55,159
Sifeng, you are awake.

409
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,799
Are you okay?

410
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,985
Don't simply move around, Sifeng.

411
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:01,795
I'm fine.

412
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:06,239
I asked you to not move. Lie down. Hurry up.

413
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,466
- Okay, I won't move. <br> - Lie down.

414
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,173
I'm really okay.

415
00:31:20,174 --> 00:31:23,198
But you even dared to stop the Demon Whip.

416
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:25,339
Now, I can't let you go even if I want to.

417
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:27,253
You crazy girl.

418
00:31:27,254 --> 00:31:30,154
By the way, I heard that

419
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,870
I'm just a broken vase.

420
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:36,128
Aren't you the one who said it?

421
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:41,097
My feelings now are broken again like that vase.

422
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:44,564
I just want Sifeng to smile at me and tell me that

423
00:31:44,564 --> 00:31:46,424
he's fine.

424
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:53,630
I don't know which part of me is like a vase.

425
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,940
Stop it. I...

426
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,055
How can Sixth Senior do this?

427
00:31:58,056 --> 00:32:00,829
I said those things in a moment of desperation.

428
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:03,948
How could he tell you all about it?

429
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,219
So, it meant nothing.

430
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:08,939
No. Of course, you are more valuable than a vase.

431
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:11,439
It was just a metaphor.

432
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,032
Although that metaphor is not that accurate, I want to say that,

433
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,830
of course, Sifeng is valuable, too.

434
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:19,261
He's more valuable than a vase and...

435
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:22,859
Sifeng, I... I'm too dumb.

436
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:26,483
I can't speak well and I can't use a good metaphor.

437
00:32:26,484 --> 00:32:29,158
You are so smart. Can you teach me how to talk?

438
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,371
Looks like I really need to teach you how to talk.

439
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:37,651
Or else, I'll eventually die in your hands.

440
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,250
There is...

441
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,919
something that I want to teach you.

442
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,241
But it's not about talking.

443
00:32:52,223 --> 00:32:53,815
It's about...

444
00:32:56,886 --> 00:33:00,089
teaching you how to fall in love with me.

445
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:01,939
Do you want to learn that?

446
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,214
Is that very hard?

447
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:08,964
No.

448
00:33:08,964 --> 00:33:12,653
It's like sword fights and spells.

449
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:16,119
You do it step-by-step and one at a time.

450
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,089
Can I learn that too although I have no six senses?

451
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:24,796
Of course. Everyone can learn that.

452
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:28,461
It might take longer for you

453
00:33:28,462 --> 00:33:31,550
but I will teach you patiently.

454
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:35,512
The important thing is you have to want to learn it.

455
00:33:35,512 --> 00:33:38,286
I'll learn it if you want to teach me.

456
00:33:38,286 --> 00:33:40,489
Good.

457
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:43,489
Then, you have to listen to me carefully.

458
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:47,059
For your first lesson, I don't want my name in that book of yours.

459
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,486
- Why? <br> - Because there are too many people in it.

460
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:54,057
And I don't like sharing.

461
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,724
But...

462
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,209
I want to be...

463
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,402
deeply ingrained in...

464
00:34:03,402 --> 00:34:05,957
the most important part of your heart forever.

465
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:08,037
Xuanji,

466
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:09,949
do you understand?

467
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:21,959
Linglong?

468
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:34,067
<i>Linglong.</i>

469
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:36,767
<i>You cherish Xuanji the most.</i>

470
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:41,421
<i>Now, Hao Chen is willing to love Xuanji for his whole life.</i>

471
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:43,940
<i>If you knew about this,</i>

472
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:47,119
<i>you would be ecstatic, right?</i>

473
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,187
Why are you here, Elder of Constellation?

474
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:03,884
I'm here to pass down the lord's order.

475
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,199
The lord's order? Go ahead.

476
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,599
He needs to confirm the validity of a clue now.

477
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:14,421
He wants you to find a person with a celestial eye at once.

478
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,839
How will there be a mortal with a celestial eye?

479
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,973
Even if there is, where can I find him?

480
00:35:20,974 --> 00:35:23,819
Are you joking with me?

481
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:25,679
That person is called Liu Yihuan.

482
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,750
As for where to find him, it'll be your problem.

483
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,147
But let me tell you...

484
00:35:31,147 --> 00:35:35,274
Our lord is running out of patience.

485
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,221
You.

486
00:35:58,034 --> 00:35:59,932
Pick it up for me.

487
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:05,919
Wait.

488
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,779
Who asked you to walk there?

489
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:10,370
- Crawl over there. <br> - You...

490
00:36:12,189 --> 00:36:15,034
Hurry up. Hurry up and crawl.

491
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:16,633
Hurry up.

492
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,988
Come over here.

493
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,258
Good boy.

494
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,650
Linglong.

495
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:34,679
How dare you call my name?

496
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,121
Do you really not remember your past?

497
00:36:37,121 --> 00:36:39,472
We've known each other for a long time.

498
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,239
The past?

499
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,859
You mentioned the past again.

500
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:46,259
Guards!

501
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,219
Bring him back and punish him again.

502
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:50,210
I don't want to be punished.

503
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,501
Not only do I want to punish you,

504
00:36:55,502 --> 00:36:58,179
I'll ask Brother Wu Tong to punish you himself.

505
00:36:58,179 --> 00:36:59,900
- Let's go. <br> - No, Linglong!

506
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:02,041
I don't want to be punished!

507
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,759
No!

508
00:37:04,797 --> 00:37:08,225
Look at you now. You look so pitiful.

509
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:10,335
I am pitiful.

510
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,421
But you don't even know who you are right now.

511
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:18,665
Aren't you as pitiful as I am?

512
00:37:24,126 --> 00:37:26,845
So baffling.

513
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,610
Brother Wu Tong!

514
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,530
Brother Wu Tong!

515
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,759
What is it, Linglong?

516
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,425
Nothing. Just a disobedient slave who spoke some nonsense.

517
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:38,716
Brother Wu Tong, play with me.

518
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,999
I'm looking for a person named Liu Yihuan now.

519
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,160
I don't have time to play with you.

520
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,810
Find another person to play with you.

521
00:37:45,814 --> 00:37:48,116
Liu Yihuan?

522
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,710
I think I've heard this name before.

523
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,899
Where did you hear it from?

524
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:54,919
The little demon in the prison.

525
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:58,886
She said that her father is Liu Yihuan and can use the celestial eye.

526
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:00,241
Really?

527
00:38:03,471 --> 00:38:05,679
I don't need to make any effort at all.

528
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,281
So, Liu Yihuan's daughter is right here with me.

529
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,063
This is so interesting.

530
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,997
Master.

531
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:20,859
I've already read your message.

532
00:38:20,859 --> 00:38:22,825
Xuanyuan has fallen

533
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:25,396
and two spirit keys have been taken away.

534
00:38:25,396 --> 00:38:29,539
Tianxu Hall is so lawless right now.

535
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:30,959
The worst thing is,

536
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:33,358
the demon clan has already found out that the Devil Star

537
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:35,632
is inside Shaoyang's secret ground.

538
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,620
The closer the two stars are,

539
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,059
the weaker the barrier of Shaoyang's secret ground.

540
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:48,580
The demon clan will not let go of this rare chance.

541
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,921
I'm going to initiate Xuyang Peak's Protector Formation at once.

542
00:38:51,921 --> 00:38:55,849
I can't let the demon clan cast their greedy eyes on the Crystal Lamp.

543
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:59,322
Master, to initiate the Protector Formation of Xuyang Peak,

544
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:02,031
we'll have to use the strongest power in Xuyang Peak.

545
00:39:02,031 --> 00:39:05,209
Besides, this formation will feed on your cultivation

546
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,522
until you wither and die.

547
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:12,979
So what if I sacrifice myself to protect the secret ground?

548
00:39:12,979 --> 00:39:15,686
But protecting it and eliminating the demons is a long battle.

549
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:21,270
If you sacrifice yourself, how many people can become your successor?

550
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:35,845
You've read the broken scrolls that I sent you before this, right?

551
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,101
I found them in the library.

552
00:39:40,102 --> 00:39:44,662
Heartless Tactics and Sentimental Tactics are actually the same.

553
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:47,390
They are separated into two because of different understandings

554
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:49,953
between different cultivators.

555
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:52,093
If we put our heart into it,

556
00:39:52,094 --> 00:39:56,638
we can turn the Heartless Tactics into the Sentimental Tactics.

557
00:39:56,638 --> 00:40:00,416
Unfortunately, I was too late.

558
00:40:01,155 --> 00:40:05,493
I can no longer find someone who can connect to me

559
00:40:05,494 --> 00:40:08,604
and practice the Sentimental Tactics with me.

560
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:14,150
I sent those broken scrolls to you

561
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,748
because it's not too late for you.

562
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:21,717
I have only you and Xuanji as my disciples.

563
00:40:21,718 --> 00:40:26,753
If both of you can practice the Sentimental Tactics together,

564
00:40:26,753 --> 00:40:32,098
even if I pass away, I'll have successors to fuel

565
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:34,842
the Protector Formation of Xuyang Peak.

566
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,934
I understand what you mean.

567
00:40:41,054 --> 00:40:43,718
I'm willing to inherit your aspiration.

568
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:52,381
Back then, you kept on persuading me to take Xuanji as a disciple.

569
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:58,219
Now, it looks like both of you are really fated to be together.

570
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:01,581
Moreover, from what I can see,

571
00:41:01,582 --> 00:41:05,579
both of you have spent four years together at Xuyang Peak.

572
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:10,741
I'm sure that both of you can succeed in mastering the Sentimental Tactics.

573
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,373
You are right.

574
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:18,780
If that's the case, please propose

575
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,916
a marriage proposal to the sect leader for us to be engaged.

576
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:23,460
And please be a witness for me

577
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,759
and Junior Xuanji in front of the four sects.

578
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,130
We can show them Shaoyang Sect's determination to guard the secret ground.

579
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,599
Okay.

580
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,025
I'll go to Fuyu Island with you.

581
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,446
Yes, Master.

582
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,410
Sifeng, are we viewing the moon now?

583
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:45,778
We are viewing the moon and continuing the lesson.

584
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,339
We are not done yet?

585
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:53,876
Do you think that my lessons are that easy to learn?

586
00:41:54,966 --> 00:41:58,307
What else do I need to learn?

587
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:03,456
What you need to learn now is, if others treat you well,

588
00:42:03,456 --> 00:42:05,593
what are you going to do?

589
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,924
If they treat me well, of course, I'll treat them well, too.

590
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,481
Since I'm teaching you to love me,

591
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:17,979
you have to differentiate between how you treat me and others.

592
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:21,837
For example, if a man compliments that you are beautiful

593
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,804
and wants to travel with you, what should you do?

594
00:42:25,804 --> 00:42:29,119
- I should agree. <br> - No. You should hit him.

595
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,958
If a man compliments you, it means that he likes you.

596
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:34,939
And since you've chosen to love me,

597
00:42:34,939 --> 00:42:38,550
how can you travel with him? So, you have to hit him.

598
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,919
Another example.

599
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,039
If a man invites you for food and gives you presents,

600
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,228
what should you do?

601
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:48,579
- Food? Of course, I have to agree. <br> - Wrong.

602
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:50,319
You have to hit him, too.

603
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,729
Why will a stranger give you gifts? There must be an ulterior motive.

604
00:42:53,729 --> 00:42:56,372
So, he deserves to be beaten up.

605
00:42:56,372 --> 00:42:58,180
I should hit him?

606
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,328
Now, the most important question.

607
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:06,389
If a man is cold and wants to hug you for warmth, what should you do?

608
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:12,605
I should hug him, right?

609
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:15,750
Or else, he'll be freeze to death.

610
00:43:17,278 --> 00:43:20,839
Chu Xuanji, you have to hit him, too.

611
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,459
I have to hit him again.

612
00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:26,478
There are so many ways to get warm, why does he have to hug you?

613
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,320
Besides, remember this.

614
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,299
This is very important.

615
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:33,959
Besides me, you can't let another man hug you,

616
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,102
and you can't hug another man either. Understand?

617
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:42,833
Sifeng, this important point sounds very strict.

618
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,418
Of course.

619
00:43:44,418 --> 00:43:46,373
This is an important question.

620
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,430
Of course, I need to be strict about it.

621
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,040
Okay, next question.

622
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,650
If one day, your father asks you to stay away from me...

623
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,221
I'll hit him.

624
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:05,790
No.

625
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:09,874
You are right. Not every question has only one answer.

626
00:44:11,671 --> 00:44:13,125
Xuanji,

627
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,670
your father is an open and above-board person.

628
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,881
If he gives you this kind of order one day,

629
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:21,699
there must be a reason for it.

630
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:24,489
But you can try to convince him otherwise,

631
00:44:24,489 --> 00:44:27,695
or meet up with me in secret.

632
00:44:31,415 --> 00:44:34,909
Xuanji, I won't let you down.

633
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,379
Little Silver Flower, why are you hiding here?

634
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,839
Well, you risked your life to protect me.

635
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:53,958
I'm here to thank you.

636
00:44:55,255 --> 00:44:58,119
My master is still injured. Don't disturb him.

637
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,493
Little Silver Flower, Xuanji did a lot of things to save us.

638
00:45:01,494 --> 00:45:03,034
You should thank her.

639
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,941
Me? I don't want to do that.

640
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,782
After you take the form of a human,

641
00:45:08,783 --> 00:45:10,579
you have to follow human rules.

642
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,259
I don't need you to repay me.

643
00:45:12,259 --> 00:45:15,388
But you have to thank the person who had helped you before.

644
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:20,059
Actually, it's fine.

645
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:23,750
Thank you. I'm done. Is it very hard? No need to act magnanimously.

646
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,354
Yanran.

647
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,612
I won't say it again even if you didn't hear it.

If I had known that you were Little Silver Flower,

649
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:34,757
we could have used the four years to become friends.

650
00:45:34,757 --> 00:45:36,808
It would have been nice.

00:45:39,787 --> 00:45:43,270
I've bought your favorite rice cake for you.

653
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,739
Xuanji is being kind.

654
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:50,360
Take it.

655
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,254
Take it.
