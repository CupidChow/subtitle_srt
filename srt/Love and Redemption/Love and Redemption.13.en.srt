Why are you so quiet? Is it tasty?

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,591
You scared me. I thought they were here to ask us to pay.

18
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,575
Don't worry. I'm the one who cooked these.

You are the one who cooked these?

No need to worry anymore.

21

When did you learn how to cook?

22
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,679
I learned it last night. It's not hard.

23
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,719
Sifeng, you are so awesome!

24
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,549
With Sifeng here, from now on, we'll have endless good food.

25
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,419
Because you like to eat.

26
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:14,201
Now, you won't have to always think about the food made by Shaoyang's chef anymore.

You are here, Yanran?

30
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:31,920
Yanran,

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,972
Sifeng cooked so much food for Xuanji.

32
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:36,459
You can have some, too.

33
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,809
If you talk when you eat, you'll be choked to death.

- What did you say? <br> - What's wrong?

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,783
- I invited you for food, but... <br> - What did I do wrong?

36
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:44,763
- What kind of attitude is that? <br> - I think...

37
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:46,519
- Linglong! <br> - This dish!

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,168
I'm going to take this back and let Yu'er taste it.

39
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:52,712
That brat has been ignoring me for two days.

40
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:56,689
Maybe I can make her talk with this dish.

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,664
Have a seat. Enjoy your food.

42
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,873
Yanran, you already scared Brother Liu off.

43
00:03:06,873 --> 00:03:08,805
Just sit down and eat.

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,082
- Sit down. Come on. <br> - I'll just eat then.

45
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,911
Eat.

46
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,779
Although this preserved egg doesn't smell so good,

47
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:31,635
it's exceptionally tasty.

48
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,377
Xuanji,

49
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:36,683
you have sense of smell now?

50
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:42,455
Yesterday, Sifeng gave me a shard of the Mirror of Origin.

51
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,199
Now, my sense of smell is back.

52
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,502
Besides, I've come around. From now on, I'll keep searching for my six senses.

53
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,539
But aren't you afraid that you'll fall into the traps of demons again?

54
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:55,759
No. Because I know that all of you will help me out.

55
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,053
Come. This calls for a celebration.

56
00:03:58,054 --> 00:03:59,359
We'll go through all difficulties together.

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,000

00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,648
Brother Liu, what happened?

62
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:23,954
Yu'er left this.

I'll go and get her back now.

66
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,480
Forget it.

67
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,984
I'm such a failure as a father.

68
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:41,079
Yu'er hates me. It's pointless to force her to come back.

69
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,299
Besides, if I bring all of you with me, she'll be even angrier.

70
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:47,888
I better get her back myself.

when I opened the celestial eye before this,

I saw a shard of the Mirror of Origin on Mount Gao in Zhongli City.

If you have the chance, go and find it together with Xuanji.

Remember to seize the opportunity.

76
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:13,966
If you can really marry Xuanji, I will treat you to a drink.

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,530
All right, everybody.

78
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,080

Since you are uninterested with the thing we want to find, why did you follow us?

90

That's up to me to decide. None of your business.

Forget it.

00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:47,548
You are like an annoying leech that we can't get rid of.

98
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,114
Have a look.

99
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:53,377
Excuse me. Where is Mount Gao?

100
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:56,610
Mount Deity is the only mountain in Zhongli City.

101
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,579
It's where Goddess Gao lives.

102
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:00,503
We don't have any Mount Gao.

103
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,759
Look. There are so many people here.

104
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,142
They are all here to watch Goddess Gao descend to the earth.

105
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:07,415
Where is Mount Deity then?

106
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,159
It's over there. But mortals can't go up there.

107
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,159
Okay, thank you.

108
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,997
Sifeng, could it be that this Mount Deity is Mount Gao?

109
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:20,991
Let's go and take a look then. Let's go.

110
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,545
Let's go.

111
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,722
"Deity Gao resides on this mountain."

112
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:46,119
"This is where the auspicious ray of sun hits."

113
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,059
Deity Gao. Mount Deity.

114
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:50,579
This is Mount Gao.

115
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:51,899
Let's go.

116
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,459
Wait.

117
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,792
Ruo Yu. Minyan.

118
00:08:51,502 --> 00:08:53,399
What a strong barrier.

119
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,679
No normal person can build this kind of barrier.

120
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,017
Could it be that there's really a deity here?

121
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:01,319
But I don't feel the aura of a deity here.

122
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,970
It makes me feel uncomfortable instead.

123
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:09,359
No worries. Goddess Gao is descending to the earth today.

124
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,640
When she does that, the barrier will be opened.

125
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,865
Let's stay in Zhongli City for a while.

126
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:19,099
When Goddess Gao descends, we'll find a way to get in.

127
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:21,358
We are going into the city?

128
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:24,659
- Can we... <br> - We can have some good food now!

129
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,739
Linglong, what is this?

130
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,859
This one? This is red bean cake.

131
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:39,059
This is green cake, yellow cake, and purple cake.

132
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,604
Miss, look at my conch. It's beautiful and you can hear the sound of the sea.

133
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:44,569
Buy one.

134
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:46,547
Listen.

135
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:48,527
- Ruo Yu. <br> - Sifeng.

136
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:51,618
- Give this to everyone. <br> - What did you buy?

137
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:59,179
Xuanji, you have a sweet tooth.

138
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:00,999
I bought you qingtuan. <br> <i>(T/N: a form of sweet green dumpling)</i>

139
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,477
Thank you.

140
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:09,559
This qingtuan is really tasty.

141
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,359
I've never tasted something like this before. You should have one, too.

142
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,952
I'm fine.

143
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,449
It's the Cold Food Festival today.

144
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:20,187
You can only find qingtuan during the Cold Food Festival.

145
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,284
It's very lively over there. Let me bring you there.

146
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:25,999
Is this tasty?

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,594
Let me take a look.

148
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,519
Ruo Yu, drink some pear blossom soup.

149
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,163
Move aside.

150
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,595
Seems like someone is feeling sour enough, so I won't invite you to drink any.

151
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:42,539
Seems like someone is venomous enough that I don't want it.

152
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:45,230
Seems like someone is jealous because Sifeng treats Xuanji so well.

153
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:46,779
You are not as cute as my sister.

154
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,005
You are ill-tempered and a troublemaker. Sifeng won't like you.

155
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:52,279
You are criticizing me?

156
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,909
Two days ago, you were so close with Sifeng.

157
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,899
Now, you can't be apart from your sixth senior.

158
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,399
How interesting.

159
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,696
You–

160
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:08,195
- You– <br> - Enough.

161
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:10,685
There are so many people here. Won't you feel embarrassed?

162
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:12,966
Later, Sifeng will lecture you again.

163
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,699
Why do you have to argue with that Lu Yanran?

164
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:23,428
She's so spoiled. She'll just ruin your mood.

165
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:29,335
Linglong, let's have our fortune told to see our luck.

166
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:31,707
- Okay. <br> - Let's go.

167
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:34,419
- Store owner. <br> - Have a seat.

168
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:35,814
We want to have our fortune told.

169
00:11:35,814 --> 00:11:39,479
The goddess is descending to Earth today. It'll definitely be lucky for you.

170
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,940
I'll do it.

171
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,880
<i>[PATRICIDE]</i>

172
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,390
Miss, what do you want to know?

173
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:59,232
My luck for this year.

174
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:03,159
You got the patricide lot.

175
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,016
This is the worst lot.

176
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,293
You'll be in a lot of trouble. And they will come in waves.

177
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:09,779
This is a bad omen.

178
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,619
Little Six, they are just here to cheat us of our money. Let's go.

179
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:14,119
Linglong,

180
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,329
I'm the one who wanted to do this. I should shake it. Yours doesn't count.

181
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:18,945
Let me do it.

182
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,759
<i>[RECRUIT MARRIAGE]</i>

183
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,059
This recruit marriage lot just means that you'll have moderate luck

184
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:32,399
if you are asking about luck.

185
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,239
I'm not asking about luck.

186
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,000
- I'm asking about my relationship. <br> - Your relationship?

187
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:39,379
Then, this is the best lot that you can get.

188
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:44,238
It means that all shall be well. Jack shall have Jill.

189
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:50,513
Linglong!

190
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,103
Linglong.

191
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,697
Linglong.

192
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,399
This is for you.

193
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,079
All shall be well. Jack shall have Jill. So auspicious.

194
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,018
When I propose our marriage to Master, you can show him this lot.

195
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,521
We are destined to be together. Master will definitely agree.

196
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:13,081
What proposal? We just resolved our misunderstanding.

197
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:16,159
I won't necessarily marry you. Take away your marriage lot.

198
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,022
Are you really not going to take it?

199
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:22,182
If you don't take my lot, my heart will not be able to settle down.

200
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:24,545
Aren't you afraid that I'll give it to another lady?

201
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:27,318
You can give it to whoever you want. I don't want it.

202
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,055
Are you really not going to take it?

203
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,602
I'll give it to another lady then.

204
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,330
You...

205
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:45,279
- Linglong, I was just joking. <br> - Fine!

206
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,639
Give your marriage lot to whoever you want. Don't give it to me!

207
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,151
Linglong!

208
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,579
Look, Sifeng.

209
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,036
Look, Sifeng!

210
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:44,128
Don't move.

211
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,900
Don't break the hair.

212
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:53,205
It'll be a bad omen. Let me get it out.

213
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,719
Wait for me there.

214
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,135
Your hair is in a mess. Let me buy you a hairpin.

215
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,794
It's not in a mess.

216
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,184
I'm in a mess.

217
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,891
Miss, you are not from here. Right?

218
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,079
How do you know?

219
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,652
I know every girl in Zhongli City.

220
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:41,235
I am a local here.

221
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:46,679
If you don't mind, how about I volunteer myself to show you around?

222
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,856
Do you have any ancient treasures in this city?

223
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:51,939
Of course.

224
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:54,908
I have a house full of treasures.

225
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:58,559
If you are willing, how about we go there and take a look?

226
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,382
Do you have an ancient mirror in your house?

227
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:04,133
Yes. I'm an ancient mirrors collector.

228
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:05,953
I have a lot of mirrors.

229
00:16:05,954 --> 00:16:08,921
Great. We'll go there together with my friend when he comes back then.

230
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:12,709
Let's go, Miss. Don't miss out on this chance.

231
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,659
Sifeng.

232
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,948
Xuanji, are you okay?

233
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:31,599
This is the hairpin I chose for you.

234
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,338
Do you like it?

235
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,622
This hairpin is so beautiful.

236
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:38,766
Put it on for me.

237
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:42,432
Okay.

238
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:56,300
Immortal Master. Immortal Master.

239
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,652
Immortal Master, can you put me down first?

240
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,295
Did no one ever tell you not to make a move on the ladies?

241
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:10,128
Immortal Master, I was just trying to be a good host just now.

242
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,899
Please forgive me and let me down.

243
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:16,139
Since you want to be a good host, great.

244
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:19,017
Help us check out the scenery from above then.

245
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,880
<i>Immortal Master!</i>

246
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,759
Well... Sifeng.

247
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,819
Why are you angry?

248
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,585
Isn't he a kind man?

249
00:17:28,585 --> 00:17:33,619
I'm flying him up there to repay him. So he can climb high and gaze far.

250
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:37,149
But just now, he said that he might have the Mirror of Origin.

251
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,325
How could a mortal own an immortal object?

252
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,319
He was just lying to you.

253
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,440
He was lying to me?

254
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,739
Lying is not good.

255
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:49,097
From now on, don't talk to any male strangers.

256
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:50,703
Understand?

257
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,438
Okay.

258
00:18:20,886 --> 00:18:25,320
Right on time. Let's see how this goddess descends from the mountain.

259
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,660
The goddess has shown herself.

260
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:41,599
This is the name list of the people that she wants to take in for this year.

261
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,099
Later, I'll send it to every family.

262
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,839
Everyone bow now.

263
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,259
Thank her for bringing prosperity to this land

264
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:52,559
and protecting the people from danger.

265
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,840
<i>- Thank you, Goddess! <br> - Thank you, Goddess!</i>

266
00:18:56,824 --> 00:18:57,999
<i>[GODDESS PAVILION]</i>

267
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:00,100
Open the door.

268
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:07,906
So, this is what they mean by the goddess descends.

269
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:12,949
The goddess just used her power to send a piece of note here.

270
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:14,937
She didn't open the barrier at all.

271
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:16,718
We can't go in.

272
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,600
Xuanji,

273
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,959
are you saying that when the goddess descended,

274
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,779
there was a demonic aura inside that purple smoke?

275
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,539
Besides, it's the same demon that caught Elder Ling Shi.

276
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:39,831
I still remember it. I won't be wrong.

277
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:41,999
<i>- Immortal Master, help us! <br> - Please save us.</i>

278
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:44,916
<i>- Please save us. <br> - Please save us, Immortal Master.</i>

279
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,049
Why is it you again?

280
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:56,527
Immortal Master, I am Fang Yizhen.

281
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:58,550
I was born and raised in Zhongli City.

282
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:00,535
I've offended you before this.

283
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:04,928
Please be magnanimous and save me.

284
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:07,825
That Goddess Gao wants to kill us.

285
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:10,799
- Immortal Master, save us. <br> <i>- Please save us.</i>

286
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,882
Get up first and let's talk.

287
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:16,066
Stop kneeling. Get up.

288
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,239
What's happened?

289
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:21,520
Goddess Gao will choose four men every year to go up there to serve her.

290
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,474
This year, she chose the four of us.

291
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:24,859
We have to go up tomorrow.

292
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:26,905
But we'll definitely lose our lives.

293
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:29,419
We have no other choice.

294
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,801
I saw how capable you are.

295
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:34,101
You must be very powerful.

296
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:37,847
You must be from the cultivator sect that saves the people from evil.

297
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:41,419
- So, please save us. <br> <i>- I beg you.</i>

298
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:45,921
Besides, that goddess is not a deity.

299
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:48,002
It's a demon.

300
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,639
How do you know that?

301
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,192
Well...

302
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,180
I was once curious about what the goddess looked like.

303
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,750
So, I followed a wedding sedan going into the mountain to spy on her.

304
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:20,780
That goddess is definitely not kind.

305
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,681
But everyone here looks up to her as a goddess.

306
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,733
They won't believe anything I say.

307
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,569
At first, I wanted to ask those grooms after they come back.

308
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:31,939
But who knew that nobody would hear from those chosen grooms anymore?

309
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:34,770
We've never even gotten a letter from them.

310
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,954
All of them must be dead now.

311
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:38,595
There's a barrier on that mountain.

312
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:41,041
How did the grooms go up the mountain?

313
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,577
All the chosen men will wait for her outside of the mountain gate every year.

314
00:21:44,577 --> 00:21:48,038
When the time is right, she will send someone to bring them in.

315
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,734
Immortal Master, please save us.

316
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:56,739
- I beg you. Please save us. <br> - Please save us.

317
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:57,962
Okay.

318
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:04,059
Tomorrow, Minyan, Ruo Yu and I will pretend to be her grooms.

319
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:06,346
That way, we can save these men

320
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:09,577
and go up the mountain to search for what we want.

321
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:10,939
Killing two birds with one stone.

322
00:22:10,939 --> 00:22:13,939
<i>- Thank you, Immortal Master.</i> <br> - Wait.

323
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:16,179
But there are only three of you.

324
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:20,316
Do we need to find another man to make up for the missing one?

325
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,179
I can't. I'll faint when I'm nervous.

326
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:27,074
I can't, too. I'll vomit.

327
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:30,128
They are too cowardly.

328
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:31,857
They'll just create trouble.

329
00:22:31,857 --> 00:22:35,526
How about I ask Yanran or Linglong

330
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,860
to dress up as men to fool her?

331
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,146
If that's the case, let me go with you.

332
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:44,399
No. It's too dangerous for you.

333
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,819
It's all right. I've mastered all kinds of spells.

334
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:49,974
I'm confident that I can defeat those demons.

335
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:51,534
Don't worry.

336
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,240
Okay.

337
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,360
I will protect you.

338
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,642
Xuanji, I'm really worried about your trip to the mountain tomorrow.

339
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:09,274
Have you embroidered all of your spells?

340
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:10,482
Look.

341
00:23:10,482 --> 00:23:14,194
I've embroidered all demon-related spells that I can think of on this dress.

342
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:17,625
Tomorrow, I just need to wear it and I'll be able to handle all kinds of demons.

343
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,336
I'm more at ease now.

344
00:23:19,336 --> 00:23:22,233
Little Six, remember to protect Xuanji well, do you hear me?

345
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:25,021
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

346
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:26,482
Look.

347
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:36,100
Isn't this the bracelet that Aunt Ying Hong gave us when we were teens?

348
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,718
I lost mine. Let me take a look at it.

349
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:41,781
Aunt Ying Hong gave it to us when we were fourteen years old.

350
00:23:41,781 --> 00:23:45,717
Look. You said that one bead represents two years.

351
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:52,037
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

352
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:54,745
Why is there an eighth bead?

353
00:23:54,745 --> 00:23:56,179
Maybe you remembered it wrong.

354
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:58,239
She must have given it to you when you were sixteen.

355
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:02,899
But I just cleaned these beads before I left Shouyang Peak.

356
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,419
There were only seven.

357
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:07,353
- Why is there an extra one? <br> - All right now. Don't think too much.

358
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:09,648
You must have remembered it wrong.

359
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:11,630
By the way, Linglong.

360
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,614
Keep this Transmission Bell.

361
00:24:13,614 --> 00:24:17,659
Great. Then I can contact you anytime tomorrow.

362
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,899
Take good care of yourself when I'm not here.

363
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:21,517
Don't always quarrel with Lu Yanran.

364
00:24:21,517 --> 00:24:24,298
Don't worry. She's not my match.

365
00:24:26,618 --> 00:24:29,115
Be careful tomorrow.

366
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:40,379
I'm tired. We have to rest earlier.

367
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,295
You can leave now.

368
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:51,379
Xuanji, you have to travel tomorrow.

369
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:53,521
Rest earlier. I want to sleep now.

370
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,922
I'm sure that there were only seven.

371
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,076
<i>[SHAOYANG]</i>

372
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,297
So many days have passed.

373
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:20,953
Why haven't I heard anything from Xuanji yet?

374
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:24,528
Could it be that she's in trouble?

375
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:26,099
<i>Senior!</i>

376
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:29,473
Senior, something went wrong when Master went to meditate in seclusion.

377
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:50,809
Master.

378
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:52,406
I'm fine.

379
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:56,778
I was just training myself to control the eye of the formation just now.

380
00:25:56,778 --> 00:26:03,459
When I was in training, I was too impatient and lost some energy.

381
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:05,062
You may leave now.

382
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:08,098
I just need Hao Chen to be here.

383
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:09,937
<i>Yes, Master!</i>

384
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,659
Master.

385
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,825
I need some time to recover.

386
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:20,059
During this time,

387
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:23,505
guard the eye of the formation for the secret ground well.

388
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:25,107
Don't be distracted.

389
00:26:25,107 --> 00:26:26,593
I understand.

390
00:26:26,593 --> 00:26:32,059
Master, you still can't unravel the true meaning of the Heartless Tactics?

391
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:38,537
I dedicated my whole life to learn about the Heartless Tactics.

392
00:26:38,537 --> 00:26:43,073
But the more I learn, the more I doubt myself.

393
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:47,419
Hao Chen, do you know that Heartless Tactics is not

394
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:50,464
the only way of cultivation in Xuyang Peak?

395
00:26:50,464 --> 00:26:53,282
We have the Sentimental Tactics, too.

396
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:56,660
But the one you are learning is the Heartless Tactics.

397
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,024
In the past, I thought that I was determined.

398
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:09,385
I believed that if I was doing it for the people.

399
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:13,059
I would be able to get rid of all my personal feelings.

400
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:17,179
So, I chose the Heartless Tactics without a second thought.

401
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:20,026
But for the past two years,

402
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:25,353
I realized that the ultimate skill of Heartless Tactics

403
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,699
is to let go of your feelings.

404
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:30,979
But if you never had any feelings before,

405
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:33,620
how are you going to know how they feel?

406
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,368
So, what can you let go of?

407
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:40,379
So, I couldn't help myself but to read about that Sentimental Tactics.

408
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:43,899
And I realized that the tactics of the Sentimental Tactics

409
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:46,819
are way more powerful than the Heartless Tactics.

410
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:50,681
Looks like I've been wrong since the very beginning.

411
00:27:50,681 --> 00:27:56,075
But even if I want to learn the Sentimental Tactics now,

412
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,273
my feelings are already gone.

413
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:04,188
And I have no one to learn it with me.

414
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:08,532
Master, you've begun to waver.

415
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,850
So, Hao Chen, use me as an example.

416
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,382
Be sure of what you want.

417
00:28:17,382 --> 00:28:19,174
Or else,

418
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:22,019
everything will be too late.

419
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:25,545
I think that there are many ways in this world.

420
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:27,371
But they are just ways.

421
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:30,754
No matter if it's Sentimental Tactics or Heartless Tactics,

422
00:28:30,754 --> 00:28:32,579
there's no limit to them.

423
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:36,099
As long as it's useful to me, then I can use any.

424
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:39,969
No matter what way we use, our goal is to reach the heavenly realm.

425
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,809
So do it for the heavenly realm.

426
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:45,299
Every way is the correct way.

427
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:49,702
Every way is the correct way?

428
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,179
You've surpassed me.

429
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,409
I am too narrow-minded.

430
00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:00,750
You are even more incisive than I am.

431
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:06,306
Hao Chen, sometimes, I even think that you are so mature that

432
00:29:06,306 --> 00:29:08,379
you don't look your age.

433
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:12,460
Instead, you look like someone who has lived for thousands of years.

434
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,152
Thank you for the compliment.

435
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,370
<i>[Joy]</i>

436
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,590
<i>[Deity Gao resides on this mountain. This is where the auspicious ray of sun hits.]</i>

437
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,405
Welcome, gentlemen. Please get down from the sedan.

438
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,370
Please change your clothes.

439
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,833
Why is this a woman's wedding gown?

440
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:01,656
The goddess is marrying you. Of course, you have to wear the wedding gown.

441
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:04,616
You better change now. We don't want to be late.

442
00:31:04,616 --> 00:31:06,044
How am I going to change?

443
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,399
How about I help you?

444
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,015
No need. I can do it myself.

445
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,739
- How about I help you? <br> - Please have some self-respect.

446
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:29,723
Gentlemen, it's disrespectful to meet the goddess with your masks on.

447
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:30,882
You better take them off.

448
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:32,499
You don't know about it.

449
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:34,651
But this is our home town's custom as a respect for the deity.

450
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:37,179
When we pay respect to the deity, we have to wear this mask.

451
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:40,539
We can only take it down when the time is right as a form of respect.

452
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:43,368
If we take it down before that, it'll be disrespectful.

453
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,880
Since you are so respectful to the goddess,

454
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,170
you can keep your mask on.

455
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:26,887
Sifeng looks quite handsome in this attire.

456
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:28,830
This demon is so troublesome.

457
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,050
Why do they have to wear a wedding gown?

458
00:32:31,058 --> 00:32:32,791
You are angry at this, too?

459
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:37,619
I think you are just jealous because Sifeng is taking care of Xuanji so well.

460
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:40,539
Let me tell you. You have no chance. Clear?

461
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:42,035
You...

462
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,520
Look at you.

463
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,482
Minyan looks quite handsome, too.

464
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,657
Gentleman, it has taken you so long.

465
00:33:16,657 --> 00:33:18,409
How about I help you with it?

466
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,500
It's all right.

467
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,602
Look at this gown.

468
00:33:22,602 --> 00:33:24,759
It doesn't suit me.

469
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:26,899
How about I not change?

470
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:28,659
Xuanji hasn't changed her clothes yet?

471
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:31,316
I can help you with it.

472
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:34,662
Goddess, my friend is a little bit shy.

473
00:33:34,662 --> 00:33:36,260
I'll help him with it.

474
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,640
Please give us some privacy.

475
00:33:39,363 --> 00:33:42,143
What a shy gentleman.

476
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,980
They almost found out that I was a woman.

477
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,880
Hurry up and change now. I'll keep an eye out for you.

478
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,000
- This... <br> - Come. Let me help you with it.

479
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,758
It's done, Xuanji.

480
00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:42,593
Xuanji.

481
00:34:46,114 --> 00:34:48,807
There is a hallucination drug on this veil.

482
00:34:49,402 --> 00:34:52,796
Xuanji, remember to hold your breath later.

483
00:34:53,363 --> 00:34:56,026
I'll find a chance to tell Minyan and Ruo Yu about it.

484
00:34:56,026 --> 00:34:58,784
Please get into the sedan.

485
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:01,581
All right, let's go.

486
00:35:05,802 --> 00:35:08,483
They are leaving now. Let's go.

487
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,425
Sect Leader Zhu Shi.

488
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:52,506
How are you?

489
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:55,416
You are Wu Tong?

490
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:00,199
Thank you for still remembering a nobody like me.

491
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,750
Now, you work for the devil

492
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,920
and feed on souls of the living to increase your power?

493
00:36:06,926 --> 00:36:08,730
If I didn't do it,

494
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,320
I wouldn't have the rights to stand here

495
00:36:11,321 --> 00:36:14,299
and talk to the sect leader of Xuanyuan Sect.

496
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:17,820
Sect Leader Zhu Shi, give me the spirit key.

497
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,020
Dream on!

498
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,979
I don't have much patience now.

499
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:26,339
With my power now, I can annihilate Xuanyuan Sect in the blink of an eye.

500
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:28,914
You betray your ancestor and are the jackal to the tiger.

501
00:36:28,914 --> 00:36:31,537
You even used drugs to control Xuanyuan.

502
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:35,219
Everything you did is despicable and shameless.

503
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:38,155
You are even worse than a demon!

504
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,139
What a joke.

505
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:44,481
You are the one who took the drugs to increase your power.

506
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:49,579
Do you think that there are such things as free meals in this world?

507
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:52,809
Xuanyuan Sect is greedy but useless.

508
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:57,221
I think Xuanyuan Sect is the one that is worse than demons.

509
00:36:59,315 --> 00:37:04,083
This calamity of Xuanyuan is brought upon by me.

510
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,241
I was too competitive to the point that I forgot about my cultivation.

511
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:12,459
I exposed my own weakness for you to exploit.

512
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:14,923
Xuanyuan was wrong once.

513
00:37:14,923 --> 00:37:17,059
We will not do it again.

514
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:19,409
Listen to my order, disciples of Xuanyuan.

515
00:37:23,634 --> 00:37:25,913
Today, Xuanyuan Sect vows

516
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:28,619
to fight against these demons with our lives!

517
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:31,337
We will not bow down to anyone!

518
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,947
I thought all the righteous sects faced death calmly.

519
00:37:55,746 --> 00:37:59,139
It turns out, all of you are just cowards.

520
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:04,178
Do you think that these demons will let you go

521
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:06,560
if you don't fight back?

522
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,261
You don't even have the quality of a cultivator.

523
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:15,599
Listen to me, disciples of Xuanyuan.

524
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,880
If you kneel to me now,

525
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,350
I'll feed you the drugs later.

526
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,810
If you want to die,

527
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,800
I don't mind feeding on more souls.

528
00:38:54,536 --> 00:39:00,287
I never thought that my disciples of Xuanyuan were just some cowards begging for their lives.

529
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:05,745
Xuanyuan Sect was established 1,300 years ago.

530
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:12,186
Looks like it's going to end here today on my watch.

531
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,751
I've let down my master.

532
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:18,380
I've let down my ancestors.

533
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,780
Okay.

534
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:26,197
Today, I'm going to use my life to repay Xuanyuan.

535
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,220
Putting aside that you are powerless now because of the Kunyin Pill you took,

536
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,999
even if your power had recovered,

537
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,821
with my power now, I have nothing to be afraid of.

538
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,639
- Sect Leader! <br> - Sect Leader!

539
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,790
Sect Leader—

540
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,499
- Have you found the spirit key? <br> - Not yet.

541
00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:14,399
Useless!

542
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:26,060
Where is the spirit key?

543
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,640
If you don't tell me now, all of you will die!

544
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,621
Altar Chief, I... I know where the spirit key is.

545
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:55,659
It's you. Shi Feng?

546
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,839
You came first during the Hairpin Tournament back then.

547
00:41:03,411 --> 00:41:06,129
But that was supposed to be mine.

548
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:08,139
The judge was unfair.

549
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:11,379
I'm just a weak little thing.

550
00:41:11,379 --> 00:41:14,630
How can I ever compete with you?

551
00:41:19,531 --> 00:41:22,698
Not bad. You are quite sensible.

552
00:41:22,698 --> 00:41:26,583
Since you know where it is, bring me to it now.

553
00:41:27,683 --> 00:41:29,233
Yes.

554
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,960
<i>[XUANYUAN HALL]</i>

555
00:41:49,171 --> 00:41:50,959
How did this happen?

556
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:54,879
The spirit key of Xuanyuan Sect has always been hidden inside the Destiny Pearl.

557
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:58,387
You must use the sect leader's key to open the Treasure Cove.

558
00:41:58,387 --> 00:42:00,790
Why is the Destiny Pearl gone?

559
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,836
How dare you fool me.

560
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:08,157
I wouldn't dare. I didn't lie.

561
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:11,961
Did anyone come here recently?

562
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,459
A few days ago, Chu Xuanji and Chu Linglong from Shaoyang Sect

563
00:42:17,459 --> 00:42:21,100
and Yu Sifeng from Lize Palace came to Xuanyuan.

564
00:42:22,158 --> 00:42:26,179
And our sect leader asked them to give a present to Island Master Dong Fang.

565
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:30,919
<i>Give this present to Island Master Dong Fang.</i>

566
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,289
But our elders already checked the present.

567
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:39,321
Nothing was wrong with it.

568
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:41,675
He must have used a camouflage spell.

569
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:49,120
Looks like the Destiny Pearl is with Chu Xuanji and the others.

570
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:58,383
Gentlemen, please get down from the sedan.

571
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,959
- Come, gentleman. <br> - Come here.

572
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,352
- Have a seat. <br> - Have a seat, gentlemen.

573
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:13,266
- Look, Sisters, he's shy. <br> - Young gentleman.

574
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:15,287
Come, have a drink?

575
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,369
- Come on, don't be shy. <br> - You should drink it yourself.

576
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,673
Come on, gentleman.

577
00:43:29,434 --> 00:43:31,710
This wine is spiked. Don't drink it.

578
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,587
Where is Goddess Gao? Ask her to come out!

579
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,120
No need to look for me.

580
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,965
I'm here.

581
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,259
We meet again.

582
00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:57,637
I've been here waiting for you.

583
00:43:57,637 --> 00:44:01,859
The energy of cultivators is even more powerful than normal people.

584
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:05,620
It would be very fortunate if I can take a sip of it.

585
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,193
She's a seductress and she wants to feed on energy.

586
00:44:08,193 --> 00:44:11,539
She must be a fox demon. She must be a thousand years old.

587
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:14,219
So smart. You are right.

588
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:16,699
I am the Thousand-Year-Old Purple Fox.

589
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:21,680
Since you got it right, what rewards do you want?

590
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,660
You are still fine after inhaling my Hallucination Smoke?

591
00:45:10,106 --> 00:45:11,849
You are a woman?

592
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:14,079
You disguised as a man to trick me.

593
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,994
Mount Gao will never spare a woman!

594
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,011
Don't hurt her.

595
00:45:24,946 --> 00:45:26,596
Interesting.

596
00:45:26,596 --> 00:45:30,657
I never thought that the two of you were a couple.

597
