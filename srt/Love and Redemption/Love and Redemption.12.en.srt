18
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,860
It's gone. Gone.

19
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,240
Thank you for sparing me.

20
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,865
I'm leaving.

21
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,560
She's still young and immature. Thanks, Little Phoenix.

22
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:16,295
Yu'er!

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,020
- Let me go! <br> - Let you go?

24
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,420
Are you going to run away again if I let you go?

25
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,656
Couldn't you thank him for saving your life?

26
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,180
What if you get caught by the bad guys again?

27
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,700
That's my problem!

28
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,260
You're not willing to accept me,

29
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,779
and you kept avoiding me.

30
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,500
Why are you pretending to be a good father now?

31
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,899
I don't need one!

32
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,299
Let me go, you old man!

33
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:38,820
You didn't care about me when I was still alive.

34
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,040
Now that I'm dead, you can't stop bothering me.

35
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:51,219
Yu'er, it's my fault that I couldn't be with you.

36
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:53,060
Now I can't leave you alone.

37
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,160
From now on, I won't let you go again.

38
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,549
Let's go.

39
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,939
A demon saved Elder Ling Shi?

40
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:10,540
Xuanji, did you make a mistake?

41
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,659
No. I've never come across such a strong demonic aura.

42
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,900
Whether a demon has caught Ling Shi or not,

43
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,589
we should head to Xuanyuan Sect and inform Elder Zhu Shi of what he did.

44
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:22,241
Sifeng. Xuanji. We'll head to Xuanyuan Sect.

45
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,271
As for the rest,

46
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,340
wait for us in town.

47
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,060
Minyan, I've said so.

48
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,980
You need to care about Xuanji's feelings.

49
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,500
But I need to explain myself.

50
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,210
You should stay in town and give it some thought,

51
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,483
in case your insincere words hurt others and yourself.

52
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,339
Ruo Yu. Yanran.

53
00:03:44,339 --> 00:03:46,460
Take Minyan to the town.

54
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,838
Don't let him follow us.

55
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:49,099
Sifeng.

56
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,319
Minyan, let's go.

57
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,570
This is utter nonsense.

58
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,960
Wait for me!

59
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,112
Wait for me.

60
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,580
Linglong. Linglong!

61
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,254
Does Linglong have something on her mind?

62
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:25,847
She's ignoring me.

63
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:28,074
Something is bothering her.

64
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:29,559
That's why she's acting that way.

65
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,740
What's bothering her?

66
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,405
We're here. Let's get down now.

67

<i>[XUANYUAN]</i>

68
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,036
Please wait for a moment.

69
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:49,963
I'll go inform them of your arrival.

70
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,100
No one is training, and the ground isn't swept.

71
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,007
That's so outrageous.

72
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,300
The censer has gone out of use.

73
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,839
It seems that they haven't burned any incense for days.

74
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,554
Sect Leader is inviting you to go in.

75
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,513
Sect Leader.

76
00:05:18,513 --> 00:05:20,219
You've traveled all the way here.

77
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,227
Why are you here?

78
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,216
Sect Leader can't talk because he's caught a cold.

79
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:31,564
That's why I'm asking on his behalf.

80
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,460
I came uninvited for an urgent matter.

81
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,739
We went down the mountain for training.

82
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,900
While passing by Wangxian Town,

83
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,860
we saw someone controlled the demon spirits to drink human blood

84
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,220
and grow Jialuo blood fruits.

85
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,740
We investigated and found out that it's Elder Ling Shi's doing.

86
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,099
As juniors, we dared not act recklessly.

87
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:57,900
We're afraid it'd tarnish Xuanyuan Sect's reputation.

88
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,740
That's why we came to inform Sect Leader Zhu Shi of it.

89
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,019
Got it.

90
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,079
Our sect will see to it.

91
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,820
Don't worry yourselves with it.

92
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,540
We almost got killed.

93
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,140
You don't look concerned at all, Elder Mo Shi.

94
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,038
I don't need you to teach me how to settle it.

95
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,220
Since the fellow elders have found out,

96
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,046
there's nothing else to talk about.

97
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:22,900
We're leaving.

98
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,447
No rush.

99
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:26,140
You came all the way.

100
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,232
I think you should stay for a vegetarian meal.

101
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,707
All three of you went down the mountain for training.

102
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,900
How many of you?

103
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,620
Six persons in total.

104
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,980
The other companions are waiting in town for our return.

105
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,580
We were afraid we'd get into danger again.

106
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,899
That's why we came up with a plan.

107
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,965
If we don't get back by this evening,

108
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:55,071
those three people will inform the sect of our disappearance.

109
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,459
If so, I won't make you stay.

110
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:04,379
Xuanyuan Sect will catch Ling Shi soonest.

111
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,735
We'll give you an explanation.

112
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:10,100
Guys, see yourselves out.

113
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,715
Wait!

114
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,420
I might need your help with something.

115
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,340
The wife of Lord of Fuyu Island is having her birthday banquet soon.

116
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,980
My men are too busy to send her the gift.

117
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,700
Thus, I'd like you all

118
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,446
to send this gift to Master Dong Fang.

119
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,120
- See the guests out. <br> - Wait!

120
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,019
It's a gift to Fuyu Island

121
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,340
and it has to do with the face of my sect.

122
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,225
Sect Leader isn't feeling so well.

123
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:02,940
He might leave something out.

124
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,726
I'll take a look at it again for Sect Leader.

125
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,399
There's not much time,

126
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,780
but you managed to remain courteous.

127
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,853
It seems that I was worried for nothing.

128
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,256
If so, please see yourselves out.

129
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,260
Xuanyuan Sect is so weird.

130
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,180
They made me feel uncomfortable.

131
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,380
Oh, right, Sifeng.

132
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,660
Why did you say that if we were not back before dark,

133
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,020
those waiting in town would inform the sect of it?

134
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,460
I don't remember we made that arrangement.

135
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,539
I found Xuanyuan Sect strange, too.

136
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:21,539
That's why I said that.

137
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:24,225
Maybe I was worried for nothing.

138
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,324
<i>[XUANYUAN SECT]</i>

139
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,260
Please calm down, my fellow divine messengers.

140
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,300
Sect Leader...

141
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,140
Sect Leader did so to get rid of the suspicion of the five sects.

142
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,540
- That's why he sent that gift. <br> - Yes.

143
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,339
I've checked on it. There's nothing wrong with it.

144
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:42,980
You need not worry, my fellow divine messengers.

145
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,620
Sect Leader, you mustn't do such an unexpected thing again.

146
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,419
Hand over the spirit keys

147
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:51,660
and Xuanyuan Sect will be saved.

148
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,860
Xuanyuan Sect has been gone for a thousand years.

149
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,652
Whether it can exist after that,

150
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,203
that depends on fate.

151
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:02,679
Instead of being controlled by demons

152
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,731
and existing on the brink of collapse,

153
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,170
it'd rather die an honorable death.

154
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,100
Do you stop your sect from being honorable?

155
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,959
My fellow divine messengers, Sect Leader is just being stubborn.

156
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,279
Perhaps he hasn't figured out your compliments to him.

157
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,500
Please allow me a few more days.

158
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,780
I promise that I'll persuade Sect Leader

159
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,179
to hand over the spirit keys.

160
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,199
I don't have to remind you all.

161
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,679
The deadline is in three days.

162
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,836
You don't have much time left.

163
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,650
- Sect Leader! <br> - Sect Leader!

164
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,959
Go away.

165
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,439
Sect Leader, the poison is going to attack your body.

166
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,640
Why can't you stop being stubborn?

167
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,280
That's right, Sect Leader.

168
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,220
Stop being stubborn.

169
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,440
Based on what those young people said,

170
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,420
Ling Shi's method isn't going to work soon.

171
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,604
Today, another ten Xuanyuan disciples have died.

172
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,906
Do you want all of our disciples to be killed?

173
00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:12,698
Yes, Sect Leader.

174
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:20,524
Xuanyuan Sect made a mistake.

175
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,361
We can't make another one.

176
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,399
You're back. You're hungry, aren't you?

177
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,912
I've prepared supper. Let's eat together.

178
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,140
I'm a bit tired. I'm going to bed first.

179
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,620
Linglong.

180
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,300
Linglong!

181
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,659
Sifeng, I have something to tell you.

182
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:04,036
It's very important. I have to say it now.

183
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,679
Master, Green Feather marks are on your wrist

184
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,959
and the Lover's Curse is now in your body.

185
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,780
I knew you'd find it out.

186
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,980
Don't tell Xuanji about it.

187
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,319
Now isn't the time to care about her! I don't care.

188
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:29,180
You can't stay here anymore.

189
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,752
Let's go. We'll go back to Lize Palace.

190
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:32,785
And we won't come back again, okay?

191
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,180
Then, we'll lock ourselves in Lize Palace forever.

192
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,079
I'd rather die.

193
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,256
You won't die.

194
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:44,680
It takes three attacks from the Lover's Curse for the blood to flow backward.

195
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,016
If you don't get hurt by love, the curse won't attack and you'll be fine.

196
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,285
That's right.

197
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:52,660
That's why I think I can still manage it.

198
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,298
What are you worried about?

199
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,180
But Chu Xuanji is unreliable.

200
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,220
She doesn't love you at all.

201
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,724
You shouldn't have fallen in love with her,

202
00:13:00,724 --> 00:13:02,440
and you're in a complicated relationship with her.

203
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,740
She'll get you killed, Master!

204
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,599
Little Silver Flower, you're getting unruly.

205
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,205
Please calm down, Master.

206
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:15,500
You were fortunate enough to cultivate yourself into a human form, and it was not easy.

207
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,700
That's why I let you pretend to be a Dianjinggu disciple

208
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,682
and train with me.

209
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,180
You're not here to control me.

210
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,821
You can't restrain me or meddle with my affairs.

211
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,220
Because I... I don't understand your decision.

212
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,606
I want you to stay alive, Master.

213
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,380
You're right.

214
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,654
I should stay alive.

215
00:13:38,654 --> 00:13:40,139
You're my spirit beast.

216
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:41,740
Our six senses are connected.

217
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,940
Can you not feel how happy I am.

218
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,985
Get up.

219
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,760
Little Silver Flower,

220
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,180
did you know? The moment I put on the Lover's Curse Mask,

221
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,380
I thought I'd never be happy again.

222
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,300
I was scared that the curse would take my life.

223
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,497
That it would control me.

224
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,545
But now I'm very happy and carefree.

225
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:17,359
I was presumptuous enough to make this decision.

226
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,615
I let myself fall in love with her.

227
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,004
All this is my decision.

228
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,100
No matter what happens in the future, I'll bear all the cost

229
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,919
and I won't regret it.

230
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,857
Do you understand now?

231
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,939
I do.

232
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:41,660
But you'll die eventually.

233
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,660
I don't want you to die, Master.

234
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,100
I don't want!

235
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,980
<i>Stop being so dramatic.</i>

236
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,960
<i>Nobody is dying here.</i>

237
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,220
Little Silver Flower, we used to go up the heavenly realm together.

238
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,805
Can you be more polite to me?

239
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,220
If your hand slips and you accidentally kill me,

240
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,280
then your master is dead meat.

241
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,679
Eldest Brother Liu, you haven't gotten rid of the bad habit of eavesdropping.

242
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,140
If it hadn't been for my eavesdropping habit,

243
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,700
I wouldn't have found out your lifeline.

244
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,995
Lifeline?

245
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:24,112
What lifeline?

246
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,608
Of course, it's a lifeline that breaks your master's Lover's Curse.

247
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,219
You're kidding me, Eldest Brother Liu.

248
00:15:34,219 --> 00:15:36,739
There's no way to break it.

249
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:40,760
Little Phoenix, you're very lucky indeed.

250
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,499
On the day I sneaked into Lize Palace to visit you,

251
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:47,620
I eavesdropped on the conversation between the Master and the Deputy Chief.

252
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,339
And I found out that there's a secret chamber in Lize Palace.

253
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:53,940
There's a dossier in that secret chamber

254
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,019
and the dossier records the solution to Lover's Curse.

255
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,260
What's the solution?

256
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,967
I'll do whatever it takes to break the curse for Master.

257
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,399
Well, it has nothing to do with you.

258
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,220
The only person who can save your master is Chu Xuanji.

259
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,667
Chu Xuanji.

260
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:19,219
We all know that when the curse starts working,

261
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:22,440
one's blood will flow backward and he'll die if he gets hurt by love thrice.

262
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,139
And the mask will turn into a crying face.

263
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:30,340
It's impossible for one to not get hurt by love.

264
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,019
Thus, this curse became a death curse.

265
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:37,420
And that's the reason why there's a lifeline.

266
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,299
If the one you love treats you with all her heart

267
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,020
and is loyal to you, she can take off your mask

268
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,597
and the mask will turn into a smiling face.

269
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,340
Why so?

270
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,000
I've never heard of this solution to the Lover's Curse.

271
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,765
Well...

272
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,179
Because only the two palace masters can enter the secret chamber.

273
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,900
Naturally, they don't believe there are loyal partners in the world.

274
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,699
That's why they've never brought it up. That's normal.

275
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:09,619
I'm bringing her here to take off my master's mask.

276
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,219
Here's the main point. They have to love each other.

277
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:17,019
- They have to love each other? <br> - Thus, I'm reminding you.

278
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:18,715
You'd better not act recklessly.

279
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:21,059
There's only one chance to take the mask off.

280
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,100
No second chance.

281
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,480
Little Phoenix, your life depends on

282
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:32,669
whether you can make Chu Xuanji fall in love with all her heart.

283
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,540
Thank you, Eldest Brother Liu,

284
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,139
for giving me a solution.

285
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,696
I really appreciate it.

286
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,531
- Don't mention it. <br> - But you do know that

287
00:17:41,531 --> 00:17:43,740
Xuanji has someone else in her heart?

288
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,939
I've fallen deeply in love with her.

289
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,630
It has nothing to do with her.

290
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,980
I can't force her for my own sake.

291
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,934
Look at yourself.

292
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:56,587
Look at yourself.

293
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,899
You've never troubled others.

294
00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:04,811
You're a man who endures everything alone.

295
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,299
But when it comes to love, you've got to listen to me.

296
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,380
You need to be aggressive when courting a lady.

297
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,299
I have come across many women.

298
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:20,980
I think Chu Xuanji is a confused girl who's ignorant of love.

299
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,659
She seems to know nothing about love.

300
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:28,220
Therefore, you need not take small fights seriously.

301
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,753
I have faith in our Little Phoenix.

302
00:18:31,753 --> 00:18:34,902
It's not as hard as you think it is.

303
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,539
<i>I, Zhong Minyan, only care about Chu Linglong.</i>

304
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:50,881
<i>I'm not apologizing.</i>

305
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,539
<i>You feel the same way about me. Why don't you admit it?</i>

306
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,869
<i>Can we stop lying to ourselves?</i>

307
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,179
<i>Eldest Brother Liu, you said Linglong and Sixth Senior fought because of me.</i>

308
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:12,740
<i>Why so?</i>

309
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,899
<i>Don't you see that your silly sister and that silly Zhong Minyan</i>

310
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:21,329
<i>like each other?</i>

311
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:28,179
<i>But Linglong and Sixth Senior fight all the time.</i>

312
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:31,060
<i>I thought she didn't like him at all.</i>

313
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,899
<i>Isn't it great if they like each other?</i>

314
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:39,340
<i>But, Eldest Brother Liu, why do they fight even though they like each other?</i>

315
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,059
<i>All three of us live happily together.</i>

316
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,887
<i>Isn't that great?</i>

317
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,620
<i>What's so great about it?</i>

318
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,419
<i>Can't you see that Linglong has lost her appetite</i>

319
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:53,500
<i>because she's very upset that Zhong Minyan likes both of you?</i>

320
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,539
<i>That's impossible. Linglong is very generous.</i>

321
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:59,540
<i>I enjoy eating drumsticks. So does she.</i>

322
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,139
<i>We share our drumsticks all the time. Sharing is caring.</i>

323
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,547
<i>Are you ignorant or pretending to be so?</i>

324
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,419
<i>There are many things in this world that can't be shared,</i>

325
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:17,599
<i>especially one's loved one. That can't be shared.</i>

326
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,881
<i>Who said so?</i>

327
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:23,040
<i>Linglong and I like Father. And she's not mad about it.</i>

328
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,799
<i>Xiao Xuanji, humans are very greedy.</i>

329
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,859
<i>There are many kinds of likes.</i>

330
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,899
<i>You like drumsticks. And I like drinks.</i>

331
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,979
<i>You like your father. And I like Little Phoenix.</i>

332
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:40,928
<i>Yet, someone will make you forget about all these likes.</i>

333
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,733
<i>You still don't get it?</i>

334
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,219
<i>Let me put it this way.</i>

335
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:51,699
<i>If you were to travel alone to a desert island</i>

336
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:53,459
<i>and stay there forever,</i>

337
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:55,659
<i>you could take someone along to keep you company.</i>

338
00:20:55,659 --> 00:21:00,219
<i>That's the one whom you wouldn't share with others.</i>

339
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,979
<i>Would you abandon Linglong</i>

340
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:05,928
<i>and stay on the desert island with Minyan forever?</i>

341
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,159
<i>That means he's not the one.</i>

342
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,499
The one and the only.

343
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:17,660
Someone who can't be shared.

344
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:23,299
Linglong seems to treat Minyan differently

345
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:28,988
and Minyan seems to treat Linglong differently.

346
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,007
Did I really make a mistake?

347
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,480
Fill her bowl.

348
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,238
Fill her bowl.

349
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,806
Sifeng said vegetables help you grow taller.

350
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,979
Linglong, what happened yesterday between you and Sixth Senior?

351
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,953
We...

352
00:22:19,949 --> 00:22:22,806
- Here. <br> - Leave me be.

353
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,034
I can't do it.

354
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:28,539
Why did you say it out loud?

355
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:30,794
How embarrassing.

356
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,739
What's so embarrassing about it?

357
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:35,219
All these years, whenever I see you,

358
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:38,699
I feel like catching a glimpse of you and talking to you more often.

359
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:41,719
I feel happy even when we're bantering.

360
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,499
Today, I'd like to make things clear in front of you all.

361
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,898
The one I like is you.

362
00:22:48,898 --> 00:22:51,419
I've already told you. If you let Xuanji down, I'll kill you.

363
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:52,979
Go ahead and kill me then.

364
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:55,299
I'd tell the same thing to anyone.

365
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:56,959
There's nothing between me and Xuanji.

366
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,519
- You... <br> - I only have you in my heart.

367
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,699
You shut up! You...

368
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:01,513
Linglong!

369
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,419
Sixth Senior is telling the truth.

370
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:05,819
What nonsense are you talking about?

371
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,219
I promised Mother that I'd protect you.

372
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,539
No one can bully you.

373
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:10,759
No one is bullying me.

374
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,739
I made a mistake.

375
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,339
I thought I liked Sixth Senior.

376
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:17,677
Actually, it's all a misunderstanding.

377
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,987
Misunderstanding?

378
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:21,540
You told me that

379
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,599
one feels like seeing the person she likes every day.

380
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,259
When I was locked inside the Mingxia Cave,

381
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:28,699
I just recovered my sense of taste

382
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,859
and Sixth Senior sent me good foods every day.

383
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,839
That's why I felt like seeing him all the time.

384
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,199
I thought I liked him.

385
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,220
But I found out that I was just craving foods.

386
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,379
I then thought about it.

387
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:46,259
Sixth Senior didn't make those foods.

388
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,959
They were prepared by the cook in our sect.

389
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,059
Does that mean I like the cook?

390
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:55,239
Xuanji, is this the reason why you...

391
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:57,779
Yes! I just found out yesterday

392
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:00,959
that the like between you and Sixth Senior

393
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,519
is a unique one that can't be shared.

394
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,699
I'm different. There are many people whom I like.

395
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:11,219
Thus, Linglong, I'm returning this dagger to its owner.

396
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:12,539
Don't ever fight again, okay?

397
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,080
Here, sit down and eat your food.

398
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,559
No.

399
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,120
If you don't like each other, why did you hug each other on that day?

400
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,379
Zhong Minyan, you still wanted to take advantage of my sister!

401
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:41,811
- I... <br> - Linglong!

402
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:43,179
That's not what happened.

403
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:48,486
Do you still remember the incident where Gudiao was killed at Mount Lutai?

404
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,891
Actually, I killed it.

405
00:24:59,892 --> 00:25:01,239
Xuanji!

406
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,979
Sixth Senior, you need not keep this secret of mine anymore.

407
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:06,923
I killed Aoyin at Mount Haiwan

408
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:11,104
with the blue light, which isn't the Yang Jue Skill.

409
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,539
It's a kind of strange power that I know nothing about.

410
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,659
It made me lose consciousness.

411
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:23,464
I don't remember what happened afterward.

412
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:25,992
Sixth Senior saw it.

413
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:30,513
He was afraid I'd be seen as a freak. That's why he kept this secret.

414
00:25:30,513 --> 00:25:35,499
We were wondering if it had anything to do with the Mirror of Origin?

415
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,499
We thought of destroying that mirror

416
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:40,779
so that these weird things wouldn't happen again.

417
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:44,019
On that day, we tried to destroy the mirror at the inn.

418
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:46,139
But that spell bounced back.

419
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:48,619
We hugged because of the spell.

420
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:50,746
Why was it so strange?

421
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:52,287
It's...

422
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,459
The misunderstanding has been resolved!

423
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:55,852
It's a good thing!

424
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:58,419
But, Xuanji, do you have any symptoms?

425
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:00,279
- Are you feeling not well? <br> - No.

426
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,059
I'm fine without that blue light.

427
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:06,619
I didn't want to make you worried. That's why I kept it from you all.

428
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:11,626
But now, I was left with no choice.

429
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:14,939
Do you believe me now?

430
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:17,499
You tried to show off even though you were not skilled.

431
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:19,559
Also, why did you hide it from me?

432
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:23,159
Did you think I'd hurt Xuanji or spread a rumor?

433
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,739
I was wrong, my dear.

434
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:29,179
I regret making such a grave mistake.

435
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:32,539
Forgive me and I'll do anything for you.

436
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,999
And I'd like to gift this dagger to you.

437
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,179
Look.

438
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:43,561
Your name is actually engraved on it.

439
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:47,876
<i>[LINGLONG]</i>

440
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:51,779
It's all a misunderstanding.

441
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:55,919
I've always wanted to marry a lady.

442
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,259
- She is... <br> - Shut up!

443
00:26:57,259 --> 00:26:59,019
I'm not accepting it.

444
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:02,158
I haven't forgiven you for causing such a big misunderstanding.

445
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:04,419
- Linglong, don't go! <br> - Linglong!

446
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:06,199
<i>- Isn't the misunderstanding resolved? <br> - Linglong!</i> <br> - You fool!

447
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,059
<i>Why are you still fighting, Linglong?</i>

448
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,109
Girl.

449
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,059
They're not fighting.

450
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:15,119
That's called flirting.

451
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:17,719
I'm jealous.

452
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,459
Although you usually seem confused,

453
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:24,419
you act decisively at crucial moments.

454
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:25,979
Not bad.

455
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:31,219
Thus, I think that impulsive warrior isn't suitable for you.

456
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:32,379
But it's okay.

457
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:34,179
We have another model.

458
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:36,671
You're suitable for a man who's gentle, determined, polite,

459
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:41,352
charismatic, and ambitious.

460
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,677
Eldest Brother Liu, what are you talking about?

461
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,379
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

462
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,299
The best fish has always been with you.

463
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:57,979
Turn around and you can see that he's always protected you!

464
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:00,259
Why has everyone left? Some dishes aren't served yet.

465
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:02,036
Ruo Yu.

466
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,814
Forget about what I just said.

467
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,712
- Eldest Brother Liu. <br> - I...

468
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,659
Why did the spell bounce back?

469
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,159
It was all your doing, wasn't it?

470
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:29,139
Master, I thought Chu Xuanji liked Zhong Minyan,

471
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:30,939
and I was worried about your mask.

472
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:33,359
I just wanted you to leave her soonest.

473
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,959
That's why...

474
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,219
That's why, I...

475
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:38,139
It took you a lot of effort to transform into a human.

476
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:39,465
You don't focus on cultivating yourself

477
00:28:39,465 --> 00:28:41,419
and you can't stop scheming.

478
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:45,040
It seems that you want to turn back into a snake forever.

479
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,259
No. I admit it's my fault.

480
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:51,096
Do you? Remember.

481
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:57,405
If you ever do such a thing again, I'll teach you a good lesson.

482
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,899
<i>Master, I'm okay if she can break your Lover's Curse.</i>

483
00:29:05,899 --> 00:29:10,009
<i>If she can't, I won't let her go.</i>

484
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,700
I was trying to matchmake for you. Why did you run away?

485
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,840
Were you shy?

486
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,039
Let's go! I'll matchmake for you again.

487
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:50,499
Eldest Brother Liu, surely Xuanji feels troubled about what just happened.

488
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:52,897
Let's not make her feel more upset.

489
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,119
Little Phoenix, you remain a gentleman at this critical moment.

490
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,199
Xuanji is like a blank paper.

491
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,179
You'll draw whatever you want.

492
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:10,499
Think about it. Her sixth senior sent her a meal

493
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:12,859
and she thought she liked him!

494
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:17,059
You have many chances to make her surrender herself to you.

495
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:20,339
It depends on whether you will seize the opportunity.

496
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:23,860
I'm anxious about seeing you this way.

497
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,819
You and Xuanji are just two stiffs.

498
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:30,793
If it keeps going this way, you'll remain two stiffs after a hundred years.

499
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,679
Let's do it this way.

500
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:40,760
You will walk to her and be a fortune teller.

501
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,519
"Miss, according to your Five Elements, you're in need of a man."

502
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:46,659
"What do you think about me?"

503
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:48,790
This trick is not good enough.

504
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,659
Fine.

505
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,139
Let's have a more straightforward one.

506
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:57,095
You'll choose a moonless and windy night.

507
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:07,753
Eldest Brother Liu, just keep these tricks for yourself.

508
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,046
Fine.

509
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,899
Little Phoenix, take it.

510
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,014
Don't say I didn't help you.

511
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,043
Thank you, Sifeng,

512
00:31:46,044 --> 00:31:48,426
for the long walk.

513
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:53,159
Back when I was in Shaoyang, I was really silly.

514
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,699
The seniors and juniors always bullied me.

515
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:57,579
But whenever I was upset,

516
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:00,779
only Linglong and Sixth Senior would cheer me up.

517
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,739
They've been fighting these past two days.

518
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:05,944
I'm actually worried about it.

519
00:32:05,944 --> 00:32:08,019
I was truly silly back then.

520
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:12,019
I always imposed my feelings upon others.

521
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:16,262
Now that you understand it, that means you're not ridiculously silly.

522
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,519
Xuanj, what's wrong?

523
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,179
Xuanji, don't cry.

524
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,031
Got you!

525
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:40,339
Did you forget that I can't cry?

526
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:41,739
It's the Merman's Tear.

527
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:43,891
Why were you panicking?

528
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,339
I see.

529
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,858
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

530
00:32:49,858 --> 00:32:54,099
It's because when Second Senior was rejected by Senior Duan Min,

531
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,659
he cried so hard.

532
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:57,659
His nose ran and his tears kept falling.

533
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:02,059
That's why I think this is where I should cry.

534
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:03,839
But I can't do it.

535
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,139
That's why I pretended to cry.

536
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:12,699
I think your second senior made that up to save face.

537
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,779
Tears are a precious thing.

538
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:19,139
Even if you pretend to cry, you can't simply let your tears flow.

539
00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:20,853
Get it?

540
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,979
I find that embarrassing, too.

541
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:26,990
I really want to be like everyone else.

542
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,811
That's why I made such a joke.

543
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:34,206
I need to stop being confused.

544
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,959
When I was young, my mother taught me

545
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,591
to write the names of important people in a notebook.

546
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,903
Look.

547
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,847
<i>[FATHER, MOTHER, SIXTH SENIOR, SISTER]</i>

548
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:05,390
<i>[SENIOR HAO CHEN, YU SIFENG]</i>

549
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:15,865
You wrote my name, too.

550
00:34:15,865 --> 00:34:17,459
Of course I did, Sifeng.

551
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:19,682
You're very important.

552
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,459
But Eldest Brother Liu said that

553
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,926
it's unique to like someone and it can't be shared.

554
00:34:24,926 --> 00:34:28,265
But I find all of these people important.

555
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:29,639
And I like them all.

556
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,140
Can't I?

557
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:36,459
<i>She sees no difference between kinship, friendship, and a relationship.</i>

558
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:39,602
<i>She really knows nothing about them.</i>

559
00:34:39,602 --> 00:34:44,179
Actually, there's no need to distinguish them from each other.

560
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,858
They're all feelings that come from one's heart.

561
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:51,028
You'll figure it out eventually.

562
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,511
But I don't think I will.

563
00:34:57,511 --> 00:35:01,379
You do know that I lack the six senses.

564
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,424
My heart can't feel them.

565
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,194
That's too bad.

566
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:12,547
I envy those who know what they're thinking.

567
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:14,739
They know what they want.

568
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:17,913
And there's me who's always confused.

569
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:25,981
Sifeng, that fragment of the Mirror of Origin, do you still keep it?

570
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,579
Yes, I do.

571
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:32,828
Do you want to keep looking for your six senses?

572
00:35:32,828 --> 00:35:34,317
I...

573
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:37,019
I do.

574
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:39,845
I want to find out my thoughts,

575
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,339
but I'm scared.

576
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:45,779
I don't wish to misunderstand others,

577
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:49,819
but I promised Senior Hao Chen

578
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:52,379
that I'd stop looking for the six senses.

579
00:35:52,379 --> 00:35:59,004
Also, what if everyone else gets hurt by my strange memory and power?

580
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:02,799
Sifeng, what should I do?

581
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,619
If you don't know your heart, you can't feel for others.

582
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:12,179
You won't know how to protect them,

583
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:16,149
and you won't know how not to hurt them. Right?

584
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,579
Your senior wants you to do good and fight evil,

585
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,539
but it's not easy to tell good from evil.

586
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:29,198
If you're confused, you can't tell good from evil.

587
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:33,899
You said you're scared of that strange power.

588
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:39,540
But it's when we're in danger that the power is unleashed.

589
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,539
I guess it's not some demon trick.

590
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:46,462
It's your secret weapon.

591
00:36:46,462 --> 00:36:50,449
Some proper guidance will even turn it into your booster.

592
00:36:52,214 --> 00:36:55,039
Besides, I'm with you.

593
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,013
No matter what happens, I'll protect you.

594
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,773
Sifeng, are you staying?

595
00:37:05,773 --> 00:37:09,134
You're not training separately again, are you?

596
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:17,110
Didn't you make me eat the Truth Pill?

597
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:22,928
I've confided myself to you.

598
00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:26,096
I knew you wouldn't leave us.

599
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,399
Xuanji, are you ready?

600
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,068
Xuanji. Xuanji!

601
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,631
Sifeng.

602
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,885
I...

603
00:38:30,885 --> 00:38:34,099
I saw that general killing people again.

604
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:36,341
And this time it's more lifelike.

605
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,637
But... But who is she?

606
00:38:41,637 --> 00:38:44,219
Why is she always on my mind?

607
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:47,939
Don't worry. A fragment can't prove anything.

608
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:52,221
When all the fragments are found, we'll know the truth.

609
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,397
There's a demonic aura.

610
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,623
Why can't I feel it?

611
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:17,592
Sifeng, is this the smell of flowers?

612
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,477
Xuanji,

613
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:27,287
you've recovered your sense of smell.

614
00:39:27,287 --> 00:39:29,530
This smells so nice.

615
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,739
There are many smells in this world.

616
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,939
Everything has its smell

617
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:39,219
and there are many interesting ones.

618
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:40,772
Come with me.

619
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:46,930
♫ <i> There's a small breeze, a small patter of rain </i> ♫

620
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:52,170
♫ <i> As soon as I saw you, I was surprised at the upheaval of my feelings </i> ♫

621
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,170
This is a peach blossom forest.

622
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,110
It's so beautiful.

623
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,239
Peach blossoms smell so nice!

624
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,770
No wonder...

625
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,420
No wonder Linglong's room is always full of flowers.

626
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:14,423
Sifeng, does each flower have its own smell?

627
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:17,819
Each of them smells different.

628
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:21,579
Sometimes its smell is more memorable than its appearance.

629
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:24,579
You can't distinguish their colors for now.

630
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:28,274
But you can differentiate them based on their smells.

631
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,852
Sifeng, what do you smell like?

632
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,699
I smell like nothing.

633
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:52,499
No, you smell good.

634
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:56,459
But it doesn't smell like a flower or food.

635
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:58,052
But...

636
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,909
it's a familiar smell.

637
00:41:22,622 --> 00:41:31,711
Xuanji, I... would like you to know that I... I...

638
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,979
Sifeng, there are too many flowers here.

639
00:41:37,979 --> 00:41:42,469
My nose has gotten uncomfortable from all of these smells.

640
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,340
It's very uncomfortable.

641
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,551
It's okay.

642
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,179
We have plenty of time.

643
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,399
There will be chances to experience it.

644
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:57,647
- Let's go there. <br> - Sure.

645
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,358
<i>[KELAI TAVERN]</i>

646
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,789
Take this.

647
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,499
Teach me how to cook tonight.

648
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:11,516
Sure.

649
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,239
<i>Senior Hao Chen, it's been a while since I last wrote my thoughts</i>

650
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:38,299
<i>because many things have happened lately.</i>

651
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:41,979
<i>But I've figured out several things.</i>

652
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:44,479
<i>I think Sifeng's right.</i>

653
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,779
<i>One should know what he's thinking</i>

654
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:51,493
<i>and not be confused.</i>

655
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,739
<i>No way.</i>

656
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:01,859
<i>If I write that,</i>

657
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:05,059
<i>Senior Hao Chen will know that I'm still looking for the mirror.</i>

658
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:07,344
<i>I'd better not tell him.</i>

659
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,059
Forget about it. Anyway, it's no big deal.

660
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,672
Sifeng?

661
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,779
Are they edible?

662
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:45,773
What a sumptuous feast.

663
00:43:45,773 --> 00:43:47,899
We can't afford it.

664
00:43:47,899 --> 00:43:50,707
What's that good smell?

665
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,846
There are so many nice dishes here.

666
00:44:03,457 --> 00:44:04,939
Why don't you dig in?

667
00:44:04,939 --> 00:44:07,840
We...

668
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,620
It's delicious!

669
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,459
- Eldest Brother Liu will buy us this meal. <br> - Minyan!

670
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:31,297
- He'll pay for it. I want to eat it, too. <br> - Linglong.

671
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,699
Ruo Yu, join us.

672
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:36,240
You...

673
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,139
Does it taste good?

674
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,692
Does it taste delicious?

675
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,710
Why don't you say something? Does it taste good?

676
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:04,960
