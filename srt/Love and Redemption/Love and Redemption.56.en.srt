00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,439
Yu Sifeng,

19
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,543
it's been three days now.

20
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:50,460
You came so early. Are you here to admit defeat?

21
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,640
I just want Xuanji to see everything that belongs to us.

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,120
No matter what your game is, it's all but useless.

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,760
Xuanji and I once planted a tree that looked exactly like that.

24
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:19,600
It was blooming with blue blossoms and covered with wind chimes.

25
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:24,314
Those notes contained our feelings.

26
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,780
I wrote down everything from memory.

27
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,560
So much time has passed, I didn't expect

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,280
that I've never forgotten any one of them.

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,640
I've told you, what you're doing is totally meaningless.

30
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:53,840
Chu Xuanji is already gone. Give it up!

31
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,599
Is that true?

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,860
Why can't you take another look then?

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,911
You're afraid that you can't confine Xuanji anymore.

34
00:03:03,912 --> 00:03:06,191
Do you think you can seal everything?

35
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:08,039
Xuanji is right here.

36
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,559
She can hear me talking to you.

37
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,672
She remembers everything.

38
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:15,780
Do you remember that you love blue flowers the most?

Xuanji.

45
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:39,719
I remember.

46
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,440

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,815
Xuanji, is that you?

50
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:02,752
You're back?

51
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:04,759
Come back to me quickly!

52
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,800
Don't be controlled by the Devil Star soul!

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,180
I don't know.

54
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,321
Can you see me through his eyes?

55
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:18,640
Xuanji, I can see you!

56
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,712
I can!

57
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:22,740
Sifeng,

58
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,246
tell me quickly. What else do I like?

59
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,399
Xuanji! Xuanji!

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,080
Xuanji!

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,719
You like dessert.

62
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,479
You like the fragrance of flowers.

63
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,759
You like the moonlit night in Shaoyang, and all the places we've visited together.

64
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,060
We agreed to spend the rest of our lives in utopia.

65
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,479
Right.

66
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,620
Utopia.

67
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,780
Is the Rose Gold Bird clan hiding in utopia, too?

68
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,479
- Where are they? <br> - In the swamp of Longshan Village.

69
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,560
Where exactly in that swamp?

70
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,120
You're not Xuanji!

71
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:21,380
Yu Sifeng, oh, Yu Sifeng.

72
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,999
You truly love her deeply.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,955
You fall for this trick every time.

74
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:31,519
I just didn't expect you to come to your senses so soon.

75
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,240
But I've asked almost everything.

76
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,700
The Rose Gold Birds are in the swamp of Longshan Village.

77
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,159
You actually used a hallucination spell to worm facts out of me?

78
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,399
How could you call yourself Demon Lord?

79
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,060
You're so despicable to break your promise!

80
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,180
It's already seven o'clock.

81
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,123
Three days have passed.

82
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,519
Your Chu Xuanji didn't appear at all.

83
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,011
I've kept my word and only used a hallucination spell on you after 7:00.

84
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:05,239
Accept defeat, Yu Sifeng.

85
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,839
All your childish memories and pitiful love

86
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,559
are petty and insignificant in my eyes.

87
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,079
- They are worth nothing. <br> - You're lying!

88
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,280
Xuanji clearly responded.

89
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,239
The eyes can't hide it.

90
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,599
It's Xuanji.

91
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,760
Xuanji is affecting you.

92
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,959
I'm Devil Maleficent, the Lord of the Demon Citadel.

93
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,759
No one can stop me even if I were to destroy the world.

94
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,999
Do I need to lie to a pest like you?

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,070
Even if this primordial spirit was in love with you

96
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,959
when it became Chu Xuanji, so what?

97
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,159
So what if she pledged eternal loyalty to you before?

98
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,592
She was just playing along. It was entirely unreal.

99
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:52,999
She doesn't understand the past.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,471
Now that she has all my memories,

101
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:58,959
she'll know that sincere love and eternal promises

102
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,700
are the biggest joke!

103
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,510
Why didn't you believe it from the beginning?

104
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,840
What have you been through?

105
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,220
Yu Sifeng, do you think a piece of memory left in Chu Xuanji's primordial spirit

106
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,559
will allow you to do as you wish without costing you your life?

107
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,940
Fine. I'll show you the price you'll pay for offending me.

108
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,000
Xuanji.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,039
<i>Sifeng! Let go of him!</i>

110
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,639
<i>Let go of him! Don't hurt Sifeng!</i>

111
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,768
<i>Let go of him!</i>

112
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:54,344
<i>I forbid you to hurt Sifeng!</i>

113
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:56,220
<i>Let go of him!</i>

114
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,220
<i>Let go of him!</i>

115
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,959
<i>Let go of him!</i>

116
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,319
<i>Devil Maleficent!</i>

117
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,620
<i>I won't let you hurt Sifeng!</i>

118
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,359
<i>Let go of him!</i>

119
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,380
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

120
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,440
Sifeng!

121
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,100
Xuanji!

122
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,960
Sifeng!

123
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,799
Xuanji!

124
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,890
Sifeng!

125
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,616
Leave here quickly!

126
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:47,359
We promised to stay inseparable!

127
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,032
How can I abandon you?

128
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:51,460
Don't be so foolish!

129
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,119
Xuanji!

130
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,900
Get lost!

131
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,580
Devil Maleficent, you lost.

132
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,439
Xuanji has always been here.

133
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,460
She appeared.

134
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,960
I told you, you can't kill me.

135
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,320
Xuanji will never let you kill me.

136
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:29,119
I only showed you mercy and spared you your life because you saved

137
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,519
my primordial spirit many times before.

138
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,180
However, don't take my kindness as your bargaining chip.

139
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,279
I've sealed your meridians.

140
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,260
Before I find the Rose Gold Bird,

141
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,420
you better stay in the Demon Citadel.

142
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,220
<i>[Together whether alive or in death.]</i>

143
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,711
Chu Xuanji, are you going to put away thousands of years

144
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:26,879
of hatred and humiliation we've suffered?

145
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,399
<i>I don't want to kill anyone.</i>

146
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,559
<i>I don't want all life to live in misery.</i>

147
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,319
<i>And I want Sifeng to be well.</i>

148
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,760
Yu Sifeng again.

149
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,134
Do you want to be with him so much, and refuse to part with him?

150
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:39,620
Do you really believe in this?

151
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,007
<i>Yes! I believe in Sifeng!</i>

152
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:46,160
Have we not suffered enough in the past?

153
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,279
Didn't we use to believe in friendship, our friends

154
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,239
and the people we loved?

155
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,999
But what happened in the end?

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,799
What did we go through? What did we get?

157
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,679
Trust me.

158
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,326
Stop resisting me.

159
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,639
I'm doing this for our sake.

160
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,720
I'll make everyone who hurt us pay the price for it.

161
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,920
Hurry and let Xuaji out!

162
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,839
Barging into my chamber?

163
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,380
Do you really wish to die?

164
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,999
Xuanji, do you not recognize us anymore?

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,399
We're your family.

166
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,340
Family?

167
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,639
I, Devil Maleficent, have lived for over 10,000 years.

168
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,822
You mortals only live for several decades.

169
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:46,840
How dare you say such things?

170
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,399
Since you once took care of my primordial spirit,

171
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,200
I'll spare all your lives today.

172
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,541
Get lost!

173
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,159
Xuanji, you can hear us. Right?

174
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,820
Even though you've become Devil Maleficent, I believe you still have your memory.

175
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,260
You lacked six senses when you were a kid.

176
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,580
It was me, Father, Mother, and Minyan who stayed by your side.

177
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,898
Nothing has changed now! We're still here for you!

178
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:12,460
Xuanji, Auntie Yinghong and Uncle He Yang are missing you, too.

179
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,678
Everyone is waiting for you to return.

180
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:19,260
Xuanji, you've lived for so long, but in this lifetime,

181
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,800
our consanguinity can't be changed.

182
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,580
I'll always be your father.

183
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,239
So noisy!

184
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,779
What family? What friendship?

185
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,323
They're all displeasing sounds.

186
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:35,787
Since you like talking about love so much,

187
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:40,939
I wonder which is more important to you: your love or your lives?

188
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,012
Xuanji, I know it's you.

189
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:51,559
Before your mother died, I promised her

190
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,159
to take good care of you forever.

191
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,759
You're not good at expressing yourself, but you have a kind heart.

192
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,879
I know your mother was right.

193
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,759
Come back.

194
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,360
You shouldn't be like this.

195
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,080
Come back.

196
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:18,740
I, Devil Maleficent, will never stop.

197
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,700
The heavens sowed the seed of bitterness.

198
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,479
They have to bear the consequences.

199
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,199
I don't want to waste my time killing you.

200
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,260
Stop annoying me.

201
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,180
This is the Core Fire.

202
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,820
Take it back and set up a barrier with it.

203
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,707
When the Transcendent Furnace is overturned and fire from the heavens descends to earth,

204
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:42,420
this Core Fire can resist the fire from the heavens and protect you.

205
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,151
You can't kill me, nor can you kill them.

206
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:00,611
Actually, you've all the love inside you.

207
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:05,691
Even if you deny that you're Xuanji, she can still influence you.

208
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,500
Illusion.

209
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,620
It's just an illusion.

210
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,439
The heavens wanted me to undergo 10 lifetimes of tribulations,

211
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,960
so that the illusion of mortal love can eradicate my hatred.

212
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,079
All of you are simply pawns of the heavens.

213
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,380
Only if I burn away all the illusion can the heavens know that

214
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,199
I'm not Chu Xuanji.

215
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,639
The grudge in my heart can't be eradicated by so-called love.

216
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:40,100
I refuse to be a pitiful worm like you who allows the heavens to shove you around.

217
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,439
Will you be happy then?

218
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,759
You simply changed from being manipulated by the heavens

219
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,740
into being controlled by hatred.

220
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,340
Devil Maleficent, why can't you let go of your hatred

221
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,839
and see who you really are?

222
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,720
Let go of hatred?

223
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,780
You can't even let go of Chu Xianji! What right do you have

224
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,048
to make me forget the hatred that is buried deep in my bones?

225
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:08,580
Yu Sifeng, do you know who the God of War is?

226
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,660
Do you know how I got my body?

227
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:28,879
I'll show you.

228
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,759
Tell me if I can let go of this hatred?

229
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,380
Should I let it go?

230
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,800
The scars...

231
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,880
How did you get them?

232
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:59,420
Who did this?

233
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,176
It was Bailing.

234
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:03,960
King Bailing?

235
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:08,380
I thought Bailing was a bosom friend that I would never find again,

236
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,279
so I trusted him completely.

237
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,479
I didn't care about the difference between deities and demons.

238
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,180
I would often drink wine with him at the white pagoda by Ruoshui Pond.

239
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,820
And then...

240
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,039
the Demon-Immortal War began.

241
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,940
I thought our friendship would bridge the war.

242
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,040
But I never expected him to plot against me and harm me!

243
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,920
Yu Sifeng, I'll show you what kind of a person he is right now!

244
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,840
<i>Feel free to drink.</i>

245
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,262
<i>The heavens and demon clans are waging war.</i>

246
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:59,075
<i>I'm afraid there'll be fewer chances</i>

247
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:02,020
<i>for me to drink with you, Brother Jidou.</i>

248
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,580
<i>I was wondering why you were in a bad mood.</i>

249
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,380
<i>So it turns out you're worried about this.</i>

250
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,199
<i>Asuras are skillful in battle,</i>

251
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,599
<i>so the celestial troops were instantly defeated.</i>

252
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,119
<i>At this rate, the heavenly palace will be invaded before long.</i>

253
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,780
<i>The crux of the problem is that the heavens</i>

254
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,030
<i>doesn't have someone like you</i>

255
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,380
<i>who is invincible enough to protect us.</i>

256
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:33,399
<i>It's not my intention to see the devil and demon clans waging war on the heavens.</i>

257
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,047
<i>Unfortunately, the grievances have accumulated over the years</i>

258
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:37,439
<i>and can't be removed overnight.</i>

259
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,279
<i>But I was thinking that if you marry a woman from my clan,</i>

260
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,414
<i>perhaps it can help mitigate the war.</i>

261
00:17:43,415 --> 00:17:46,879
<i>And a woman from my clan can assist you in protecting the heavens forever.</i>

262
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,987
<i>No.</i>

263
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:49,879
<i>Gods and demons are enemies.</i>

264
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,400
<i>How can the heavens be united with the demon clan through a marriage?</i>

265
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,119
<i>Gods and demons are enemies?</i>

266
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,300
<i>Then, why did you invite me for a drink and befriend me?</i>

267
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,860
<i>Brother Jidou, you're different from other demons.</i>

268
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,170
<i>Among all the demons in the world,</i>

269
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,820
<i>you're the only one that I'll befriend.</i>

270
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,440
<i>Judging from the current situation,</i>

271
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,950
<i>I wonder how much longer</i>

272
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,320
<i>we can drink together like this.</i>

273
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,799
<i>The three realms are so big that it's hard to find a bosom friend.</i>

274
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,539
<i>I'm willing to drink and talk to you every day.</i>

275
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,060
<i>Is that true?</i>

276
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,299
<i>We're friends. Don't you trust me?</i>

277
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:52,750
<i>I'm just afraid that once the heavens are conquered,</i>

278
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:55,759
<i>the three realms will descend into chaos.</i>

279
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,140
<i>All the gods and deities won't be able to escape from their doom.</i>

280
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,563
<i>You need not worry about the war.</i>

281
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:09,660
<i>I brought good news for you.</i>

282
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,240
<i>Something is wrong with the wine.</i>

283
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,760
<i>What do you mean?</i>

284
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,039
<i>Brother Maleficent,</i>

285
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,120
<i>didn't you just say you wanted to drink and talk with me every day?</i>

286
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,971
<i>Unfortunately, you're an Asura after all.</i>

287
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,760
<i>That makes me uneasy.</i>

288
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,159
<i>But if I can completely turn you to my side,</i>

289
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,740
<i>then only I can rest easy forever.</i>

290
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,920
<i>What did you say?</i>

291
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,560
<i>I'm sorry, Devil Maleficent.</i>

292
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,780
<i>I'm only doing this for the sake of the heavens.</i>

293
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,155
<i>Brother Maleficent, you shouldn't have woken up so soon.</i>

294
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:38,600
<i>We're friends.</i>

295
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,600
<i>The current situation won't look good for you.</i>

296
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,180
<i>Since you'll forget everything soon,</i>

297
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,879
<i>I won't hide it from you.</i>

298
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,879
<i>I'll change your entire appearance</i>

299
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,780
<i>so that you can make a clean cut from the past.</i>

300
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,320
<i>You'll transform into a new person.</i>

301
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,319
<i>No one will ever be able to recognize you.</i>

302
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,439
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

303
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,479
<i>Didn't you want to drink and talk to me every day?</i>

304
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,630
<i>It's the only way to fulfill your wish.</i>

305
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:22,380
<i>This is best for all of us.</i>

306
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:49,352
<i>These two weapons made from demonic bones are too vindictive.</i>

307
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:55,960
<i>I'll remove them for you and find you another weapon in the future.</i>

308
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,599
<i>My King, the Heavenly King has ordered</i>

309
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,119
<i>you to release Devil Maleficent immediately.</i>

310
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,719
<i>Even if I'm willing to, I'm afraid it's too late now.</i>

311
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,159
<i>Go back and report to the Heavenly Emperor that I'll definitely</i>

312
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,720
<i>build an upstanding God of War for the heavens.</i>

313
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:38,639
<i>Brother Maleficent, I'm going to use this Crystal Lamp to seal your soul.</i>

314
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,559
<i>Lie down. Take a rest.</i>

315
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,079
<i>Devil Maleficent, you've no heart now.</i>

316
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,081
<i>I'll use the corner of the crystal as your heart.</i>

317
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:07,820
<i>All your six senses will be gone.</i>

318
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,390
<i>You'll be at my disposal.</i>

319
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:15,150
♫ <i> Explore the universe </i> ♫

320
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,080
♫ <i> The sword brings forth a sandstorm </i> ♫

321
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,510
♫ <i> Grasping the mortal's view through the sword's sheath </i> ♫

322
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:26,310
♫ <i> Ask for the path through the maze </i> ♫

323
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,130
♫ <i> Measuring the distance of Heaven and Earth </i> ♫

324
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,510
♫ <i> Ruling over the wind and all creations, small and great </i> ♫

325
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,839
<i>Now, you're no longer the Devil Star, Devil Maleficent,</i>

326
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,900
<i>but the God of War of the heavens.</i>

327
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,519
<i>Starting from tomorrow, you'll serve the heavens,</i>

328
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,940
<i>wipe out all Asuras and slaughter the Demon Citadel.</i>

329
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,959
<i>Who exactly are you?</i>

330
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,500
<i>I am the God of War!</i>

331
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,860
I was once kind and affectionate,

332
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,980
yet I was met with heartless betrayal.

333
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,279
I didn't want to massacre, but Bailing

334
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,620
tore up my bone and turned me into a murder weapon.

335
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,359
I longed for peace and harmony,

336
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,980
but Bailing manipulated me into killing my clanmates.

337
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,920
Yu Sifeng, tell me...

338
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,740
Should I not hate?

339
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,520
Should I not seek revenge on the heavens?

340
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,540
The thing planted in my chest is just a corner of a crystal.

341
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,940
It can't contain all your feelings.

342
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:08,239
The 10 lifetimes of tribulations and the reincarnation of the God of War

343
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,500
have nothing to do with me,

344
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:17,000
because I'm a heartless person anyway.

345
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,760
Xuanji, I'm sorry

346
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,820
that you've had to suffer in agony all alone.

347
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,500
Had I known earlier,

348
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,209
I would've stayed and talked with you.

349
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:52,060
I wouldn't have let you become like this.

350
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,680
I'm sorry.

351
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,180
How many times have I told you?

352
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,439
I'm not Chu Xuanji, and I don't need your sympathy.

353
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,719
My soul has returned now.

354
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,239
There's no Chu Xuanji and Yu Sifeng. There's no one!

355
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,100
All I have are hatred and vengeance.

356
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,079
No.

357
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,760
No matter how much you hate, I know there's still a trace of love.

358
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,223
Yu Sifeng, if you don't stop this endless bickering,

359
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:40,180
I'll wipe out Chu Xuanji and your memories from my mind.

360
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,240
<i>Xuanji, I'll rescue you for sure.</i>

361
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,542
<i>Even if I have to die,</i>

362
00:26:54,542 --> 00:27:00,240
<i>I won't let you continue to live in Devil Maleficent's hatred.</i>

363
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,320
Don't panic. It's me.

364
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,660
Teng She, why have you come?

365
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,560
- I'm here to stop you from doing anything stupid. <br> - What do you mean?

366
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,940
I know you want to ask the white bird to send a message to your clanmates and tell them to hide,

367
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,660
but you're digging your own grave.

368
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,719
Demon birds are at Yuan Lang's command.

369
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,055
If you pass the letter to the white bird, Yuan Lang will get it within half a day.

370
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:34,940
But the Rose Gold Birds are in danger, I have to send them a message.

371
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,260
If you trust me enough, let me help you then.

372
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,780
After all, the heavens don't want the Rose Gold Bird to be found.

373
00:27:50,678 --> 00:27:53,286
And also, do you want to rescue Xuanji?

374
00:27:53,287 --> 00:27:56,060
I do. Do you have any plans?

375
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,080
I overheard the conversation between the king and the vermilion bird.

376
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:01,999
They wanted to pour the juice of Tianying Grass made by the sorcerer

377
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,760
into Devil Maleficent's wine to make him faint for a while.

378
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:06,999
Then, they'll take a drop of his blood

379
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,872
and put it into the Crystal Lamp as a catalyst to reseal Devil Maleficent's soul.

380
00:28:11,872 --> 00:28:16,019
When they were distracted, I stole the Crystal Lamp and the juice of Tianying Grass.

381
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:18,879
If you really can seal Devil Maleficent's soul,

382
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,279
the stinky woman will come back.

383
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,920
Is that true?

384
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,540
I've tested the juice anyway.

385
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,780
Other than making Asura faint for a while,

386
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,439
it has no other toxic effects.

387
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,872
If so, why don't we try it?

388
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:34,260
Perhaps we can really rescue Xuanji?

389
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,279
Sifeng, I don't want to see the stinky woman being controlled by Devil Maleficent

390
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,848
and do anything immoral.

391
00:28:40,848 --> 00:28:43,278
I'll leave these with you. Whether to use them or not,

392
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,300
Sifeng, it's up to you.

393
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,160
Kneel!

394
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,639
Palace Master!

395
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,319
Elder Luo.

396
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,700
- Palace Master! <br> - Elder Luo.

397
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,279
Palace Master, it's that darn Yuan Lang who caught us.

398
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,040
How could this happen?

399
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,919
How could I find them so quickly, is it?

400
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,079
Yu Sifeng, I'm also a Rose Gold Bird.

401
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,159
Of course, I know where in the vast swamp

402
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,047
is most suited for Rose Gold Birds.

403
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:37,280
As expected, I found every one of them.

404
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,119
You're also a Rose Gold Bird, why are you so cruel to your clanmates?

405
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,839
My clanmates are nothing. The demon clan is more important.

406
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,660
What's wrong with prioritizing what's most important?

407
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,559
Your meridians are sealed, yet you dare to fight me?

408
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,550
You've such unruly hands!

409
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,000
- I'll cut them off for you! <br> - Stop!

410
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,079
Yu Sifeng is my personal demon slave.

411
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,960
If you dare to hurt him, I'll kill you.

412
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,540
Demon Lord, Yu Sifeng saw that I captured the Rose Gold Birds

413
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,959
and wanted to fight with me.

414
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,140
That was why I...

415
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,159
Even if my demon slave wants to kill you, you can't touch him

416
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,199
without my order.

417
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,799
Understand?

418
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,719
Yu Sifeng, come back with me.

419
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,319
Devil Maleficent, these are my clanmates.

420
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,519
They've nothing to do with what happened back then!

421
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,639
If you sacrifice them to avenge yourself,

422
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,160
how are you any different from Bailing?

423
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,999
I tip the Transcendent Furnace to rebuild three realms

424
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,719
not only for revenge, but also to reset the rules in the three realms.

425
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,336
In contrast with this, the Rose Gold Birds' lives are trifling.

426
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:57,759
Whether you're sad or resentful,

427
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,940
I'll not change my mind for a demon slave.

428
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,399
Yuan Lang, pass my order.

429
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,199
Tomorrow morning, all the demons shall assemble.

430
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,319
We'll attack the heavens again.

431
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,560
Yes.

432
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,199
Devil Maleficent, tonight is my last chance.

433
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,999
For the sake of my clanmates, for the sake of stopping you,

434
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,260
for the sake of Xuanji, I've to reseal your soul.

435
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,655
<i>Do you know how I got my body?</i>

436
00:32:25,656 --> 00:32:27,839
<i>I'll show you.</i>

437
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,159
<i>Tell me whether this hatred can be forgotten?</i>

438
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,440
<i>Should it be forgotten?</i>

439
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,399
<i>I thought Bailing was a bosom friend that I would never find again,</i>

440
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,079
<i>so I trusted him completely.</i>

441
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,020
<i>But never had I expected him to plot against me and harm me.</i>

442
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,959
<i>You're an Asura after all.</i>

443
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,880
<i>That makes me uneasy,</i>

444
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,896
<i>but if I can completely turn you to my side,</i>

445
00:32:56,896 --> 00:33:02,020
<i>then only I can rest easy forever.</i>

446
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,200
Do you think a god can enter the Demon Citadel unnoticed by me?

447
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,839
I knew each and every one of Teng She's and your moves,

448
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,039
but I'm curious.

449
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,999
The only chance to save the Rose Gold Birds is right before you.

450
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,959
Why did you choose to give up?

451
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,759
I do want to save my clanmates,

452
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,520
but for the sake of justice in the three realms, I can't do that.

453
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,599
You're very lucky.

454
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,639
If you really put a drop of my blood in the Jade Cup,

455
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,900
the situation would be so much worse.

456
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,660
You don't get it?

457
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,119
Fine.

458
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,960
I'll show you what exactly is inside the Crystal Lamp.

459
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,318
It's the Golden Flame in the Transcendent Furnace.

460
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:24,199
It was sealed within Zhongtian Palace, for the fortune of all life.

461
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,284
It loses power once it leaves the palace.

462
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:30,100
But there's one exception,

463
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,368
which is to use Asura's blood to break the seal.

464
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:36,492
Bailing deliberately let Teng She overhear the conversation

465
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:38,959
and tricked you into getting my blood

466
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,999
in order for the Golden Flame to explode in the mortal realm.

467
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,254
Just now, if you'd used my blood, and dropped it into the Crystal Lamp

468
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:49,600
then we would've been burned into ashes by now.

469
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,830
I never expected that as the ruler of the heavens,

470
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:54,420
Bailing is so malicious.

471
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,639
With things as such, you should agree for me to attack the heavens

472
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,300
and seek revenge on them, right?

473
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,860
No.

474
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,780
The actual culprit behind all of this is Bailing himself.

475
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,080
The other deities have no idea.

476
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,903
If you want to seek revenge, you only need to aim at Bailing.

477
00:35:18,904 --> 00:35:21,180
You don't have to involve all beings.

478
00:35:22,064 --> 00:35:24,039
I want to find him,

479
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,039
but how is it possible that such a shameless person

480
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,799
will have the audacity to meet me alone?

481
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,120
He must be hiding behind all the deities and plotting another scheme right now.

482
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,679
Yu Sifeng, he's the one who involved all beings, not me.

483
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,919
I will go to the heavens to find Bailing and persuade him to meet you.

484
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,965
You?

485
00:35:44,966 --> 00:35:46,799
I want to help you.

486
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,359
If I succeed, you can get what you want without going to war with all the demons.

487
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,078
If I fail,

488
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,199
it's only a few days of delay for you to attack the heavens.

489
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,380
You have nothing to lose.

490
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,540
You're doing this for me to release Chu Xuanji, right?

491
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:10,043
That's right. If this is done, you can't confine Xuanji anymore.

492
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:14,159
Make it happen before you use it as your bargaining chip.

493
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,200
Okay. That's settled then.

494
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,020
Aren't you afraid Bailing will get angry and kill you?

495
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:26,291
If that's the case,

496
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:30,419
I'll only have myself to blame in seeking my own doom.

497
00:36:30,419 --> 00:36:33,760
Devil Maleficent, please give me a chance.

498
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:37,160
Give all the beings in the three realms a chance.

499
00:36:38,384 --> 00:36:42,022
Fine, I promise you.

500
00:36:43,063 --> 00:36:46,959
If you can't come back alive, I'll fight my way to the heavens

501
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,759
and pull out Bailing's tendons one by one

502
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,580
to weave a Soul Gathering Flag for you.

503
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,559
Bailing, my demon slave would like to see

504
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,639
if you have any courage left to meet me

505
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,742
after being so shameless and despicable.

506
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:06,119
Be well prepared.

507
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,860
Don't disappoint him too much.

508
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,559
My King, so you purposely tricked me.

509
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,759
You wanted to trick Sifeng into using the Golden Flame to kill Devil Maleficent.

510
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,481
Don't you think this is too heinous?

511
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:27,440
Whether I had the intention or not,

512
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,560
you've colluded with demons anyway.

513
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,799
Teng She, I know you hate to part with Chu Xuanji and Yu Sifeng,

514
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,319
but Devil Maleficent is the most powerful man in three realms.

515
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,590
I could seal his soul once, but there'll never be a second time.

516
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:47,759
If I want to stop him, I have to eradicate him completely.

517
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,840
Using their lives to save the three realms is worth it!

518
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,800
My King, if you want to save the three realms,

519
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,680
you can just meet up with Devil Maleficent and talk out the grievances with him!

520
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,270
How insolent!

521
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,279
I am the ruler of the heavens!

522
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,040
Will a murderous demon like him be worthy enough to see me?

523
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,420
Pass on my imperial order!

524
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,839
From now on, the heavens shall be on high alert.

525
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,719
Any demon who dares to cross the boundary,

526
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,100
no matter what the reason is, will be killed without mercy!

527
00:39:15,328 --> 00:39:16,260
Where are you from?

528
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,180
How did you cross the Sea of Life and Death and enter the heavens?

529
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,007
I'm here to see King Bailing. I need to talk to him.

530
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:22,398
King Bailing has ordered.

531
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:24,919
Any demon who dares to cross the boundary will be killed without mercy!

532
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,080
- Take him down. <br> - Attack!

533
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,540
I'll beg the king to break your blood contract with Chu Xuanji.

534
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,880
You'll be all right then.

535
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,199
- It's unnecessary. <br> - Why?

536
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,820
Can't bear to lose her?

537
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,940
It tastes so bad!

538
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,300
It's tasteless! Just like mud!

539
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:35,559
You've tried every flavor in the mortal realm

540
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,159
and look down on food in the heavens, don't you?

541
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,639
Teng She, come back.

542
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,199
It's because of your voracious appetite that you made the mistake.

543
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,159
That's how they got the goods on you and controlled you!

544
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,919
You're not even a human.

545
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,782
You don't need food to survive,

546
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,333
nor should you have feelings for mortals.

547
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:56,140
I don't want to listen!

548
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,919
You're not even on duty today.

549
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,879
Go manage your heavenly troops.

550
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,780
Why are you here giving me lectures?

551
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,900
I've already made arrangements for them.

552
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,799
My top priority now is to persuade you.

553
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,679
Teng She, quickly figure it out.

554
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,839
Apologize to King Bailing and this will soon be over.

555
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,780
Otherwise, do you really want to share life and death with your master?

556
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,100
Wake up!

557
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,540
She's no longer a mortal girl! Nor is she the God of War!

558
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,020
She's the biggest enemy of the heavens, Devil Maleficent!

559
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:29,400
We'll eradicate him sooner or later.

560
00:41:32,515 --> 00:41:34,199
Are you done?

561
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,280
Get going then. I want to sleep.

562
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,620
Someone crossed the Sea of Life and Death.

563
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,580
Teng She, what are you doing?

564
00:41:56,408 --> 00:41:57,500
Let me go!

565
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,940
Stay here and calm yourself down.

566
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,919
I'll handle the matter at the Sea of Life and Death.

567
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,980
Teng She, get back here!

568
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,760
Move, all of you!

569
00:42:14,863 --> 00:42:16,660
Lord Teng She?

570
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,719
I mean I'm in charge of this little demon.

571
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,535
Get out of here.

572
00:42:22,536 --> 00:42:23,599
Come, fight me.

573
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,660
Fight me!

574
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,876
Is this all you have? How dare you barge into the heavens?

575
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:36,670
All right, it's none of your business now.

576
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,620
I'll take him to the prison for sanction.

577
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,247
Wait.

578
00:42:41,248 --> 00:42:43,900
Lord Teng She, aren't you being punished

579
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,020
and confined in prison by King Bailing?

580
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,119
How dare you question me?

581
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,900
I do not dare. It's just–

582
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,999
Do you see this?

583
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,840
Do I have to report to you every time King Bailing assigns me a task?

584
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,360
Let's go.

585
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,540
That was so close. Why did you venture to the heavens alone?

586
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,380
It's not a lasting solution for the heavens and the Demon Citadel to go on like this.

587
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,519
Bailing is wary of Devil Maleficent.

588
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,949
Using those dirty tricks will only deepen the hatred on both sides.

589
00:43:23,949 --> 00:43:26,660
Do you think the situation will get any better

590
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,959
if King Bailing is willing to see Devil Maleficent?

591
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,632
Sifeng, Devil Maleficent isn't that stinky woman, Xuanji.

592
00:43:32,633 --> 00:43:33,840
He is.

593
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,479
They share the same origin and life.

594
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,734
I believe that Devil Maleficent just wants to seek justice for himself.

595
00:43:40,735 --> 00:43:42,519
He doesn't want all life to be in misery.

596
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,679
I don't know.

597
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,606
I think if you recklessly see King Bailing, you'll only anger him.

598
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:48,820
It's too dangerous! He'll kill you!

599
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,391
If the three realms and the demon realm are at war

600
00:43:52,392 --> 00:43:54,403
then I'll not be the only one in danger.

601
00:43:54,403 --> 00:43:58,220
Even if it's risky, I need to try it.

602
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,838
Teng She! You're really imprudent!

603
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,040
Don't try to let the demon go!

604
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,999
Hurry and go! King Bailing is in Zhongtian Palace.

605
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,959
I'll stop this Green Dragon.

606
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,620
Thank you.

607
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,279
<i>You're a mere demon, how dare you to trespass in my palace?</i>

608
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,839
<i>The Evil Suppression Mantra in Zhongtian</i>

609
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,439
<i>won't allow anyone without a celestial soul to pass through.</i>

610
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,879
<i>Once a demon steps into it, he can't live for long before turning into ashes.</i>

611
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,679
<i>You've sought your own demise.</i>

612
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,334
King Bailing, you know why I'm here.

613
00:44:43,335 --> 00:44:46,879
The heavens and demon realms don't have to fight to the death.

614
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,959
Why must you push the matter beyond the point of no return?

615
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,999
<i>Do not distort the truth!</i>

616
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,660
<i>It's Devil Maleficent who wanted to overturn the three realms with his demons.</i>

617
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,959
<i>He destroyed Fenru City, broke through the Demon Citadel,</i>

618
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,559
<i>smashed the heavenly gate and forced the heavens to release the Sea of Life and Death.</i>

619
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:03,780
<i>It all happened because of him!</i>

620
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,679
<i>How dare you come and claim innocence?</i>

621
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,679
<i>The heavens will surely eradicate him, and wipe out all the demons,</i>

622
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,520
<i>and I will stop wasting my breath on a dying demon like you!</i>

623
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,159
Why do you possess a celestial soul?

624
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,486
I have no idea.

625
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:45,150
Perhaps you're mistaken.

626
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:47,559
Stop playing tricks.

627
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,280
I'll know your identity right away.

628
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,080
Xi Xuan?

629
00:46:18,135 --> 00:46:19,719
<i>You did nothing wrong.</i>

630
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,900
<i>You shouldn't die here.</i>

631
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:24,519
<i>Who are you?</i>

632
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,918
<i>I'll send you to Fenru City to enter the mortal realm.</i>

633
00:46:26,919 --> 00:46:29,640
<i>The heavens can't simply hurt you there.</i>

634
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,260
<i>No!</i>

635
00:46:44,696 --> 00:46:46,440
<i>Let her go.</i>

636
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,879
<i>Greetings, Heavenly Emperor.</i>

637
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,079
<i>God of War,</i>

638
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,159
<i>my son, Xi Xuan, is willing to lose his 10,000-year-old immortal form</i>

639
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,559
<i>to beg for a chance of survival for you.</i>

640
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,479
<i>Regarding this, the blame is on the heavens after all.</i>

641
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,022
<i>We've wronged you.</i>

642
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:06,340
<i>So today, I'll let you undergo ten lifetimes of trials in the mortal realm</i>

643
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,839
<i>to wear out your resentment.</i>

644
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,400
<i>As for your fate, it depends on you.</i>

645
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,639
<i>Xi Xuan, my son, as the Celestial Rose Gold Bird,</i>

646
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,759
<i>it took you 10,000 years to take on a human form</i>

647
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,679
<i>but if you become a mortal now, you'll lose your immortality.</i>

648
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,360
<i>Do you regret it?</i>

649
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,800
<i>I have no regrets.</i>

650
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:31,140
<i>Never mind. You go to the mortal realm and undergo ten lifetimes of trials, too.</i>

651
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,780
<i>Bailing, do you regret your actions today?</i>

652
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,900
<i>I did everything for the three realms.</i>

653
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,820
<i>I have nothing to regret!</i>
