18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,712
The Five Great Sects were arrogant and selfish.

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,440
All of you didn't treat Tianxu Hall seriously.

20
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,580
Now that everything has gone to hell and the spirit keys have been stolen,

21
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:57,759
you are just trying to find an excuse for your mistakes.

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,660
You want someone to take the blame.

23
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:06,000
This blame will not be born by me and my spirit beast.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,730
I will be suffering alone from this heavy punishment.

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,351
Fine.

26
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,760
I knew it was you.

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,680
You changed?

28
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,315
How is it? Do you like it?

29
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:53,560
You changed for me?

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,439
What if I don't?

31
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,570
If you don't, I won't dress like this.

32
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,078
What do you like? Tell me.

33
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:10,639
I don't need it.

34
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,919
What? You don't like that I'm trying to make you happy?

35
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,150
You are not the type who will purposely make people happy.

36
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:17,267
You are arrogant. You never bat an eye.

37
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:21,359
You will provoke someone when you are unhappy.

38
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,717
You were like that when I first met you under Mount Shaoyang.

39
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,603
Your temper angers people.

40
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:30,060
But I like to make you angry.

41
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,179
I like to see you getting angry.

42
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,959
I like it when you get impatient.

43
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,460
I like it when you stare at me with anger.

44
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,546
What are you talking about? I don't know.

45
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:54,044
Although you've forgotten about everything in the past, you are still Linglong.

46
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:57,939
You can't change!

47
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,378
What are you talking about? I don't know anything!

48
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:02,680
You are my benefactor. I just want to make you happy.

49
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:06,020
I'll leave if you don't like it.

50
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,520
Let me go!

51
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,200
Who allowed you to leave?

52
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,600
Who asked you to repay me?

53
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,359
I like how you are right now.

54
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Willful. Bossy.

55
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,166
Opposing me angrily.

56
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,184
You're crazy.

57
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,060
You don't know how charming you look right now.

58
00:04:57,077 --> 00:05:00,959
That's not right. How could you not resist me?

59
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,199
You were never the type to obey people.

60
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,900
I'm even trying to kiss you.

61
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,279
You should hit me, scold me, and oppose me. You should push me away.

62
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,802
You should slap me! Slap me!

63
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,320
You asked me to slap you.

64
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,999
What is that expression?

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,600
What do you want me to do?

66
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,020
Yes. You are really Linglong.

67
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,020
Just keep it this way and be by my side obediently, all right?

68
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,719
I have a temper!

69
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,020
I will ignore you if you keep this up.

70
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,493
If you stay like this, I will listen to you.

71
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,560
<i>Xuanji.</i>

72
00:06:47,738 --> 00:06:51,013
<i>Xuanji!</i>

73
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,539
Xuanji!

74
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,380
How are you?

75
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,020
Are you trying to force your sealed inner force? Nonsense!

76
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,839
Senior Hao Chen's power is far greater than yours.

77
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,079
Your inner force sealed by his qi will not be easily broken by force.

78
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,220
Unfortunately, I didn't succeed.

79
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,110
I'm so useless.

80
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,159
What are you doing? You're still trying?

81
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,320
Do you want to die?

82
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:23,200
I am restricted in the way I am.

83
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,559
I can't help Sifeng at all.

84
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,180
I couldn't find the demon hiding on Fuyu Island.

85
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,527
I don't even know how Sifeng is right now.

86
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:34,584
Even if...

87
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:39,850
Even if none of you believe him, I still won't give up.

88
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,414
Sixth Senior.

89
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:48,020
I will be responsible for my own life.

90
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,119
I'm willing to take such a risk for Sifeng.

91
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,740
I think you've gone mad.

92
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,599
I didn't say I didn't trust him.

93
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,439
I've gotten Master's approval to talk to him in prison.

94
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Let me see how he is doing and talk about it when I'm back.

95
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,320
Fine.

96
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,600
Hall Master.

97
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:41,791
I fought courageously for you and made the plan.

98
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,639
I helped Wolf obtain two spirit keys.

99
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,502
I don't know why I deserve this punishment.

100
00:08:45,503 --> 00:08:49,859
You did contribute at the battle of Fuyu Island but it's not enough to atone for your mistakes.

101
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:52,719
What did you do when I asked you to fake an attack on Fuyu Island?

102
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,220
You took Tianxu Hall's demon forces and rushed to battle.

103
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,639
What a glorious moment for the North Superintendent.

104
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,495
Do you know how many casualties our demon force has suffered?

105
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:03,639
But the sect suffered damages as well.

106
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,759
Isn't your final aim to destroy the Five Great Sects?

107
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,620
Why are you just stealing spirit keys?

108
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,779
From this day onward, Wolf will be solely responsible for the spirit keys.

109
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:19,500
You shall not interfere.

110
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,240
You no longer have the authority to command Tianxu Hall's demon force.

111
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,759
Stay here and wait for the next order.

112
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,560
Get lost if you understand.

113
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,700
You are wise, My Lord.

114
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,199
My Lord, I wonder if the Flower Demon beside Wu Tong...

115
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,199
Do you think I don't know about it?

116
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,398
He can have fun with her since I have no use for her now.

117
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,260
She will be of use to me later.

118
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,740
Make the necessary preparations to take the remaining spirit keys.

119
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,355
Yes.

120
00:09:57,355 --> 00:10:02,019
We have verified that the Crystal Lamp sealing Devil Star's primordial spirit

121
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:04,519
is in Shaoyang's secret ground.

122
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,995
We are just waiting to gather the spirit keys and obtain the Divine Weapon.

123
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:10,446
Even the heavens are helping me.

124
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:14,083
Everything is proceeding according to our plan smoothly.

125
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:20,420
Looks like Heaven agrees that it's time to break the balance of the Three Realms.

126
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,530
Sifeng, have a drink.

127
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,780
You should know that I'm a particular person.

128
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,656
How can I drink this water?

129
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,100
You won't drink or you can't even drink at all?

130
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,980
Don't tell me that you can't even lift this bowl up?

131
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,380
You shouldn't expose me.

132
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,980
Don't you think I will be embarrassed if you put it like that?

133
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,080
What good will it bring you by being stubborn?

134
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,560
Here.

135
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,160
Sifeng, are you all right?

136
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:38,639
What is this?

137
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,000
Don't worry.

138
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,700
I won't die.

139
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,799
Why did you torture yourself like this?

140
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,980
You are here to advise me, right?

141
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,979
Even if I want to advise you, I still need you to listen.

142
00:11:55,979 --> 00:12:00,326
As your brother, I can't bear to see you suffer.

143
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:02,630
Is it necessary to ignore your friends

144
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,290
and your own life for that Lu Yanran?

145
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:15,040
Lu Yanran is her fake name indeed.

146
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,020
But she went on our adventures

147
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,834
and shared our troubles with us along the way.

148
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:30,700
Isn't she our friend as well?

149
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,883
Shouldn't I protect her?

150
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:37,079
That's different. She's a demon.

151
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:40,739
By protecting Tianxu Hall's demon, you are destroying the only hope of saving Linglong.

152
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,820
Do you know that?

153
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:49,280
Minyan, to save Linglong,

154
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,340
please find another way.

155
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,210
Little Silver Flower will not be able to help.

156
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,560
I know this will be the result in the end.

157
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,100
Fine.

158
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:11,420
Even if you don't care about your friends or your own self,

159
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,320
you should think about Xuanji at least.

160
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,300
She is risking her life to save you.

161
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:21,800
I couldn't stop her at all.

162
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,060
You want her to get involved?

163
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:32,323
You should know Xuanji's personality.

164
00:13:32,323 --> 00:13:36,719
I'm really worried that she might try to force her way in to save you one day.

165
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:39,120
Think about the consequences.

166
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,900
Actually, I want to help you, too.

167
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,980
- But, Sifeng, you... <br> - Minyan,

168
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,780
tell Xuanji...

169
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,140
tell her that I'm fine.

170
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:59,140
The sect leaders called me here just to ask me some details.

171
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:05,660
They will release me if they can't get anything from me.

172
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,575
After all,

173
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,800
I'm still someone from Lize Palace.

174
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,980
Don't worry.

175
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,840
Tell her...

176
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,100
that I'm fine.

177
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,399
She wants to protect me out of friendship.

178
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,800
I appreciate that.

179
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,940
This is my own problem.

180
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,720
It's none of her business.

181
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,380
Ask her not to cause any trouble.

182
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,799
I will feel better, too.

183
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,620
Minyan,

184
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,540
can you do it?

185
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,480
Sifeng.

186
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:00,720
Sifeng.

187
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,200
Sixth Senior!

188
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,940
Sixth Senior.

189
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,058
Did you see Sifeng? How is he? Is he fine?

190
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:54,339
He's fine. Nothing happened.

191
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:57,578
He said this is his own problem.

192
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:59,740
It's none of your business.

193
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,540
None of my business?

194
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,720
What is this?

195
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,279
Xuanji.

196
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,270
This is Sifeng's blood, right? You lied to me. He isn't fine.

197
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
Xuanji!

198
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:35,571
Xuanji, what are you doing?

199
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:37,560
Senior Hao Chen.

200
00:16:39,455 --> 00:16:43,439
Senior Hao Chen, Sifeng went through interrogation and punishments.

201
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,819
Why isn't he released yet? He is innocent.

202
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:48,479
We have to be careful with the enemy ahead of us.

203
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,799
He and his demon snake are involved in two deaths.

204
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,479
There is no evidence at all. How can the case be solved?

205
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:57,727
He might be innocent.

206
00:16:57,728 --> 00:17:01,479
But there's also another possibility where he is the culprit.

207
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,020
He is indeed a demon clan from Tianxu Hall.

208
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,799
The Four Sects are walking on thin ice now.

209
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,380
No one dares to guarantee his innocence.

210
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,078
Who will take responsibility if he is wrongly released?

211
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,959
Sifeng is innocent. He is not a demon.

212
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,799
When will you grow up?

213
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,760
How are you vouching for his innocence?

214
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,999
With that friendship when both of you were young?

215
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,598
Do you know that love is the weakest thing of all?

216
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,039
Isn't the love deep between Master Dongfang and his wife?

217
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,759
Didn't he end up getting betrayed?

218
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,980
Your relationship with him is nothing.

219
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,839
How could you know Yu Sifeng didn't pretend to be friends with you,

220
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,515
but tried to lurk around the daughter of Shaoyang's sect leader

221
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:46,186
to become the spy of Tianxu Hall?

222
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:49,700
When he first entered Shaoyang, he baited you to go to the secret ground.

223
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,399
Don't you think that was pre-planned?

224
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,340
What did I teach you?

225
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,680
Don't judge with emotions. Be rational. Think about it!

226
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,594
If that's the truth, there will be no real emotions in this world.

227
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:13,340
If I have to sacrifice friendship, I would rather give up my rationality.

228
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,280
The Sifeng I know is not that kind of person.

229
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:31,058
Because of him, you'd rather forget everything I taught you at Xuyang Peak

230
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:36,600
and keep acting rashly without considering the big picture?

231
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,120
You trust him that much?

232
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,260
Yes. I trust him.

233
00:18:57,459 --> 00:19:01,280
It's no use even if you trust him.

234
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,900
Open the gate.

235
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,720
What's wrong?

236
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,960
You won't wait until the sect leaders are here before interrogating me?

237
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,479
That's not necessary.

238
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,039
I'm just here to ask you

239
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,840
what your motive is of getting close to Xuanji.

240
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,520
My motive?

241
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:00,000
Making friends depends on fate.

242
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:07,480
If we became friends, we might be normal friends, we might be a perfect match,

243
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,359
or we might live and die together.

244
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,099
Senior Hao Chen, don't you have any friends?

245
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:19,526
What do you think my motive is?

246
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:21,959
Don't try to be smart with me.

247
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,680
Didn't you get close to Xuanji to urge her

248
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,440
and trick her to find her six senses?

249
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,080
You tempt her to have greed and be reckless.

250
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,740
What kind of friend are you?

251
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,720
Xuanji is a human being.

252
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,140
She wants to have feelings like a normal person.

253
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,820
But you stopped her from feeling anything human.

254
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,740
Let me ask you. What is your motive?

255
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,100
Xuanji is the protector.

256
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,974
That is her fate. She is destined to have no senses.

257
00:21:02,974 --> 00:21:05,880
That's also a blessing.

258
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,195
But you, you taught her to twist her destiny.

259
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:14,679
She was naive but you let her fall into unnecessary worries and obsession.

260
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,760
How dare you say you don't have a motive in mind?

261
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:23,919
Tell me. What are you trying to do and what did you find out?

262
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,400
I don't know what you are talking about. Fate and destiny.

263
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,800
Xuanji's life should be decided by her.

264
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:41,400
You don't have the right and authority to decide for her.

265
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,580
<i>When will you stop lying to me?</i>

266
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,559
<i>All these years, I was muddled.</i>

267
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,480
<i>I don't know where I am or where I come from.</i>

268
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,230
<i>I have no name because you don't dare to tell me.</i>

269
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,340
<i>I have no family or friends</i>

270
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,770
<i>because you are afraid I might find a hint of where I come from.</i>

271
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:02,259
<i>Tell me. Why are you doing this?</i>

272
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:04,799
<i>Sifeng is innocent. He is not a demon.</i>

273
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,150
<i>You trust him that much?</i>

274
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,840
<i>Yes. I trust him. I trust him!</i>

275
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,539
<i>This Yu Sifeng... Xuanji opposed me because of him.</i>

276
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:50,500
<i>I even got angered by him and lost my rationality.</i>

277
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,399
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

278
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,460
<i>He cannot be kept alive.</i>

279
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,083
- Father. <br> - What are you doing?

280
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,660
I told you.

281
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,822
It's impossible to release Yu Sifeng at a crucial time like this.

282
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:22,441
Father, I beg you. Sifeng just wants to save his spirit beast.

283
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:25,540
If you have evidence, I have nothing to say.

284
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,980
But you are only judging from assumptions.

285
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,660
It's too reckless to wrong an innocent person.

286
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,840
Stand up.

287
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,731
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

288
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:42,958
This is related to every sect's existence.

289
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:46,574
The Four Sects have reached an agreement on this.

290
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:48,380
You don't have to argue.

291
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,060
Whichever is more important between the lives of everyone

292
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,220
and a person's life, don't you know that?

293
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,487
I don't.

294
00:23:57,487 --> 00:24:00,879
The anonymous letter telling every sect about the existence of Tianxu Hall was written by Sifeng.

295
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:05,439
The Four Dimension Chain, spirit keys, Devil Star. Sifeng told me everything.

296
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:08,924
Everyone knew about the dangers, but wouldn't believe him.

297
00:24:08,924 --> 00:24:13,538
Trying to cover up and finally blaming it all on an innocent person after everything happened.

298
00:24:13,538 --> 00:24:17,580
Will you right the previous wrongs by locking Sifeng up?

299
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,479
There are many things that you don't understand.

300
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,439
If the Devil Star is released, many people will be dead.

301
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,439
You don't know anything, yet you still argue with me.

302
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,199
Xuanji, you disappoint me.

303
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:32,580
I'm disappointed, too.

304
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,644
The cultivator sects claim to be benevolent and righteous,

305
00:24:35,644 --> 00:24:40,459
but because of an unproven accusation, they tried to sacrifice the innocent Sifeng.

306
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:44,300
Where are benevolence and righteousness?

307
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,480
Master!

308
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,519
What's right is right and what's wrong is wrong.

309
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,899
Treating Sifeng this way isn't fair!

310
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,620
You...

311
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:07,618
Master, Dianjing Valley's Elder Zong caught the escaping Madam Dongfang. She's been brought to the prison.

312
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:10,115
Valley Master Rong requests your presence.

313
00:25:10,115 --> 00:25:13,034
Madam Dongfang.

314
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:15,639
She knows who the demon is hiding on Fuyu Island.

315
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,580
She can prove Sifeng's innocence.

316
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,639
But Madam Dongfang has accused Sifeng.

317
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,598
She said he is Tianxu Hall's demon and their accomplice.

318
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,580
What?

319
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,882
No. That's impossible. I have to ask her.

320
00:25:28,882 --> 00:25:31,159
Xuanji!

321
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,400
- Master. <br> - Lock her up.

322
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,519
What do you want me to say?

323
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,779
I already told you. He is the demon.

324
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:45,920
The demon of Tianxu Hall. That's the truth.

325
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,550
We planned everything.

326
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,799
All of you had to be baited.

327
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,746
Once Xuanyuan's sect leader is dead, no one else can open the Destiny Pearl.

328
00:25:57,746 --> 00:26:02,600
We want the spirit key and not the stupid pearl.

329
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,479
When Yu Sifeng pretended to bring Linglong back,

330
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,060
we'd already predicted that all of you righteous sects

331
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,720
would make the exchange with a fake spirit key.

332
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:20,699
As expected. All of you are hypocrites.

333
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:22,660
Qing Rong,

334
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,039
when did you become like this?

335
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,919
I'm always like this!

336
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,079
You better stay away from me.

337
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,739
You are just like them. Disgusting.

338
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:37,574
Do you dare say that you've never killed someone from my sect?

339
00:26:37,575 --> 00:26:40,720
- You... <br> - Stop pretending.

340
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,319
Let me tell you.

341
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,240
I wouldn't be with you if it wasn't for my survival.

342
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,730
Now that I think about it,

343
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,587
it's not worth it to get rid of you by using the Gu Poison.

344
00:26:57,587 --> 00:27:01,960
Why should I get rid of a puppet like you?

345
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,628
Thanks to his acting on the island,

346
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:14,735
your suspicions about me were gone

347
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:18,592
and you fell for me.

348
00:27:18,592 --> 00:27:23,780
You even gave me the key to the Treasure Vault.

349
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:29,287
I was only satisfied when I finally broke your heart.

350
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:31,020
You...

351
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:36,270
Look at that. What is that expression?

352
00:27:39,262 --> 00:27:42,720
Yu Sifeng, what do you have to say?

353
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,119
- She's mad. <br> - Who is mad?

354
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,980
You are the one who's mad.

355
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,835
He is a demon. Don't trust him!

356
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:54,240
He's the same as Ouyang Tong!

357
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,280
A heartless demon who betrayed me.

358
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,299
I gave him so much help, yet he abandoned me after he got the spirit key.

359
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:06,680
Everything is fake.

360
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,400
Every demon of Tianxu Hall should be dead.

361
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,960
The same goes for you.

362
00:28:16,703 --> 00:28:22,880
Worse comes to worst, we will all just die together.

363
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,420
- Give it to me! <br> - Don't touch Qing Rong!

364
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,680
Sifeng!

365
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,460
Yu Sifeng, can't the Hell's Nails hold you down?

366
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,400
Hold it!

367
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,378
This is the Demon Corpse Poison. I saw it clearly.

368
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:43,200
Sifeng was just trying to take the poison instead of killing her.

369
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:49,520
Yes. Let me tell you.

370
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,500
I want to kill all of you.

371
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,780
Only then will he think I'm useful and come back for me.

372
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,220
Why didn't all of you die?

373
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,119
Why? All of you should die.

374
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:11,239
Die!

375
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,429
- Qing Rong, what are you doing? <br> - Die!

376
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,678
Wake up!

377
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:16,427
Let me go!

378
00:29:16,427 --> 00:29:18,060
- Are you crazy? <br> - Let me go!

379
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,239
Someone, bring her away!

380
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,159
- Let me go! <br> - Wake up!

381
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,253
He will come back for me!

382
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:30,302
Let me go!

383
00:29:31,245 --> 00:29:33,762
Master, she is mad indeed.

384
00:29:33,762 --> 00:29:35,970
Her words about Sifeng cannot be trusted.

385
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,620
Valley Master Rong, remove the Hell's Nails from Sifeng.

386
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,349
How do we know that this is not pre-planned to win our trust?

387
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,719
That's right.

388
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,159
If this act was just to clear Yu Sifeng's suspicions,

389
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,542
his identity is actually more suspicious.

390
00:29:51,543 --> 00:29:55,540
Perhaps he is holding more of Tianxu Hall's secrets right now.

391
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,380
Since there are so many doubts, why don't we interrogate him again?

392
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,560
What do you think, Master Dongfang?

393
00:30:04,726 --> 00:30:06,637
Take him away.

394
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,254
- Interrogate him again. <br> - Hold it!

395
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:10,766
Why do you need to interrogate him again?

396
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,160
Wasn't it the truth that Sifeng just saved all of you?

397
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,811
Why do you still have to judge and interrogate him through assumptions?

398
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:18,557
They were all mere guesses.

399
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:19,839
Minyan!

400
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,620
Are you trying to cause troubles just like Xuanji?

401
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,320
Master.

402
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:32,300
Minyan,

403
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,220
it's useless.

404
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:38,399
Don't get involved.

405
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,140
Sifeng.

406
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,260
Raise your head.

407
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,120
Linglong, you...

408
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,205
Who allowed you to call my name?

409
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:35,054
Only Brother Wu Tong can call me that.

410
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:36,920
If you don't know what's good for you,

411
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,894
I will dig out your eyes and cut your tongue out.

412
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:41,320
Guards!

413
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,560
What are you doing?

414
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,080
Since you look honest, I want you to be my slave.

415
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,529
- Put that on him. <br> - This...

416
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:56,480
You...

417
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,069
If you play with me obediently, I will reward you.

418
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,360
- Let's go! <br> - You...

419
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,878
Linglong! Linglong!

420
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:17,694
Here. It's me!

421
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:19,726
Are you in charge here?

422
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:21,685
Hurry and let me go!

423
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:23,923
Why is everyone calling my name now?

424
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:26,976
I don't even know where a rude half-demon like you came from.

425
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:29,579
- How dare you ask me to let you go? <br> - No way.

426
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,554
You forgot who I am?

427
00:32:31,554 --> 00:32:34,114
Don't pretend that you don't know me.

428
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:36,818
I even brought your senior here to look for you.

429
00:32:36,818 --> 00:32:39,179
I got locked up because of you.

430
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:41,320
You have to live up to your conscience.

431
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,229
I have no time to waste on you.

432
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,240
Let's go.

433
00:32:47,474 --> 00:32:49,206
Don't go.

434
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:50,799
You really don't remember me?

435
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,279
My father is Liu Yihuan,

436
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,799
the weird old man who has a celestial eye.

437
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,320
Why don't you remember me?

438
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,400
Tianxu Hall's next target will be either Lize Palace or Dianjing Valley.

439
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,382
We can't let them waste our time.

440
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:08,860
We have to learn of their plan.

441
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,711
I think Yu Sifeng is trying to delay us.

442
00:33:12,712 --> 00:33:15,180
But he won't say anything, no matter what.

443
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,388
Everyone, what do you think we should do?

444
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:20,063
Yu Sifeng is stubborn indeed.

445
00:33:20,063 --> 00:33:23,778
He could even endure the Lize Palace's 13 Punishments

446
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:28,314
except for Valley Master Rong's Hell's Nails.

447
00:33:28,314 --> 00:33:31,140
I do have a mythological object in my hands.

448
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,759
This Demon Whip was passed down by Dianjing Valley's Grand Ancestor.

449
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,878
I just need everyone to work with me and activate the Demon Whip's power.

450
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:03,479
After three whips on Yu Sifeng, his demonic soul will show itself.

451
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,480
He will no longer be stubborn.

452
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,607
Pure Yang force is needed to activate this Demon Whip

453
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:12,511
and its holy force.

454
00:34:12,512 --> 00:34:15,278
Among us, I'm afraid

455
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:17,888
only those who have mastered the purest Yang Jue Skill

456
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:20,960
will be suitable to activate the Demon Whip.

457
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,720
In that case, I'm willing to contribute.

458
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,182
- Xuanji. <br> - Sixth Senior.

459
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,496
How is Sifeng? Bring me to him.

460
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:47,630
Xuanj, Master's orders.

461
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,177
You are forbidden to cause any trouble.

462
00:34:49,177 --> 00:34:51,983
But he was accused as a demon.

463
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:54,018
But the elders will never listen to us.

464
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:56,553
Why is this happening?

465
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:59,659
If the elders won't listen, I will save him myself.

466
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:02,200
You will even oppose the elders?

467
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,639
Sixth Senior, I don't care anymore.

468
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,440
When I saw Sifeng getting caught,

469
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,910
somewhere in my heart hurts.

470
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,278
Do you know?

471
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:18,366
When I was young, I accidentally smashed Mother's favorite vase.

472
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,199
That is my saddest memory.

473
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,959
But I think... the vase broke once again.

474
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,599
I want Sifeng to come back.

475
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,559
I want him to come back safely.

476
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,009
No matter who tries to stop me, I will still save him.

477
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,399
It's bad!

478
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,559
- Ruo Yu? <br> - Great. Everyone's here.

479
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,999
Valley Master Rong is going to use the Demon Whip

480
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,719
on Sifeng tomorrow to verify his identity.

481
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,879
He needs to take three whips to prove that he is not a demon.

482
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,599
They even want to use the Demon Whip?

483
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,559
What is a Demon Whip?

484
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,199
It is Dianjing Valley's mythological object. It is very powerful. Any...

485
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,559
Any demon that gets whipped will lose its power

486
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,439
and show their original shape.

487
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,839
What if it's a human being?

488
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,199
If it's a human being, they will be badly hurt if they don't die.

489
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,479
Tianxu Hall has greatly harmed the Five Great Sects.

490
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,109
Every elder hates demons badly.

491
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,720
They'd rather kill wrongly than release someone.

492
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,154
Sixth Senior, I don't care anymore now that it's come to this.

493
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:07,579
I have to save Sifeng.

494
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:09,866
What happens today is none of your business.

495
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,440
Wait. I'll go with you.

496
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,943
- All right. <br> - Let's go.

497
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,359
<i>Master, hand me over to them!</i>

498
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,319
<i>Otherwise, they will not stop torturing you.</i>

499
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,319
<i>Hurry and release me!</i>

500
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
Our blood ties have yet to sever.

501
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,160
I am still your master.

502
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,775
I will not send my spirit beast to death.

503
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:33,726
<i>If I am your spirit beast, my duty is to protect my master.</i>

504
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:35,910
<i>Now that my master is suffering because of me,</i>

505
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:38,182
<i>I would be better off dead than a spirit beast.</i>

506
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:41,620
<i>- Master, release me!</i> <br> - That's enough.

507
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,840
I will never go back on my decision.

508
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,100
- Let's move separately. <br> - All right, let's go.

509
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,440
Sifeng!

510
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,480
Xuanji.

511
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,759
Xuanji.

512
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,920
Sifeng.

513
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,540
They hurt you to this extent.

514
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,820
I will take you away now.

515
00:37:38,471 --> 00:37:40,080
Don't come here!

516
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,380
What are you doing, Sifeng?

517
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,960
Xuanji.

518
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,879
This place is too dangerous.

519
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,318
You shouldn't be here.

520
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:53,886
They've wronged you and locked you here.

521
00:37:53,887 --> 00:37:55,399
They even hurt you.

522
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,740
I have to save you. Let me go to you, Sifeng.

523
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,519
They are just external injuries.

524
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,159
I will be fine.

525
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,079
You, on the other hand, trespassing into the prison to save me

526
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,184
and taking such a risk...

527
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:13,199
How will your father explain to other sect leaders?

528
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,279
I don't care about that.

529
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,795
They said you are a demon and even plan to use the Demon Whip.

530
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,980
I have to save you.

531
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,680
Sifeng.

532
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,920
Xuanji, do you trust me?

533
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,278
You are Sifeng.

534
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:52,119
Of course, I trust you, Sifeng.

535
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,479
I know you are not a demon.

536
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,320
You're not related to Tianxu Hall at all.

537
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,980
I am not Tianxu Hall's demon clan.

538
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,340
I know about that.

539
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,520
Little Silver Flower went to Tianxu Hall because of other reasons, right?

540
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,200
Actually, I asked Little Silver Flower to go to Tianxu Hall

541
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,280
to find the Mirror of Origin.

542
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,960
I want to know where it is.

543
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,559
I want to restore your six senses.

544
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,500
This is our promise.

545
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,780
I have to fulfill it.

546
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:34,120
If I tell them, they will find out about your secret.

547
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,740
That overwhelming power of yours.

548
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,742
They will see you as someone weird again.

549
00:39:40,743 --> 00:39:44,960
That is why I can't tell them.

550
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,099
Just let them think that I'm someone weird.

551
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:53,260
That is much better than you losing your life.

552
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,119
Even if I tell them, they will not believe me.

553
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,320
Furthermore, I can't let you become their topic of gossip.

554
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,680
Sifeng,

555
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,599
you are always making decisions for me yet you won't tell me anything.

556
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,260
It's not worth it to do this.

557
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,080
I don't care

558
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,560
whether it's worth it or not

559
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,000
as long as I'm willing to do it.

560
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,439
Sifeng! Xuanji! Master is here.

561
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,640
Let's go!

562
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,320
The Sword Trap was repaired.

563
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,380
Yu Sifeng! Xuanji!

564
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:54,460
Put down your sword.

565
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,649
Do you hear me? Put down your sword.

566
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,534
Father. Senior. Sifeng is not a demon.

567
00:40:59,534 --> 00:41:01,359
You cannot use the Demon Whip on him.

568
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,359
Master, we still don't know the truth.

569
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,239
It's a heavy punishment to use the Demon Whip.

570
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,999
Elders, please show mercy.

571
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,660
You want us to show mercy when you broke out of prison?

572
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,374
Yu Sifeng, you're trying to escape when your doubts haven't been cleared?

573
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:15,399
Are you absconding?

574
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,959
Sect Leaders. Elders.

575
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,086
I am not related to demons at all.

576
00:41:21,087 --> 00:41:24,022
Please believe me, and don't trouble Xuanji and the rest.

577
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,998
We will know about your identity tomorrow.

578
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:30,875
But you are guilty of convincing someone to break you out.

579
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,919
That's because you are planning to use the Demon Whip.

580
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,799
I begged everyone to rescue Sifeng. He is unrelated to this.

581
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:37,638
I will say it again.

582
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:38,927
Put down your sword!

583
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:42,619
Xuanji, listen to your father and put down the sword.

584
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:47,057
Senior, forgive me for defying orders.

585
00:41:47,057 --> 00:41:48,639
Xuanji.

586
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,029
Fine.

587
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,359
You are getting bolder.

588
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,799
You are still holding your sword.

589
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,400
Are you trying to fight me and your senior?

590
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,739
Father. Senior.

591
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:02,599
I was brought up and taught by all of you.

592
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,034
I dare not disrespect.

593
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:07,980
But I won't stand by while I see Sifeng getting wrongly accused.

594
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,841
What do you want?

595
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,799
Xuanji, you...

596
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,964
If you want to accuse Sifeng,

597
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:18,599
I will just give you my life!

598
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,540
You are willing to use your life to threaten your father for him?

599
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:29,320
Xuanji, is he worth your recklessness?

600
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,319
Sifeng said he doesn't care whether it's worth it or not

601
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,780
as long as he is willing to do it.

602
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,160
What I'm doing today is out of my own will.

603
00:42:44,483 --> 00:42:47,300
I hope you don't force me anymore.

604
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,803
Xuanji, I am happy for what you did for me today,

605
00:42:57,803 --> 00:43:00,840
but you shouldn't make your father and senior sad.

606
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,820
It's just three whips.

607
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,840
I can endure it.

608
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,922
I said I will help you restore your six senses.

609
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:15,300
I will do it no matter what.

610
00:43:16,111 --> 00:43:17,920
Don't worry.

611
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,860
I won't die.

612
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:32,740
Sifeng.

613
00:43:38,038 --> 00:43:40,520
Someone, take him away.

614
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,318
Xuanyuan Sect took the demon clan's medicine.

615
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,214
Fuyu Island had a demon clan spy.

616
00:43:50,215 --> 00:43:52,278
Lize Palace has a demon clan disciple.

617
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:54,994
Shaoyang Sect helped with a demon clan's prison break.

618
00:43:54,994 --> 00:43:58,380
Our righteous sects are really bustling.
