18
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,380
It's exactly as Sifeng said.

19
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,230
Does everyone in Lize Palace know this spell?

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,980
It's embarrassing to say this. I don't know these spells.

21
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,920
Sifeng is gifted.

22
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,859
The usual disciples of Lize Palace can't even compete with him.

23
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,839
If it wasn't for the deputy chief forcing him,

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,758
I don't even know what would happen.

25
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,597
His natural gift would've been wasted.

26
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,479
What's wrong with Sifeng? Why did your deputy chief force him?

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,620
It's nothing much.

28
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,300
He just wants him to go back to the right path. But Sifeng—

29
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,719
Outsiders cannot ask about what happened at Lize Palace.

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,039
Ruo Yu, you talk too much. Let's go.

31
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,319
What does Lize Palace have to do with you then?

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,719
You don't see yourself as an outsider?

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,319
What do you know?

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,780
- I know everything. <br> - Enough.

35
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,751
- What don't I know? <br> - What do you know?

36
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,787
- What do you know then? <br> - Enough.

37
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:34,192
- What's wrong with me? <br> - Stop arguing.

38
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:37,320
The exit is near. Let's go.

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,691
- Move! Me first! <br> - Don't be rash!

40
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:59,420
Get up!

41
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,540
Linglong!

42
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,500
Sifeng, don't go!

43
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,110
Don't worry. I've recovered.

44
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:18,997
You should be worried about Zhong Minyan.

45
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:22,840
I am, but I—

46
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:25,380
Shaoyang's Transmission Charm?

47
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,300
This is bad! Linglong and the rest are in trouble!

48
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,925
- Bird demon! <br> - Let us go!

49
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:35,332
- I'll kill you if I get out! <br> - Ugly little demon! Let us go!

50
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:38,240
Stop arguing at this time!

51
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,040
Linglong!

52
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:45,620
If Xuanji and Sifeng are baited by the charm,

53
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,999
how much of Sifeng's power will be recovered?

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,460
Within an hour of using the secret arts,

55
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,760
even if force was used, only 30% of the power will be recovered.

56
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,060
It's bad.

57
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,440
Do you think we will be annihilated?

58
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,900
Careful! Don't come here!

59
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,720
Let them go!

60
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,879
- Linglong! <br> - Beware of traps.

61
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,439
You are the one who hurt me?

62
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,239
Yes. You fool!

63
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,780
How dare you embarrass yourself here?

64
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,320
Look out!

65
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,850
You save them. I will kill him.

66
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,240
All right.

67
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,520
Xuanji, look out!

68
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,140
- Xuanji! <br> - Sifeng!

69
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,780
- Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng!

70
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,440
- Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng!

71
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,540
Sifeng!

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,720
Sifeng.

73
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,799
What are you?

74
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,240
Who are you

75
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,999
to ask me?

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,999
The two stars will merge soon.

77
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,640
No one can stop Tianxu Hall from doing what they want!

78
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,740
Sifeng!

79
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,380
Xuanji.

80
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:17,523
Xuanji.

81
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,040
Xuanji!

82
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:34,683
Xuanji. Xuanji.

83
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:46,060
Sifeng!

84
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,160
- Xuanji. <br> - Xuanji.

85
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,180
- Sifeng. <br> - Xuanji, how are you?

86
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,220
Xuanji.

87
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,719
- Sifeng. <br> - I'm fine.

88
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,919
What's wrong with Xuanji?

89
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,239
Xuanji's Yang Jue Skill is between level seven and eight.

90
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,296
Her mental state is unstable. Something went wrong.

91
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:03,359
She passed out due to exhaustion.

92
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,320
It'll be fine when she wakes up.

93
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,199
Really? Why didn't I know?

94
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,119
How did you know?

95
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,060
What do you mean something went wrong? She almost killed Sifeng!

96
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,518
Xuanji didn't do it on purpose.

97
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,360
- What do you mean? <br> - She wanted to save him and was temporarily unstable.

98
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,400
I'm fine. She didn't do it on purpose.

99
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,380
No more arguments now that the demon is killed.

100
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,620
Ruo Yu, let's take a look over there.

101
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,599
Sifeng,

102
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,800
why did you release all the Quru Birds?

103
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,598
They were controlled by the Aoyin.

104
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:45,220
Now that the Aoyin is dead, the Quru Birds are harmless.

105
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,278
That Aoyin cleaned the furnace beforehand.

106
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,559
There's no residue at all.

107
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,079
I wonder what this Zhuyu Grass was used for.

108
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,799
This demon claims to be from Tianxu Hall and said some unknown things.

109
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,461
I wonder what this Tianxu Hall is planning?

110
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:03,429
It's unexpected. Tianxu Hall seemed like they had disappeared for the past four years

111
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,279
but they have been doing something secretly.

112
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,760
It's hard for us to figure out what it means for the two stars merging right now.

113
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,362
Why don't we send letters back to our sects to warn them?

114
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,680
Look out!

115
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,155
- What is that? <br> - No worries.

116
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:31,980
That is Aoyin's tendon. It's a stubborn thing.

117
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,142
It'll get tangled and stuck with direct contact to flesh and blood.

118
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:36,759
It's a great material to make Demon Tying Rope.

119
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,360
Sifeng, let's go back since the demon is dead.

120
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,960
Let's first regroup at Wangxian Town.

121
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,720
If you have no place to stay, we can stay together.

122
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,340
All right.

123
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,599
Master, are you still going to visit Chu Xuanji?

124
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,519
You'll be worried as long as she isn't awake, right?

125
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,703
You should know the Lover's Curse Mask prevents you from falling in love.

126
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,359
You shouldn't stay here.

127
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,520
Regarding my life, I know more about it than you.

128
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,198
Nothing worries me here.

129
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:22,399
Find the shopkeeper to pay for the room.

130
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,040
We are leaving.

131
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,975
Master is only trying to pay for the room.

132
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:30,060
Master, wait for me.

133
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,180
- Sifeng! <br> - Xuanji.

134
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,500
You're awake.

135
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,300
How are you?

136
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,780
Where's Aoyin?

137
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,359
We were saved?

138
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,396
How were we saved?

139
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:58,719
Also, Sifeng.

140
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,419
- Is Sifeng all right? <br> - Xuanji.

141
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,780
Don't worry.

142
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,214
You killed Aoyin. Don't you remember?

143
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:06,180
Me?

144
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,967
I already said Xuanji went mad at that time.

145
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:11,200
She had no conscience.

146
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,460
Xuanji, when you practice next time, try to be safe and not rush.

147
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,260
I...

148
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,559
Don't think too much.

149
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,299
Oh, the people of Wangxian Town want to thank us with a banquet downstairs.

150
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:29,639
I'm sure there are many delicious foods for you.

151
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,679
Pack up. Let's—

152
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:37,860
Sixth Senior, I still have something else to ask you.

153
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,827
Linglong, I have something to talk about with Xuanji.

154
00:12:44,827 --> 00:12:48,220
Why don't you head down and greet them first?

155
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,280
I'll head there with Xuanji soon.

156
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,660
All right.

157
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,359
<i>What is Xuanji hiding from me?</i>

158
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,019
<i>Even if there's a secret,</i>

159
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:17,170
<i>it should be a secret with me.</i>

160
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,371
<i>When did Little Six and her...</i>

161
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,315
Sifeng, you must be here to see Xuanji.

162
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:29,620
Don't worry, Xuanji is awake.

163
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,894
But she has something to talk about with Little Six.

164
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:34,560
It's inconvenient for you to go there.

165
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,419
Chu Xuanji's condition is none of our business.

166
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,020
No one cares. Don't think too much.

167
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,505
No one cares? Sifeng cares.

168
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:42,720
I know you don't care. No one cares whether you care or not.

169
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,040
- Sifeng doesn't care... <br> - Immortal master!

170
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,598
The immortal masters are here.

171
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:52,648
We have nothing to repay for the immortal masters' help for Wangxian Town.

172
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:55,424
We can only prepare a simple banquet to thank all of you.

173
00:13:55,424 --> 00:13:57,519
All of you must not reject our invitation.

174
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,780
- Please head there. <br> - Please.

175
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,579
Go on ahead. I'll invite the other immortal masters.

176
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:06,089
It's all right. My sister and another senior have something to talk about.

177
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:07,660
- They will go later. <br> - Sure.

178
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,060
Please head over there.

179
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,580
Isn't that the same as what happened with Gudiao?

180
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,719
Why did it happen again?

181
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,460
Also, I keep feeling that I did something to Sifeng.

182
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,420
Sixth Senior, can you tell me what happened at that time?

183
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,202
You were pointing your fingertips at Sifeng.

184
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,119
You almost...

185
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,279
But you stopped immediately. Sifeng is fine.

186
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,600
- You didn't hurt him. <br> - I...

187
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,830
I dreamed of it.

188
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:42,798
Inside my dreams,

189
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,894
I was always killing people.

190
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:47,599
I was covered in blood.

191
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,534
But why can't I feel anything?

192
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:52,840
I...

193
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:54,919
I...

194
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,959
I almost killed Sifeng.

195
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,359
That's not it, Xuanji.

196
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,919
That was just a dream.

197
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,079
But it almost came true.

198
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,532
I wanted to protect everyone,

199
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:09,200
but I couldn't control myself.

200
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,519
I am afraid that I will become a monster

201
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,179
who recognizes no one and kills for no reason.

202
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,559
That won't happen, Xuanji.

203
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,300
Calm down. Don't confuse your dream with reality.

204
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:23,119
But those dreams...

205
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,371
When the dreams overlap with visions from the shards,

206
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:29,920
they...

207
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:33,223
Everyone, a toast to the immortal masters!

208
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,573
If it weren't for their help in killing the demon,

209
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:38,311
Wangxian Town would have suffered from famine.

210
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:42,520
- Thank you, immortal masters. <br> - Thank you, immortal masters.

211
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:49,134
<i>The people of Wangxian Town want to thank us with a banquet downstairs.</i>

212
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:50,420
<i>Sixth Senior,</i>

213
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,660
<i>I still have something else to ask you.</i>

214
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,419
<i>Linglong, I have something to talk about with Xuanji.</i>

215
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:01,787
<i>Why don't you head down...</i>

216
00:16:01,787 --> 00:16:03,640
Sifeng...

217
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,959
Sifeng, let's leave after the meal.

218
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,219
Why are you in a rush again? We just sat down.

219
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,067
Sifeng knows what he is doing.

220
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:14,918
He won't be rushing to his death.

221
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:17,210
Don't say that word again. How dare you?

222
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,260
Enough.

223
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,598
Just eat.

224
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:21,359
Sifeng.

225
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,380
Sifeng.

226
00:16:31,455 --> 00:16:34,140
Sifeng, why won't you drink with me?

227
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,459
Why are you so cold towards me?

228
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:37,899
You forgot about our friendship?

229
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:40,659
You forgot that we killed the Gudiao and saved the merman together?

230
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:44,356
You forgot that we went to Dianjing Valley Sect to punish Wu Tong?

231
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:46,552
- Stop talking. <br> - Shut up!

232
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:49,200
- You— <br> - Enough. Let's eat.

233
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,940
<i>Zhuyu Grass?</i>

234
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,060
<i>It was used as fuel.</i>

235
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,708
<i>I see.</i>

236
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,647
Sixth Senior, I am too afraid.

237
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:20,300
The merman told me

238
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,478
I am not my complete self.

239
00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:28,059
What if I can't control myself one day

240
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:31,179
- and make all those dreams come true? <br> - Merman?

241
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:33,540
You mean the shards of the Mirror of Origin?

242
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,619
Why are you mentioning this again? Didn't you say you will forget about it?

243
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:42,479
Senior Hao Chen did forbid me to find the Mirror of Origin.

244
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:47,279
But I didn't give him the shard I have.

245
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,039
- I keep feeling— <br> - Xuanji,

246
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,720
do you still have the shard with you?

247
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:56,039
That must be the problem.

248
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,999
Don't be deceived by the merman.

249
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,026
Demons like to deceive people and create an inner demon.

250
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:02,683
There must have been an inner demon created in you.

251
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,300
Inner demon?

252
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,422
Why did the inner demon have to come to me?

253
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:09,719
How would I know about a demon's evil deeds?

254
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,799
It's just like the Aoyin controlling the Quru Birds to destroy all the Zhuyu Grass here.

255
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,959
We don't know the reason for that, either.

256
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,659
Xuanji, don't be afraid. It's nothing.

257
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:21,540
Let's destroy the shard and it won't affect you again.

258
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,394
<i>That darn Chu Xuanji.</i>

259
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:27,554
<i>Why did we run into her?</i>

260
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:30,020
<i>I can't allow Sifeng to get mixed up with her again.</i>

261
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,100
<i>I might as well do the extreme.</i>

262
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,233
Sixth Senior, why don't we forget about it?

263
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,359
Let's hand it to Master.

264
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,420
- No! <br> - Even though—

265
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,159
I don't know what kind of trouble that will get you into.

266
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,900
We can't tell the others.

267
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,319
Let's try again. Think of a way to destroy it

268
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,620
and let it become an eternal secret.

269
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,320
Look out!

270
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,110
Sixth Senior, I can't move.

271
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,760
I feel numb, too.

272
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,498
I think the spell got reflected.

273
00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:23,991
What about the shard?

274
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:26,710
The shard has been destroyed. It's all over.

275
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,839
But we are in this situation.

276
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,620
- Why don't we call for help? <br> - No.

277
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,362
How can we explain this?

278
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:34,917
We can't call them.

279
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:36,839
How should I explain this?

280
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,286
Use your qi.

281
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:40,587
Use your qi to break the spell.

282
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,240
Sifeng,

283
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:51,852
you forgot how well you treated Xuanji?

284
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:54,856
Xuanji got hurt because she took the hairpin from Wu Tong for you.

285
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:56,239
You cared about her.

286
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,682
I always thought you liked our Xuanji.

287
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:02,360
What's wrong with you?

288
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,639
That's nonsense.

289
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,380
Lize Palace has its rules.

290
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,439
Disciples should not be friends with others.

291
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,679
It's my duty.

292
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,920
Duty?

293
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,320
Fine.

294
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,158
Let go of your duty today.

295
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:16,859
Did you really forget us?

296
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,319
You don't care about us and Xuanji?

297
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,899
Anything exceeding my duty

298
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:22,719
will bring its consequences.

299
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,560
You don't have to think too much.

300
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,919
Fine.

301
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,999
Fine, you forgot everything.

302
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,380
It's fine if you changed.

303
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,919
But the one who grew up with me...

304
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,959
The one who is growing with me,

305
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,619
changed in an instant, too.

306
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:40,817
Changed to the point that I don't know anything about her.

307
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:44,418
Changed like a total stranger.

308
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:51,799
Sifeng, I think I saw a shadow over there.

309
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,180
Do you think it's another demon?

310
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,759
Where's the demon?

311
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,479
<i>Where's the demon you saw?</i>

312
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,899
I think I saw a shadow go in

313
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:08,580
but I'm not sure if it's a demon.

314
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,839
Xuanji. Xuanji!

315
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,319
Linglong.

316
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,220
Linglong, you're finally here.

317
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:30,240
It's not what it seems.

318
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,100
We are just...

319
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,760
- We are— <br> - Zhong Minyan.

320
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:35,820
How dare you! How dare you bully my sister?

321
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,359
- I won't forgive you! <br> - Linglong.

322
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,599
- He bullied you! <br> - No. Stop it.

323
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,162
Sixth Senior did not bully me.

324
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,439
Linglong, since we disturbed them,

325
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,599
- let's just leave. <br> - Don't touch me!

326
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,859
Let me tell you.

327
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:55,286
Don't try to add fuel to the fire.

328
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:56,679
What did I do?

329
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,399
Can you explain what you were doing?

330
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,439
We were just...

331
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,820
- Zhong Minyan, I'll kill you! <br> - Linglong!

332
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,540
Xuanji, he was bullying you because he thought you were ignorant.

333
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,823
- Don't you know that? <br> - No. Sixth Senior didn't bully me.

334
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:15,860
He was just helping me. It's true.

335
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,679
I was helping Xuanji with her troubles.

336
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,300
I tripped accidentally.

337
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,620
You want to kill me? Fine.

338
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,860
I'll stand here. Kill me.

339
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,267
- You... <br> - Xuanji, move!

340
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:26,140
I'll kill him!

341
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,302
You want to kill me?

342
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:30,434
Fine.

343
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:32,479
Let's see how you kill me.

344
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,079
You don't care anymore once your young lady temper comes up.

345
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,879
I've had enough. Kill me!

346
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,933
Don't regret it.

347
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:41,479
You might hug me and cry

348
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,400
when you regain your consciousness.

349
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,613
Why should I regret? I hate you the most in all of Shaoyang Sect.

350
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:54,868
If you die, I'll laugh in my dreams.

351
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:58,640
Linglong, stop it.

352
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,640
<i>Use it to defend yourself.</i>

353
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,619
<i>Isn't this your family heirloom?</i>

354
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:16,639
<i>Yes. It's for my future wife.</i>

355
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,800
This dagger...

356
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,920
was with you.

357
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,860
This dagger was given to me by Sixth Senior

358
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,119
before I went up to Xuyang Peak.

359
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,000
Y-Yes.

360
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,500
I gave it to Xuanji.

361
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,200
He gave it to you four years ago?

362
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,459
Yes, he gave it to me four years ago.

363
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:51,480
Young Lady of Shaoyang Sect. Isn't that obvious?

364
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,180
Both of them were engaged with each other.

365
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,100
Being intimate for awhile isn't something surprising.

366
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,920
Xuanji, he gave you his family heirloom dagger.

367
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,440
You are really going to be the daughter-in-law of the Zhong family.

368
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,660
Keep it well.

369
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,780
Zhong Minyan,

370
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,323
in that case, stop behaving casually

371
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:31,854
and treat Xuanji well.

372
00:25:31,855 --> 00:25:34,942
I won't forgive you if you don't.

373
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,280
Linglong!

374
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,640
Sifeng, let's leave.

375
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,488
Farewell.

376
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,680
Sifeng!

377
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,724
Little Silver Flower, are you satisfied?

378
00:26:06,725 --> 00:26:08,519
I admit that I lured you there,

379
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,059
but she isn't worth your time and efforts. Isn't that right?

380
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,039
You don't have to do anything.

381
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,720
Sifeng!

382
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:19,679
Sifeng! Sifeng!

383
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,960
Sifeng, don't leave. I still have something to tell you.

384
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,720
I'm sorry. I'm busy.

385
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:37,882
Sifeng, we haven't met for four years.

386
00:26:37,882 --> 00:26:39,890
I don't want to leave you like this.

387
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,982
We are just strangers.

388
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:43,300
Stop pestering me.

389
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,880
Don't get involved with me.

390
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,140
Sifeng!

391
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,760
Don't touch it!

392
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,080
What is this?

393
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:09,060
<i>[Wine]</i>

394
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,520
<i>[Wine]</i>

395
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,980
Are you crying?

396
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,939
Leave me alone.

397
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,959
I have something to tell you.

398
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,179
I would've given you an explanation if you weren't throwing a tantrum a moment ago.

399
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:33,480
Yes. I'm stupid and foolish. I didn't see it clearly.

400
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,651
Do you have to act this way?

401
00:27:35,651 --> 00:27:37,639
Can't we talk at all?

402
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,980
- Can you let me finish— <br> - Zhong Minyan!

403
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,859
In your eyes, aren't I a stubborn young lady who always causes troubles?

404
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:47,673
You look down on me in your heart.

405
00:27:47,673 --> 00:27:50,640
Why are you still compromising for me?

406
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,439
I don't pay attention to anyone unrelated anyway.

407
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,700
We will both go our separate ways in the future. All right?

408
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,079
Can't I say a few words?

409
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,635
You have always been like this since you were young.

410
00:28:02,635 --> 00:28:04,639
You don't care whenever you get angry.

411
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,939
You don't show mercy when you are right. It's worse if you are wrong.

412
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:09,499
Do you know what I'm going to say? How is it all right?

413
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:11,720
If I have to say, even that Lu Yanran is more reasonable.

414
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:13,799
- At least— <br> - Great.

415
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,040
You are comparing me with Lu Yanran. I wasted all my time on you all these years.

416
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,459
You are just watching? Help!

417
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:37,545
It's useless. Aoyin's tendon will grasp firmly once in contact with blood and flesh.

418
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:39,299
It's flesh and blood. Not yet refined.

419
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:40,779
We can't do anything

420
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:43,100
unless it releases its grasp willingly.

421
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,240
I'll give you blood if you like it.

422
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,467
Release her and bind me.

423
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:52,960
Bind me.

424
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,259
It's not moving.

425
00:28:56,259 --> 00:29:00,339
Yanran, I think the Aoyin tendon likes Xuanji's blood more.

426
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,119
It's useless.

427
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,780
I don't believe it.

428
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,120
Can't it feel pain? Can't I cut it?

429
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,428
It's still not working.

430
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,439
Are you happy?

431
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,960
If I can't cut it, I can cut your hand instead.

432
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,080
You've caused enough trouble.

433
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,683
She's the one who caused you trouble!

434
00:29:24,683 --> 00:29:28,139
Chu Xuanji, you caused so much trouble.

435
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:30,079
Why are you smiling?

436
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,609
You've noticed it?

437
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:33,577
I made a mess today.

438
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:35,820
It's my bad for smiling,

439
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,099
but you won't have to leave. Right?

440
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:41,008
- Of course, I'm happy. <br> - Going late or early, I still have to leave anyway.

441
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:43,759
There's no difference. Don't talk about these useless things.

442
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,900
That's different.

443
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,244
She was trying to cut my hand off, but you protected me.

444
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,859
That means you are worried and still care about me.

445
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:52,502
- I'm happy. <br> - You think too much.

446
00:29:52,502 --> 00:29:55,919
I stopped her because it won't work.

447
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,260
Do you think I want to drag your dismembered arm along?

448
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,801
Sifeng, let's not waste our time.

449
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,595
Isn't Xuanyuan Sect nearby?

450
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,426
Sect Leader Zhu Shi is knowledgeable and sophisticated.

451
00:30:07,426 --> 00:30:08,901
I'm sure he can deal with this Aoyin tendon.

452
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:10,339
That's our only way.

453
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:12,859
Everyone is tired today. Rest early.

454
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:15,400
We will go to Xuanyuan Sect tomorrow.

455
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,739
What about her?

456
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:21,859
I'm telling you. Don't sleep in a room with Sifeng!

457
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:23,280
You hear me?

458
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,540
Then...

459
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,980
Where should I sleep tonight?

460
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,680
Sifeng,

461
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,034
I am very sleepy.

462
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:06,540
I can't sit on the chair any longer.

463
00:31:09,718 --> 00:31:11,239
Sleep.

464
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,620
Sifeng, where will you sleep?

465
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,299
You don't have to worry.

466
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,820
I will explain to Zhong Minyan tomorrow.

467
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,262
You have no choice,

468
00:31:20,263 --> 00:31:22,520
but to stay here for the night.

469
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,716
Sifeng, I wanted to ask you.

470
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:27,518
Why is Linglong so angry

471
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,535
about what happened to me and Sixth Senior?

472
00:31:29,535 --> 00:31:31,459
She even said Sixth Senior is so bad.

473
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:34,300
I think Sixth Senior is not bad.

474
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,555
<i>You don't know what love is.</i>

475
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:39,239
- <i>Don't think about it. <br> - Who told you that?</i>

476
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,811
<i>I have someone I like, too.</i>

477
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:43,060
<i>I like Sixth Senior.</i>

478
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,600
Aren't you sleepy?

479
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:48,639
Why aren't you sleeping?

480
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,658
I'm not sleepy now.

481
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,799
I don't understand.

482
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,699
Although I like Sixth Senior,

483
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:57,666
but Linglong is just as important as Sixth Senior.

484
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:01,799
I don't wish that either of them is unhappy.

485
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,840
They had a big argument this time

486
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,853
because I like Sixth Senior.

487
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:11,067
Do you think Linglong hates and looks down on Sixth Senior?

488
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:14,342
That was why she was angry when she heard I like Sixth Senior.

489
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:18,279
Sifeng, since you are so smart, can you help me?

490
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,420
Is there any way to let Linglong like Sixth Senior, too?

491
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:31,679
I have no time to listen to the issue between you and Zhong Minyan.

492
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,526
If you are not sleepy,

493
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:36,385
just get out.

494
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,020
I'm sleepy. Sleepy.

495
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,179
<i>I haven't written to Senior Hao Chen about my experience yet.</i>

496
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,185
<i>Si Feng ignores me, too.</i>

497
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:04,559
<i>I should write to Senior Hao Chen first.</i>

498
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,799
<i>Senior Hao Chen,</i>

499
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,571
<i>I didn't write to you about my experience on time</i>

500
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:10,991
<i>because we met a demon recently.</i>

501
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:12,919
<i>The problem has been solved.</i>

502
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:15,959
<i>I will report to you about what happened for the past two days.</i>

503
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,159
<i>First.</i>

504
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,528
<i>I met Sifeng, but he ignores me.</i>

505
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:24,320
<i>He keeps always trying to leave.</i>

506
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,739
<i>I'm quite happy now that he can't leave at the moment.</i>

507
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:33,540
<i>I hope I can get back this important friend of mine this time.</i>

508
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:39,279
<i>Second. Linglong and Sixth Senior had a bad argument.</i>

509
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,203
<i>Linglong said her bazi doesn't match with Sixth Senior's <br> <i>(T/N: bazi is the eighth characters of a horoscope, birth date)</i></i>

510
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:47,075
<i>so they make up as quickly as they start a new argument.</i>

511
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:50,091
<i>They always told me not to worry.</i>

512
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:53,938
<i>It would be better if they could continue to get along</i>

513
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:56,525
<i>and care for each other.</i>

514
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,350
- Xuanji, what are you doing? <br> - I... The fire... You...

515
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,806
Sifeng, the fire will shorten the tendon.

516
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:17,980
No!

517
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,707
Sifeng, I told you. Right?

518
00:34:20,707 --> 00:34:23,826
This thing will become shorter.

519
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,440
Hand.

520
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:29,915
Sifeng, how is your injury?

521
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:32,260
Let me take a look at your injury.

522
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,640
Chu Xuanji, why are you still so reckless?

523
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,980
This is improper. Aren't you engaged with Zhong Minyan?

524
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,639
How could you do that?

525
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,620
I just want to take a look at your injury.

526
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,940
I don't need your concern.

527
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,142
This bell...

528
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:24,120
Didn't you say you lost it?

529
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,910
What does that have to do with you?

530
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:27,963
It's a useless thing, anyway.

531
00:35:27,963 --> 00:35:30,379
I don't know why it's still with me.

532
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,740
You never realized such a big thing was on you?

533
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,179
You don't feel anything at all with it on you?

534
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:38,280
Chu Xuanji, why do you have so many questions? How would I know?

535
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,460
You are hungry?

536
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,142
I'll get you something delicious.

537
00:35:56,143 --> 00:35:57,520
All right.

538
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,340
Delicious.

539
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:08,439
Sifeng, come closer.

540
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,480
Help me out. I can't eat it otherwise.

541
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,480
It's faster this way. Go to sleep after you eat.

542
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,640
- Sifeng, aren't you eating? <br> - Open your mouth.

543
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,675
This is delicious. Try it.

544
00:36:31,675 --> 00:36:33,099
It's fine.

545
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,834
- Try it. <br> - Shut your mouth.

546
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:36,210
Eat.

547
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,831
Sifeng, I can't eat if I shut my mouth.

548
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,000
Do you still want to continue eating?

549
00:36:44,171 --> 00:36:46,280
I want the soup.

550
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,540
I want that.

551
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,420
That.

552
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,039
Are you full?

553
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,440
Yes.

554
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,635
Sifeng, look at this.

555
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:46,651
It turned back to normal.

556
00:37:46,651 --> 00:37:47,819
Look.

557
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:50,520
Stop fooling around. Go to sleep.

558
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,274
<i>Senior Hao Chen, nothing special happened.</i>

559
00:38:03,274 --> 00:38:05,659
<i>Grilled fish was delicious.</i>

560
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,883
<i>We ate spicy hotpot.</i>

561
00:38:07,883 --> 00:38:09,900
<i>I'm very happy.</i>

562
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,545
<i>[I think it was fun.]</i>

563
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:18,780
<i>[I hope Father will let us leave the sect more.]</i>

564
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,705
<i>Three. We helped the people of Wangxian Town deal with the problem of the Quru birds.</i>

565
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:24,980
<i>The people thanked us.</i>

566
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,539
<i>I'm quite happy.</i>

567
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:28,379
<i>Zhuyu Grass is so delicious.</i>

568
00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:31,187
<i>It was wasted unfortunately.</i>

569
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:32,439
<i>Oh.</i>

570
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,639
<i>These Quru birds were controlled by an Aoyin demon from Tianxu Hall.</i>

571
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:39,514
<i>The Aoyin demon said something about two stars merging together.</i>

572
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:42,280
<i>We don't know what it meant.</i>

573
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,667
Sifeng, your shadow looks nice.

574
00:39:08,296 --> 00:39:12,314
I forgot. You don't like people praising you.

575
00:39:12,314 --> 00:39:15,739
When I told you your smile looked nice,

576
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:17,728
you got angry all of a sudden.

577
00:39:17,728 --> 00:39:21,680
I think you really look nice when you smile,

578
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,254
but I've never seen you smile

579
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,640
ever since we met again.

580
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,838
I am very worried about you. I don't know what happened to you.

581
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,439
I regret it.

582
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,960
I think I missed out on a lot of things.

583
00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:44,578
Sifeng, I think it's weird.

584
00:39:44,578 --> 00:39:46,946
I still miss you

585
00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:50,280
although you are right in front of me.

586
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,560

♫ <i> This sea of misery turns out to be yearning </i> ♫

588

Sifeng.

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,280
Sifeng.

590
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:17,049
Are you asleep?

593
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,920
Sifeng,

594
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,360
your mask is different from the one in the past.

595

It's just that you won't show me your face ever again?

601
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,759
Can't we go back to how it used to be?

<i>It works every time.</i>

607
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,620
What's wrong, Sifeng? Are you feeling uncomfortable?

608
00:41:44,231 --> 00:41:45,720
No.

609
00:41:46,747 --> 00:41:50,740
I just think it's funny.

610
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,540
Funny?

611
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,519
The past.

612
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,160
What happened before.

613
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,160
We can never return anymore.

614
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,700
Chu Xuanji, why do you still provoke me?

615
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,580
The person I don't want to see the most

616
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,240
while roaming the world is you.

617
00:42:14,607 --> 00:42:17,000
We shouldn't have met again.

618
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:19,899
Why?

619
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,935
Why?

620
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:24,760
Tell me.

621
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,000
Why did you choose Zhong Minyan?

622
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,799
I chose Sixth Senior?

623
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,100
What do you mean?

624
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,480
Why do you like him?

625
00:42:44,011 --> 00:42:46,519
Are you asking why I like Sixth Senior?

626
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,922
I think Sixth Senior is very nice.

627
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:50,857
I want to see him.

628
00:42:50,857 --> 00:42:52,539
I feel happy with him.

629
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:55,280
I want to be with him forever.

630

He...

631
00:42:57,731 --> 00:43:00,040
We also have a secret.

Enough.

633
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:06,700
Stop it.

634
00:43:07,215 --> 00:43:08,920
I understand.

635
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,840
You're the one who asked me. Why are you getting angry again?

636
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,320
Chu Xuanji, thanks for telling me all of these.

637

Sifeng.
