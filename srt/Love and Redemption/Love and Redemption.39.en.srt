00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,704
<i>[EPISODE 39]</i>

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,080
From your perspective, you think that Hao Feng has unlimited love for you.

19
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,040
And she even removed your Lover's Mask for you.

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,480
But in reality,

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,079
she stopped loving you when she found out that you were a demon.

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,519
The cultivators sensed something strange when she gave birth to her child.

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,079
If the old palace master didn't reach there and kill them in time,

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,999
the secrets of Lize Palace would've been revealed.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,719
For Hao Feng, she witnessed the deaths of her friends and families

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,339
before she got over the fact that she gave birth to a demon's child.

27
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,372
How could she love you?

28
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:12,593
She could only hate you.

29
00:02:12,593 --> 00:02:16,161
And she wanted to kill you personally.

30
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,440
Oh, Senior,

31
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,360
yet you're trying to force her to love you just like in the past.

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,720
She couldn't even commit suicide.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,560
She was tortured by you every day.

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,779
Continue.

35
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:39,056
Continue your story!

36
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,460
I knew long ago that you were up to no good.

37
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:43,599
Do you think I'll believe you?

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,940
I will never believe you.

39
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,035
Because I only believe in myself.

40
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,309
You forced Hao Feng to remove your Lover's Mask.

41
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,906
She only had a hatred for you.

42
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:57,216
She would never love you.

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,064
<i>Hao Feng, what's wrong?</i>

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,638
<i>Hao Feng.</i>

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,062
<i>- Hao Feng! <br> - Don't come near me!</i>

46
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:14,020
<i>Hao Feng! Hao Feng!</i>

47
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,439
<i>Don't come near me.</i>

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,238
<i>Don't come near me.</i>

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,880
<i>Hao Feng, no matter what you do to me,</i>

50
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,800
<i>I will never hurt you.</i>

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,284
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

52
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,919
The Lover's Curse backfired on you,

53
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,159
and she finally had a chance to escape.

54
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,479
You couldn't even control your demonic nature.

55
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,339
And He Danping, the wife of Shaoyang's sect leader, caught you red-handed.

56
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:50,520
Do you still remember that?

57
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,380
Oh, Senior.

58
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,599
You put Lize Palace in danger because of your carelessness.

59
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,999
You only struck He Danping several times before you continued your pursuit.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,759
If I hadn't followed you and exterminated He Danping,

61
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,830
Shaoyang Sect would've known about our secrets.

62
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,751
And they would've lead the other sects here to destroy us.

63
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,420
So, you were the murderer of Xuanji's mother.

64
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,879
Yes. I did it.

65
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,381
So what if I did it?

66
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:29,002
I'm doing this in order to tie up his loose ends.

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,440
The old palace master was biased.

68
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,680
He still favored my senior even after all his misdeeds.

69
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,700
It's all because he inherited the 12 Feathers bloodline.

70
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,267
The old palace master put in so much effort to place the Lover's Curse on you.

71
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:51,339
To prevent the Lover's Curse from triggering,

72
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:55,599
he went to obtain the Heartless Pill for you before his death.

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,400
It's all because he didn't want you to know the truth

74
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,439
and ruin your future.

75
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,091
No.

76
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,910
This is not true!

77
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,889
You're lying!

78
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,880
You're a sly villain.

79
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,159
Hao Feng removed my mask personally!

80
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,198
She swore that she would be with me no matter if I'm a was human or demon!

81
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,196
That's the truth!

82
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,259
You!

83
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,980
You should stop lying!

84
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,620
Father, what's wrong?

85
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,153
Senior, you were the cause of

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,040
Hao Feng's death.

87
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,599
No!

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,340
That's not true!

89
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,900
I'm not lying.

90
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,740
Elder Luo knows about this as well.

91
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,059
You can ask him.

92
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:57,440
Shut up!

93
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,863
Elder Luo,

94
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,800
please tell me.

95
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,960
Please tell me that

96
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,759
he's lying.

97
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,951
Master, no matter if it's true or false,

98
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:35,140
it's all in the past now.

99
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,120
There's no need to ask.

100
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,939
Since Elder Luo doesn't want to say anything, that's fine.

101
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:55,640
I'll take out the treasure that I've been keeping for over 20 years.

102
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,160
I'll show it to you.

103
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,100
This is the bloodletter that Hao Feng wrote for her father.

104
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,340
Let me read it for you.

105
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,829
"I was trapped by a demon.

106
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:15,599
Blood gushes out from my throat every day.

107
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,205
How I wish I could end my life here?

108
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:21,420
Death is my only savior.

109
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,219
I was deceived by a demon because of my feelings. I was humiliated.

110
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,659
And I've tainted Dianjing Valley Sect's reputation.

111
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:30,380
It's too late for me to regret.

112
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,887
With my death, I will prove that I will never be together with demons

113
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,888
for all eternity."

114
00:07:37,888 --> 00:07:41,157
By Hao Feng.

115
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,280
<i>[Hao Feng]</i>

116
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,994
Impossible.

117
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,720
Junior, tell me.

118
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,820
You're lying to me, am I right?

119
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,443
You're just trying to anger me.

120
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:16,000
I've never heard of any spells that could alter one's memories

121
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:19,494
during my stay in Lize Palace.

122
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,080
Senior, explain this then.

123
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,940
There's no spell that could change time.

124
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,120
You're just denying the truth.

125
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,834
Palace Master!

126
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,278
Father!

127
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,499
Stop talking.

128
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:06,742
The Lover's Curse is triggering.

129
00:09:06,742 --> 00:09:08,963
Please consume the Heartless Pill.

130
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:12,649
Senior, what's wrong?

131
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:14,949
If Hao Feng and you were truly in love,

132
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:17,580
the Lover's Curse would've been gone.

133
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,209
- Why is it triggering now? <br> - Shut up!

134
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,542
Yu Sifeng,

135
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:29,120
you would rather shut me up than understand

136
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,660
whether the relationship between your parents

137
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,700
was genuine or fake?

138
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,066
Father.

139
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:53,440
We fed your mother with the stalactite.

140
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,239
She'll wake up soon.

141
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,360
She'll tell you how...

142
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,700
we fell in love.

143
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,360
He... He's lying.

144
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,114
Senior,

145
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,880
I'm not lying.

146
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,260
Speaking of the stalactite,

147
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,720
I remembered something.

148
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,079
Dianjing Valley Sect spent two years searching for the stalactite.

149
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,972
And they've finally found the 1,000-year-old stalactite.

150
00:10:26,972 --> 00:10:28,739
They wanted to use it to save Hao Feng,

151
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:31,746
but someone snuck into Dianjing Valley Sect one night

152
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:34,299
and stole Hao Feng's body.

153
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,379
Even though they found the stalactite, it was too late,

154
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:40,060
and the previous sect leader died because of grief.

155
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Everything was gone.

156
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,126
Senior,

157
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:53,480
I don't think you knew this. Right?

158
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,170
What do you mean?

159
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,033
What do you mean by it was too late?

160
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,032
If a cultivator dies, you can revive him

161
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,474
if you manage to find a 1,000-year-old stalactite

162
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,707
and feed it to him within three years.

163
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:12,760
After three years, their primordial spirit will dissipate completely.

164
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,740
There's no medicine that can revive the dead!

165
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,620
Didn't you say you fed her the 1,000-year-old stalactite?

166
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,640
Let's look at your Hao Feng then.

167
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,283
Is she alive?

168
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,940
Or is she dead?

169
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,913
Open the lid!

170
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,336
Father!

171
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,020
Senior, I'm just teasing you.

172
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,880
You were right.

173
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,116
As the two phoenixes fly side by side, love comes true.

174
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:04,627
You and Hao Feng had a great relationship.

175
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:07,128
I'm so envious of you.

176
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,275
Senior, look.

177
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,762
She's not dead yet.

178
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:39,080
- Hao Feng. <br> - She is smiling at you.

179
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,312
Hao Feng.

180
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,737
Mother.

181
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,360
<i>I will never... I will never be together with a demon like you!</i>

182
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,520
<i>I will never be together with a demon like you!</i>

183
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,680
As the two phoenixes fly side by side...

184
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:50,840
As the two phoenixes fly side by side!

185
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,432
Father!

186
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,396
Father.

187
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,566
Father.

188
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,741
Your mother did...

189
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,340
love me before she found out that

190
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,760
I was a demon.

191
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,144
We were...

192
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,600
truly in love before.

193
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,040
Both father and son suffer the same fate.

194
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,380
Such a pity.

195
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,620
I've tried my best

196
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,384
to travel the path that I'd chosen.

197
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:53,265
Yet, it was the most disgraceful path.

198
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,860
I've let you down.

199
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,760
I've let your mother down as well.

200
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,601
Hurry.

201
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:10,039
Take the Heartless Pill.

202
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,359
Only then will you be able to cut off your feelings

203
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,900
so that you won't end up like me

204
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,351
and harm yourself and others in the process.

205
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:19,848
I won't take it.

206
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:22,319
You should take it to save your life!

207
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,962
Father.

208
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:31,380
Sifeng, promise me that you'll lead Lize Palace with your all.

209
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,140
And take good care of the Rose Gold Bird clan.

210
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,390
I promise you.

211
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,494
Father, please take the pill.

212

224
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,380
<i>Everyone, kneel down before the passing of Palace Master!</i>

225
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,149
Father!

226
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,680
♫ <i>Just like this we let each other go</i> ♫

227
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:11,560
♫ <i>I have no regrets because I've loved you before </i> ♫

228
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,080
<i>[Lize Palace]</i>

229
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,159
What are you doing? Why aren't you kneeling?

230
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,780
Every disciple needs to kneel down for the lord's passing.

231
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,199
Kneel now!

232
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,058
The palace lord was muddle-headed before his passing,

233
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,072
and many things were left unsaid after his passing.

234
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:49,239
Of course, we won't kneel before his passing.

235
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,840
Unless the new palace lord can convince us.

236
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,420
<i>Only then will we acknowledge him as our old palace lord.</i>

237
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,920
Vice Palace Lord is heroic and chivalrous.

238
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,580
I'll acknowledge him as our new palace lord.

239
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,800
We will acknowledge him as our new palace lord!

240
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,679
Vice Palace Lord, Sifeng has the Gold Feather Medallion.

241
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,180
He's the new palace lord.

242
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,420
Are you trying to stage a revolt?

243
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,140
What do you mean by that?

244
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,639
Now is a crucial moment for the sect's survival.

245
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,413
I just want Lize Palace to retain its legacy.

246
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:41,514
How could you say it's a revolt?

247
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,400
Our palace lord has just passed away.

248
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,260
You can't even wait for a second?

249
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,233
Yu Sifeng,

250
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,679
hand over the Gold Feather Medallion.

251
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,559
It's not a good thing for you to possess that.

252
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,966
Let me shoulder your burden.

253
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,597
What do you think?

254
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,850
How many of you have joined Tianxu Hall?

255
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,239
All demons come from the same clan.

256
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,959
There's no difference between Tianxu Hall and Lize Palace.

257
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,517
Elder Bai, what's the 25th rule of Lize Palace?

258
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:28,214
Those who had joined Lize Palace cannot join other sects or groups.

259
00:20:28,215 --> 00:20:30,340
If not, they will be considered traitors

260
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:32,201
and they may be slain!

261
00:20:33,908 --> 00:20:35,948
<i>[GOLD FEATHER MEDALLION]</i>

262
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,900
The Gold Feather Medallion is here.

263
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,840
For those who had joined Tianxu Hall,

264
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,694
I'll spare you all from your misdeed only for today.

265
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:52,120
After today, I won't spare any of you.

266
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,630
Now, come out if you want to.

267
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,340
Quit Tianxu Hall.

268
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,360
I grew up in Lize Palace.

269
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,719
We're a family.

270
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,975
We should take care of each other.

271
00:21:10,975 --> 00:21:17,360
We shouldn't sacrifice our lives for the goals of the evil Tianxu Hall.

272
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,017
You! Come back!

273
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,047
Deputy Chief,

274
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,200
you colluded with outsiders

275
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,580
and betrayed us.

276
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,832
You've broken our rules.

277
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,640
I'd promised to protect the Rose Gold Bird clan.

278
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,720
I won't give up

279
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,520
until I've arrested you.

280
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,340
Fine.

281
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,560
Since you've agreed to protect our clan,

282
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,340
I'm sure you don't want your people to die because of you, right?

283
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,040
You! You hold your clan members as hostages!

284
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,420
You're out of your mind!

285
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,774
Hand over the Gold Feather Medallion

286
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:33,195
and appoint me as the new palace lord to guarantee their safety.

287
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,880
If not, more of them will die.

288
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,356
Yu Sifeng, if you attack us, I'll make sure to kill all of them.

289
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,684
We don't need to fight.

290
00:23:07,684 --> 00:23:10,440
I'm just taking over for several days.

291
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,534
After the crisis has passed,

292
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:15,620
I promise to return you the Gold Feather Medallion.

293
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,558
What do you think?

294
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,375
Or do you think that

295
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:26,540
the Gold Feather Medallion is more important than their lives?

296
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,660
Very good!

297
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,220
From today onward, I will be the leader of Lize Palace.

298
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,140
All of you must follow my orders.

299
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,266
Here's my first order.

300
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:26,380
Everyone must join Tianxu Hall.

301
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,040
Those who disobey my orders will be exterminated.

302
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,700
I fancy you,

303
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,160
yet you don't know my intention.

304
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,573
Sifeng,

305
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,015
I finally understand

306
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,440
how you felt in the past.

307
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,149
Senior, Heroine Chu has drunk a lot of wine.

308
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:31,679
She's very drunk.

309
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,817
But she's still not willing to let go of the wine jar.

310
00:25:33,817 --> 00:25:37,000
She won't listen to me. Senior, please check on her.

311
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,120
But is it too late now?

312
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:50,466
I'm sure you've been afraid, anxious, shaken as well, am I right?

313
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,443
They say...

314
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,813
you're a demon,

315
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,254
and I'm the God of War.

316
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:18,515
That's why I must kill you.

317
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,185
Kill you?

318
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,780
How can I kill you?

319
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,240
How can I kill you?

320
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,611
This is...

321
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,300
I... I would rather quit being the God of War.

322
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,255
Sifeng...

323
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,160
I know it's too late for me to understand your feelings,

324
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,780
but no matter what,

325
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,720
you shouldn't have lied to me in the first place.

326
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,980
You shouldn't have lied to me.

327
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,100
Why did you lie to me?

328
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:34,250
♫ <i> I'm willing to fall to this state, <br>willing to bear this thousand years wait </i> ♫

329
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:39,420
♫ <i> The dream you gave me is sufficient, <br> I've been happy for a long time </i> ♫

330
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,588
Why?

331
00:27:41,588 --> 00:27:45,460
♫ <i> The feeling of deep love is fast asleep </i> ♫

332
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,780
♫ <i> Fall into a red dot at the corner of my eyes </i> ♫

333
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:55,770
♫ <i> If I still don't understand in this lifetime, <br>wake me up in the next lifetime </i> ♫

334
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:02,960
♫ <i> Seen all the luminosity of this world and experienced <br> all the hardship, befriending the moon </i> ♫

335
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:14,130
♫ <i> Even if it's unrequited love, even if it's my wishful thinking, <br> I can wait a thousand years alone </i> ♫

336
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,824
<i>Xuanji,</i>

337
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,839
<i>my father gave my mother this hairpin as a token of love.</i>

338
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,820
<i>Now I'll give it to you.</i>

339
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,520
<i>I want the hairpin you gave me last time.</i>

340
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,900
<i>Can you give it to me again?</i>

341
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,399
<i>You mustn't regret this.</i>

342
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,228
<i>After you take it,</i>

343
00:28:42,228 --> 00:28:46,337
<i>you'll belong to me.</i>

344
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:58,289
Purple Fox.

345
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:07,094
Purple Fox?

346
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,360
Your nose is pretty sensitive.

347
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,059
Are you fully healed?

348
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,819
It's dangerous for you to come here.

349
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,379
Don't worry about me.

350
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,479
I met Ting Nu and Liu Yihuan,

351
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,099
and Ting Nu treated my injuries.

352
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:23,679
I came here because I was worried about you.

353
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,971
I've heard about Sifeng's matter as well.

354
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:28,719
He's the 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird,

355
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,943
and you fought.

356
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:33,520
I didn't expect him to be a demon as well.

357
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,613
But do you mind that he's a demon?

358
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,319
Shouldn't I mind that?

359
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,900
If so...

360
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,840
You see, you treated my injuries.

361
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,679
You even became friends with Ting Nu and I.

362
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,120
Sifeng isn't an evil demon.

363
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,245
I think he was in the dark about

364
00:29:56,245 --> 00:29:58,946
the relationship of Lize Palace and Tianxu Hall as well.

365
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:02,160
So, you can't...

366
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,060
This is a different story!

367
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,820
He shouldn't have lied to me.

368
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,839
He's the person I trust the most.

369
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,593
But he hid his true identity from me.

370
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:11,995
This...

371
00:30:11,996 --> 00:30:15,216
What about the words he said in the past?

372
00:30:15,216 --> 00:30:18,220
I don't know which of them are true or false.

373
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,640
- I... <br> - You'll know the truth

374
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,532
when you bring him here and ask him, am I right?

375
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:27,099
If he's lying to you, you can just chop him up.

376
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,814
But if there's a misunderstanding,

377
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:32,383
you two should talk it out and solve the misunderstanding.

378
00:30:32,384 --> 00:30:35,964
You two should find a solution together.

379
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:39,920
Misunderstanding is the worst thing that could happen between a couple.

380
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,094
If you miss out on him this time, maybe you'll miss out forever.

381
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,207
You'll regret it.

382
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,967
Fine. I understand now.

383
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:01,525
Seems like Xuanji has made up her mind.

384
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:04,406
Since you've made up your mind,

385
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,324
I'll find Sifeng and tell him that you don't want to see him again.

386
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:11,946
I'll ask him to give up.

387
00:31:11,946 --> 00:31:14,300
And you two should sever your ties.

388
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,363
No! I didn't mean that! I want to see him!

389
00:31:16,364 --> 00:31:18,540
It's just that...

390
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,234
You don't know how to face him?

391
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,633
<i>Linglong, you're mine now.</i>

392
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:48,091
<i>Why are you siding with a traitor?</i>

393
00:31:48,091 --> 00:31:50,260
<i>Who's yours? Shameless man!</i>

394
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:53,401
<i>Did you forget how we fondled together?</i>

395
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,620
<i>I couldn't sleep well without you, you know?</i>

396
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,341
<i>So, it's her, the young lady of the Shaoyang Sect.</i>

397
00:31:59,341 --> 00:32:01,890
<i>She had an interesting relationship with Wu Tong.</i>

398
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,280
<i>It's no wonder she could still be saved even after joining Tianxu Hall.</i>

399
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,560
<i>I think she's just trying to save herself.</i>

400
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,540
Linglong, it's me.

401
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,859
How did you know I was here?

402
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:20,219
When we were still in the Shaoyang Sect,

403
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:22,660
you would hide beside the lake whenever you were sad.

404
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,572
I know all about them.

405
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,013
Just leave me alone for now, okay?

406
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:33,645
You've been unhappy ever since you regained consciousness.

407
00:32:33,645 --> 00:32:35,730
Do you have something on your mind?

408
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,762
Can you tell me about it?

409
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,380
Fine. I'll stay here.

410
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,328
You can tell me when you feel like it.

411
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:48,204
I'm always here for you.

412
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,275
Purple Fox, tell me.

413
00:33:12,275 --> 00:33:15,740
Why must it be Lize Palace?

414
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,560
Why must he be a Rose Gold Bird?

415
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,940
Why is he defending that evil demon?

416
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,820
That demon killed my mother.

417
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,720
What should I do?

418
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,798
What should I do?

419
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,659
Xuanji,

420
00:33:41,672 --> 00:33:43,385
think about Sifeng.

421
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:45,846
There's nothing he could've done.

422
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,775
He was just a child when your mother was killed.

423
00:33:49,775 --> 00:33:52,796
He couldn't decide

424
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:54,639
what his master wanted to do.

425
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,319
To him, his master is his benefactor.

426
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,220
And Liu Yihuan told me that

427
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,494
his master is his father as well.

428
00:34:03,494 --> 00:34:07,000
He only knew about that recently.

429
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,739
Tell me. What should Sifeng do then?

430
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,742
It's hard for him to decide.

431
00:34:11,742 --> 00:34:13,964
This can't be.

432
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,298
Xuanji, I know.

433
00:34:17,298 --> 00:34:21,030
It's tough for you to

434
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,120
endure the shock and sadness of the truth.

435
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:29,199
I'm sure Sifeng is suffering as well.

436
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,611
I've lived for 1,000 years.

437
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:35,551
I do understand life to a certain extent.

438
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,960
A lifetime may seem like a long time,

439
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,839
but actually, we only have enough time to pursue one belief in a lifetime.

440
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:49,938
So, it'll depend on you whether to pursue righteousness

441
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:52,420
or your heart.

442
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,258
But it's useless if I pursue my heart on my own.

443
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:57,528
You're right.

444
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:00,849
That's why you need to know what Sifeng is thinking as well.

445
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,360
I'll ask Liu Yihuan to find Yu Sifeng.

446
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,033
You two must meet up

447
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:09,345
and explain everything clearly.

448
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,360
But I'm returning to the Shaoyang Sect tomorrow.

449
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,610
Don't worry. I'll find you somehow.

450
00:35:18,611 --> 00:35:20,598
Wait for my good news.

451
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,420
It's all my fault.

452
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,195
What did you say?

453
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,854
It's my fault that Wu Tong captured me, right?

454
00:35:49,854 --> 00:35:51,894
How is that your fault?

455
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:54,404
But all of them are saying that.

456
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,440
I didn't wish for Wu Tong to capture me at all.

457
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,560
But all of them are despising me after they heard

458
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,459
what Wu Tong said.

459
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:09,639
Linglong, you don't need to care about them.

460
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,693
Just pretend that you heard nothing.

461
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:14,194
But I did hear them.

462
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,720
Why should I pretend not to hear it?

463
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,900
It has happened.

464
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,540
Why must I deny the truth and lie to myself?

465
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,460
Will you join them?

466
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,639
Will you laugh at me?

467
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,157
When I was young, the children in my village

468
00:36:45,157 --> 00:36:47,970
always teased me for being an orphan.

469
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,953
I could only pretend not to hear it.

470
00:36:49,953 --> 00:36:53,152
Because if I cared about their insults,

471
00:36:53,152 --> 00:36:55,977
they would insult me even more.

472
00:36:55,977 --> 00:36:59,140
We can't seal people's mouths.

473
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,331
But we can choose not to listen.

474
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,842
Linglong, you did nothing wrong.

475
00:37:05,842 --> 00:37:07,649
At least you're not guilty of it.

476
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,708
Don't worry.

477
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:23,520
I will always accompany you.

478
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,160
It will be over eventually.

479
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,500
Okay?

480
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,114
<i>Return to me right now!</i>

481
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:19,151
<i>Return to me right now!</i>

482
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,250
<i>You'll always be mine!</i>

483
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,047
<i>You will never escape me!</i>

484
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,280
<i>No!</i>

485
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,696
<i>Many years ago, a disciple of Lize Palace</i>

486
00:39:19,696 --> 00:39:22,439
<i>fell in love with the daughter of Dianjing Valley Sect's old leader.</i>

487
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,800
<i>They could have lived happily together.</i>

488
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,759
<i>They even had a child.</i>

489
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:31,819
<i>But the cultivators took away the sect leader's daughter by force.</i>

490
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:33,549
<i>In the end,</i>

491
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:41,590
<i>she committed suicide.</i>

492
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:47,893
♫ <i>Never thought about whether the most touching moments</i> ♫

493
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,910
♫ <i>were colored with sorry, joy, or tears</i> ♫ <br><i>[Memorial Tablet of Hao Feng]</i>

494
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,022
<i>Hao Feng, she's your mother.</i>

495
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,440
<i>Hao Feng is my wife.</i>

496
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,920
<i>She's your mother as well.</i>

497
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,800
<i>I'm your master, but I'm your father as well.</i>

498
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,460
<i>She was always here.</i>

499
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,274
<i>But why?</i>

500
00:40:12,274 --> 00:40:14,394
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

501
00:40:14,394 --> 00:40:19,140
<i>I'm just waiting for your mother to wake up.</i>

502
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,780
<i>I wanted to tell you everything after she woke up.</i>

503
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,320
<i>She's the best woman in the world.</i>

504
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,339
<i>Marriage is forbidden for disciples of Lize Palace.</i>

505
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:34,522
<i>The old palace master used your mother to threaten me.</i>

506
00:40:34,522 --> 00:40:36,783
<i>He forced me to swear a blood oath</i>

507
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:40,491
<i>that I'll only be able to acknowledge you when you become an adult.</i>

508
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:42,655
<i>But in this world,</i>

509
00:40:42,655 --> 00:40:45,760
<i>no father can stand the fact that they can't acknowledge their son.</i>

510
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:50,880
<i>Can you call me father?</i>

511
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,281
<i>No one in the world must separate Hao Feng and me.</i>

512
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,500
<i>People who forced her</i>

513
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,662
<i>and harmed her, weren't they supposed to die?</i>

514
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,151
<i>So what if he's a demon?</i>

515
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:08,179
<i>It won't work out when he's a demon?</i>

516
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:11,546
<i>Didn't you say that you would love him forever?</i>

517
00:41:11,546 --> 00:41:13,022
<i>She's deceiving you!</i>

518
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:17,920
<i>If you two really loved each other, feuds would never form between you two!</i>

519
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,920
<i>Sifeng, you knew this all along</i>

520
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,210
<i>and you hid this from me all the time?</i>

521
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,828
<i>I didn't hide anything from you!</i>

522
00:41:25,828 --> 00:41:29,529
<i>Sifeng, you were lying to me all along!</i>

523
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,184
<i>No matter how true your vows are, once they discover your identity,</i>

524
00:41:35,184 --> 00:41:40,045
<i>it will end badly.</i>

525
00:41:40,045 --> 00:41:42,234
<i>If you get together with her,</i>

526
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:45,054
<i>you will be the one who suffers in the end.</i>

527
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:52,890
♫ <i>Even though it may be crumbling, <br> it's better than being disappointed</i> ♫

528
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:20,300
Palace Master, Master didn't want to listen to me.

529
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,960
I can only beg you now.

530
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:27,259
Now that you're in heaven, I hope you can bless Master

531
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,939
so that he can learn something from your past mistakes.

532
00:42:29,939 --> 00:42:32,968
I hope he'll take the Heartless Pill and forget about Chu Xuanji.

533
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,201
And I hope that the demon clan will thrive.

534
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:37,798
So that we can kill all those humans.

535
00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:40,839
Dianjing Valley Sect, Fuyu Island, Shaoyang Sect,

536
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,097
I hope every one of them dies!

537
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:44,891
Little Silver Flower.

538
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,200
What nonsense are you saying?

539
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,976
Get out!

540
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:53,977
Fine.

541
00:43:04,112 --> 00:43:05,791
<i>- Palace Master. <br> - Palace Master.</i>

542
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:27,355
The Gold Feather Medallion is in your hands now. Why did you come here?

543
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,619
You don't need to be so hostile.

544
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:32,126
We come from the same clan.

545
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:36,020
I wish for our clan to thrive as well.

546
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,938
Actually, we can work together.

547
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,520
You killed your own clan members.

548
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,594
You still dare to propose a collaboration?

549
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:49,575
The people whom I killed were useless.

550
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,638
But you're different.

551
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:54,319
Once you break the shackles of the 12 Feathers bloodline,

552
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,020
you'll be able to become one of the most powerful demons.

553
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,649
You want to borrow my power?

554
00:44:01,649 --> 00:44:04,380
You need to show me your sincerity.

555
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,540
Why don't you tell me what exactly you are up to?

556
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,950
The things that I want to do

557
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:15,440
are beneficial to demons naturally.

558
00:44:15,448 --> 00:44:20,451
Do you know the identity of the Rose Gold Bird clan 1,000 years ago?

559
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,979
We were the personal guards of King Asura.

560
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:32,925
We were the first platoon to attack the heavens!

561
00:44:32,925 --> 00:44:36,006
Our clan was glorious then.

562
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,419
Unlike now!

563
00:44:37,419 --> 00:44:42,448
We can only hide in the mortal realm and cover our faces with masks in order to hide our demon powers.

564
00:44:42,448 --> 00:44:45,716
We'll revive the Devil Star and dominate the three realms!

565
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:49,573
By then, we'll be able to do whatever we want in the three realms.

566
00:44:49,573 --> 00:44:52,874
And everyone will bow to us.

567
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,239
The Devil Star was dead long ago.

568
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:07,300
Stop daydreaming.

569
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,819
You are so close with the Shaoyang Sect.

570
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:11,880
Don't tell me you don't know this?

571
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:16,678
The Crystal Lamp, in their forbidden ground, contains the core of the Devil Star.

572
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:18,616
As long as we save Wu Zhiqi

573
00:45:18,617 --> 00:45:21,780
and use the Yuntian Hoop and Chehai Hook to unseal the Crystal Lamp,

574
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,594
we'll be able to revive the Devil Star,

575
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,363
and we can pay them back for our humiliations.

576
00:45:30,363 --> 00:45:32,240
Since that's the case,

577
00:45:32,873 --> 00:45:36,840
I still don't understand something.

578
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,620
What has this got to do with Xuanji?

579
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,240
Why are you making things difficult for her?

580
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,840
I've told you enough.

581
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,489
Why don't you show me your sincerity as well?

582
00:45:48,489 --> 00:45:51,058
I'll tell you my goal after that.

583
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:55,827
So, what exactly do you want me to do?

584
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:07,150
