we're not here to fight today.

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,700
No?

35
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,540
I thought the God of War was here to kill me, the big demon.

36
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,880
Sifeng did save you and swear to be your brother.

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,100
I guess you're not a malicious demon.

38
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,700
I'm here to look for Sifeng.

39
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,819
There's a lot of misunderstandings between him and me,

40
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,420
and I'd like to ask for his forgiveness.

41
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,340
But I haven't found him.

42
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,040
I didn't expect you to be so straightforward.

43
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,740
Do you know where he is?

44
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,439
Of course, but I can't tell you.

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,240
I've promised him not to say.

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,640
So, pretty God of War, don't put me in a tough spot.

47
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Fine, I won't.

48
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,939
Oh, that's right.

49
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:25,879
I've heard that the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook were used to seal the Crystal Lamp.

50
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,760
I'd like to retrieve it.

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,140
Let me ask you this, then.

52
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,099
Back then, we took you to the Demon Citadel

53
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,979
so King Asura would let us off.

54
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:42,939
Now, I'm curious as to what you saw there

55
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:45,960
that twisted your temperament and made you attack the heavens.

56
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,540
I don't remember.

57
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,860
The heavens took away my memories.

58
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,459
Looks like the heavens can never change their sneaky old habits.

59
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,260
Right, Little Snake?

60
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,500
The heavens have their own rules.

61
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,480
What rules?

62
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,580
So the heavens are faultless, isn't it?

63
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:12,240
Whatever.

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,660
I don't really care about that millennial-old grudge

65
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,359
between the heavens and the demons.

66
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,719
Now, I just want to be free.

67
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,740
As for the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook, I've passed them to Sifeng.

68
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,579
They're in safe hands, I'm sure.

69
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,039
You'll just have to find him, if you can.

70
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,159
- However... <br> - However what?

71
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,219
However, I've heard that he's been trying

72
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:34,939
to stop the Lover's Curse cast upon him,

73
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:38,420
so he took a Heartless Pill to forget about his own past.

74
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,340
That's why I'm afraid he's probably forgotten you.

75
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,860
He wants to forget me?

76
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,820
If you ask me, you should let him go.

77
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,660
You are not mere commoners.

78
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,220
The world is your oyster.

79
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,199
Since you can finally part ways and move on,

80
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,980
isn't that a perfect end?

81
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,579
Getting troubled over love is the stupidest thing in the world, isn't it?

82
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,279
The stupidest thing I've done is losing Sifeng.

83
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,720
That's why I will find him.

84
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,919
Even if he hates me or despises me,

85
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,740
I'll explain everything to him when I find him.

86
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,399
Looks like your current life

87
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,719
is much more interesting than your stint in the heavens.

88
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,660
Fine, to each their own.

89
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,079
Everyone has different paths.

90
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,839
I've said all that I can say.

91
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,920
I've finished the wine, too. Time to go.

92
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,320
Oh, right.

93
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,719
It's a Perfect Fruit from the kingdom of Aolai.

94
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,340
It can mask your presence in the three realms

95
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,940
so you can avoid certain troublemakers.

96
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,140
Prevention is key. No need to thank me.

97
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,100
I gave one to Sifeng, too. So if you want to find him,

98
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,180
I'm afraid it won't be easy.

99
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,200
I'm off.

100
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,940
That stupid monkey is just bluffing.

101
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,080
We're just looking for someone. It's easy.

102
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
Can you do it?

103
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,940
This place is filled with Sifeng's scent.

104
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,480
Give me a former possession of his.

105
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,540
Sifeng gave me this.

106
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,300
Try it.

107
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,700
I'll try.

108
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,080
Why did it run off?

109
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,719
What's going on?

110
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,319
I guess the Perfect Fruit does work after all.

111
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,460
My magic went slightly out of control.

But I'd get bored eventually.

163
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,780
Take food as an example.

164
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,619
How boring would it be if I ate the same food every day?

No, you're not air.

You must have underestimated me, then.

I've decided.

So, you did all that to Sifeng because your sister was held...

Anyone who works for Deputy Chief

As long as Ruo Xue could stay alive, I could do anything.

281
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,680
I could abandon morals.

282
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,279
I could abandon friends.

283
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,120
I could even abandon my life.

284
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,510
I'm the one who should die, not Ruo Xue.

285
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,320
So you did that for someone you love.

286
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:38,000
Forget it. I won't blame you since you have your reasons.

288
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,039
Ruo Xue loves this spot the most.

289
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:50,220
When we first left Lize Palace, we didn't know things would transpire into this.

290
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,160
As orphaned Rose Gold Birds, we even thought we were in paradise.

We first met here.

292
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,880
Back then, you had just gained the form of a human.

293
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,340
You looked so much like Ruo Xue from the back.

294
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,180
Do you remember the first question you asked me?

295
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,399
Back then, you insisted on drinking seawater.

296
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,080
I couldn't stop you.

297
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,900
After you drank it, you asked me why the seawater was salty.

298
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,780
I... I don't remember.

299
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,500
It's been so many years.

300
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,900
Everything I did was to free Ruo Xue.

301
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,740
But my wish couldn't come true.

302
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,440
Right now, I only have one wish.

303
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,060
I hope you can live well.

304
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,339
Wherever you are, whoever you're with,

305
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:53,400
as long as you're still alive, I...

306
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,840
I would feel that there's something worth living for me.

307
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,600
Promise me.

308
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,280
Little Silver Flower, live well.

309
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,160
If you need any help, as long as I can do it, feel free to tell me.

310
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,520
My biggest wish now is to terminate my blood contract with my master.

311
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,540
Of course, I want to do it amicably.

312
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:27,220
Then I can truly be myself and stand before him

313
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,020
and love him with all my heart.

314
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,860
Very well, I'll help you.

315
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,859
I've read before that the Asuras were pioneers in taming spirit beasts.

316
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:44,280
That's why they're familiar with blood contracts.

317
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,259
Back at the Demon Citadel, I've read some obscure books.

318
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,740
I think we can find a solution in them.

319
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,240
Really? Let's go, then!

320
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,200
I'd love to go there, too.

321
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,980
Yuan Lang's remnants are still there.

322
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,379
I need to destroy them to avoid future troubles.

323
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:00,559
Isn't he already dead?

324
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,420
It's a long story. I'll tell you everything on our way there.

325
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,800
<i>No wonder Sifeng has been impersonating as the Devil Star.</i>

326
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,860
<i>So this is the truth he's been trying to hide.</i>

327
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,959
Are you leaving us to find Yu Sifeng?

328
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,560
Yes.

329
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,280
But, Xuanji,

330
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,100
you know you're a human and he's a demon.

331
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,840
- How can you... <br> - Father,

332
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,079
everything is crystal clear now.

333
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,380
He has never done anything malicious.

334
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,860
He wanted me to believe him,

335
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,280
but I still judged him like any other sect would have.

336
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,100
I regret not trusting him like he trusted me.

337
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,100
Regardless of whether he is human or demon, or even the Demon Lord,

338
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,320
I want to be with him forever.

339
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,660
Even if he has done nothing, he's been avoiding you.

340
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,500
He doesn't want you to find him.

341
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,860
Do you want to look for him forever?

342
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,699
But, Xuanji, you are now the God of War.

343
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:50,759
Everyone hopes you can stay and protect the mortal world.

344
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,399
Father, Tianxu Hall no longer exists now.

345
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:56,799
For now, everything is safe.

346
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,610
Even without me around, nothing will happen to the mortal world.

347
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,060
I've thought about it.

348
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,920
In this life, I am just Chu Xuanji.

349
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,440
I am not the God of War.

350
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,279
I know you have been hoping that

351
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,460
I would become a heroine who could bring peace to the world.

352
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,100
But I just want to be a commoner.

353
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,399
I can feel that no matter how victorious the God of War is,

354
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,540
despite her shining armor,

355
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,480
her heart is nothing but empty.

356
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,460
For this life, I just want to lead a common life.

357
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,100
I want to be with someone, be a dutiful wife,

358
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,460
and reside in a place of my choosing.

359
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,740
Sifeng is that special someone that I want to be with.

360
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,040
Father, when I find Sifeng,

361
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,940
and if you still don't want to associate yourself with the demons,

362
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,640
then...

363
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,380
then I shall not return.

364
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,360
Get up.

365
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,740
Silly child, what are you talking about?

366
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,880
Fine.

367
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,640
You may go.

368
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,980
If you ever feel tired,

369
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,140
just come back.

370
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:39,640
Shaoyang will always be your home.

371
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,690
Xuanji!

372
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,100
Xuanji!

373
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,180
Linglong, are you here to persuade me?

374
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,340
No. I'm here to give you some money.

375
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,019
I've been saving it for myself. I think you'll find it useful.

376
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,539
I should be following you,

377
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:19,039
but I can't leave when Little Six hasn't recovered.

378
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,840
I'm sorry.

379
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,300
Xuanji...

380
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,810
<i>[Shaoyang]</i>

381
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,179
...I believe you will find him. I'll be waiting for you two.

382
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:36,140
Teng She, she's your master.

383
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,060
Take good care of her.

384
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,020
What a nag.

385
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,700
I'm off.

386
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,480
Stinky woman, where are we going now?

387
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,740
Actually, you don't have to follow me.

388
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,380
Weren't you enjoying all the good food in Shaoyang?

389
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,800
You can stay back for more.

390
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,920
What? Am I an unwanted presence now?

391
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,759
Teng She, do you know any ways to break a blood contract without hurting anyone?

392
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,840
What? You're breaking our contract?

393
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,860
Really?

394
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,999
I tamed you as my beast to attack Tianxu Hall.

395
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,879
But now, this is my personal quest.

396
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,740
I can't drag you down just to look for Sifeng.

397
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,759
I've been helping you with my whole heart, and you're not appreciating it at all!

398
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,860
Fine, terminate all you want!

399
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,700
I'm going! I'm not following you!

400
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,500
Haven't you been pestering me to terminate our blood contract?

401
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,599
That was the past.

402
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,700
Things are different now.

403
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,460
You're mad?

404
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,399
Fine, I won't mention it anymore.

405
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,780
Since you're a good fighter, I can't bear to let you go.

406
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,279
That's enough.

407
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,220
Please forgive me, Lord Teng She.

408
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,179
That's more like it.

409
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:00,839
But remember this. You pleaded with me first,

410
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,380
that's why I'm going the extra mile to help you this time.

411
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,539
So, where shall we head now?

412
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,639
Let's go somewhere you two have been.

413
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,960
Maybe Little Phoenix is there.

414
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,580
Have you two been here?

415
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,080
This is the place Sifeng and I

416
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,300
defeated Gudiao and saved Ting Nu.

417
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,919
Back then, he didn't smile much.

418
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,540
He was always stern and cold,

419
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,780
but he actually looked very handsome when he smiled.

420
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,380
<i>Cheers!</i>

421
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,960
<i>Thank you.</i>

422
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,460
Sifeng loves eating lotus seeds,

423
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,460
but he said the core of the seeds is bitter.

424
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,079
Lotus seeds?

425
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,280
Why are they bitter?

426
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,020
<i>This is a lotus seed.</i>

427
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,220
<i>The core is bitter.</i>

428
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,080
<i>It tastes awful when you bite it.</i>

429
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,220
<i>It's like what you'd feel when you're upset or down.</i>

430
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,039
<i>There are some tastes that you'd love to try,</i>

431
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,080
<i>but you just can't have them, even when it's right in front of you.</i>

432
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,820
<i>That's what you call desire.</i>

433
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,300
Sifeng taught me about different tastes.

434
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:01,060
He said bitterness means unhappiness,

435
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,879
but he's been through so much bitterness for me.

436
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,220
When I find him, I won't let him go through that anymore.

437
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,699
Let's go.

438
00:32:11,699 --> 00:32:14,500
I have to find Sifeng.

439
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:28,660
<i>[Guest Tavern]</i>

440
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,620
Enjoy your food.

441
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,360
We stayed in this inn before.

442
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,520
Here's your food!

443
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,080
- Excuse me. <br> - Coming!

444
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,440
Do you still have empty rooms?

445
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,820
It's you.

446
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,119
You know me?

447
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,399
Of course I do.

448
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,100
Weren't you the heroine who captured the Quru Bird?

449
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,200
Then, do you still remember this man?

450
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,420
Back then, he was always wearing a mask.

451
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,740
Him? I remember him quite well.

452
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,040
Have you seen him?

453
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,440
Well, I haven't,

454
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,519
but I remember that for some unknown reason,

455
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,439
he'd wake our chef up in the middle of the night

456
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,220
to learn how to cook.

457
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,410
He said there's a fussy eater

458
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:32,560
that he has to please, no matter what.

459
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,599
I've never seen someone so clever.

460
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,460
Even our chef is impressed by the dishes he could prepare.

461
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,200
This way, please.

462
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,100
Here we are.

463
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,759
Excuse me, can your chef prepare food that's better than Sifeng's?

464
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,239
Yes.

465
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,640
Get him to prepare us some food.

466
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,840
Our chef is not here.

467
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:00,840
Are you turning me down because I look poor?

468
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,700
No, no.

469
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,710

482
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,880
Stinky woman, what are you thinking?

483
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:32,320
I didn't expect that the yard in Qingmu Town

484
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,660
has been burned to ashes.

485
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,060
Even the tree with wind chimes is no longer there

486
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,740
that holds special memories for me and Sifeng.

491
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,740
Why have things become like this?

492
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,400
Stinky woman.

493
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,620
Don't be sad.

494
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,020
It's destined.

495
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,340
Destined?

496
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,600
I don't believe in destiny.

497
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,760
I want to control my own life.

498
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,000
Forget about that.

499
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:49,652
Stinky woman, what's our next destination?

500
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,540
I've reminisced about everything between Sifeng and me.

501
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:09,240
All that came to my mind is what he did for me,

502
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,680
but I was so cruel to him.

503
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,720
I even stabbed him.

504
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,360
He must have been so hurt.

505
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,860
Teng She,

506
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,780
Sifeng is so nice,

507
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,980
but why am I so awful?

508
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,886
Oh right! Where does Liu Yihuan live?

509
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,659
Doesn't he have a celestial eye?

510
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:47,400
I'm sure he can find Sifeng.

511
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
Eldest Brother Liu.

512
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,799
The east wind thaws the winter.

513
00:37:56,799 --> 00:38:00,300
<i>The east wind thaws the winter.</i>

514
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,479

519
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,740
Old Fogey, I told you not to put your head on the window.

520
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,140
It's scary.

521
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,439
You little wench.

522
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,980
Is that how you speak to your dad after taking etiquette lessons?

523
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,360
So, what did you score for your test today?

524
00:38:57,244 --> 00:38:58,000
<i>[DISTINCTION]</i>

525
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,940
- I want a pinwheel. <br> - Sure!

526
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,340
- Make that two. <br> - Of course.

527
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,340
You deserve it, my dear.

528
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,219
Wait, I thought you'd always barely passed your tests.

529
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:12,600
Why a distinction today?

530
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,679
That's simple.

531
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,519
All I had to do was to cast a spell,

532
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,460
and I copied the answer scheme onto my test paper.

533
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,119
- You... <br> - You made a promise, no regrets!

534
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,120
You naughty brat, stand right there!

535
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,999
This is Qingyang City.

536
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,559
Eldest Brother Liu lives here.

537
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,639
Sifeng has always been close with him.

538
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,600
Maybe he even came to visit him.

539
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,260
Let's search.

540
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,840
Eldest Brother Liu!

541
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,119
Can anyone stay in a stinky place like this?

542
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:00,160
Sifeng is a fussy guy, and this old bird is the exact opposite.

543
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,679
He's not here.

544
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,380
Are you looking for someone?

545
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,000
She touched me?

546
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,200
Are you looking for Deity Liu?

547
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,319
Ma'am, do you know where Eldest Brother Liu is?

548
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,860
He must be visiting his daughter at the academy again.

549
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,460
Wait here. They'll be back soon.

550
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,180
Very well.

551
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,580
These stupid toys sure cost a fortune.

552
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,340
I'll make them myself next time.

553
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,180
- Eldest Brother Liu. <br> - Older Sister Xuanji.

554
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,900
Yu'er, let's go out for lunch!

555
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,200
Eldest Brother Liu.

556
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,980
What are you doing here?

557
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,799
We have nothing to entertain you with.

558
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,740
Older Sister Xuanji, forget about that old guy.

559
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,220
Come on, let's go in!

560
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,760
What? I know you're a glutton.

561
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,959
Older Sister Xuanji, take a seat.

562
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,700
Let me get you some tea.

563
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,040
Yu'er has regained her demon form.

564
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,900
Seeing you two here sure dampens my mood.

565
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,560
We're doing really fine now.

566
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,079
Anyway, don't ask me where Little Phoenix is.

567
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,359
I don't know.

568
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,639
Eldest Brother Liu, I know I was wrong.

569
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,999
Just reprimand me.

570
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,380
I've been trying to find Sifeng so I can apologize.

571
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,760
Why should I reprimand you?

572
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,560
Does it matter who's right or wrong?

573
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,340
Little Phoenix has been through hell for you.

574
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,359
You should let him live the rest of his days in peace.

575
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,439
That would be a great help.

576
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,199
The rest of his days?

577
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,359
What do you mean?

578
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,919
Wu Zhiqi said he ate a Heartless Pill.

579
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,840
Didn't he take it?

580
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,040
Did his curse act up again?

581
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,399
He ate it.

582
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,199
That's why he's already forgotten you.

583
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,940
He doesn't remember you.

584
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,180
Stop looking for him.

585
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,519
You know Little Phoenix.

586
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,979
He looks easygoing at first glance, but he's obstinate inside.

587
00:42:07,979 --> 00:42:10,759
To him, it's all or nothing.

588
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,879
Now he has chosen to leave.

589
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,519
He's not changing his mind anymore.

590
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,959
Eldest Brother Liu, I really know I was wrong.

591
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:20,680
I'm angry at myself, too.

592
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,639
Before I met Sifeng,

593
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,040
I never knew what it meant to be loved by someone.

594
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,759
It was Sifeng who made me feel.

595
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,670
No matter what happened to me,

596
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,050
he was always behind me, protecting and guarding me.

597
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:36,300
He treated me gently.

598
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,280
I took everything for granted,

599
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,920
but I really didn't know he suffered so much for me.

600
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,559
I only know now that I've hurt him deeply.

601
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,239
That's why I must find him.

602
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,540
I want to tell him that I know how to love now.

603
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,319
Eldest Brother Liu, please help me.

604
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,020
This time, I want to start all over again with him.

605
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,280
It's my turn to protect him, please?

606
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,039
Stop wasting your breath on me.

607
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,020
I'm a stubborn guy myself.

608
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,900
What's with you, you old fogey?

609
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,839
Even you could give yourself the chance to be a good father.

610
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,999
Why can't you give Xuanji a chance to find Sifeng?

611
00:43:28,999 --> 00:43:31,219
Besides, you need the doer to undo what she has done.

612
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:35,940
Perhaps Little Phoenix is waiting for Xuanji to resolve his troubles.

613
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,240
Eldest Brother Liu, you know that...

614
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,760
my past nine lives with Sifeng all ended in tragedy.

615
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,780
I don't want history to repeat itself this time.

616
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,319
I want to change.

617
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,120
I want a happy ending this time.

618
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,999
I know you care for Sifeng.

619
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,879
Trust me, I won't hurt him this time.

620
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,279
Even if he doesn't fall in love with me again,

621
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,239
I'll stay by his side just like how you are with Yu'er.

622
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,740
I'll protect him forever.

623
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,299
That's enough, Old Fogey. Stop hiding.

624
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:09,319
You always sigh when you mention Sifeng anyway.

625
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,679
Who knows, things might turn out better if Older Sister Xuanji approaches him.

626
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,080
Just tell her.

627
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,000
Stupid wench, why are you supporting an outsider?

628
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,460
Forget it, there's no point in letting you know.

629
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:35,060
I really don't know where Little Phoenix is.

630
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,540
You should try searching in the south.

631
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,380
Target places filled with energy.

632
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,840
Maybe you can find him there.

633
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,039
Thank you, Eldest Brother Liu. I will bring him back.

634
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:46,060
Let's go, Teng She.

635
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:53,500
<i>I wanted to pass this position to Elder Luo.</i>

636
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,280
<i>Eldest Brother Liu, why did you stop me?</i>

637
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,200
<i>If I didn't stop you,</i>

638
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,840
<i>I'd have to see you bang your head on the wall, put a Lover's Curse on yourself</i>

639
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,399
<i>and pretend to be the Devil Star until you're half-dead.</i>

640
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:09,799
<i>Now I even have to see you pass all your duties to someone</i>

641
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,759
<i>and find a place to die alone.</i>

642
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,200
<i>Isn't that what you're thinking, Little Phoenix?</i>

643
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:26,080
<i>The power of the divine weapons is raging within me.</i>

644
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,140
<i>I don't know how long I can last.</i>

645
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,500
<i>So, you're worried that you might succumb to the Juntain Hoop and Cehai Hooks' power,</i>

646
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,840
<i>and the power would render you into pieces.</i>

647
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,579
<i>Even when you die, the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook may fall into the wrong hands</i>

648
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:38,879
<i>and cause the soul of the Devil Star to be released.</i>

649
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,799
<i>By then, Xuanji will become an Asura zombie herself.</i>

650
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,159
<i>That's why you have to stay away from Xuanji</i>

651
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,480
<i>even when you die. Right?</i>

652
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,220
<i>Don't worry, Eldest Brother Liu.</i>

653
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,860
<i>I've never thought about</i>

654
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,900
<i>giving up on myself and dying.</i>

655
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:04,180
<i>Wu Zhiqi told me that there's the Glacial Pool</i>

656
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,700
<i>that can suppress the power of the divine weapons.</i>

657
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,519
<i>I'm planning to stay there.</i>

658
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,640
<i>Really?</i>

659
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,999
<i>So, you and Xuanji...</i>

660
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,500
<i>I'm tired.</i>

661
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,660
<i>I have been too obsessed.</i>

662
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,620
<i>I thought we could end well,</i>

663
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:25,520
<i>but the answer has already been written in history.</i>

664
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,679
<i>Not having an ending is an ending in itself.</i>

665
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,680
<i>You're completely discouraged.</i>

666
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,239
<i>Are you letting go for good?</i>

667
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,000
<i>Perhaps I should have known</i>

668
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,191
<i>that these matters</i>

669
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,994
<i>can never be forced.</i>

670
