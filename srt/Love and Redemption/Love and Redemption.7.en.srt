17
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,900
So, the lady you like is called Xuanji.

18
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,979
Brother Liu, you eavesdropped on me.

19
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,070
If I didn't do that, how would I know that you'd be so lovesick?

20
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,939
You can't even save yourself.

21
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,625
And you are still thinking about your lover?

22
00:01:56,625 --> 00:02:01,699
But does your lover know that you are being punished here because of her?

23
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,529
Of course, she knows.

24
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:05,060
We made a deal.

25
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,589
We are going to roam the world and train together.

26
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,441
We still have a long way ahead of us.

27
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:11,900
The future?

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,786
Are you that confident that you can survive the 13 Punishments?

29
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,298
Of course.

30
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:19,882
I still have a lot of things that I haven't done yet.

31
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:23,762
I promised Xuanji that I'm going to find the Mirror of Origin for her.

32
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:27,900
I will not let myself die in that 13 Punishments.

33
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,353
Mirror of Origin?

34
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:34,500
Isn't that the magical mirror where you can see your previous life?

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,740
Brother Liu, you know about it, too?

36
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,399
It used to be a magical object from the heavenly realm.

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,762
But it's broken and scattered across the world, right?

38
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:50,586
Yes. I'm going to collect all of the pieces.

39
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,671
Collect all of the pieces?

40
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:58,910
Little Phoenix, if I tell you

41
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,720
that I've seen a piece of the Mirror of Origin before,

42
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:04,820
how are you going to repay me?

43
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,100
Brother Liu, where did you see it?

44
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,762
When I was digging the secret tunnel,

45
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:13,980
I was climbing on top of the Kushui River.

46
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,140
Suddenly, a ray of bright light shone into my eyes.

47
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,027
So dazzlingly bright.

48
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:21,739
When I paused to look at it, I saw a mirror shard

49
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:24,579
lying on top of the riverbed of Bitter Water River.

50
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:29,260
It's the same shard that I saw in the Ancient Record of Magical Objects.

51
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,833
Brother Liu, how can I get into the Bitter Water River then?

52
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:36,638
Tell me.

53
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:42,318
Little Phoenix, actually, I just saw it from afar that day.

54
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,368
I'm not sure whether it's the shard of the Mirror of Origin.

55
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:47,666
No need to make yourself suffer.

56
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,060
I promised Xuanji.

57
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,601
The water of Bitter Water River is not normal water.

58
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:55,010
You'll feel like you've been burned just by touching it.

59
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,330
Besides, the deeper you go, the more painful it is.

60
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,098
You can't bear that kind of bone-deep pain.

61
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:02,898
I can.

62
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,780
Xuanji, why did you agree to go to Xuyang Peak?

63
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,767
After you leave, we won't be able to be like this again.

64
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:17,151
If you are bullied, I won't be able to protect you anymore. Do you know that?

65
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:20,547
Linglong, I'm going there to become stronger.

66
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:26,080
Look. Our father is the sect leader of Shaoyang Sect. He's so powerful.

67
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,575
But he has me, a useless daughter.

68
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:35,260
Moreover, I embarrassed him so much during the Hairpin Tournament.

69
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,699
Who said that you embarrassed him? I'll give him a piece of my mind!

70
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,541
Linglong, that's not what I meant.

71
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,449
Look. You are so smart. Everyone likes you.

72
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,994
But I always drag others down and bring troubles to everyone.

73
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:49,380
Even I am sick of myself.

74
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,420
Besides, I'm going to Xuyang Peak to train this time.

75
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,860
After I finish my training, I can protect myself.

76
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,551
I might even be able to protect you.

77
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:59,939
So, don't worry about me anymore. Okay?

78
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:03,010
Xuanji, if you want to learn,

79
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,113
I can teach you. You can learn slowly from me.

80
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:08,699
Can you not go to Xuyang Peak?

81
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,220
Linglong, don't be like this.

82
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,343
Why are you acting like a child?

83
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,238
It's not that I'm not coming back.

84
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,258
Okay now.

85
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,313
Little Phoenix, how are you feeling?

86
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:30,697
Don't act tough. Just come up if you can't take it anymore.

87
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,971
Dummy.

88
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,140
Okay then.

89
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,500
If they bully you over there, you have to tell me.

90
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,746
Then, I'll tell father and ask him to bring you back. Okay?

91
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:55,023
Okay, I'll definitely tell you if that happens.

92
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,691
Unfortunately, Sifeng is not here.

93
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,820
I really want to tell him about me going to Xuyang Peak.

94
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,942
Sifeng?

95
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:07,986
Oh, right. I almost forgot again. Sifeng asked me to give you this.

96
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:10,578
You can use it to send your voice across the world.

97
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:14,458
You just need to activate it like you activate a spell.

98
00:06:18,282 --> 00:06:21,326
Sifeng. Sifeng!

99
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,107
Little Phoenix, have you found it?

100
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:32,096
If you can't find it, give up! Come up!

101
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,100
Sifeng, I am Xuanji.

102
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,020
I want to tell you that I've recovered now.

103
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,154
What about you? Have you gone back to Lize Palace?

104
00:06:47,154 --> 00:06:49,670
How is everything at Lize Palace?

105
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:09,020
Did I use it the wrong way?

106
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,810
Maybe the bell is not with Sifeng now.

107
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,020
Try it later.

108
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,823
Okay.

109
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:19,819
Linglong, actually, I quite miss Sifeng.

110
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:22,638
I've decided. After I come back from Xuyang Peak,

111
00:07:22,638 --> 00:07:24,131
we'll fly there with our swords to see him.

112
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:27,900
And then we'll roam the world together, okay?

113
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,242
Good idea.

114
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:33,060
I think it'll take you 800 years until you can fly with your sword.

115
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,180
Little Six is so bad. Let's ignore him, Xuanji.

116
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,900
Linglong, I think Sixth Senior is quite nice.

117
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,700
Xuanji, you are leaving tomorrow.

118
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,762
I brought a jar of good wine for you as a farewell.

119
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,451
We'll drink until we drop today.

120
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:51,794
So, this is the Mirror of Origin.

121
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:54,756
Brother Liu, thank you.

122
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,100
Why are you thanking me?

123
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,600
You are the one who picked it up without a care for your life.

124
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:08,060
The bitter water in Bitter Water River is really dangerous.

125
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,655
It's done.

126
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:14,572
I'll tell Xuanji about this at once.

127
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,630
<i>Xuanji.</i>

128
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:23,859
Xuanji.

129
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,440
<i>Xuanji. Xuanji.</i>

130
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,140
Xuanji.

131
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,835
Xuanji.

132
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,745
<i>Xuanji. Xuanji.</i>

133
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,801
Xuanji!

134
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,020
You put in so much effort to help her find the shard.

135
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,689
But she doesn't even reply to you.

136
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:57,100
- Xuanji. Xuanji <br> - Give it back.

137
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,899
Maybe this bell is broken.

138
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,940
But I heard it very clearly just now.

139
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,491
She has already woken up but she still hasn't contacted you yet.

140
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:10,780
I think she has already forgotten about you.

141
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,602
You dummy.

142
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:20,700
There are so many pretty ladies in the world.

143
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,059
Why do you have to like a lady without six senses?

144
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:26,900
I think you must have grown dumb because you stayed too long in Lize Palace.

145
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,749
I think you better escape from the secret tunnel now.

146
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:32,035
Leave Lize Palace and never come back.

147
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:35,331
Don't risk your life for the 13 Punishments, either.

148
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,860
Now, I'm even more curious about this Miss Xuanji.

149
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,620
I want to take a good look at her if I have the chance.

150
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,678
I want to see why you are so obsessed with her.

151
00:09:54,258 --> 00:09:58,440
You should learn from me.

152
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,162
When I was young, I was charismatic and unrestrained.

153
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:04,432
I never stuck to just one.

154
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:07,731
I like this one today and I like that one tomorrow.

155
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:09,897
How awesome it was.

156
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:11,740
I want to ask you.

157
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:17,380
Do you feel the same way towards Yu'er and her mother?

158
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,600
When Yu'er's mother was still young,

159
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,009
she was the most beautiful lady at Yanhong Pavilion in Qingyang City.

160
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,899
Everyone was willing to spend thousands just to get into her good books.

161
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,219
But she had only eyes for me.

162
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,820
After I came back to the palace,

163
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,602
she found out that she was pregnant.

164
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:52,146
And she gave birth to Yu'er without my knowledge.

165
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:57,990
She even carried Yu'er and traveled all the way to Lize Palace.

166
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:04,067
This woman was really brave.

167
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,727
Brother Liu, but I've never heard you mention it before.

168
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,770
Just a stale and boring past.

169
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,931
At that time, I wanted to live as a human for once

170
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:30,586
in seclusion with Yu'er and her mother in the forest.

171
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:35,660
But I never thought that the old palace lord would find out about it.

172
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,706
And after that,

173
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,762
Hong Yu was driven away.

174
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,376
Lize Palace is always like this.

175
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:54,814
It's inhumane.

176
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:58,518
At first, the old palace lord wanted to capture Yu'er, too.

177
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,555
But I was holding his dark secret.

178
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,475
I was ready to go down with him.

179
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,580
And you know what happened next.

180
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,810
I made a vow

181
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:21,340
to stay in Lize Palace forever to receive my punishment

182
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,576
in exchange for my daughter's life.

183
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,300
But luckily, I wasn't thrown into the 13 Punishments.

184
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,420
Or else, I would be long dead.

185
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,612
I see.

186
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:39,243
So, you entrusted Yu'er to a family of farmers near Lize Palace

187
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:41,623
but don't dare to meet up with her.

188
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,743
At least Yu'er can live in peace.

189
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,562
When I'm free, I can sneak out to look at her.

190
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,641
This is quite nice.

191
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:58,478
It's quite nice.

192
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:09,567
Time to eat.

193
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,020
Life is hard and short. Food and drinks are the most important thing.

194
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,049
Where did you get this money bag?

195
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:26,460
It's clearly the one that I gave to my daughter during her birthday this year.

196
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,489
Stop talking nonsense. You can't even get out from here.

197
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:32,580
How can you give a present to your illegitimate daughter?

198
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,207
You have a tongue.

199
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:38,187
If you don't know how to speak, I'll pull it out for you.

200
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:40,740
Tell me. Where did you get this money bag?

201
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,106
I'll tell you. Just now, a crying old man came to Lize Palace.

202
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:49,240
I was passing by. So, he gave me this money bag and asked me to give you a letter.

203
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,073
Your daughter was criticized for being an illegitimate child with no parents.

204
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:55,342
So, she got furious and fought with them.

205
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:58,325
In the end, she fell down the cliff and she is dying.

206
00:13:58,325 --> 00:14:00,460
Bastard, how can you only say that now?

207
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,100
What can you do? You can't go out.

208
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,380
You!

209
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,582
Brother Liu, calm down.

210
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,253
Get lost!

211
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,700
Yu'er is in trouble.

212
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,439
No. I have to save her.

213
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,460
Brother Liu, leave first. I'll stop them.

214
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,720
- Little Phoenix, you... <br> - Say no more. Save your daughter first.

215
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,308
- Go now! <br> - Be careful then!

216
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:47,239
You lost the mask and fell in love, against the rules. We haven't even tried you for those yet.

217
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:50,738
And now, you helped the important criminal, Liu Yihuan, to escape.

218
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:54,419
This head disciple of Lize Palace is really amazing.

219
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:56,825
How dare you!

220
00:14:56,825 --> 00:15:00,426
I know that I've broken the rules. I'm willing to be punished.

221
00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:03,380
But I don't think that I'm wrong.

222
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,802
Feelings and desires are the most normal things in this world.

223
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:12,704
I don't know why Lize Palace has so many rules

224
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,170
that make us live like a living corpse.

225
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,327
Insolent fool!

226
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:20,100
You repeatedly commit the same mistake.

227
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,589
Do you still have respect for Lize Palace's rules?

228
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,950
You impenitent creature!

229
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,679
How dare you question the rules of our great ancestors.

230
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,717
Looks like you've made up your mind to stand against Lize Palace.

231
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:37,022
Palace Lord, are you still going to defend him this time?

232
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:40,812
Palace Lord, Yu Sifeng has broken the major rules of the palace repeatedly.

233
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:42,604
He even rebels against us.

234
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:45,690
As the discipline elder of Lize Palace, please

235
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,890
send this disciple to 13 Punishments Tower of Oblivion at once.

236
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,620
Please give your order!

237
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:07,194
Palace Lord,

238
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,955
it's time to give your order.

239
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,012
Palace Lord,

240
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,289
do you still remember this?

241
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:39,132
This is the Black Feather Token given by the old palace lord.

242
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:42,380
I can use it to keep the palace lord in line when the situation calls for it.

243
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,167
Since you are quite biased towards Yu Sifeng's matters,

244
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:49,251
I have no choice but to use this.

245
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,603
Stop forcing my master.

246
00:16:57,603 --> 00:16:59,718
I'm willing to be punished.

247
00:17:06,954 --> 00:17:08,616
Sifeng!

248
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,991
Sifeng!

249
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:13,416
You are willing to be punished.

250
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,459
Good.

251
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,460
From today onwards,

252
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,294
Yu Sifeng is no longer the head disciple of Lize Palace.

253
00:17:21,294 --> 00:17:24,955
From now on, those who break the rules will not be pardoned easily.

254
00:17:24,955 --> 00:17:29,394
The same applies to even the best of us.

255
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:38,502
Guards, bring Yu Sifeng into the 13 Punishments Tower of Oblivion.

256
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:45,290
Get lost! All of you, go away!

257
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,415
Xuanji,

258
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:54,458
when you reach Xuyang Peak,

259
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:58,574
remember to listen to your master and your senior.

260
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,047
Train well.

261
00:18:05,642 --> 00:18:07,137
Father,

262
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,667
Sister, Sixth Senior, I'll be leaving now.

263
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,196
Take care of yourself.

264
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:18,700
Xuanji, I can't bear to part with you.

265
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,277
Me, too.

266
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,458
Don't worry. Xuyang Peak will take good care of Junior Xuanji.

267
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,078
Thank you, Senior Hao Chen.

268
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:35,537
Xuanji, let's go.

269
00:18:35,537 --> 00:18:39,476
Xuanji, take care.

270
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,082
Take care.

271
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,370
Goodbye.

272
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:17,290
<i>[Palace Middle Hall]</i>

273
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:23,180
Xuanji, Hao Chen said that you are innocent and fearless.

274
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,451
I think he is right.

275
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:28,460
At first, I didn't plan to accept any more personal disciples

276
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,367
because I already have Hao Chen to take over my place one day.

277
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:34,550
But he kept on recommending you to me

278
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,510
so that I can accept you as my disciple.

279
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:44,865
After giving it a thought, I think that you are indeed a nice kid.

280
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:49,822
Senior, didn't you say that he chose me?

281
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:57,041
Quickly kneel and greet your master.

282
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:05,122
Master, thank you for accepting me as your disciple.

283
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:14,089
Good. From today onwards, you are Xuyang Peak's disciple.

284
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,626
From now on, you have to train hard

285
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:19,260
and bear the responsibility to guard Xuyang Peak.

286
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,186
Yes, Master.

287
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:23,999
Get up.

288
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,385
Hao Chen, after reinforcing the barrier of the secret ground,

289
00:20:31,385 --> 00:20:35,683
it's quite stable now. I've decided to meditate in seclusion

290
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:40,382
to fully understand the essence of Heartless Tactics.

291
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:43,700
<i>I just became his disciple and he's already going into seclusion?</i>

292
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,722
When I'm not here, all the disciples and matters of Xuyang Peak

293
00:20:48,722 --> 00:20:51,802
will be under your care and jurisdiction.

294
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:55,020
Is that clear for everyone?

295
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,340
- Yes, Master. <br> - Yes, Master.

296
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:03,300
Xuanji, I've already passed down

297
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,580
everything I know to Hao Chen, your senior.

298
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:11,017
I feel rest assured for him to train you.

299
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:15,820
Follow his teachings and respect him like he's your master.

300
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,036
Don't slack off.

301
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:20,143
Yes, Master.

302
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,606
Don't worry, Master. I'll do my best to train and teach her.

303
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,650
Senior, what is the Heartless Tactics that

304
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,540
Master said just now? Is it something powerful?

305
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,649
That's the ultimate skill of Xuyang Peak.

306
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:42,778
The people who practice it should get rid of all emotions and distractions

307
00:21:42,778 --> 00:21:44,899
to reach the state of Anatta, non-self. <br> (T/N: Anatta - Buddhist doctrine, that there is no unchanging, permanent self, soul, or essence in phenomena)

308
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:48,002
This is the cultivation of Xuyang Peak since ancient times.

309
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:50,100
<i>The ultimate skill?</i>

310
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,116
<i>I won't be able to learn that. It has nothing to do with me.</i>

311
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:58,866
You are thinking that this skill has nothing to do with you. Right?

312
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,914
How do you know about that?

313
00:22:02,914 --> 00:22:06,115
Your face is an open book.

314
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:10,220
It's quite difficult for normal people to reach that state.

315
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,074
But your six senses are undeveloped. Your state of mind is different.

316
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:15,962
You were born to learn the Heartless Tactics of Xuyang Peak

317
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:18,231
to become its Boundary Protector.

318
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,939
Senior, what is a Boundary Protector?

319
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:43,977
This is what I want to tell you.

320
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:49,270
The Boundary Protector is the duty of all disciples of Xuyang Peak.

321
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,537
You accidentally went into the secret ground.

322
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,180
You should know that there's a powerful celestial force inside.

323
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,070
If an evil man succeeds to break into it, the world will be in chaos.

324
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:02,180
The duty of the Boundary Protector is to protect the secret ground with their lives.

325
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,916
Since you managed to come out from the secret ground unharmed,

326
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:09,393
maybe this is your destiny with the secret ground.

327
00:23:09,393 --> 00:23:10,834
What's inside the secret ground?

328
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:14,656
It's not something that young disciples should ask.

329
00:23:14,656 --> 00:23:17,210
Just remember your duty and mission.

330
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,559
Train hard.

331
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,833
If you manage to reach the state of immortality in the future,

332
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,938
your life will not be in vain.

333
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:28,340
Senior, I still have a question.

334
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,394
Why do humans need to become a deity?

335
00:23:31,394 --> 00:23:33,932
Isn't it nice to be a normal human?

336
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,990
Why do you have so many questions?

337
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,689
No matter if it's humans, monsters, or demons,

338
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:44,058
all of them want to become deities.

339
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,866
Becoming a deity is the ultimate and only true path in life.

340
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:51,556
You just need to remember this.

341
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,709
By the way, I've already put all of your things inside the library.

342
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:00,999
What things?

343
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:04,060
Your dagger, bell, and kaleidoscope.

344
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,159
No. They are all gifts from others

345
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,542
and they are my most precious things.

346
00:24:09,426 --> 00:24:12,378
Xuanji, I just told you that

347
00:24:12,378 --> 00:24:14,584
Xuyang Peak is all about reaching Anatta.

348
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:17,385
These things carry the feelings of others.

349
00:24:17,385 --> 00:24:19,768
They'll disturb you from your training. Distractions.

350
00:24:19,768 --> 00:24:23,092
So you can't bring them with you.

351
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,814
Senior, I won't bring them with me.

352
00:24:26,814 --> 00:24:29,436
I'll just keep them in my room.

353
00:24:29,436 --> 00:24:32,649
Under the bed. I won't look at them often.

354
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:34,201
No.

355
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,564
Just one. Just give me one.

356
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,374
After you finish your training, I'll give them back to you.

357
00:24:46,297 --> 00:24:50,577
If that's the case, can you give me the Transmission Bell for a moment?

358
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:53,339
I want to talk to Sifeng for one last time.

359
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:56,828
At first, I wanted to tell him about me coming to Xuyang Peak

360
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,930
after everything was settled here.

361
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,534
Sifeng?

362
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:02,802
The disciple of Lize Palace?

363
00:25:04,506 --> 00:25:07,808
Xuanji, you won't be able to meet him.

364
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:10,939
What's the point of contacting him then?

365
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:14,273
You just promised me that you'll listen to me.

366
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,421
<i>I have no choice then.</i>

367
00:25:16,421 --> 00:25:19,905
<i>I've made a deal to meet Sifeng four years later anyway.</i>

368
00:25:19,905 --> 00:25:23,625
<i>I'll just train well first and visit him in the future.</i>

369
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,797
Why do you look so upset?

370
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:34,031
Since I took so many of your things, how about I give you a gift?

371
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,580
This is awesome!

372
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,474
Every person in training needs to have a personal magical weapon.

373
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:13,308
I'll give you this Parting Umbrella as your weapon then.

374
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,179
Awesome.

375
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:19,259
When I go out in the future, I just need to bring this umbrella. Right?

376
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:20,981
Not only is it a magical weapon,

377
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:24,113
it can even shield me from rain and sun.

378
00:26:24,113 --> 00:26:25,826
Thank you, Senior.

379
00:26:25,826 --> 00:26:28,193
You really like to slack off.

380
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,699
Senior, after I have this magical weapon,

381
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:36,465
does it mean that I can win even if I don't practice my spells?

382
00:26:36,465 --> 00:26:38,187
Although it has some power in it,

383
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:41,593
if you are not well-trained, you won't be able to use it well.

384
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:43,425
You can't slack off.

385
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:46,746
Now, can you see the importance of training?

386
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,279
I get it now, Senior Hao Chen.

387
00:27:01,058 --> 00:27:04,579
<i>The 13 Punishments Tower of Oblivion has 13 floors.</i>

388
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:07,393
<i>All 13 floors are full of vicious beasts, monsters, and evil spirits,</i>

389
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:10,434
<i>devilish formations that erode the soul and heart.</i>

390
00:27:10,434 --> 00:27:15,618
<i>The one who is punished has to climb from the bottom to the top</i>

391
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:17,764
<i>to be able to survive it.</i>

392
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:33,416
<i>Xuanji, I'm afraid that I'll be in a hard battle for quite a while.</i>

393
00:27:34,258 --> 00:27:36,998
<i>But I won't forget about our deal.</i>

394
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:39,719
<i>I'll definitely come out alive.</i>

395
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,634
Senior, I'm late.

396
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:06,723
Go ahead and punish me.

397
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:16,139
Why should I punish you?

398
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:17,550
Because...

399
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,420
Because I slacked off

400
00:28:20,426 --> 00:28:23,587
and didn't get up in the morning to train.

401
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:28,299
If you are awake but your heart is not,

402
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:30,699
it'll only have the opposite effect on your training.

403
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:34,474
Don't worry. I won't force you to wake up early.

404
00:28:40,482 --> 00:28:41,954
You are hungry?

405
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,716
Do you want to eat it?

406
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:12,305
Although you don't need to wake up early to train here,

407
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:14,545
we have our own rules.

408
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:18,214
First, we only eat once a day.

409
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:21,330
If you want to eat,

410
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,389
you'll have to chase it by flying with your sword.

411
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,163
Senior, I'm hungry.

412
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:25,019
I'm really hungry.

413
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:26,751
Bear with it.

414
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:34,139
Well, I can't find any flint in my room.

415
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:36,490
I can't light up the lanterns.

416
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,027
Learn how to use the fire spell to light up the candles then.

417
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,908
Light up.

418
00:31:09,354 --> 00:31:10,986
Light up.

419
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,019
<i>I'm hungry and it's dark.</i>

420
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:16,539
<i>Hurry up.</i>

421
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:20,281
<i>If you don't light up again, I'll eat you.</i>

422
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:04,930
♫ <i> Destiny foreshadows in this lifetime </i> ♫

423
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:10,210
♫ <i> Like a dream, unexpectedly meeting you </i> ♫

424
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:15,900
♫ <i> You left the mole on the corner of the eye as a mark </i> ♫

425
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:21,240
♫ <i> Yet forget the previous lifetime's promise </i> ♫

426
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:25,810
♫ <i> The ending has been set, the twist of fate can't be seen </i> ♫

427
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,510
<i>Xuanji,</i>

428
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,420
<i>these 13 Punishments are harder than I thought.</i>

429
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,514
<i>I just managed to pass the first level.</i>

430
00:32:34,514 --> 00:32:36,685
<i>But I can do it.</i>

431
00:32:36,685 --> 00:32:39,980
<i>I'm afraid that</i>

432
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,559
<i>it'll take me longer than expected to pass through all 13 floors.</i>

433
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,952
<i>You still haven't replied to me until now.</i>

434
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:55,363
<i>I don't know if you can hear me or not.</i>

435
00:32:55,363 --> 00:32:58,134
<i>Is the bell too hard for you to use,</i>

436
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,910
<i>or did you lose the bell?</i>

437
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:07,620
♫ <i> When the moon rises, memories come flooding back, <br>as if waking from a dream </i> ♫

438
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,540
♫ <i>My love does not cease, unchanged whether in life or death </i> ♫

439
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:18,700
♫ <i> Love as colored glass </i> ♫

440
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,060
Senior Duan Qing.

441
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:46,199
Xuanji, did you just go to collect some nectar?

442
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:48,859
Yes. I love the nectar from various flowers.

443
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:51,537
So, I just collected some of them from the valley just now.

444
00:33:51,537 --> 00:33:53,200
Can I have a taste?

445
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,760
Sure.

446
00:34:00,003 --> 00:34:01,724
So sweet.

447
00:34:03,188 --> 00:34:06,499
Senior Duan Qing, is this bottle full of nectar, too?

448
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:07,682
Yes.

449
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:10,201
Can you give it to me then?

450
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:13,909
Well, can I make you another one?

451
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:16,866
This bottle is for someone else.

452
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:18,843
For whom?

453
00:34:18,843 --> 00:34:22,506
It... It's someone I like.

454
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,592
I have someone I like, too.

455
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:25,939
Then, you'll understand.

456
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,622
If you really like someone,

457
00:34:27,622 --> 00:34:31,473
you'll want to share the thing you like the most with him.

458
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:36,579
Sharing the things I like with the person I like.

459
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:38,600
Is everyone like this?

460
00:34:39,365 --> 00:34:42,121
All right, Xuanji. I have to go now.

461
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:47,066
<i>Since I've decided to like Sixth Senior,</i>

462
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:50,004
<i>I'm going to leave some of the fruits I like for him.</i>

463
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,515
Senior Hao Chen.

464
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,379
Finally, you don't need to be hungry anymore.

465
00:35:03,379 --> 00:35:06,265
Senior Hao Chen, haven't I improved a lot lately?

466
00:35:06,265 --> 00:35:07,609
You can fly quite okay now.

467
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:11,679
Tomorrow, you'll take a spell test with other new disciples from outside.

468
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:16,568
Why?

469
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:54,059
You've studied at Xuyang Peak for quite some time.

470
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:57,658
Today, we are going to test your basic spell skills.

471
00:35:57,658 --> 00:35:59,050
Are you ready?

472
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,060
Yes!

473
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,173
Xuanji, I taught you myself.

474
00:36:06,173 --> 00:36:08,538
Don't embarrass me.

475
00:36:08,538 --> 00:36:10,179
Don't worry, Senior Hao Chen.

476
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:12,375
I'm ready.

477
00:36:24,363 --> 00:36:27,639
Let's start. Lightning Spell.

478
00:36:49,122 --> 00:36:50,896
Wind Spell.

479
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,511
Okay.

480
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:31,389
Burrowing Spell.

481
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:34,953
Xuanji, you can go first.

482
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,481
Thank you, Senior Hao Chen.

483
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:05,819
Your spell is okay.

484
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:08,395
But you need to improve on your physical capability.

485
00:38:14,314 --> 00:38:16,779
This is what you consider well prepared for the exam?

486
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:19,136
I won't do it again.

487
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:23,090
Have you ever thought that if it rained today

488
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,933
and it washed off all the spells you copied on your dress,

489
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:27,775
what are you going to do?

490
00:38:29,794 --> 00:38:32,754
Luckily, it's not raining today.

491
00:38:33,651 --> 00:38:37,331
You should at least find a fool-proof way if you are going to cheat.

492
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:40,282
That's it for today's test.

493
00:38:40,282 --> 00:38:42,246
All of you have improved a lot.

494
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:43,760
Continue to work hard tomorrow.

495
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,240
Yes, Senior!

496
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:56,539
Great. Now that I've embroidered them on, I won't forget about these spells.

497
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:59,500
And they won't be washed off, either.

498
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,613
Senior, you are not angry. Right?

499
00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:05,281
As long as you know how to use it.

500
00:39:05,281 --> 00:39:07,289
No matter what method you use,

501
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:11,499
be it memorizing it or carrying it with you, it's not important.

502
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:12,899
Senior, you are so kind.

503
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,841
Now, I can use any spells.

504
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:17,841
When I see my seniors and juniors when I go back to Mount Shaoyang,

505
00:39:17,841 --> 00:39:19,579
they'll be shocked that I've improved

506
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:22,539
when I show them these five spells.

507
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:25,779
You can just barely perform those spells right now.

508
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:27,418
It's not something to be proud of yet.

509
00:39:27,418 --> 00:39:31,078
From now on, you have to work harder to strengthen your spells

510
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,769
so that you can defeat real monsters and demons.

511
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:42,051
What? Do you already want to ambush me with these petty skills of yours?

512
00:39:42,643 --> 00:39:45,243
You are wrong, Senior.

513
00:39:51,372 --> 00:39:54,826
I never thought that you could break the spell to my wine cellar.

514
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,845
You've improved.

515
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,170
I'll have to borrow this as a gift then.

516
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,697
This wine is for you.

517
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:08,338
But can I drink a little bit of it?

518
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:10,719
I've been craving it lately.

519
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,049
Senior, the wine you brewed is really delicious.

520
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:24,931
It's the best.

521
00:40:25,411 --> 00:40:28,853
Don't drink so much. I don't want you to be drunk.

522
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,212
Senior, I've been wanting to ask you this.

523
00:40:33,212 --> 00:40:35,490
You are so amazing

524
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:39,090
and many seniors and juniors like you.

525
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:41,502
Are you really going to give up all of your feelings

526
00:40:41,502 --> 00:40:46,410
to learn those Heartless Tactics and guard the secret ground forever?

527
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,726
I was born to guard that secret ground.

528
00:40:49,726 --> 00:40:53,418
Only by being heartless can I get rid of the turmoil in this world

529
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:56,017
and neutralize the demons inside everyone.

530
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,440
Don't you want to be with your friends?

531
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,854
Friend?

532
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:11,329
I used to have a friend.

533
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:13,490
We were very close.

534
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:18,268
But she betrayed me and committed a grave crime.

535
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,662
It's too bad that I didn't realize it sooner.

536
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,631
If I could have helped her out earlier,

537
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:32,574
perhaps she wouldn't be like this today.

538
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,745
Betrayal?

539
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:39,539
Then, she is not a real friend.

540
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,619
My friends are all splendid.

541
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:43,863
They won't do this kind of thing.

542
00:41:50,131 --> 00:41:52,122
Humans are unpredictable.

543
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:54,549
Your friends might change.

544
00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:57,659
Xuanji, one day, you'll understand that

545
00:41:57,659 --> 00:41:59,759
only by focusing on becoming a deity

546
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:02,779
can you get rid of all your worries right now.

547
00:42:02,779 --> 00:42:04,421
Understand?

548
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,017
Yes.

549
00:42:17,907 --> 00:42:21,671
<i>Are you still unwilling to become a deity because you are still angry?</i>

550
00:42:22,379 --> 00:42:26,798
<i>Is this the life that you want?</i>

551
00:42:26,798 --> 00:42:30,994
<i>Do you know that I'm here to bring you back?</i>

552
00:42:30,994 --> 00:42:36,458
<i>When we go back, can we still be together like before?</i>

553
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:26,080
