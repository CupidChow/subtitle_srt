The Snow Lingzhi?

00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,700
Sifeng!

20
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,271
Look at the Snow Lingzhi!

21
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:49,632
It has matured!

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,800
Sifeng, you will be saved!

00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,119
Xuanji, I told you I wasn't that unlucky.

Is the thunderous calamity over?

29
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:33,545
Your blood contract has been terminated.

30
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:35,235
The thunderous calamity has passed as well.

31
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:37,054
You're free now.

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,079
- I'm free now? <br> - Yes.

33
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,300
- You're free now. <br> - I'm free now?

34
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,180
Master!

35
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,802
No!

36
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,300
Snow Lingzhi!

37
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,395
Sifeng, what should we do without the Snow Lingzhi?

38
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:02,895
Sifeng, how can I save you?

39
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:07,020
Sifeng, I want you to stay alive! I don't want anything to happen to you, Sifeng!

40
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,278
Sifeng!

41
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,732
- I'm fine. <br> - Why are you saying Master will die?

42
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:14,933
What's going on?

43
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:18,440
Tell me!

44
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:23,447
Yu Sifeng, you couldn't kill me.

45
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:25,580
You're going to die in front of me instead.

46
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,580
What a funny turn of events.

47
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,575
Yuan Lang?

48
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:30,980
Yes.

49
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,360
I'm the only one who wishes to send you to an early grave.

50
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,416
It's all thanks to your stupid spirit beast.

51
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,417
Thanks to her, my plan went smoothly.

52
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,220
- What do you mean? <br> - What do I mean?

53
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,919
I knew from the start that

54
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,068
Yu Sifeng was waiting for the Snow Lingzhi to be matured.

55
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:54,800
That's why I lured you into my plan.

56
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,012
Actually, you don't need to feed the moths with Lingzhi at all.

57
00:03:58,012 --> 00:04:00,132
But if they consume Lingzhi,

58
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:03,719
they'll feed on Lingzhi once they become moths.

59
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,817
This rare Snow Lingzhi which only grows around the Glacial Pool,

60
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:11,160
the moths will detect it even from 100 miles away.

61
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,850
And once they consume it,

62
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,140
there'll be no way to save Yu Sifeng.

63
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,361
You think you're that lucky?

64
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:21,809
You think you could find the moths vital to terminating the contract

65
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:24,246
by just exploring the huge Demon Citadel?

66
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:27,026
The book even told you how to feed it, you know?

67
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,200
It's all because my powers haven't recovered.

68
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,456
I couldn't seek revenge by myself.

69
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:35,553
That's why I placed the lure there.

70
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:40,033
I didn't expect a dumb spirit beast like you to fall for it

71
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:42,239
and become my weapon.

72
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,298
Die!

73
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,660
God of War, you're so fierce.

74
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,469
It's a pity my real body isn't here. You can't hurt me.

75
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:56,894
Chu Xuanji, I know you want to abandon your identity as the God of War

76
00:04:56,895 --> 00:05:00,280
and you want to live with Yu Sifeng peacefully and grow old together.

77
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,999
It's a pity that you can't escape your fate.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,719
Not just me, the entire heavens won't let you off.

79
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,559
I'll kill every one of you then,

80
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,399
until you regret your actions!

81
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:15,399
Chu Xuanji, you don't need to be angry.

82
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,119
Isn't helping Yu Sifeng to survive this ordeal

83
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,278
the most important thing now?

84
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:23,540
Xuanji.

85
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,871
Xuanj, just let him go.

86
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,679
Just accompany me for the rest of my days.

87
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:37,163
Don't waste your time on unnecessary feuds.

88
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:42,160
No! If you die, I don't want to live.

89
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,688
Silly girl.

90
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,910
Besides me,

91
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:02,061
you still have your father and your older sister.

92
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:06,400
How could you abandon them?

93
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,140
No matter what happens to me...

94
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,960
in this lifetime, I'm content.

95
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,658
Because...

96
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,144
I know I am always

97
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,537
in your heart.

98
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,873
I have no regrets in this life.

99
00:06:32,873 --> 00:06:34,680
Xuanji,

100
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,839
you need to take care of yourself.

101
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,560
Actually, it's too early for you to say your goodbyes.

102
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,100
Yu Sifeng may still survive.

103
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,639
What?

104
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,486
Although the divine weapon is draining his life,

105
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:57,389
there's a way to save him.

106
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,358
You need to unseal the Crystal Lamp and revive the Devil Star.

107
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:05,220
The Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook are part of the Devil Star all along.

108
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,980
If you revive Devil Star and he absorbs the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook,

109
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,060
Yu Sifeng will be saved.

110
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,260
God of War, it all depends on your choice.

111
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,208
Yuan Lang, don't spout nonsense!

112
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,973
You'll know whether I'm lying if you think about it.

113
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:29,893
I don't need to say much.

114
00:07:29,893 --> 00:07:35,199
God of War, it all depends on you, whether to save him or not.

115
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,244
Farewell.

116
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,733
Xuanji, don't believe him.

117
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,938
Yuan Lang is trying to trick you.

118
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:50,793
Master, I was wrong!

119
00:07:50,793 --> 00:07:52,065
I didn't do this on purpose!

120
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:54,133
I didn't know that this was his plan!

121
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:58,014
Please don't abandon me! Please don't abandon me!

122
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,649
Little Silver Flower, I'm not your master any more.

123
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,366
The blood contract has been terminated.

124
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:07,439
You don't need to kneel before me.

125
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,158
Now,

126
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,860
I don't have much time left.

127
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,723
I just want to...

128
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,480
I want to spend...

129
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,737
my remaining time with Xuanji.

130
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:31,590
You should leave.

131
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,241
Xuanji,

132
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:39,723
Little Silver Flower was deceived.

133
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:44,809
This is my fate.

134
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:47,904
We don't need to blame anyone else.

135
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:49,801
Let's go.

Stop following us.

140
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,840

147
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:06,300
Xuanji,

148
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,119
let me help!

149
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,699
Come.

150
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,899
This is Vermilion Bird's blood fog.

151
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,403
Xuanji, the thunderous calamity has attracted the Four Sacred Beasts.

152
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:17,680
First, it's Yuan Lang.

153
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,391
Now, it's the Four Sacred Beasts.

154
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:21,399
Why are they pursuing us?

155
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,574
Why can't they just let Sifeng and I lead a peaceful life?

156
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:28,687
I don't care who comes, I'll defeat all of them!

157
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:31,998
Teng She, take care of Sifeng for me.

158
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,007
Show yourself!

159
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:49,599
So, it's the God of War?

160
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,243
Long time no see.

161
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:53,844
Why are you so angry?

162
00:10:53,844 --> 00:10:57,954
Is it because my song wasn't good enough for you?

163
00:10:57,954 --> 00:11:00,434
I've tried my best to tolerate your actions.

164
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:02,279
Why are you still trying to force me?

165
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,520
You should know the best whether Sifeng is the Devil Star or not.

166
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,394
Why are the heavens still pursuing him?

167
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:10,019
General, seems like you're mistaken.

168
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,529
We're not trying to pursue Yu Sifeng.

169
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:14,607
God of War, we're trying to pursue you.

170
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,473
Me?

171
00:11:16,473 --> 00:11:20,400
I've experienced ten tribulations in ten lifetimes. I'm not the God of War anymore.

172
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,159
Why are you pursuing me?

173
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,204
God of War, we came here to arrest you under King Bailing's order.

174
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:27,879
You better cooperate with us.

175
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,294
If not, innocent people will be harmed,

176
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:34,535
and I know you don't wish to see that.

177
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:38,620
Thank you for the reminder, but I'm not interested in the heavens.

178
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,880
I won't follow you back.

179
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,688
General, seems like you care about him very much,

180
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:48,939
but he's annoying to me.

181
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:53,057
Why don't you let me destroy him with my blood fog?

182
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:55,617
So that it'll be more interesting!

183
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,726
Stinky woman, let me help you.

184
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,747
Teng She, what do you mean by this?

185
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:11,276
We're your peers in the heavens.

186
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:15,619
It's fine if you don't want to help us, but are you trying to betray us?

187
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:18,107
I just don't like it when you are trying to bully her as she's alone!

188
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:19,788
We from the heavens...

189
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,919
We from the heavens need to obey justice and righteousness.

190
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,440
You can't just bully her as she's alone. I won't stand for it.

191
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,879
She's the God of War. She's not a random demon.

192
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,950
You want us to fight her fairly? That's digging our own grave!

193
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,869
Teng She, are you acting like this because you're drunk?

194
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:36,812
Black Tortoise, don't you understand?

195
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:38,462
He's doing this on purpose.

196
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:40,932
It's obvious that he wants to go against us.

197
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:47,080
Lord Teng She, I heard long ago that you were tamed by the God of War.

198
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,704
At first, I didn't believe it.

199
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:52,944
But judging by this situation, it seems that it wasn't just a rumor.

200
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,939
Nonsense!

201
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:59,144
I-It's because I get along well with her! That's why I take her as my subordinate!

202
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:01,718
I won't stand for it if you bully my subordinate!

203
00:13:01,718 --> 00:13:04,379
Teng She, capturing her is King Bailing's order.

204
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,269
I can ignore everything you've done.

205
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,919
But if you fight us today, it means that you're going against his order.

206
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,140
Have you thought it through? Are you trying to disobey King Bailing?

207
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,799
King Bailing?

208
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,320
Naturally, I respect him,

209
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,840
but I can't just leave Xuanji in the lurch!

210
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,149
If you touch Xuanji, I'll fight until the end!

211
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,220
You ignorant imbecile!

212
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,100
We'll capture you as well! Prepare for your punishment!

213
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,718
You are trying to bully me as well?

214
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,066
Teng She, you're a heavenly officer.

215
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:37,679
You shouldn't join this fight.

216
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,159
Let's fight then! Stop wasting time!

217
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,674
- Come on! <br> - Be obedient!

218
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:43,823
Be obedient?

219
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,980
Why? I'm not your spirit beast!

220
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,650
<i>Thank you, Teng She.</i>

221
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:57,060
<i>But I won't put you in a plight.</i>

222
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,280
Come on.

223
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,719
So, it was you? You created the blood fog?

224
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,400
Today, we'll settle our debts once and for all!

225
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,687
Ninth Heaven Fire!

226
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,520
This is as close as we can get.

227
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,099
No. I'm sure someone released the blood fog on purpose.

228
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,719
Sifeng... He's hurt.

229
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:07,480
What if he's in danger?

230
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,045
Yan Ran.

231
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,300
The blood fog is dangerous. You'll die if you inhale it.

232
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,721
That's fine.

233
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:16,859
I was supposed to die anyway.

234
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,166
I want to save Sifeng.

235
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,301
You don't need to follow me. I can go by myself.

236
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:23,863
Yan Ran.

237
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,986
You and I are the same.

238
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:29,587
You can't forget him,

239
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:30,912
and I can't forget you.

240
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:33,041
I've promised to see this through with you.

241
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:37,222
If you want to die, I'll die with you.

242
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:38,719
So...

243
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,840
Don't blame me if you die.

244
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,264
Silly girl, this is not how you should die.

245
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:48,953
Now, there is no wind, yet the blood fog is floating around.

246
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:52,120
Seems like it's following the direction of the Southern Seven Stars.

247
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:57,424
If I'm not mistaken, the path

248
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,978
should be over there.

249
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,760
Set up the Sacred Beasts Formation!

250
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,675
Yan Ran!

251
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,100
Little Silver Flower, how do you feel?

252
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,519
Little Beauty, were they strong?

253
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,199
Why were you so angry at them?

254
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,759
They're mediocre.

255
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,281
They're using the Sacred Beasts Formation to buy time.

256
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:26,576
Which one of you hurt my Little Fox?

257
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:27,859
Come out!

258
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:31,391
- I'll get even for her! <br> - Let's go!

259
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,609
The Sacred Beasts are quick in escaping, huh?

260
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,471
Sifeng!

261
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:46,319
Master! Master!

262
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,262
Yan Ran!

263
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:51,020
- Master! <br> - Yan Ran, look at me.

264
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,039
- How do you feel? <br> - Where's Master?

265
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,368
Where's Master?

266
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:56,291
I'll take you to him.

267
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,402
Little Silver Flower!

268
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,638
Master!

269
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,428
Master! I'm here.

270
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,852
Little Silver Flower, why were you hurt?

271
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:36,727
Master, are you all right?

272
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:39,140
I'm really sorry.

273
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,495
I can only offer my life to atone for my sin.

274
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:46,840
Please don't hate me, okay?

275
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,242
I've never hated you.

276
00:18:49,242 --> 00:18:50,980
Close your eyes.

277
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,280
I'll treat your wound.

278
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,607
No need.

279
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,440
I can't last for long.

280
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,153
Master, can I lie on your hand?

281
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:11,867
Just like the past?

282
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,360
I always thought that

283
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,000
if I regain my freedom one day,

284
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,440
I could become a real human,

285
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,010
and I could pester you just like Chu Xuanji.

286
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,667
I can do everything she does.

287
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,200
But now, I finally understand.

288
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,360
I'm really naive.

289
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,080
The more I try to imitate her,

290
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,220
the further you are from me.

291
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,677
Chu Xuanji,

292
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,221
I will die soon.

293
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:30,340
No one will talk bad about you in the future.

294
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,215
I'm sure you're happy, right?

295
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:37,360
Little Silver Flower, I know you treat

296
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,905
Sifeng as the most important person in your life,

297
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:46,020
and I know you did everything for his sake.

298
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,401
So, Little Silver Flower, I'm very sad.

299
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,038
I'm really sad.

300
00:20:57,273 --> 00:21:02,393
You cultivators speak beautiful lies.

301
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:04,817
I don't believe you.

302
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,817
Master, how great would it be

303
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:26,350
if I were a cultivator like you

304
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,660
in my next life?

305
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,954
Forget it.

306
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,200
Actually, to me,

307
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,972
staying as a little snake

308
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:59,490
and by your side forever

309
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:02,376
is a good thing as well.

310
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,337
Master, I'm so tired.

311
00:22:16,337 --> 00:22:19,100
Can I take a nap?

312
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,420
Just for a little while.

313
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,527
Master, please don't wake me up.

314
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,717
Little Silver Flower! Little SIlver Flower!

315
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,160
Although you're my spirit beast,

316
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,160
we're mere friends.

317
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,917
Why did you insist on achieving the impossible?

318
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,863
Why can't you

319
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:02,381
take a look at the person who's beside you all the time?

320
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,850
♫ <i>One lie, one step out of turn</i> ♫

321
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:13,790
♫ <i>Every wound from love frost up these tears</i> ♫

322
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:19,590
♫ <i>Hestiate alone, protecting the past</i> ♫

323
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,524
Ruo Yu, where are you going?

324
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,080
Yan Ran had a harsh life.

325
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,986
I'll send her to the West Coast.

326
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:37,131
That's the place where we first met.

327
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,300
She'll rest in peace over there.

328
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,441
Wait.

329
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:57,788
Sifeng! Your body!

330
00:23:57,788 --> 00:24:00,294
I'm fine.

331
00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:04,220
Let me send her off.

332
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,516
<i>Master, I'm your spirit beast.</i>

333
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:29,739
<i>I'll follow you wherever you go.</i>

334
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:32,906
<i>I'm your master. If I die, you'll have nowhere to go.</i>

335
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:34,579
<i>Master, please don't die!</i>

336
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:38,796
<i>If she dares to hurt you, I will never let her off!</i>

337
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,899
<i>The Loveless Curse is triggering!</i>

338
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,961
<i>Master, please don't hurt yourself!</i>

339
00:24:44,962 --> 00:24:48,068
<i>If you hurt yourself, I can only commit suicide to atone for my sin!</i>

340
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,558
<i>I don't want to terminate our blood contract!</i>

341
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:51,983
<i>I know my fault now!</i>

342
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:54,187
<i>I really do!</i>

343
00:24:54,187 --> 00:24:57,124
<i>Master, I promise that I won't hurt Chu Xuanji again!</i>

344
00:24:57,124 --> 00:24:59,010
<i>You mustn't hurt yourself,</i>

345
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,994
<i>and you mustn't abandon me!</i>

346
00:25:00,994 --> 00:25:03,680
<i>I'll follow you forever!</i>

347
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,733
<i>I will never leave you and I will protect you forever!</i>

348
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:10,644
<i>In your eyes, I'm only a spirit beast.</i>

349
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:14,261
<i>I disobeyed your command because I didn't want you to get hurt,</i>

350
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:17,202
<i>because I only have you in my heart.</i>

351
00:25:17,202 --> 00:25:21,247
<i>I was always beside you. Can't you just take a look at me?</i>

352
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:25,554
<i>If you think this is too tough, you may leave me.</i>

353
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,240
<i>Fine. You'll regret this.</i>

354
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,520
<i>Just you wait. I'll find a way to terminate our blood contract.</i>

355
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,432
Sifeng, thank you for sending her off.

356
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:43,620
I'm sure she would be happy if she knew.

357
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,680
♫ <i>Bathing under your tender gaze</i> ♫

358
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,720
♫ <i>I only hope that you can be well for all lfetime</i> ♫

359
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,690
Sifeng.

360
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:04,140
♫ <i>It's too absurd, but just can't forget our past</i> ♫

361
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,956
Eldest Brother Liu, does your wound still hurt?

362
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,500
The wound is nothing.

363
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,639
I stole the celestial eye in the first place.

364
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,000
It's fine if they want to take it back.

365
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,413
I'm just worried about Yu'er.

366
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,259
She was implicated because of me.

367
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:28,279
I don't even know where she is right now.

368
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,719
I told them to come at me for my misdeeds!

369
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,780
I will make them give me an explanation!

370
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,159
Those dogs in from the heavens are too much!

371
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,086
I just wanted to lead a peaceful life,

372
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:41,710
yet they're coming for us!

373
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,868
I'll destroy every single one of you!

374
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,579
Wu Zhiqi, we were just hurt.

375
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:49,653
We'll be fine after some rest. Don't be so angry.

376
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:52,278
Moreover, you said I was ugly. Right?

377
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,288
This is better. I can train for a few hundred years

378
00:26:55,288 --> 00:26:57,182
and take on the appearance that you like.

379
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,519
How is this better?

380
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,047
I'll make the call whether you change your appearance or not!

381
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:03,320
They have no right to interfere!

382
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,597
- Ting Nu. <br> - Ting Nu.

383
00:27:07,597 --> 00:27:09,720
How's Sifeng?

384
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,440
He's very weak, and his qi was damaged.

385
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,220
I'm afraid he can't withstand the power of the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook anymore.

386
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,800
How much time does he have?

387
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:32,744
Even if he's lucky, he'll survive for one month at most.

388
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,368
Ting Nu, although the Snow Lingzhi is gone,

389
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,758
are there any similar herbs or grasses in the world?

390
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,218
There are so many great herbs in this world.

391
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:44,622
Don't tell me all of them are useless?

392
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:46,998
Just like you, I want to save Sifeng, too,

393
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,963
but the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook aren't from the mortal realm.

394
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:53,463
His body can't stand it if he absorbs them by force.

395
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,955
We can't do anything about it.

396
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,610
Don't tell me Little Phoenix has to face the same fate again?

397
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,330
No.

398
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,769
There's another way.

399
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,931
Ting Nu, if I unseal the Crystal Lamp and revive the Devil Star,

400
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:15,222
the Devil Star will absorb the Juntain Hoop and Cehai Hook

401
00:28:15,223 --> 00:28:17,703
and Sifeng will be saved, am I right?

402
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:20,899
That's possible.

403
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,532
But once Devil Star is revived,

404
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:25,052
the three realms will be plunged into chaos!

405
00:28:25,052 --> 00:28:26,817
That's right, Xuanji.

406
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:28,380
The Devil Star is a violent and cruel entity.

407
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,407
If you revive him, everyone else will die!

408
00:28:32,407 --> 00:28:34,444
Yes. If the three realms are plunged into chaos,

409
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:37,632
the lines between immortals and humans will be blurred,

410
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,359
and everything will be too late by then.

411
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,233
Sifeng,

412
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,379
here. Have some soup.

413
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,976
I'm really lucky.

414
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:41,677
I have someone to feed me.

415
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,376
If you like it, I can feed you every day.

416
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,200
Doesn't that make me useless?

417
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,293
But judging by your condition,

418
00:30:07,293 --> 00:30:09,234
you're useless, indeed.

419
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:11,276
Don't worry, Sifeng.

420
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,560
You'll get better soon.

421
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,270
Xuanji, are you trying to revive the Devil Star?

422
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,220
Are you trying to unseal the Crystal Lamp?

423
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,760
That's the only way I can save you.

424
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,312
This is Yuan Lang's trick. You mustn't believe him.

425
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,182
Yes.

426
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:51,484
I know Yuan Lang is trying to revive the Devil Star.

427
00:30:52,949 --> 00:30:56,909
But I can save you with this method as well.

428
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,420
If you do revive Devil Star,

429
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:05,045
the mortal realm may be pushed into

430
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:07,924
an endless sea of torment.

431
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,339
I know that.

432
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,480
But that's just a possibility.

433
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,020
I don't know what exactly will happen

434
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,604
once the Devil Star is revived, but I know that you will die

435
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,588
if I don't unseal the Crystal Lamp.

436
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,502
Don't worry.

437
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,133
I'm the God of War.

438
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:42,420
I've recovered my powers.

439
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,554
I defeated the Devil Star 1,000 years ago

440
00:31:45,554 --> 00:31:47,714
and sealed him into the Crystal Lamp.

441
00:31:47,714 --> 00:31:54,336
And now, for your sake, I can defeat him and seal him again.

442
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:57,640
I won't let him wreak havoc in the world.

443
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,255
No.

444
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,782
You won't be able to seal him away.

445
00:32:01,783 --> 00:32:03,803
Don't you believe in me?

446
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,590
Xuanji, it's not that I don't believe in you,

447
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,071
but everything is uncertain.

448
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:16,719
If you fail,

449
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,939
the Devil Star will be revived. The three realms will be plunged into chaos.

450
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:24,001
Your father, Shaoyang Sect, Minyan and Linglong,

451
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:26,430
everything around us will be engulfed

452
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:30,260
by the hatred of the Devil Star.

453
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,859
What can we do by then?

454
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,816
What else can we do?

455
00:32:36,817 --> 00:32:39,097
We've missed out on too many things.

456
00:32:39,097 --> 00:32:43,860
Sifeng, I just wish that we can live together

457
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,114
and grow old together.

458
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,879
Xuanji,

459
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:58,496
that's my wish as well.

460
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,880
But as a human,

461
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,239
I wish to live without guilt.

462
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:08,723
If the three realms are plunged into chaos because of me,

463
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:11,159
I will be the biggest sinner.

464
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,360
Even if I live, I will never live in peace.

465
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,522
Xuanji, promise me.

466
00:33:19,522 --> 00:33:22,201
Promise me that you'll never do it.

467
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,435
Sifeng!

468
00:33:26,435 --> 00:33:30,060
Sifeng! Sifeng!

469
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,846
Sifeng!

470
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,249
I promise you! Please don't move!

471
00:33:40,249 --> 00:33:42,953
You mustn't exert your body! I promise you!

472
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:44,754
Okay?

473
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,851
Xuanji,

474
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,179
let's cherish our remaining days.

475
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,124
With you by my side,

476
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,400
I have no regrets now.

477
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,919
But, Sifeng, I still need to return to the Shaoyang Sect.

478
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,511
My father's birthday is arriving.

479
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:19,927
Linglong has prepared a banquet for him.

480
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:22,927
She knows that I've found you.

481
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,736
She wants us to return together.

482
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,359
And...

483
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:36,105
there's another important thing that I must do.

484
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,790
♫ <i>Are of sorrow and joy that you will never understand</i> ♫

485
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:51,280
Marry me.

486
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,130
♫ <i>With you, I watch how the flowers flourish and wither</i> ♫

487
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:02,770
♫ <i>Unseal all the memories that are buried in dust in your heart</i> ♫

488
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:08,730
♫ <i> When the moon rises, memories come flooding back, <br>as if waking from a dream&nbsp; </i> ♫

489
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,657
But I don't have much time left.

490
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,056
Won't this...

491
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,560
ruin your future?

492
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:33,170
♫ <i> In the end, we're unable to escape from our fate </i> ♫

493
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:38,900
♫ <i> The expressions concealed under the mask </i> ♫

494
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:43,180
♫ <i> Are of sorrow and joy that you will never understand </i> ♫

495
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,620
I won't marry anyone else besides you.

496
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,140
So, no matter how much time you have left,

497
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,980
I want to leave no regrets behind,

498
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:01,505
just like you.

499
00:36:01,505 --> 00:36:07,710
So, you must promise me that you'll marry me.

500
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:13,230
♫ <i> Retrieve the beauty that are colorless in your eyes </i> ♫

501
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:19,330
♫ <i> With you, I watch how the flowers flourish and wither </i> ♫

502
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,200
I promise you.

503
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,500
I promise you.

504
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:41,770
♫ <i> My love does not cease, unchanged whether in life or death, <br> love as colored glass&nbsp; </i> ♫

505
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,418
Greetings, King Bailing.

506
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:03,460
Teng She, seems like you've been leading a carefree life.

507
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,592
I don't dare to do so.

508
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:07,139
You don't dare to do so?

509
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:09,348
You came to the mortal realm without permission.

510
00:37:09,348 --> 00:37:11,519
And now you're turning against the heavens.

511
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,501
- This is bad. <br> - You're too daring for your own good.

512
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,843
My King, please listen to my explanation.

513
00:37:19,844 --> 00:37:21,994
No need for that.

514
00:37:21,994 --> 00:37:25,561
I'll give you one day to return to the heavens.

515
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:28,730
If not, I'll strip you of your powers and charge you with treason.

516
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,639
The longer you delay this,

517
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,720
the heavier the punishment your servants will get.

518
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,797
You better know what's good for you.

519
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,159
So delicious.

520
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:50,263
Why are you acting so nice today? You even prepared food for me.

521
00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:53,184
I bought the buns from a distant town.

522
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,360
Save your breath. Just eat.

523
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,073
Just tell me what's going on.

524
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,953
Xuanji, please think of a way to terminate our contract.

525
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:10,040
Or just grant me permission to leave forever.

526
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,901
I'm going to leave.

527
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,020
You don't have a fever. Why are you speaking nonsense?

528
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,100
Stop pretending.

529
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,440
Didn't you say that you'd allow me to leave whenever I wanted to?

530
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,840
But, Teng She, why are you leaving right now?

531
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,608
Did I make you upset?

532
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,121
Is it because there is no delicious food here?

533
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:36,661
Or is it because there are no fights over here?

534
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:38,317
I'm a heavenly officer.

535
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:41,398
I can leave whenever I feel like it!

536
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,020
I don't want to be your spirit beast anymore.

537
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,913
You're lying. We've been through thick and thin together,

538
00:38:47,914 --> 00:38:49,332
and you didn't say you wanted to leave.

539
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:51,584
Why are you...

540
00:38:51,584 --> 00:38:54,860
Is it because you know why the heavens are pursuing me?

541
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,741
I don't know!

542
00:38:56,741 --> 00:39:00,032
What? You think I'm happy when I'm with you?

543
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:03,179
I have to obey your command! They even said I'm a spirit beast!

544
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,276
You recalled me in front of the Four Sacred Beasts!

545
00:39:06,276 --> 00:39:08,357
Have you ever thought of my feelings? I have my own pride, you know?

546
00:39:08,357 --> 00:39:10,676
I've had enough!

547
00:39:10,676 --> 00:39:13,236
Just tell me the reason you're upset with me!

548
00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:16,956
Why are you trying to terminate our contract? It's upsetting, you know?

549
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,900
You're a heartless person in the first place. Why would you be upset?

550
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,729
- You– <br> - I don't want to be your spirit beast.

551
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,500
- You better let me leave! <br> - You–

552
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,060
Did you forget how we made our pact?

553
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,412
So what if you defeat me?

554
00:39:36,413 --> 00:39:37,999
I'm unhappy now!

555
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,460
You shouldn't force me to be your spirit beast!

556
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,342
If you're unhappy with me, just turn me into ashes!

557
00:39:43,343 --> 00:39:45,064
If not, you better let me leave!

558
00:39:45,064 --> 00:39:47,068
You can die alone if you want to!

559
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:49,143
It was hard for me to obtain this position.

560
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:51,484
I don't want to die with you!

561
00:39:51,484 --> 00:39:53,319
Fine! You want to leave?

562
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,746
Leave now! I grant you my permission!

563
00:39:55,747 --> 00:39:57,708
No matter what happens to me in the future,

564
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:59,840
it has nothing to do with you!

565
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,053
Great! I'm free now!

566
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,407
By the way, stinky woman, I need to tell you one last thing.

567
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,200
You mustn't unseal the Crystal Lamp.

568
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,659
You'll regret it.

569
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:16,351
It won't matter to you since you're leaving anyway!

570
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:17,824
You!

571
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,014
That's right. Both of us are stubborn.

572
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:29,224
My goodness.

573
00:40:29,224 --> 00:40:31,879
- This is the end. <br> - Leave now!

574
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,113
I will never acknowledge you even if you return!

575
00:40:35,113 --> 00:40:36,620
Fine.

576
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,269
We'll go on our separate paths.

577
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,330
That little snake belonged to the heavens in the first place.

578
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:11,904
If he stays, he'll make it difficult for everyone.

579
00:41:11,904 --> 00:41:15,060
It's the best choice for him to leave now.

580
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,513
I know that. I just can't bear to part with him.

581
00:41:18,513 --> 00:41:21,447
Enough already. You're making me uncomfortable with this.

582
00:41:21,448 --> 00:41:24,308
We need to discuss our next plan.

583
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,762
Wu Zhiqi, do you know the reason the heavens are pursuing me?

584
00:41:32,762 --> 00:41:34,471
You went to the heavens before.

585
00:41:34,471 --> 00:41:37,516
Do you know why?

586
00:41:37,516 --> 00:41:42,879
I think it may be connected to your meeting with King Asura.

587
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,695
The time when you stole the Juntain Hoop and Cehai Hook and lured me to the Demon Citadel?

588
00:41:45,695 --> 00:41:47,385
Yes.

589
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,940
<i>God of War, you murdered me.</i>

590
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,579
<i>With my last breath, I leave you a huge gift!</i>

591
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:01,297
<i>You better take a good look at the secrets hidden within King Bailing's hall!</i>

592
00:42:01,297 --> 00:42:05,628
<i>You deserved all of this!</i>

593
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:08,867
About the paintings within Demon Citadel,

594
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:10,831
I don't remember them.

595
00:42:10,832 --> 00:42:13,970
I didn't see them when I went to Demon Citadel last time.

596
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,200
What exactly is King Bailing hiding?

597
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:20,100
Why did the God of War pursue him after she returned from Demon Citadel?

598
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,555
While I was in the Mirror of Origin,

599
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:26,096
I think I saw an argument between the God of War and King Bailing.

600
00:42:26,096 --> 00:42:27,799
She suffered a huge injustice.

601
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,291
She said the heavens used her,

602
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:32,153
and she wanted to destroy the heavens.

603
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:34,303
After that, she was sent to the Altar of Banishment.

604
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:38,021
But I couldn't see the entire situation clearly.

605
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:43,166
I think the heavens are hiding secrets about the God of War.

606
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:50,039
I think all of them are connected to the Crystal Lamp and the Devil Star.

607
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,310
You see, the heavens didn't pursue you for so many years,

608
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:57,940
but after the attack on the Shaoyang Sect, after the Crystal Lamp was disturbed,

609
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,980
they hurt Little Fox and took back Liu Yihuan's celestial eye.

610
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,179
Now, they send the Four Sacred Beasts after you.

611
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:06,359
I think all of them are connected somehow.

612
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:10,205
I won't offend them if they don't offend me.

613
00:43:10,205 --> 00:43:14,400
Seems like I need to get to the bottom of this.

614
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,179
And I need to unseal the Crystal Lamp, no matter what.

615
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,894
That's the only way I can save Sifeng.

616
00:43:18,894 --> 00:43:21,257
Have you decided?

617
00:43:21,257 --> 00:43:24,519
Wu Zhiqi, you must help me once I return to Shaoyang.

618
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,958
Don't worry. I'm glad to be of assistance.

619
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,018
Teng She is gone.

620
00:43:36,018 --> 00:43:37,492
If you can't get over him...

621
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:40,056
It's fine. He's heartless.

622
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:43,437
It's better for him to stay in the heavens.

623
00:43:45,734 --> 00:43:50,779
Sifeng, we can ask for my father's permission once we return to Shaoyang,

624
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:53,354
and we can be together forever after that.

625
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:02,319
Xuanji, listen to me.

626
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,620
In my current state, I'm afraid that

627
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,840
I will leave you soon,

628
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:13,720
and it may ruin your future.

629
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,400
Sifeng, we've been through so many ordeals.

630
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,840
Don't you understand?

631
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,260
I've recovered my six senses.

632
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,831
I've thought it through.

633
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:32,517
I will only be happy if I stay with you.

634
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,000
Are you going to meet your father like this?

635
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,659
Do I look ugly?

636
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,182
I've spent a long time dolling myself up, you know?

637
00:44:52,183 --> 00:44:54,450
Take out your accessories.

638
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,503
Sifeng, I want you to draw my eyebrows every day

639
00:45:18,522 --> 00:45:21,362
after we get married.

640
00:45:27,163 --> 00:45:28,567
Okay.

641
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:31,148
I'll draw them for you every day.

642
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,760
<i>Sifeng, you even know how to draw eyebrows?</i>

643
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,629
<i>This is my first time drawing them for others.</i>

644
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:03,885
<i>I'm not an expert yet.</i>

645
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:06,980
<i>But I'll improve gradually.</i>

646
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,364
<i>- Don't move. <br> - It's itchy.</i>

647
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:10,564
<i>It'll end up badly if you move.</i>

648
00:46:10,564 --> 00:46:12,354
<i>I'm almost done.</i>

649
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,732
<i>Sifeng, my father always told me this when I was young,</i>

650
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:32,172
<i>he drew my mother's eyebrows for her when I was young.</i>

651
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,474
<i>It's different for your father and mother.</i>

652
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,451
Young Master Yi, where are you going?

653
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:06,401
I have something to attend to.

654
00:47:06,401 --> 00:47:08,155
I need to leave.

655
00:47:08,155 --> 00:47:10,361
Will you return?

656
00:47:10,361 --> 00:47:12,352
No.

657
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:24,890
