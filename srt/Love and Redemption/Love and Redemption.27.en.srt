<i>I don't know any Treasure Cove.</i>

<i>Listen! Even if you spend your entire life drawing my portraits,</i>

195
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,284
<i>I will never fancy you.</i>

196
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,460
<i>Senior, you only used half of your strength.</i>

197
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,052
<i>Are you looking down on me?</i>

198
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:26,778
<i>You lost.</i>

199
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,170
<i>Is the fight the only thing on your mind?</i>

200
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,438
<i>Yes.</i>

201
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,498
<i>I will become the sect leader.</i>

202
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:42,726
<i>But I've never wanted to steal that position from you.</i>

203

Why?

Why does it end like this every time?

206
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,021
Don't tell me this tragic end is our fate?

207

00:32:51,332 --> 00:32:53,565
<i>It's nearby.</i>

312
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:55,719
<i>I'm sure I can find Xuanji around here.</i>

313
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,260
God of War.

314
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,960
I'll have a good fight with you.

315
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,526
Which scoundrel is...

316
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,718
What is this?

317
00:33:42,718 --> 00:33:45,239
You stink!

318
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,080
You stole my Star Compass. Where are you trying to go?

319
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,659
Green Dragon, you shouldn't malign me.

320
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:58,579
I lost the Dingkun Sword last time because of your interruption!

321
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:01,219
And now, I've lost the armor as well.

322
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:03,650
The God of War will awaken soon. It's a huge matter.

323
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,460
You can't afford to bear responsibility for this!

324
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,524
Armor?

325
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,538
- Isn't it right here? <br> - Are you blind?

326
00:34:11,538 --> 00:34:13,171
You better...

327
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,576
It wasn't there just now.

328
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,259
I don't care. It's such a big matter.

329
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:28,578
I need to go and check it out.

330
00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:30,874
You can't go.

331
00:34:30,874 --> 00:34:32,138
Why?

332
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:36,000
The God of War will awaken soon. Who are you to stop me?

333
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,379
I'm stopping you under King Bailing's order.

334
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:41,079
He ordered me to keep an eye on you,

335
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,538
and stop you from involving yourself with the God of War.

336
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:47,280
You better follow me back.

337
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,608
I don't believe you, and you'll never control me.

338
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,019
Sifeng!

339
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:09,299
- Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng!

340
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:11,919
- Sifeng, please wake up! <br> - Xuanji!

341
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,319
Xuanji!

342
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,810
Xuanji!

343
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:18,010
Ting Nu, what's going on? When will they wake up?

344
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:20,719
Their primordial spirits have returned to their bodies.

345
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,306
They are in shock due to the impact of the explosion.

346
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:26,134
They'll be fine after some rest.

347
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,060
<i>Her awakening isn't complete.</i>

348
00:35:34,061 --> 00:35:36,065
<i>What will happen to Yu'er?</i>

349
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,439
What's Liu Yihuan doing?

350
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,599
He actually used his celestial eye to interrupt her awakening?

351
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,374
My Lord, since we know the identity of the God of War now,

352
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:51,559
why don't you let me capture Chu Xuanji right now?

353
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,642
When she awakens her power, you may absorb her powers

354
00:35:54,643 --> 00:35:56,959
by using the Soul Furnace,

355
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,958
and everything will go according to your plan.

356
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,978
Isn't that for the best?

357
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,606
Chu Xuanji is very stubborn.

358
00:36:05,606 --> 00:36:08,059
If we capture her by force, she may respond violently

359
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:10,539
and the God of War may never complete her awakening.

360
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:13,433
If so, her powers will reduce drastically.

361
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:15,853
I can't take this risk.

362
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:22,140
I do have a way to stimulate her to awaken her powers.

363
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,260
Tell Liu Yihuan that

364
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,853
if he wants his daughter to stay alive,

365
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:29,573
he must follow my orders.

366
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,869
Yes.

367
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,660
Xuanji, you're awake?

368
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,380
I... You...

369
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,723
Xuanji.

370
00:37:17,414 --> 00:37:19,099
All of you are here?

371
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:21,565
- This is great. <br> - Of course, we're here.

372
00:37:21,565 --> 00:37:23,119
Here.

373
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,921
Wipe your face.

374
00:37:31,413 --> 00:37:32,742
What's wrong?

375
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:36,139
It's hot.

376
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:39,299
It's hot? Did you recover your six senses? This is great!

377
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,379
If it's too hot, I'll cool it down for you.

378
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:43,800
It's fine. It's not that hot.

379
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,573
I feel warm and comfortable.

380
00:37:48,573 --> 00:37:49,895
Xuanji,

381
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,120
what exactly did you see in that mirror?

382
00:38:01,973 --> 00:38:04,200
I saw my past.

383
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,900
Were you the God of War in the past?

384
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,779
Xuanji is the God of War indeed.

385
00:38:13,779 --> 00:38:17,798
My junior, who was talentless before, is actually someone that great?

386
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:20,239
No wonder the Demon Whip was destroyed.

387
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,179
I thought it was the power of the Dingkun Sword.

388
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:23,989
I didn't expect it to be Xuanji's power.

389
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:25,419
There's more to that!

390
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:29,019
Gudiao on Mount Lutai, Aoyin on Mount Haiwan,

391
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:31,340
and the Samadhi Fire on Mount Gao as well.

392
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,739
I was worried for nothing. I thought she was possessed or something.

393
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:38,700
I wouldn't need to worry if I knew that she was the reincarnation of God of War.

394
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,490
Xuanji, tell us.

395
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,190
How does it feel to be the God of War?

396
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,140
It must've been great, right?

397
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,093
I hate it very much.

398
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:52,533
I hate the God of War.

399
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,419
I hate my past.

400
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,119
I hate the heavens.

401
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,719
I hate everything inside the mirror.

402
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:06,006
I only see blood, wars, and lies.

403
00:39:06,006 --> 00:39:08,179
Everything else was cold.

404
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,939
They cheated you?

405
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,580
Are you referring to the heavens?

406
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,939
I don't know what happened, either.

407
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:17,680
I just...

408
00:39:18,993 --> 00:39:23,300
I just saw that I was chained,

409
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,694
and I was suffering so much.

410
00:39:27,694 --> 00:39:30,779
But none of them wanted to listen to me.

411
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:33,860
All of them wanted me to leave.

412
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,099
The human realm is better.

413
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:41,819
Here, I have you.

414
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:43,299
You are there for me.

415
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:46,780
I feel alive down here.

416
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,179
Xuanji, it's over now.

417
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:49,879
It's all in the past.

418
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,479
But I didn't expect my junior to be the God of War.

419
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,659
If people knew about this, Shaoyang Sect would become glorious.

420
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,179
We mustn't tell anyone about this.

421
00:39:57,179 --> 00:39:59,139
Tianxu Hall is trying to revive the Devil Star,

422
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:02,159
and the nemesis of the Devil Star is the God of War.

423
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,160
We should keep quiet so that Tianxu Hall won't try to target her.

424
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,459
That's right. I'm so dumb.

425
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:10,819
We need to keep this a secret.

426
00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:14,619
Xuanji, did you see Sifeng in the mirror?

427
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:18,679
That's right. Sifeng said all his nine tribulations were related to you.

428
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:21,895
His nine tribulations?

429
00:40:21,895 --> 00:40:24,752
I didn't see any tribulations.

430
00:40:24,752 --> 00:40:27,993
I only saw what happened to me in the heavens.

431
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,260
Oh my.

432
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,859
The Mirror of Origin reflects the past that we couldn't let go of.

433
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:38,019
Little Phoenix saw you because he couldn't let go of you.

434
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,899
You didn't see him?

435
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:43,060
That means he's not inside your heart.

436
00:40:44,754 --> 00:40:47,539
I was blind. I even wanted to help you two be together.

437
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:50,499
Now, I think you should stay far away from him.

438
00:40:50,499 --> 00:40:52,419
No! Eldest Brother Liu, that's not the case!

439
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:54,979
What exactly happened in the mirror?

440
00:40:54,979 --> 00:40:56,899
How would we know what's going on inside the mirror?

441
00:40:56,899 --> 00:41:00,939
We only saw Little Phoenix coughing blood because he was too depressed.

442
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:02,499
It's unlucky if he encounters this once.

443
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:04,339
Three times? Maybe he's trying to atone for his sins.

444
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,318
But he died nine times because of you.

445
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,659
I think you are just not meant for each other.

446
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:13,006
I beg you, show him some mercy this time.

447
00:41:13,006 --> 00:41:14,963
Just let him off.

448
00:41:19,315 --> 00:41:20,799
Xuanji?

449
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,860
Xuanji, what's wrong?

450
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,053
I don't know what's going on, either.

451
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:26,913
I just...

452
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,472
I feel bad when I hear about Sifeng's suffering.

453
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:34,813
I feel like I can't breathe.

454
00:41:34,813 --> 00:41:36,459
You can't breathe?

455
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:38,100
Seems like you do have your six senses back.

456
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,779
You know how to care for people now.

457
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:41,099
Oh, right.

458
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,838
Eldest Brother Liu, where's Sifeng?

459
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:45,259
Where's Sifeng?

460
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:46,819
I don't know.

461
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:49,116
Maybe he left because he was too sad.

462
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,950
- Xuanji! <br> - Xuanji!

463
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:56,059
Why did you say those things?

464
00:41:56,059 --> 00:41:57,899
I'm telling the truth.

465
00:41:57,899 --> 00:42:00,299
Don't you know Little Phoenix well enough?

466
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:04,299
He won't tell anyone about his suffering and pain.

467
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:09,380
If I don't tell her, how would she care for him?

468
00:42:30,406 --> 00:42:34,941
<i>In this life, we'll never meet again.</i>

469
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:37,117
<i>Never meet again?</i>

470
00:42:37,117 --> 00:42:39,572
<i>Even if you spend your entire life drawing my portraits,</i>

471
00:42:39,572 --> 00:42:41,831
<i>I will never fancy you.</i>

472
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,910
