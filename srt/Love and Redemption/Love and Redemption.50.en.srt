Where's the Black Feather?

19
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,340
What's going on? Did someone take it?

20
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,700
Impossible, no one knows I was here.

21
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,340
Wu Zhiqi may have destroyed this place,

22
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,680
but the demonic aura is still strong.

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,380
Perhaps it has already been consumed.

24
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,700

The demonic aura here is still too much for you.

28
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,760
Let's leave now. I'll search for the feather for you.

We won't be able to search everywhere in a day or two.

I'm staying here to search for it.

Fine, but promise me this.

33
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,425
You must not stay here long.

34
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:25,940
You must leave here every seven minutes.

35
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,780
After all, you need to stay alive to meet Sifeng, right?

36
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,880
Teng She, ask them.

37
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,700
Hello, sorry for disturbing you.

38
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,900
- Have you seen him before? <br> - No.

39
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,920
Teng She, do you see a black crow tailing us?

40
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,380
What black crow? Can we eat it?

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,679
Your Highness,

44
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,660
the God of War is in the mortal world,

45
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,720
searching for the Rose Gold Bird, Yu Sifeng.

46
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,460
She's still entangled with that demon.

47
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,060
Looks like I have no more need to keep her.

48
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,940
Pass my order.

49
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,300
All celestial soldiers and knights

50
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,519
shall bring the God of War and her associates here once they are seen.

52

Do not spare Teng She as well.

53
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,820
Your Highness, as far as I'm concerned,

54
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,420
Teng She was forcibly captured by the God of War and made him her spirit beast.

55
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,399
He didn't want to do this. He was forced.

56
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:11,759
Please investigate this.

57
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,380
I shall hear no more.

58
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,300
Four Mythical Beasts, proceed to the mortal world now

59
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,960
to arrest the God of War and her associates.

60
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,820
Yes, Your Highness.

61
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,239
We've been searching for ages, and still no trace of him.

62
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,744
If it weren't for us trying not to alarm the heavens,

63
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,539
I'd have summoned the Lord of Earth and gotten our answers.

64
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:43,580
Wu Zhiqi gave us the Perfect Fruit so we can mask our presence.

65
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,200
Will the heavens really give us trouble?

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,779
What's with you and your curiosity?

67
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:51,560
Why so many questions?

68
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,199
But when I was destroying the Crystal Lamp in the secret ground,

69
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,040
I think I heard the Devil Star talking with King Bailing.

70
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,080
I think King Bailing must have done something wrong.

71
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,364
Don't spout nonsense.

72
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:06,340
Out of all the deities, I respect King Bailing the most.

73
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,220
Anyway, Wu Zhiqi gave you the Perfect Fruit,

74
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,524
so the heavens won't find you.

75

Stop thinking so much.

Can't you wait for him?

124
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,340
Young Master Yi's whereabouts are mysterious.

We're going broke at this rate.

I know you're anticipating his return,

but no one knows if that mysterious man will ever turn up.

135
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,940
Why don't we let the masters here take a look first?

136
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,380
Didn't you say the inn is closed?

137
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,340
Why is there a room still alight?

138
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,539
Hush! That's the room with the demon.

139
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:08,719
Whenever the sun sets every day,

140

you can see candlelight from the room.

You can even hear someone cry when you get near.

I didn't know better back then, so I let our guests stay there.

143

Then, every guest who had stayed in the room all disappeared.

144
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,060
Only then did I know there's something fishy inside.

145
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,860
Actually, we have a resident demon slayer here named Young Master Yi.

146
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,359
But only a few have ever managed to contact him.

147
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,340
That's why we put up that notice to hire a demon slayer.

148
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,399

Teng She...

155
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,079
do you even need me to handle that puny demon?

160
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,040
It'll be done before your tea goes cold.

161
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,239
Aren't you following her?

162
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,399
Tea, please. Hurry up.

163
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
You–

164
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,940
The lights are out! They're out!

165
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,240
Is she doing fine?

166
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,180
Oh, dear! That young lady is going to get killed!

167
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,900
Please take a look!

168
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,280
Is my tea done?

169
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,180
Faster!

170
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,380
Did that demon eat the young lady?

171
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,359
We still don't know who's eating whom.

172
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,560
I'm starving.

173
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,940
Miss, are you okay?

174
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,420
Here you go.

175
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,060
A weasel spirit.

176
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,679
Weasel?

177
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,479
It said you splashed it with hot oil three months ago.

178
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,940
That's why it's back for revenge.

179
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,960
But we can't spare it since it killed so many people.

180
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Three months ago, I did see an animal eating our chickens,

181
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,199
so I splashed hot oil on it.

182
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,980
So this is it.

183
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,660
You two look so young,

184
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,540
but you're rather formidable.

185
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,740
Thank you so much.

186
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,580
Ma'am, do you want the weasel's carcass?

187
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,900
No, no.

188
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,999
You like eating this, don't you?

189
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,120
You can grill it.

190
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,653
If you don't mind, please stay here for the night.

191
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:21,879
Of course, we don't mind.

192
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,200
Here, help me grill this.

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,680
By the way, ma'am, I have a favor to ask.

194
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,580
You've been staying here for so many years.

195
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,740
Have you seen anyone like this?

196
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,820
Well, let me see.

197
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,246
He does look familiar.

198
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:42,300
Really?

199
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,260
But I've had so many guests in my inn.

200
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,960
I can't really remember.

201
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,580
<i>[West Valley Inn]</i>

202
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,259
<i>Sifeng, where are you?</i>

203
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,799
I say, Liu Yihuan is dubious.

204
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,759
We've already searched all over the southern region for a whole year,

205
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,420
but there's still no sign of him.

206
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,420
Could it be that he doesn't want you to find Sifeng,

207
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,160
so he pointed us in the wrong direction?

208
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,540
No.

209
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,960
That's not how Eldest Brother Liu is.

210
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,400
Perhaps for the past year,

211
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,460
Sifeng has been migrating around.

212
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,060
Fine.

213
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,700
Anyway, we're about to reach the southernmost region.

214
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,920
So where should we go next?

215
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,520
I heard Sifeng say that

216
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,520
the Rose Gold Birds used to live in the west.

217
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,660
Let's head west tomorrow.

218
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,250
<i>[West Valley]</i>

219
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:37,960
Young Master Yi, you're finally here.

220
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,580
I saw your memo.

221
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,620
Well?

222
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,420
Well? Did someone slay the demon?

223
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,660
Yes,

224
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,540
but it's just a random girl from nowhere.

225
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,220
We're still unsure about her skills.

226
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,740
Why don't you take a look, Young Master Yi?

227
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,639
No need. The demon is gone.

228
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,980
Now that you're finally here, I can't make you come for nothing.

229
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,440
Why don't you stay here for dinner?

230
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,140
No need.

231
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,180
Young Master Yi!

232
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,340
Teng She.

233
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,280
Let's buy some rations for our journey.

234
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,600
What do you want to eat?

235
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,600
Anything delicious will do.

236
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,979
- It's Sanqing tea. <br> - Sanqing tea? What's that?

237
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,740
It's made from morning dew, pine nuts, and Buddha's hands.

238
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,620
Sifeng drinks that every day.

239
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,400
Sifeng is here!

240
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,600
Sifeng!

Who are you?

256
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,079
I just flew up to get a good view.

257
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,460
I think you're mistaken.

258
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,499
Sifeng isn't here.

259
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:19,220
Impossible! I'm sure I saw Sifeng. I can't be wrong.

260
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,900
I'm not leaving. I'm staying here to look for Sifeng.

261
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,560
<i>[West Valley Inn]</i>

262
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,020
Masters, can you pay a visit to Huangdi Town?

263
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,999
Our livestock has been dying mysteriously.

264
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,780
I'm afraid it's the work of the demons.

265
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,060
We'll go there in a few days' time.

266
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,780
How much money do you need?

267
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,940
Forget about money.

268
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,080
We just want to look for someone.

269
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,900
Please ask the townsfolk if they have seen this man.

270
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,800
I'll ask them.

271
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,500
Masters, please take a look at my place.

272
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,220
I think it's haunted.

273
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,940
What's with you?

274
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,479
I thought you'd ask Young Master Yi for help when it comes to demons.

275
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,060
Why are you asking them for help?

276
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,460
Have you forgotten all about Young Master Yi?

277
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,427
We'd love to ask him for help, too, but he's so mysterious and elusive.

278
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:23,620
Whenever we need his help,

279
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,180
we can only leave a letter in the town's mailbox,

280
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,839
and we still won't get any news from him.

281
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,260
We just can't find him.

282
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,679
<i>That's right.</i>

283
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,060
We can't help it.

284
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,799
When are you two leaving?

285
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,399
You've been here for over a month.

286
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,599
Aren't you looking for someone?

287
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,160
You should get moving.

288
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,144
What's wrong?

289
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:50,780
Do you think that we're stealing your crush's business?

290
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,359
You're just a bunch of amateurs.

291
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,079
When Young Master Yi is back, you'll go out of business.

292
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,980
A'Lan, don't argue with our guests.

293
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,160
My osmanthus wine is about to mature.

294
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,800
Go give a jar to Young Master Yi.

295
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,160
Sure.

296
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,060
You look so happy at the mention of Young Master Yi.

297
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,280
Your crush only appears once in a blue moon.

298
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,220
Is he a nutcase like they say?

299
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,460
None of your business.

300
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,180
He's a fine example of a man.

301
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,060
He's principled, stern, and capable.

302
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,060
Besides, he may be cold towards everyone,

303
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,180
but maybe not so towards his wife.

304
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,440
He's my type.

305
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,399
Does he have a wife?

306
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,440
No, but he will get one soon.

307
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,880
Are you talking about yourself?

308
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,959
Actually, he does fancy me a bit.

309
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,319
I fancy him, too.

310
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,079
If he's willing to marry me, of course I'll be his wife.

311
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,980
I can even marry him tomorrow.

312
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,479
That's why I'm making this clear.

313
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,180
Don't you take advantage of Young Master Yi.

314
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,720
Otherwise, I won't let you off.

315
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
She said she won't let us off.

316
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,520
This girl...

317
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,260
Sorry for making you witness a farce.

318
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,739
How is that a farce?

319
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,120
I'm envious of her, in fact.

320
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,839
<i>Sifeng, what color is this?</i>

321
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,140
<i>It's a light-blue hydrangea.</i>

322
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,560
<i>So this is blue. How pretty.</i>

323
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,759
<i>I love blue the most.</i>

324
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,560
<i>So you've decided to like blue.</i>

325
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,360
<i>I've always liked it.</i>

326
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,520
What are you doing here?

327
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,099
A'Lan, here's a question.

328
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:51,180
Is that the road to Old Li's house in Huangdi Town?

329
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,120
Why should I tell you?

330
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,299
Fine, you don't have to tell me. I'll just follow you.

331
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:59,160
I know you're looking for Young Master Yi.

332
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:03,012
It's that way, just follow the path down.

333
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,439
Does Young Master Yi live nearby?

334
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,140
Why are you looking for his house?

335
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,340
You know we've been searching for someone.

336
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,580
I want to see if Young Master Yi might know anything.

337
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,059
No need, he hates strangers.

338
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:19,299
Besides, all he does is forage for herbs.

339
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:20,720
He doesn't like socializing.

340
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,900
He won't know the person you're looking for.

341
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,960
You should go now.

342
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Move!

343
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,560
Young Master Yi.

344
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,420
Young Master Yi, I've brought you some wine.

345
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,559
No rewards come without merit. How can I take your wine for free?

346
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,820
What merit? I don't care.

347
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,320
I just want to give you some wine.

348
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,620
Take it back.

349
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,860
No.

350
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,739
You've taught me so much about medicine and spells.

351
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:18,459
I've never paid you.

352
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:21,800
Take this wine as payment, please?

353
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,240
Young Master Yi, listen.

354
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,570
Lately, there are two wandering cultivators in town.

355
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:36,279
They're annoying. They just won't leave now,

356
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,460
and everyone's been seeking their help instead of yours.

357
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,420
They're stealing your business.

358
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,279
You should show them a thing or two.

359
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,980
Let them know you came here first.

360
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,140
Since someone is doing my business, that saves me a lot of trouble.

361
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,860
What if you go out of business?

362
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,999
It's fine.

363
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,020
I'm satisfied with a simple life.

364
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,040
Let them be.

365
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,240
It's true that you can fend for yourself now,

366
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,153
but what if you have a family in the future?

367
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,660
It's fine, though.

368
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,620
Even if you don't have a penny to your name, I'll take care of you.

369
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,980
Young Master Yi!

370
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,639
I've finally found you.

371
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,460
Uncle, what brought you here?

372
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,900
I've heard you mention this place.

373
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,260
This is my uncle.

374
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,900
He lives in the neighboring Huanglong Town.

375
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,060
Young Master Yi, our town is in trouble.

376
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,020
I'm here to ask for your help.

377
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,020
This is what happened.

378
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,060
Lately, every wedding in town will become a funeral the day after.

379
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,420
Newlyweds have been dying from mysterious circumstances.

380
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:55,660
I wonder what demon has been targeting newlyweds.

381
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,140
Last night, another couple died.

382
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,159
Now, my son is over 30 years old, and he's finally found a wife,

383
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,279
but we have to delay his wedding.

384
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,120
If he doesn't get married soon, the bride's family is going to cancel it.

385
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,780
That's why we're asking for your help, Young Master Yi.

386
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,720
Please slay the demon for us, Young Master Yi.

387
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,260
There are two new demon slayers in Xigu Town lately.

388
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,420
Since they're a man and a woman, they can act as newlyweds.

389
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,320
They're more suitable for this job.

390
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,040
You should look for them.

391
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,660
It's not that I don't trust them,

392
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,859
but we've hired many demon slayers and monks,

393
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:33,099
and they've all been kidnapped by the demon, too.

394
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:34,959
None of them have returned yet.

395
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,900
The demon is too strong.

396
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,100
Young Master Yi, take me along.

397
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,099
We can act as newlyweds, too.

398
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:43,860
Since you've been teaching me, I can help you, too.

399
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,339
No, this demon is too vicious.

400
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:49,920
You're no match for him.

401
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,619
That demon is so strong, and those cultivators are just amateurs.

402
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,859
If we let them go, they might just die.

403
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:01,319
That's right, Young Master Yi. Please help us.

404
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:05,940
Our town's prospective couples are all counting on you.

405
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,040
If that's the case, I shall go there.

406
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,700
Sir, hold the wedding as planned.

407
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,099
A'Lan, sorry to bother you.

408
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,600
I need you to act as my bride tomorrow.

409
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,060
It's not a bother.

410
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,660
I don't mind even if it's for real.

411
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,660
I have nothing valuable on me.

412
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,820
Please take this to buy a pair of wedding attire.

413
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,380
You can use the rest for the banquet.

414
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,760
He approached me instead of someone else.

415
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,460
And he gave me such a huge luminous pearl.

416
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,540
That means he does fancy me, right?

417
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,380
Once we go through the ceremony,

418
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,699
I'll get my uncle to propose for real.

419
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:09,379
I'm sure Young Master Yi won't reject.

420
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:13,780
A'Lan! Aren't you going to serve the guests?

421
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,400
What are you grinning at?

422
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,260
Boss, I'm marrying Young Master Yi!

423
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,380
What nonsense is that?

424
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,980
It's true, I'm going to be his bride tomorrow.

425
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,660
By then, I'll be the envy of the town.

426
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,106
I don't think you're sick.

427
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:33,392
Miss A'Lan, here are your wedding robes.

428
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:34,964
- Put them here. <br> - Sure.

429
00:26:34,964 --> 00:26:36,910
Boss, I'm taking two days off.

430
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,490
I'm going to get married. I won't be back for the next two days.

431
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,900
Please keep this luminous pearl for me.

432
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,360
Young Master Yi gave me this as a token of our love.

433
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,120
I'm going to get married.

434
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,024
A'Lan!

435
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:54,225
What's wrong with that stupid girl?

436
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,539
What now?

437
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,600
No one has seen Sifeng.

438
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,364
I say, you must be mistaken.

439
00:27:06,365 --> 00:27:07,999
I'm sure he wasn't Sifeng.

440
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:11,550
Impossible, I can't be wrong. He is Sifeng.

441
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,460
Miss Chu.

442
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,260
I know you're knowledgeable.

443
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,459
Can you help me and see if this thing is worth much?

444
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:23,000
How much money can I get from it?

445
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,980
Isn't this a luminous pearl from Lize Palace?

446
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,169
Look carefully.

447
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,699
I've seen this before. I saw it on Sifeng.

448
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:37,240
Ma'am, where did you get this?

449
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,040
Young Master Yi gave A'Lan this as a token of their love.

450
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,260
- Well, is it worth much? <br> - Young Master Yi?

451
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,020
Or was A'Lan scammed?

452
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,420
Where are they?

453
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,299
A'Lan was rambling about marrying Young Master Yi.

454
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:51,059
I don't know what's going on, too.

455
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,119
I heard that man is sickly.

456
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,170
I don't know what she sees in him, either.

457

00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:51,600
You mindless wench.

482
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,100
Did we ask for your help?

483
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,960
Do you know you've ruined my wedding?

484
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,020
So, you're Young Master Yi.

485
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:10,976
Why are you looking for Young Master Yi?

486
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,739
Sifeng, we've finally found you after searching everywhere.

487
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:17,218
Thank goodness you're here.

488
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:20,280
Otherwise, we'd still be searching.

489
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,416
You've lost weight.

490
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:28,196
No wonder you look different from the portrait.

491
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,460
Is there anything you need, Miss?

492
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:39,620
What are you talking about?

493
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,180
Who is Sifeng?

494
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,160
Young Master Yi, do you know them?

495
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,260
I have never met them.

496
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,490
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

497
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,199
Little Phoenix, she's Xuanji!

498
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:56,480
Should I know this name?

499
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,220
Sifeng, you...

500
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:09,144
Don't you remember me?

501
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:14,716
I came late, after all.

502
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:21,000
Have you eaten the Heartless Pill and forgot all about us?

503
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,080
Then...

504
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,139
Look at this.

505
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,100
This...

506
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,179
You made this lock puzzle.

507
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:35,959
I've read your note inside.

508
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,311
I know you didn't mean to hide the truth from me.

509
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,639
I was wrong to blame you.

510
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,679
And this bell.

511
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,780
We contacted each other with this, Sifeng.

512
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,459
Sifeng, look.

513
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:46,099
Don't you remember?

514
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:48,279
Don't you remember one single bit?

515
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,200
Sifeng.

516
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,660
If my guess is correct,

517
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,880
you're the new demon slayers, are you not?

518
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,060
I don't know why you're showing me these knick-knacks

519
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,880
while rambling nonsense on my wedding.

520
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,360
I'm sure you can see I'm getting married tonight.

521
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,160
I'd like to request you two to not interfere in our ceremony.

522
00:32:12,884 --> 00:32:17,104
If we had any history, Miss,

523
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:19,520
I'd like to tell you this.

524
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,660
All is in the past.

525
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,200
I hope you will not take them to heart.

526
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,580
If you wish to stay for the banquet...

527
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,340
Auntie, please take them to their seats.

528
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,400
If you don't... please leave.

529
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,940
Sifeng, you're crazy!

530
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,199
You've been through so many hardships for this stinky woman.

531
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,239
How can you forget her?

532
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,260
And you're marrying another woman now.

533
00:32:52,432 --> 00:32:53,899
Are you done yet?

534
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:55,879
I know you want to make a quick buck here.

535
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:56,859
That's fine.

536
00:32:56,859 --> 00:32:59,020
But if you disturb our wedding because of this,

537
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,939
don't you think you're too mean?

538
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,499
What do you know? How long have you known him?

539
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:06,139
He's known stinky woman for ten lives, and you?

540
00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:07,820
Ten lives?

541
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,580
More like ten lice.

542
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,900
What are you talking about?

543
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,179
I don't care what you say. I only care about this life.

544
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,419
In this life, Young Master Yi belongs to me.

545
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,120
Right?

546
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,599
Uncle, the auspicious hour is coming. Right?

547
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,405
That's right! You should go now.

548
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:50,266
Don't miss the auspicious hour.

549
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:52,179
<i>Yes, go now.</i>

550
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:53,779
Fine, Sifeng.

551
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:57,880
Let's fight, and you'll remember everything!

552
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,893
Stop that, Teng She.

553
00:34:02,852 --> 00:34:04,752
Actually,

554
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:09,124
if you've really taken the Heartless Pill,

555
00:34:09,124 --> 00:34:12,040
at least you will be safe.

556
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,960
I wanted to find you to stay by your side and ask for your forgiveness.

557
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,740
But...

558
00:34:19,912 --> 00:34:24,260
if you have found someone you love and you're happy now,

559
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,260
then I'm satisfied.

560
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:33,959
Yes.

561
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,920
I am happy now.

562
00:34:37,664 --> 00:34:38,759
We're running out of time.

563
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,980
Please exchange your gifts now, dear newlyweds.

564
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:49,010
♫ <i> Each and every sound is me </i> ♫

565
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:56,280
♫ <i> With all that I am, my love will never reach your silhouette </i> ♫

566
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,350
♫ <i> You don't know where you're going until </i> ♫

567
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,930
♫ <i>You've been heartbroken </i> ♫

568
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:07,460
♫ <i> Concealed feelings deep in one's heart </i> ♫

569
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,459
<i>So, Sifeng, there are so many colors in this world.</i>

570
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:13,600
<i>Which color looks best?</i>

571
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,120
<i>It's red.</i>

572
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,140
<i>That's because a girl looks the prettiest</i>

573
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,260
<i>when she wears her red bridal robe.</i>

574
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,760
<i>You just have to know that</i>

575
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,040
<i>only those who anticipate love can remove this mask.</i>

576
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,860
<i>You have removed it.</i>

577
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,400
<i>I know</i>

578
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,600
<i>you and I are on the same wavelength now.</i>

579
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,460
<i>When we leave here, we'll return to Lize Palace.</i>

580
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,240
<i>We'll get wed in front of my master.</i>

581
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,650
<i>Enter the bridal chamber!</i>

582
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,940
♫ <i> Would there have been less mistakes made </i> ♫

583
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:15,080
♫ <i> Fate is a part of my bone, you are my growing pain </i> ♫

584
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,860
Stinky woman!

585
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:24,250
♫ <i> Growing from inexperience to maturity, <br> how many trials to complete? </i> ♫

586
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,999
Stinky woman! I thought the worst scenario was him forgetting you.

587
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:29,556
No, listen to me.

588
00:36:29,556 --> 00:36:31,400
We've finally found him after going through so much.

589
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,881
We can't let this rest!

590
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:35,740
Stinky woman.

591
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,920
Stinky woman, say something!

592
00:36:41,052 --> 00:36:44,659
This is it. I'm going to knock him out and bring him here!

593
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:48,580
Let's see if he'd still forget you!

594
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,631
Say, you're the God of War after all.

595
00:36:50,632 --> 00:36:52,137
Can't you show him what you're made of?

596
00:36:52,137 --> 00:36:55,797
Who cares? You can just kidnap him first!

597
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,580
I was wrong.

598
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,765
I hurt him again and again.

599
00:36:59,765 --> 00:37:03,560
I thought that no matter what I did, wherever I was,

600
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,720
Sifeng would never leave me.

601
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,883
He would always be there, right behind me.

602
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:12,924
But I was late. He already has a new life,

603
00:37:12,924 --> 00:37:15,840
and I'm not included in it.

604
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,380
He has taken the Heartless Pill,

605
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,460
so he's free from the Lover's Curse now.

606
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,419
At least he's forgotten about the hurtful things I've done to him.

607
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:32,804
That's good, too.

608
00:37:32,804 --> 00:37:34,825
Eldest Brother Liu was right.

609
00:37:34,825 --> 00:37:37,720
That's the best ending for him.

610
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:43,500
Stinky woman, are you out of your mind?

611
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,364
<i>I came late.</i>

612
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,060
<i>Have you eaten the Heartless Pill and forgotten all about us?</i>

613
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,100
<i>You made this lock puzzle.</i>

614
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,020
<i>I've read your note inside.</i>

615
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,380
<i>I know you didn't mean to hide the truth from me.</i>

616
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,539
<i>I was wrong to blame you.</i>

617
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,540
<i>And this bell.</i>

618
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,500
<i>We contacted each other with this, Sifeng.</i>

619
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,979
<i>Sifeng, look.</i>

620
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:18,720
<i>If my guess is correct,</i>

621
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,759
<i>you're the new demon slayers, are you not?</i>

622
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:24,100
<i>I don't know why you're showing me these knick-knacks</i>

623
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,620
<i>while rambling nonsense at my wedding.</i>

624
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,948
<i>If we had any history, Miss,</i>

625
00:38:29,948 --> 00:38:32,540
<i>I'd like to tell you this.</i>

626
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,860
<i>All is in the past.</i>

627
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,340
<i>I hope you will not take them to heart.</i>

628
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,920
<i>I've hurt Xuanji so deeply.</i>

629
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,820
<i>Is she upset, too?</i>

630
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:50,668
<i>Xuanji, this is the only thing I can do.</i>

631
00:38:50,668 --> 00:38:54,194
Young Master Yi. Young Master Yi.

632
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,900
Young Master Yi!

633
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,900
Or... should I call you Sifeng?

634
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,740
Just call me Young Master Yi.

635
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,075
They're your past acquaintances, right?

636
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:16,976
Yes.

637
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:27,928
Then, why did you lie to them that you were getting married?

638
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:34,376
I have some history

639
00:39:35,492 --> 00:39:38,019
that I do not wish to recall or repeat.

640
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:42,160
That's why I wanted them to take my hint and leave.

641
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,440
It has to do with Miss Xuanji, right?

642
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,200
Was she your significant other?

643
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,884
I do not wish to talk about it.

644
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,420
I'm sorry.

645
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,880
I should be the one to apologize.

646
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,280
I dragged you into this mess just now.

647
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,020
Thank you for cooperating with me.

648
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,979
It's fine, Young Master Yi. I'm glad to help you.

649
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:18,480
Even if...

650
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,520
I have to help you forever, I don't mind.

651
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,080
Your hands are cold. Are you fine?

652
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,960
I'm fine.

653
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,820
All that stinky woman did the entire day was cry and starve herself.

654
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,140
I'm famished, too.

655
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,865
Why are there only leftovers here?

656
00:40:57,865 --> 00:41:00,785
This family must be a bunch of misers.

657
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:04,020
Can't they prepare something better for a wedding?

658
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,000
A wedding?

659
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,219
At least they should have something better for the newlyweds.

660
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:11,500
To the bridal chamber!

661
00:41:15,904 --> 00:41:18,504
<i>Yu Sifeng isn't asleep yet.</i>

662
00:41:18,504 --> 00:41:23,020
<i>I think I shouldn't peek on their wedding night.</i>

663
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,959
Young Master Yi, why don't I sleep outside?

664
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:30,739
It's cold outside, and you're frail. You'll catch a cold.

665
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:32,940
Since we're putting on an act, we have to make it look real.

666
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,779
Don't worry, this demon targets newlyweds.

667
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:38,860
I'm sure he holds a deep grudge towards newlyweds.

668
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,379
Local tradition dictates three days of a wedding celebration.

669
00:41:42,379 --> 00:41:45,219
I'm sure the demon will be back within three days.

670
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:48,919
If you sleep outside, it'll be bad if the demon finds us out.

671
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:52,540
You should spend the night here.

672
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,079
Then, why don't I sleep on the floor? You can take the bed.

673
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,260
No need. Rest early.

674
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,585
<i>So, Yu Sifeng, you're not really married.</i>

675
00:42:06,586 --> 00:42:10,224
<i>You're playing me and stinky woman around like two fools.</i>

676
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,354
- Really? Sifeng's not married? <br> - That's right.

677
00:42:14,354 --> 00:42:17,153
Who'd sleep separately on their wedding night?

678
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:18,799
One sleeps on the bed, and the other on the floor.

679
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,100
They're treating each other like strangers.

680
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,120
They've fooled us!

681
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,559
I think they're setting a trap up for some demon.

682
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,760
I'm going to find him.

683
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,780
For what? Steal his business?

684
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,679
- I... <br> - Please don't embarrass us, will you?

685
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,620
But what if he did take the pill, forgot about me,

686
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,120
and married that girl for real?

687
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,620
If you ask me, something fishy is going on.

688
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,979
Think about it! A lady approaches him and cries.

689
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:44,819
Even if he doesn't know her, he would've asked something.

690
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:48,080
But he didn't, isn't that weird?

691
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,060
Well, let me test him, and we'll know.

692
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,520
A'Lan, stay here. Don't go anywhere.

693
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,459
This is bad! We followed the demon all the way here,

694
00:43:18,459 --> 00:43:21,540
but that demon is too strong! He even kidnapped Xuanji!

695
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,360
- Where did they go? <br> - Over there.

696
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,760
She's the God of War.

697
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,380
What kind of demon can kidnap her?

698
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,179
Haven't you forgotten about her?

699
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,860
Why do you remember that she's the God of War?

700
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,779
Stinky woman, come out.

701
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:42,039
Little Phoenix didn't take the Heartless Pill after all.

702
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,920
He's never forgotten about you.

703
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,620
Sifeng!

704
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,780
Sifeng, don't go.

705
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,100
Do you think this is fun?

706
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,619
Sifeng, don't go.

707
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:57,459
I've been searching for ages, and I've finally found you.

708
00:43:57,459 --> 00:44:00,720
Since you wouldn't acknowledge me, I had to do this.

709
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,259
Don't be angry.

710
00:44:02,259 --> 00:44:06,239
Come on... Stinky woman went through a lot just to search for you.

711
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,459
You two can talk it out or even fight it out.

712
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:11,179
Settle your scores once and for all.

713
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:14,080
Stop hiding around.

714
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,939
I've been looking for you for the past year.

715
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:20,300
No one knew where you went.

716
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,480
It was Eldest Brother Liu who said you were in the south.

717
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,020
Why must you search for me?

718
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,619
Ting Nu told me about the Lover's Curse.

719
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:31,139
If you didn't take the Heartless Pill, then how is your health now?

720
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:33,040
Does it hurt?

721
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,600
I'm fine now.

722
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,160
As long as you don't show yourself to me,

723
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,000
I won't die.

724
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,879
Sifeng, I know I was wrong.

725
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,660
You can do anything to me, but don't leave me without a word.

726
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,640
Xuanji, I've never been angry at you.

727
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,480
The past is all but history to me.

728
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,699
I don't believe that.

729
00:44:55,699 --> 00:44:56,960
If you don't care about me,

730
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,760
what do the hydrangeas in front of your house mean?

731
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,739
Hydrangeas are common in Xigu Town.

732
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:05,760
If that confuses you, I shall pull them out.

733
00:45:06,688 --> 00:45:08,899
Sifeng, I do know I was wrong.

734
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:10,659
I've done you wrong.

735
00:45:10,659 --> 00:45:12,379
I regret not trusting you.

736
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:15,500
I was a fool, so please don't go.

737
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,140
If you do feel regret,

738
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,192
please do me a favor.

739
00:45:20,192 --> 00:45:23,720
Tell me. I can do anything for you.

740
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,200
Stay away from me as far as possible.

741
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,620
Young Master Yi, help! Young Master Yi, help!

742
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,280
A'Lan!

743
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,000
Sifeng!

744
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,420
That's a lot of bridal gowns.

745
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,900
This must be the demon's nest.

746
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,820
While killing demons is your clan's duty, you can't kill the innocent.

747
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,680
I didn't mean it. I couldn't see clearly.

748
00:46:55,450 --> 00:47:05,020
