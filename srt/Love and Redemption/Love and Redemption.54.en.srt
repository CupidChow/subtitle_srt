This is the medical book that I've copied.

19

This is for you.

20
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:45,137
Your cultivation is not that advanced yet.

21
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:48,616
When you meet stronger demons, don't force yourself.

22
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:50,137
Be careful.

23
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:57,442
Young Master Yi,

24
00:01:57,442 --> 00:02:02,149
I'm already very grateful to be able to have this memento.

25
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,638
Ever since I first saw him,

26
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:10,961
I already knew that I was not for him.

27
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:16,660
I'm just a half-disciple to him and that's it.

28
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,010
Chu Xuanji,

29
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,799
if both of you are married one day,

30
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:25,879
send me a wedding invitation.

31
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,810
No matter where I am,

32
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,326
I'll go there and congratulate you.

33
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,320
Okay.

34
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:47,693
Young Master Yi, go now.

35
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:51,817
I hope that everything will go smoothly for you from now on.

36
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,204
I'll pray for you here.

37
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,727
Miss A'La, take care of yourself.

38

<i>Greetings, King Bailing.</i>

39
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,329
<i>Guards, detain Teng She in the Sky Prison.</i>

40
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,800
King Bailing, what did I do wrong?

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,370
Why do I have to be detained in Sky Prison?

42
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,840
Look towards your left and right.

43
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,139
The God of War has deep anguish to her that

44
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,677
even 1,000 years can't mellow out.

45
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:41,874
You must have heard about the great bloodshed that happened here back then.

46
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:46,326
Now, when I sent the Four Sacred Beasts to capture her,

47
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:51,300
you foiled my plan and chose to stand by her.

48
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,354
What is it? Are you going to betray the heavens

49
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:59,800
and let her bring great disaster to the heavens again just like before?

50
00:04:01,778 --> 00:04:05,259
I did help her out for a little bit,

51
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:07,539
but I did it for our friendship.

52
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,872
I wasn't trying to revolt against the heavens.

53
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:12,089
Is that so?

54
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,179
You stole the scroll from my palace

55
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:17,560
and went to the human realm to give her the information.

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,962
You foiled my plan to make her destroy the Crystal Lamp.

57
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,224
Does that count as betrayal?

58
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,659
Make the God of War destroy the Crystal Lamp?

59
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:28,580
Is that strange?

60
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,523
Teng She,

61
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:35,459
actually, you had already suspected my identity before this,

62
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,899
but I used the spell of deceit on you.

63
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:40,560
So, you couldn't tell.

64
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,733
So that person is indeed you.

65
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,483
Yes. King Bailing,

66
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:02,139
since you've already spent 20 years with her in the human realm,

67
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,532
you should know that she's kind. She won't attack the heavens.

68
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:08,553
But why can't you spare her?

69
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:12,247
She is kind?

70
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:16,827
Since you've read the scroll, you should know her identity by now.

71
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:21,523
Her kindness has a time limit to it.

72
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:26,203
Her ego and arrogance have never changed.

73
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:29,099
I tried to help and save her,

74
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:33,074
but she's being difficult! All of my efforts have been wasted!

75
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:36,634
It's hard to get rid of her demonic character and anguish.

76
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:40,331
She is destined to bring chaos to the three realms.

77
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:45,579
Now she is even tempted to open the Crystal Lamp.

78
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:50,860
If we spare her again, she'll eventually come for the heavens!

79
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:57,370
I did read the scroll before.

80
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,259
but it's just a broken scroll.

81
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,759
I don't understand why the scroll stated that

82
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,516
the God of War was born from the destruction of the Devil Star.

83
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:08,539
I don't understand why it stated that God of War and the Devil Star are the same.

84
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:11,684
Is the scroll mistaken?

85
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:14,820
You are asking too many questions.

86
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,260
You just need to know that

87
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,848
no matter if it's the Devil Star or the God of War,

88
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:24,760
if they are a threat to the heavens, they'll have to be destroyed.

89
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:29,920
As for you, if you help God of War again,

90
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,520
you'll meet the same fate, too.

91
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:35,613
Green Dragon.

92
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,299
Yes, King Bailing.

93
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:39,639
Take him to the Sky Prison.

94
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,436
Yes, King Bailing.

95
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,054
Chu Xuanji,

96
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:09,978
I know why you are going to Mount Shaoyang.

97
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,092
Since you want to open the Crystal Lamp to destroy the three realms,

98
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:18,745
don't blame me for being so unforgiving.

99
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,595
The Shaoyang Sect is just right ahead of us.

100
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:27,099
I think we demons shouldn't go there.

101
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:29,139
We don't want to ruin another's birthday party.

102
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:33,111
Sifeng, perform well when you go to meet your father-in-law,

103
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:35,940
so that he can marry off his daughter to you without any worries.

104
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,699
Don't worry, Eldest Brother Wu.

105
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:40,683
I'll send you a letter as soon as there's good news.

106
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:43,718
All right, we'll wait for your good news here. Go.

107
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,135
Wu Zhiqi, where are you going?

108
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,779
I have something personal to do.

109
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,579
Don't think that I can't tell.

110
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,459
You were whispering with Xuanji.

111
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,861
You are planning to open the Crystal Lamp, right?

112
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,627
So what if I am.

113
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:10,272
I won't allow you to go.

114
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:13,426
Why do you have to let things get out of hand?

115
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,099
Even if we don't do anything,

116
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:17,171
those deities from the heavens will kill us.

117
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:18,890
When that happens, it'll really be out of our hands.

118
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,060
Just wait for me here.

119
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:23,718
Please help me take care of this little fox.

120
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:25,610
Something big will happen today.

121
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,711
Find a place to hide.

122
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:31,322
Wu Zhiqi!

123
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,338
Senior Xuanji, you are back.

124
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,939
He is...

125
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,162
We are here to celebrate Father's birthday.

126
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:47,699
Senior, let us go in and inform him first.

127
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:50,230
One is your senior and the other one is Shaoyang Sect's savior.

128
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,979
Why do you have to inform him first?

129
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:54,376
- Linglong. <br> - Xuanji.

130
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,990
You are finally back. The party has started.

131
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,979
- I thought you couldn't make it. Let's go. <br> - Sifeng, how are you?

132
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:01,819
- Senior Linglong. <br> - What senior?

133
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:04,920
Without them both, Mount Shaoyang would have been burned to dust.

134
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:07,155
Let's go.

135
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,059
It's good that you came back this time. Now, we have someone to talk to.

136
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:19,430
But Sifeng doesn't look too well.

137
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,722
Maybe he's tired from the long journey.

138
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:25,907
With your power, you won't be this weak even if you fly to the sky.

139
00:09:25,907 --> 00:09:28,288
Did something happen?

140
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,740
Actually, besides celebrating Father's birthday this time,

141
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,786
Sifeng is here to ask Father for my hand.

142
00:09:35,786 --> 00:09:37,487
Really?

143
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,633
After going through so much, this day has finally come.

144
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:45,027
Don't be so happy first.

145
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:46,683
Father hasn't agreed yet.

146
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:50,644
He looks strict usually but he's actually very soft-hearted.

147
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:52,758
Just beg him and he'll agree.

148
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,920
Let's go.

149
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,919
Sifeng, the last time the four of us climbed this Mount Shaoyang

150
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,188
was a long time ago.

151
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:05,723
We'll have to spend more time together this time.

152
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:09,436
I've been keeping a few jars of great wine for you.

153
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,068
Later, I'll use your kitchen

154
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:14,739
and cook us some drinking dishes. We'll drink until we drop.

155
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,933
That'll be for the best.

156
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:21,659
Sifeng, you are faltering in your steps.

157
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,505
Is it because of your old wound?

158
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:25,934
Yes, but I'll be fine.

159
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:29,209
Sifeng, I'm sorry.

160
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,025
Why are you suddenly apologizing to me?

161
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:35,899
I doubted you before this.

162
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:39,237
As your friend, I didn't believe in you or support you,

163
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:42,387
but you did so many things for us in secret.

164
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:44,407
I feel really guilty about it.

165
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,699
This is a chaotic world. It's normal to be cautious.

166
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,443
I would do the same thing, too, if I were you.

167
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,139
No need to feel guilty.

168
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:55,619
Everything is good now, right?

169
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:57,219
By the way,

170
00:10:57,219 --> 00:11:00,287
I haven't congratulated you for your marriage with Linglong.

171
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:03,955
She and I are already married, when is your turn?

172
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,579
Don't tell me that you are here this time...

173
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,576
You'll know about it soon.

174
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:12,427
Let's go.

175
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:22,852
Sifeng, don't leave anymore since you are already back.

176
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:24,171
Sifeng,

177
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:27,667
Xuanji told me about your great news.

178
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:31,659
I was very lost before this because I stayed with the demons of Tianxu Hall.

179
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:35,226
So, I told Xuanji a lot of bad things about you.

180
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:39,989
Now, I want to apologize to you.

181
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,916
You and Minyan really think alike.

182
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,960
You each apologized to me. It's too much.

183
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,740
All right now. Everything is in the past now.

184
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,831
Luckily, after going through so many hiccups,

185
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:59,817
the four of us are together again.

186
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:04,180
Luckily, we are still here together.

187
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,355
It's a happy day today. Let's not talk about the past. Let's go.

188
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:09,019
Time to greet our birthday boy.

189
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,520
Let's go.

190
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:17,067
We hereby wish you an abundance of health and prosperity!

191
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:20,059
<i>Abundance of health and prosperity!</i>

192
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:23,180
Thank you, everyone. Cheers.

193
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,811
Father!

194
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,492
Father, look who's here.

195
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:34,095
Father.

196
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:41,559
Father, I'm back.

197
00:12:43,084 --> 00:12:46,800
I wish you good health and prosperity.

198
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,379
Okay. It's good that you are back.

199
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,500
I'm very happy.

200
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:58,644
Happy birthday, Sect Leader Chu.

201
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,459
Isn't this the new palace master of that Lize Palace demon nest,

202
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:05,951
Hero Yu Sifeng?

203
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,467
Why is he here?

204
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:11,219
But he helped Shaoyang Sect before and he guarded the Crystal for us.

205
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:12,900
He's still a demon.

206
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,419
Our sects kill demons and monsters.

207
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,339
But now, we have a demon here?

208
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,614
Are we going to dine together with a demon?

209
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,630
The four of you, come with me.

210
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:46,779
Father, what is the meaning of this?

211
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:48,499
Sifeng is Shaoyang's savior.

212
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:50,971
You brought us to this side hall because of a malicious comment.

213
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:54,006
This doesn't conform to Shaoyang etiquette.

214
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:59,165
Although this place is more secluded,

215
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,876
it's easier for us to talk here.

216
00:14:02,787 --> 00:14:04,259
It's okay.

217
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:07,859
It's tranquil here. It's more comfortable for us to talk.

218
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,978
Xuanji, you've lost some weight.

219
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:18,299
Since you are back this time, stay.

220
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:22,477
Your sister and I have missed you so much.

221
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,226
Thank you, Father,

222
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,816
but besides coming back to wish you, I have a request.

223
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:38,895
If you agree, I'll accompany you forever at Shaoyang.

224
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:40,854
What is it?

225
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,692
Father, I beg you

226
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,369
to let me and Sifeng get married.

227
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,740
Sect Leader Chu, after so many years, Xuanji and I

228
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,268
are deeply in love with each other.

229
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:09,828
Please give us your blessing.

230
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:25,826
This thing...

231
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:28,934
This thing is a serious matter.

232
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:31,850
I have to consider it carefully.

233
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,003
Father, Sifeng risked his life for Xuanji over and over again.

234
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:38,184
Nobody else in this world will treat Xuanji as well as he does.

235
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,139
Marriage is no child's play.

236
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,379
How can I just agree to it?

237
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,906
You have a prejudice against him. When Little Six proposed,

238
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,166
you agreed right away.

239
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:54,084
How can you compare Minyan to Yu Sifeng?

240
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,047
Xuanji, I need to think about it.

241
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,940
Father, you still mind that Sifeng is a demon. Right?

242
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:15,204
It's okay.

243
00:16:15,204 --> 00:16:17,351
I won't force you.

244
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,996
But I want to tell you that

245
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:24,114
in this life, I'll only marry Sifeng and no one else.

246
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:29,872
Xuanji, I know that both of you are very close.

247
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:31,560
But just now...

248
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,704
Just now, you heard those malicious comments as well.

249
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:38,862
I know Sifeng is a good man

250
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:40,578
and Shaoyang is indebted to him.

251
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:44,733
But in the end, he's still a demon.

252
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:48,300
You are still young. You don't know that gossip is a fearful thing.

253
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,160
I'm just afraid that it'll be hard on both of you in the future.

254
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:57,791
Father, I know a lot of things now.

255
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,459
In this world, we'll meet a lot of people,

256
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:04,700
but only a few are important to us.

257
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,700
The important people in my heart are you,

258
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,778
Linglong and Sixth Senior.

259
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:14,355
As long as you don't reject us,

260
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:17,070
it won't be hard on Sifeng and me.

261
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,486
<i>Sect Leader, your guests are still waiting to drink with you.</i>

262
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,019
Easier said than done.

263
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:40,540
Just like cultivation

264
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,420
and it's the same in life, too.

265
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,899
Get up first, both of you.

266
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:51,760
We'll discuss this later.

267
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,456
Sifeng...

268
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:10,549
Looks like it'll be hard for your father to agree.

269
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,699
Don't think too much.

270
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:17,702
I'm sure that he just can't accept it for the moment. He'll be fine after some time.

271
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:21,043
Yes, Sifeng. We'll help you to convince him.

272
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,096
It's okay, Sifeng.

273
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:26,452
I'm very clear about what I want.

274
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:30,243
If my father agrees, I'll marry you at Shaoyang.

275
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,228
If he doesn't agree,

276
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:36,168
we can get married anywhere in this world.

277
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,260
Sifeng.

278
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,691
Sifeng, did you pull on your old wound?

279
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:49,099
I'll get Auntie Yinghong to take a look at him now.

280
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:50,247
No need to do that.

281
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:54,979
Well... I know Sifeng's body well. He's just exhausted from the journey.

282
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:57,980
Go and celebrate Father's birthday first. We'll be fine.

283
00:19:00,364 --> 00:19:02,044
Let's go then.

284
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,004
We'll get going then.

285
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:12,779
Sifeng.

286
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:16,459
Hold on, Sifeng. Let me help you suppress the curse.

287
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,939
King Bailing, you want us to open the Heavenly Meteor Formation

288
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,827
to attack Mount Shaoyang in the human realm?

289
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:34,987
Yes.

290
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:38,579
The Heavenly Meteor Formation is a deadly formation that uses the power of stars.

291
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:42,099
Every living thing that is inside it will be annihilated. The hill will be crushed.

292
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:45,659
Isn't it a bit excessive to use it against humans?

293
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:46,739
No.

294
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:48,939
The God of War is already at Mount Shaoyang.

295
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,939
She'll open the Crystal Lamp soon.

296
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,779
And then, the Devil Star will be revived and the three realms will be in chaos.

297
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:58,723
I'm opening this formation to stop the God of War,

298
00:19:58,723 --> 00:20:02,047
but this formation is not targeting the God of War alone.

299
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:03,855
It's targeting the whole Mount Shaoyang.

300
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:05,939
To sacrifice millions of lives to defeat her?

301
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:09,011
- This is too much. <br> - Yes.

302
00:20:09,011 --> 00:20:11,400
Isn't there any other way?

303
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:15,979
For the past few days, I've been thinking about the solution.

304
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:19,963
But the Crystal Lamp and God of War are not ordinary in the human realm.

305
00:20:19,963 --> 00:20:22,924
Normal ways won't be able to hurt them at all.

306
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:27,640
So, setting up the Heavenly Meteor Formation is our only choice.

307
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,219
Desperate situations call for desperate measures.

308
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:36,219
To bury the whole Shaoyang and wrongly kill millions of lives

309
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:40,314
are better than letting the Devil Star be revived and bring ruin to three realms.

310
00:20:40,314 --> 00:20:43,179
Back then, Heavenly King asked us to leave God of War alone.

311
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:45,083
He said that everything is a preordained fate.

312
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,579
Don't you think you should discuss this with the Heavenly King first?

313
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:50,139
We are out of time.

314
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:52,579
The God of War is going to open the Crystal Lamp soon.

315
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:55,165
If Heavenly King wants to blame someone in the future for it,

316
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:56,739
I'll take full responsibility for it.

317
00:20:56,739 --> 00:21:00,515
Please help me set up the formation to destroy Mount Shaoyang,

318
00:21:00,515 --> 00:21:03,803
seal the Crystal Lamp and kill Chu Xuanji.

319
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,318
<i>Yes, King Bailing.</i>

320
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,558
Why are you here?

321
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,792
Are you here to laugh at me?

322
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,119
- What are you doing? <br> - Here's a dragon scale. Keep it well.

323
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:42,539
The path of Heaven is closed now. To go to the human realm,

324
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:43,862
you have to go through the Heaven Fire.

325
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:46,340
This dragon scale can help you with that.

326
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:52,800
Why do I have to go down? King Bailing didn't punish me, right?

327
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,539
When you reach there, look for Chu Xuanji at once

328
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:01,120
and ask her to forget about the Crystal Lamp.

329
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,369
Ask her to leave Mount Shaoyang at once without delay.

330
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:06,459
What is the meaning of this? Explain it to me.

331
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,259
King Bailing has ordered the Seven Emperors of North Heaven

332
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:10,239
to initiate the Heavenly Meteor Formation.

333
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:12,779
He's going to sacrifice Mount Shaoyang to kill Chu Xuanji

334
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:15,137
and bury the Crystal Lamp forever.

335
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,459
What did you say?

336
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:20,299
I heard it myself. It's true.

337
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,715
The Seven Emperors of North Heaven have already departed.

338
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:25,619
If you don't go now, Chu Xuanji will die.

339
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,940
If she dies, you'll die, too.

340
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:33,604
I can't watch you die in vain. Go now.

341
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,776
Green Dragon,

342
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,382
if I can come back here alive,

343
00:22:46,818 --> 00:22:49,098
I'll treat you to a drink as an appreciation.

344
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,940
How is it, Little Beauty? Are we going to start?

345
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,667
Back then, he used his life to protect the Crystal Lamp.

346
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,499
But now, I'm going to open it.

347
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:11,920
Even if he blames me for it, I still have to do this.

348
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,338
Wu Zhiqi, later, I'll rip a hole through it

349
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:17,219
and you'll keep it stable.

350
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:20,099
Then I won't alarm the protection rock when I take out Crystal Lamp.

351
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,339
Don't worry.

352
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:24,563
Although the divine weapons together with the 12 Feathers are very powerful,

353
00:23:24,563 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm still powerful enough to buy you some time.

354
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,912
We got it. Let's go.

355
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:08,769
Sifeng!

356
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:10,611
Why did you do this?

357
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:12,111
I...

358
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,887
Sifeng, I saw it.

359
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:22,323
I saw your lives starting from the heavens to the nine reincarnations.

360
00:24:22,323 --> 00:24:24,419
I saw what you had gone through.

361
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,139
We've missed out on so many things.

362
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:28,739
It's not easy for us to meet each other again in this life.

363
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:30,963
I don't want to give up yet.

364
00:24:30,963 --> 00:24:33,084
I won't let you die.

365
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:36,006
Give me the Crystal Lamp. I want to open it.

366
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:37,682
Sorry, Xuanji.

367
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:41,492
We can't open this Crystal Lamp,

368
00:24:41,492 --> 00:24:43,517
and I won't give it to you

369
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:46,030
unless you kill me.

370
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,250
You–

371
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,495
- Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng!

372
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:00,760
Take care of him. I'll chase after it.

373
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,060
Okay.

374
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,259
- Xuanji. <br> - Sifeng.

375
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:05,619
Can you manage?

376
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:09,857
Eldest Brother Wu, stop her. Don't let her open the Crystal Lamp.

377
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,023
Sect Leader Chu, go ahead and hit that Longevity Drum.

378
00:25:17,023 --> 00:25:18,710
Go ahead.

379
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,996
Run, mortals of Shaoyang.

380
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:24,968
King Bailing is going to sacrifice Mount Shaoyang to seal the Crystal Lamp.

381
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:27,660
All of you will die if you stay here. Run!

382
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,379
- Xuanji. <br> - Xuanji!

383
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:39,653
Why did you take out the Crystal Lamp?

384
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:42,144
Father, I want to save Sifeng.

385
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,939
Xuanji, run now.

386
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:45,659
- Why are you here? <br> - Forget about me.

387
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,979
Escape with these mortals first. King Bailing has given his order...

388
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:50,299
- Teng She. <br> - Run!

389
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,762
Teng She!

390
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:20,155
Bailing.

391
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:26,163
Are you Bailing?

392
00:26:26,163 --> 00:26:28,059
Where did you take Teng She?

393
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,819
Are you the one who took the Crystal Lamp?

394
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:33,723
<i>He came here without permission and leaked Heaven's secret to you. He's unforgivable.</i>

395
00:26:33,723 --> 00:26:37,368
<i>As for the Crystal Lamp, why do you want it?</i>

396
00:26:37,368 --> 00:26:39,419
<i>Have you forgotten about your vow?</i>

397
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:42,882
What vow did I make with you? I don't remember you!

398
00:26:42,882 --> 00:26:44,739
<i>Is that so, Xuanji?</i>

399
00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:46,993
<i>You promised me that you'd destroy the Crystal Lamp</i>

400
00:26:46,993 --> 00:26:49,171
<i>and kill the soul of the Devil Star.</i>

401
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:54,276
<i>Do you still remember that you'll protect the world no matter the cost?</i>

402
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,635
This voice.

403
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,859
What you said is...

404
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:01,739
<i>Promise me.</i>

405
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:03,699
<i>Destroy the Crystal Lamp.</i>

406
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:08,247
<i>We can't let the demon clan win.</i>

407
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:11,799
<i>Promise me.</i> <i>Promise me.</i>

408
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,819
<i>You are set on opening the Crystal Lamp.</i>

409
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:16,179
<i>You've already forgotten about my teachings.</i>

410
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:18,942
<i>Today, I'm here to punish you for bringing chaos to the world</i>

411
00:27:18,942 --> 00:27:21,678
<i>and poisoning the people.</i>

412
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:32,379
Hao Chen?

413
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:34,426
- Senior Hao Chen? <br> - This...

414
00:27:35,411 --> 00:27:36,971
Senior Hao Chen,

415
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,719
aren't you already dead?

416
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,939
Why are you here?

417
00:27:41,939 --> 00:27:44,244
Hao Chen...

418
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:49,289
is just the identity I use when I'm in the human realm.

419
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:52,170
I'm King Bailing.

420
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:10,480
- King Bailing. <br> - King Bailing.

421
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:14,376
Bailing?

422
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,166
Senior Hao Chen.

423
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,219
<i>Until now, you still don't repent on your sins.</i>

424
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:24,719
<i>You hate the heavens for betraying and tricking you.</i>

425
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:27,248
<i>You'll always want to seek revenge, right?</i>

426
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:29,339
<i>Do you think I'll forgive you?</i>

427
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:34,780
<i>For the harmony of the three realms, I can't keep you here anymore.</i>

428
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,071
<i>You'll be punished now!</i>

429
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:39,339
So, you are King Bailing.

430
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:40,979
Why?

431
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:42,539
Why did you lie to me?

432
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,106
I lied to you?

433
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:48,699
I took the form of a mortal and descended to the human realm to guide you myself.

434
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:52,619
I just hoped that you could get back onto the right path and come back to the heavens.

435
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:55,138
I did it for you.

436
00:28:55,138 --> 00:28:57,739
I didn't want you to die young,

437
00:28:57,739 --> 00:29:01,219
but you were so stubborn to accept my guidance.

438
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:03,219
You've wasted all of my efforts.

439
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:07,460
In the end, you can't even keep your promise to me.

440
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,659
Now, not only don't you want to destroy it,

441
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:14,059
you want to open it and release the Devil Star's soul.

442
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:19,019
And as Hao Chen, our relationship as senior and junior

443
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:23,579
for so many years means nothing to you.

444
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:24,927
What about you?

445
00:29:24,927 --> 00:29:27,931
Is our relationship for so many years real or fake?

446
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:31,740
Or is everything just a way to help me reincarnate?

447
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,459
You used me so that I felt depressed and guilty

448
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:36,859
for Senior Hao Chen's death.

449
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:40,299
You purposely forced me to attack Sifeng!

450
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:43,259
You forced me to make a vow to destroy the Crystal Lamp

451
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:45,170
even though I'd die!

452
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:48,546
Have you ever cared about me, then?

453
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:51,050
This is your duty.

454
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,381
If you had valued our relationship

455
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:56,780
and listened to me to let things run their course,

456
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,568
it would not come to this today!

457
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,875
So, before this, you had indeed

458
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,689
accused Sifeng wrongly on purpose,

459
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,324
and I felt so sinful for not being able to fulfill your dying wish.

460
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:18,287
But in the end, I'm just a pawn.

461
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,220
You still want to argue so fallaciously and irrationally?

462
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,379
I'm disappointed in you.

463
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:27,059
I gave you a lot of opportunities,

464
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,145
but you insisted on going against Heaven's will.

465
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:33,690
Today, I'm going to sacrifice Mount Shaoyang

466
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,059
by initiating this Heavenly Meteor Formation

467
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,659
to bury you and the Crystal Lamp forever!

468
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,369
What did you say?

469
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,805
- Please have mercy on us. <br> - Please spare us, King Bailing.

470
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:09,379
- Spare us. <br> - Stop! I'm the one who took out the Crystal Lamp.

471
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:12,726
I'm the one who went against Heaven's will! Kill me if you want,

472
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:15,401
but why are you killing these innocent people?

473
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:19,769
Chu Xuanji, you brought this upon yourself.

474
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:21,931
How dare you ask me that!

475
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:25,523
As soon as the Crystal Lamp is opened, the Devil Star will be revived.

476
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:27,965
He'll destroy everything.

477
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:32,219
If you can't let go of this obsession, you'll bring disaster to the three realms!

478
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:37,355
So, I'll have to crush this wild dream of yours to nothing!

479
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:39,975
Stop! I just want to save someone.

480
00:31:39,975 --> 00:31:43,195
After I save Sifeng, I'll just seal him back in.

481
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:47,059
I'm the God of War. If I can catch him once, I can catch him again!

482
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:49,579
- Impossible. <br> - Why?

483
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:51,779
The Crystal Lamp is getting more and more unstable now.

484
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:55,466
There is no mythological object that can seal the Devil Star anymore.

485
00:31:55,466 --> 00:31:58,606
I can only suppress it with Mount Shaoyang.

486
00:31:58,606 --> 00:32:00,275
Remember.

487
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:03,499
You are the cause of this calamity,

488
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:08,120
and these people will die because of you.

489
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:34,512
What is it?

490
00:32:36,348 --> 00:32:39,362
This is bad. It's Heaven's wrath.

491
00:32:42,124 --> 00:32:45,059
You can't go. Are you trying to die?

492
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,739
This is not something you can stop.

493
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:48,739
But...

494
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:52,615
If I'm not wrong, this is the Heavenly Meteor Formation.

495
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:55,675
What formation is that? That stupid monkey is still inside.

496
00:32:55,675 --> 00:32:57,636
What about him?

497
00:32:57,636 --> 00:33:01,419
Calm down. A small formation will not be able to trap that stupid monkey.

498
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:03,979
Didn't he ask us to take care of you before he left?

499
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:06,180
He'll be fine.

500
00:33:07,244 --> 00:33:09,104
He did say that.

501
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:39,419
You once taught me to take care of the people,

502
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:42,851
but why are you slaughtering these innocent people?

503
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:47,395
To keep the peace of the three realms, some sacrifices are unavoidable.

504
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:51,394
Instead of letting out the Devil Star to bring ruin to the world,

505
00:33:51,394 --> 00:33:53,179
I would rather sacrifice Shaoyang

506
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:56,920
for hundreds and thousands of years of peace.

507
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,994
By sacrificing themselves today, the people of Shaoyang

508
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:03,875
will be blessed in the future.

509
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,258
What a joke!

510
00:34:08,258 --> 00:34:11,654
The high and mighty King Bailing treats us like a piece of dirt.

511
00:34:11,654 --> 00:34:15,219
Back then, you took care of me at Xuyang Peak.

512
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,926
No matter what ulterior motives you had,

513
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:21,619
those memories are precious to me.

514
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:24,339
Thank you for your care for so many years.

515
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:27,818
From now on, our past relationship is no more.

516
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:30,298
I won't let you hurt Shaoyang Sect!

517
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:33,798
Today, I'll fight to the death with you!

518
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:44,475
Chu Xuanji,

519
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:48,043
since you insist on siding with the demons and going against me,

520
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:52,765
I'll finish you off once and for all today!

521
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,465
Xuanji!

522
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,386
Xuanji!

523
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,040
Xuanji!

524
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:52,812
Sifeng!

525
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,986
Sifeng!

526
00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:02,696
Sifeng!

527
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:16,919
Sifeng, how are you feeling?

528
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:18,480
Sifeng!

529
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,819
How did this happen?

530
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:23,059
What happened?

531
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:24,179
This is bad.

532
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:26,619
The power of the Juntain Hoop and Cehai Hook is bursting because of an outside impact.

533
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:29,299
Sifeng is seriously injured. He can't contain the power anymore.

534
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:33,860
No. I have to save Sifeng. Give me the Crystal Lamp.

535
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,553
No.

536
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,748
You can't open the Crystal Lamp.

537
00:36:39,748 --> 00:36:42,944
- Promise me. <br> - Sifeng!

538
00:36:42,944 --> 00:36:45,624
You have to open the Crystal Lamp.

539
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,765
Yuan Lang? You are still alive?

540
00:36:55,765 --> 00:36:58,019
I'm not here to fight with you.

541
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:01,040
I'm here to tell the God of War the truth.

542
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:04,779
Xuanji,

543
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:06,480
don't listen to him.

544
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:11,219
He's just here to trick you to open the seal of the Crystal Lamp.

545
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:12,579
Don't listen to him.

546
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:15,859
God of War, do you know why

547
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:20,768
King Bailing is so unforgiving when you want to open the Crystal Lamp?

548
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:38,763
Finally, you know the truth.

549
00:37:38,763 --> 00:37:40,637
Chu Xuanji...

550
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,266
The God of War is the Devil Star.

551
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,771
The Devil Star is the God of War.

552
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,740
I am the Devil Star.

553
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,650
Yes. You are the Devil Star.

554
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,252
The soul inside the Crystal Lamp is yours.

555
00:38:06,252 --> 00:38:08,253
Goddess of War.

556
00:38:08,837 --> 00:38:10,498
- No. <br> - Yuan Lang!

557
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,140
Shut up.

558
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,879
In this world, only the Devil Star can open the seal of the Crystal Lamp.

559
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:21,084
No. You are lying to me.

560
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:22,628
You are lying to me.

561
00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:25,496
- Xuanji. <br> - You are lying to me.

562
00:38:25,496 --> 00:38:28,039
It's recorded very clearly on the mural inside the Demon Citadel.

563
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:33,040
Or else, why do you think Yu Sifeng would admit that he's the Devil Star?

564
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:40,056
Xuanji, it's not true.

565
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:43,097
Don't believe in him. He wants to destroy the three realms.

566
00:38:43,097 --> 00:38:45,579
He must have an ulterior motive.

567
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:47,320
Don't believe him.

568
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:55,942
Since young, every one of you

569
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:59,548
asked me to kill demons to uphold justice,

570
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:02,600
but the biggest devil in this world

571
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,042
was me.

572
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:08,631
Impossible.

573
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,851
Impossible. Impossible.

574
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,459
- Xuanji. <br> - Impossible.

575
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:18,299
If you don't believe me, go and ask King Bailing.

576
00:39:18,299 --> 00:39:22,459
He tricked the Devil Star and extracted his soul from him.

577
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:24,842
Then, he used a mythological object made by its bones

578
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:27,970
to seal his soul inside this Crystal Lamp.

579
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,861
And his body was transformed into the God of War.

580
00:39:30,861 --> 00:39:32,467
And the God of War's heart

581
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:36,574
is just a minor piece that King Bailing took from the Crystal Lamp.

582
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,051
Demon, that's enough!

583
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,791
What he said...

584
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,732
Is what he said true?

585
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,772
It doesn't matter that you know now.

586
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,354
He is right,

587
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,316
but everything is going to end now.

588
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,823
Since the beginning,

589
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:16,106
the devil that you want to kill is me.

590
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:21,081
What a joke.

591
00:40:23,284 --> 00:40:26,374
What is the God of War then?

592
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,951
Bailing, why did you do it?

593
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:34,467
Why did you do it?

594
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:36,893
For the three realms.

595
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,140
You stopped me from getting back my six senses.

596
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:46,720
You wanted me to feel nothing so that I could become your puppet!

597
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,694
You can't be corrupted if you are heartless, to begin with.

598
00:40:50,694 --> 00:40:53,011
Only then can the three realms be safe.

599
00:40:53,011 --> 00:40:58,708
But even after nine reincarnations, your anguish is still here.

600
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:02,396
And this time, you even gained a mortal heart because of Yu Sifeng.

601
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:06,011
I can't let you turn into a demon again.

602
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,712
Sifeng. Sifeng.

603
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:18,452
Sifeng.

604
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,388
Sifeng!

605
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,019
Sifeng. Sifeng.

606
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,659
Yu Sifeng,

607
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:30,880
I'll kill you first.

608
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,280
Let's see if the Crystal Lamp will be broken or not.

609
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,640
Sifeng!

610
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,280
Xuanji.

611
00:41:41,396 --> 00:41:42,869
Sifeng!

612
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,620
Sifeng! I won't let anything happen to you.

613
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:01,852
Xuanji.

614
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,720
No!

615
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,859
I'd rather die than let you become a demon because of me!

616
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:09,138
Sifeng, I don't care about that.

617
00:42:09,138 --> 00:42:10,419
I just want to save you!

618
00:42:10,419 --> 00:42:15,259
Devil Star or God of War. I don't care. I just want you to live!

619
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,603
Sifeng, if I become Devil Maleficent, don't forget about me!

620
00:42:30,603 --> 00:42:33,420
Remember, you have to find me!

621
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:36,019
Xuanji. Xuanji!

622
00:43:40,876 --> 00:43:44,400
<i>I'm willing to drink with you every day.</i>

623
00:43:46,684 --> 00:43:50,191
<i>I'm sorry, Devil Maleficent.</i>

624
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,620
<i>I'll now bestow this life to you.</i>

625
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,076
<i>And for your whole life, you'll fight for me</i>

626
00:43:57,076 --> 00:43:59,955
<i>and for the heavens.</i>

627
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,539
<i>Devil Maleficent,</i>

628
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:05,145
<i>why do you kill your own people?</i>

629
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,774
Xuanji!

630
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,149
Devil Star, Devil Maleficent.

631
00:45:06,908 --> 00:45:09,959
- Xuanji. <br> - Xuanji.

632
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:15,477
Brother Bailing, long time no see.

633
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,942
Maleficent.

634
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,154
Xuanji.

635
00:45:41,355 --> 00:45:42,795
Xuanji.

636
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,244
I am Devil Maleficent.

637
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,379
Xuanji!

638
00:45:55,379 --> 00:45:57,140
Where are you going?

639
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:08,004
Xuanji.

640
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,992
The life of a human is really hilarious.

641
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,460
This belongs to Chu Xuanji.

642
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,540
From now on, she's no longer related to me.

643
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,300
Where are you going?

644
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,184
I'm going back to where I belonged in the past.

645
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:52,978
I'm going to get back everything that I lost for the past 1,000 years.

646
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:55,191
Xuanji, don't go.

647
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,650
- Xuanji! <br> - Xuanji!

648
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,814
You don't know me anymore?

649
00:47:00,814 --> 00:47:04,697
- Xuanji. <br> - Xuanji.

650
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,489
If you pests keep on addressing me wrongly without respect,

651
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:12,059
I won't mind washing this mountain with blood.

652
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:13,772
Xuanji.

653
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:19,346
- Xuanji! <br> - Xuanji.

654
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,896
Xuanji. Xuanji.

655
