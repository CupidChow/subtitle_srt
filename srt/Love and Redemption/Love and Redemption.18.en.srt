00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,666
Where am I?

19
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,180
Where is Wu Tong?

20
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,611
Answer me. Answer me!

21
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,765
You want to eat?

22
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,140
Beggar's Chicken of Shaoyang.

23
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,267
I remember that a disciple of Shaoyang once said that

24
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:51,015
this was your favorite dish.

25
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,473
Eat it.

26
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,856
I won't harm you.

27
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,915
Eat it.

28
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:25,066
Eat it.

29
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,722
The way you eat reminds me of the time

30
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:05,059
when I was hunted by the five sects.

31
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:07,400
I had to hide inside the deserted valley.

32
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,600
That place was completely barren.

33
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:13,419
There were only some rotten animal carcasses.

34
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:17,153
Take a guess.

35
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:19,414
What did I survive on?

36
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,488
What is it? Do you already want to vomit just by thinking about it?

37
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:32,380
I spent a year like that. So, you'll eat this.

38
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,660
If you dare spit it out, I'm going to let you have a taste of what I had.

39
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,510
Eat it!

40
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:45,441
Yes. Eat it.

41
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:56,068
This is the Eldest Miss Chu that I know.

42
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,020
Now, you look more energetic.

43
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,099
I'm tired.

44
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,637
I want to take a nap.

45
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,339
Are all the famous and upright sects like this?

46
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:59,132
I didn't have the intention to kill you yet and you already want to kill me?

47
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:03,220
If I was that stupid, do you think I'd be able to live until today?

48
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,819
Don't waste your energy fighting me.

49
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,733
You won't be able to kill me.

50
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,539
<i>Here are all the most powerful divine weapons in the heavenly realm.</i>

<i>God of War, this Dingkun Sword is an ancient ominous sword. It's foul and evil.</i>

54
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,012

King Bailing!

56
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:54,179
King Bailing!

57
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:57,548
King Bailing. Are you okay?

58
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,487
Just now, I saw that the God of War's life pillar was flickering.

59
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:02,500
I didn't know why.

60
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,858
So, it's because you were casting a spell on the Dingkun Sword.

61
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:08,637
This is just a false alarm.

62
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:12,410
At first, I wanted to break her tie with the Dingkun Sword and take it away.

63
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,939
But I failed.

64
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:15,300
Why?

65
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,248
Will her life pillar be affected, too. if I try to take away the Dingkun Sword?

66
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:19,639
Of course.

67
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,586
But I'm afraid that the Dingkun Sword is so strong that

68
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:24,733
it'll awaken the God of War's memories.

69
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:29,171
And I'm afraid that her power will be awakened soon.

70
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:33,540
King Bailing, you shouldn't have given that sword so easily to her back then.

71
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,680
What were you thinking? For just a moment of her happiness?

72
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,420
You brought this upon yourself.

73
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,910
You...

74
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,460
You are wise and great.

75
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,699
You'll definitely find a way.

76
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:50,860
I'm worrying about nothing.

77
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:55,881
I'll use a spell to seal the power of this sword first and

78
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:58,222
suppress the evil in it.

79
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:29,357
Are you okay, King Bailing?

80
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,609
It's quite difficult to use this body in the human realm

81
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:51,300
to suppress this divine weapon.

82
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,679
I don't know how long I can suppress it.

83
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,164
Si Ming, go back to Siming Hall now

84
00:10:56,164 --> 00:10:59,922
to seal her life pillar and chain up her past.

85
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,139
No matter if it's the Dingkun Sword or other things,

86
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:08,099
I'll not allow any other power to stir up her memories.

87
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:11,179
King Bailing, this...

88
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:14,114
You can't interfere with the human realm.

89
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:17,556
But protecting life pillars is your duty.

90
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:20,419
It's best if she doesn't remember

91
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:22,740
those incidents that she shouldn't remember.

92
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,751
Only then can she be safe.

93
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,860
Yes, King Bailing.

94
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,955
Finally, her life pillar is sealed up.

95
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:11,537
But her memories are chained, too.

96
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:14,650
And King Bailing is a stubborn and difficult person.

97
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,208
Looks like it'll be hard for them to mend their relationship.

98
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,499
I can only hope that King Bailing can help her reincarnate sooner

99
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:24,745
and bring her back to the heavenly realm.

100
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,660
Then, I'll be able to update this Tales of the Three Realms.

101
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,841
Let me in! Old Guy Siming.

102
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:38,542
Old Guy Siming, hurry up!

103
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:44,300
Lord Flying Snake.

104
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,099
Old Guy Siming.

105
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,780
Wait! Who are you calling an old guy?

106
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,182
Do I look like an old guy?

107
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,793
Let me ask you. Where did the God of War go to pass through her trial this time?

108
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:58,540
The God of War?

109
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,900
Why are you asking about her?

110
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,176
Of course, I want to go there to compete with her.

111
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:09,819
- Come over here. <br> - Tell me.

112
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:12,640
Come over here. Something bad has happened.

113
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:15,509
What happened?

114
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:18,219
Let me tell you, but don't tell King Bailing about it.

115
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:23,060
I lost the Dingkun Sword that I'm guarding.

116
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,677
God...

117
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,320
Such a major issue?

118
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,922
So, I must go and find the God of War and get back

119
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:38,831
the Dingkun Sword before King Bailing finds out about it.

120
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:41,209
Hurry up and tell me where she is now.

121
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:43,990
I'm not going there to fight with her.

122
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,778
Her reincarnation was done through seniority.

123
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:53,546
How can a powerless deity like me find out where she is?

124
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:57,226
You are too useless. Forget it.

125
00:13:57,226 --> 00:13:59,562
I'll go and find out about this elsewhere then.

126
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,204
Don't tell anyone that the Dingkun Sword is gone.

127
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,499
You are just a stinky snake.

128
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:11,918
I'll record it down.

129
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,819
You are awake?

130
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,260
Senior Hao Chen.

131
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,859
Where is Sifeng? How is he? Did you see him?

132
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:27,177
Did the Deputy Chief take him back to Lize Palace?

133
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:28,625
He is fine.

134
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,865
You can rest assured now.

135
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:32,399
Good.

136
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,220
Xuanji, do you still remember your vow to master before you left the mountain?

137
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,339
You vowed that you'd protect the secret ground forever.

138
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:41,740
So, you should always put the secret ground first.

139
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,619
How could you just promise to marry someone without thinking?

140
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:46,889
But I took off Sifeng's mask.

141
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:49,682
If I don't take responsibility for it, he'll be punished.

142
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,140
Nonsense.

143
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,899
When did Lize Palace have this rule?

144
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:56,977
Besides, no matter what, this is Lize Palace's matter.

145
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:58,867
You may be able to interfere this time,

146
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:01,993
but will you be able to do that forever?

147
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:05,298
You agreed to marry a man without serious consideration.

148
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,497
Are you just going to abandon your father, your sister, and...

149
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,439
You'll spend the rest of your life with someone just like that?

150
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:20,769
I... I haven't thought that far ahead yet.

151
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:25,420
Forget it. Later, I'll bring you to Lize Palace to explain it to them.

152
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,139
Tell them that you made that decision on a whim and that it doesn't count.

153
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:32,722
No, I've promised them. How can I break my promise?

154
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:35,449
I can't just wash my hands of Sifeng's matters.

155
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:37,901
You don't even listen to me now?

156
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:39,913
Of course, I do.

157
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:41,683
You do?

158
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:43,739
Fine. Let me ask you then.

159
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:45,384
Why were you at Mount Gao?

160
00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:47,634
What were you looking for?

161
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:49,580
I...

162
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,670
I went to Mount Gao to look for the Mirror of Origin.

163
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:55,579
Senior, don't be mad.

164
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,980
I know that I promised you

165
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,419
to not look for the Mirror of Origin anymore.

166
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:03,179
But I really want to restore my six senses.

167
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,580
I want to be like everybody.

168
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,633
I have a friend who said that he knows this mirror well.

169
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,751
He said that it's not an evil mirror.

170
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,745
It will just let you see your past.

171
00:16:12,745 --> 00:16:16,340
A friend? It's Yu Sifeng again.

172
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,700
I put so much effort to teach you all those years

173
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,139
but you trust him more than you trust me.

174
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:24,037
Si Feng has the same thoughts as me.

175
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:26,099
I want to feel those senses for myself.

176
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:29,441
Moreover, a human has a heart to feel.

177
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:31,419
We have eyes to see.

178
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:35,189
We have a nose to smell and a mouth to eat.

179
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:38,657
If I give up all of those, what else can I do?

180
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:41,958
The world has a myriad of things and a man's heart is incomprehensible.

181
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,884
Before you left the mountain, I taught you

182
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:47,338
to always reflect on yourself and not to be bewitched by others.

183
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:50,018
But in the end, you still let your desire win out.

184
00:16:50,018 --> 00:16:52,958
I'm really disappointed in you.

185
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,419
Looks like there's no need to continue with this trial anymore.

186
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,129
Go back to Shaoyang and continue your cultivation in Xuyang Peak.

187
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:04,939
No. I still haven't heard from Linglong and Sixth Senior.

188
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:06,139
I must go.

189
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:09,265
Min Xing and Min Jue have already gone to Mount Gao to look for them.

190
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:11,160
You don't need to do anything.

191
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,059
You'll be grounded in Fuyu Island first.

192
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:15,223
Practice with Spell of Tranquility for 20 hours every day.

193
00:17:15,223 --> 00:17:16,801
After everything is settled here,

194
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:19,820
go back to Shaoyang with me at once and never leave it anymore,

195
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,938
and be a dedicated protector for your whole life.

196
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:26,037
- No, Senior! <br> - Go back now!

197
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:44,572
<i>Do you know what it means by taking off this mask?</i>

198
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:46,899
<i>I took it off. I'll take the responsibility for it.</i>

199
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,667
<i>What should I do? Tell me.</i>

200
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,668
<i>Marry him. Are you willing to do that?</i>

201
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:55,180
<i>Do you still remember your vow to master before you left the mountain?</i>

202
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,287
<i>You vowed that you'll protect the secret ground forever.</i>

203
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:00,690
<i>So, you should always put the secret ground first.</i>

204
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,914
<i>How could you just promise to marry someone without thinking?</i>

205
00:18:03,914 --> 00:18:08,734
<i>Are you just going to abandon your father, your sister, and...</i>

206
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:13,643
<i>You'll spend the rest of your life with someone just like that?</i>

207
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,139
Deputy Chief,

208
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:21,918
the disciples are still waiting.

209
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:24,697
Are we going to bring Sifeng back now?

210
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:26,540
No.

211
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,963
Since that girl is willing to risk her life for him,

212
00:18:29,963 --> 00:18:31,660
we'll let him stay.

213
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,733
Did you bring me the shards of the Loveless Mask?

214
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,339
They are here.

215
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,898
This is the bark of the Kunlun Tree.

216
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:48,011
It won't break so easily.

217
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:50,660
Interesting.

218
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,498
Aren't you curious whether or not that girl

219
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:56,460
truly loves Sifeng?

220
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,339
I don't know.

221
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:02,939
Let's conduct a test then.

222
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,520
Yes, Deputy Chief.

223
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,184
The immortal Kunlun Tree.

224
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,150
So, it's the Loveless Mask.

225
00:19:24,658 --> 00:19:26,177
<i>The mask was removed,</i>

226
00:19:26,177 --> 00:19:28,074
<i>but the curse is still there.</i>

227
00:19:28,074 --> 00:19:29,699
<i>Yu Sifeng,</i>

228
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:35,104
<i>looks like you have no choice but to work hard for Xuanji's love.</i>

229
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,500
<i>Good.</i>

230
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,211
<i>Senior Hao Chen is not watching me in the yard.</i>

231
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:45,691
<i>I can check on Sifeng now.</i>

232
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,458
Our fight is not over yet.

233
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,539
How about we give it a go now?

234
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:55,810
I don't want to fight you.

235
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,560
Then, I'll bring Sifeng back.

236
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,498
If I win, are you not going to bring Sifeng back?

237
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:08,258
Depends on your capability then.

238
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,594
Xuanji, are you okay?

239
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:19,138
<i>Could it be that she's not the master of this sword?</i>

240
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:20,676
I'm fine.

241
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,819
Deputy Chief, what is the meaning of this?

242
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,498
Is it because Xuanji talked back to you?

243
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:31,150
So you are seeking revenge now?

244
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,780
Isn't it too shameful to treat a junior like this?

245
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,459
I saw that her sword is very powerful, so I wanted to test it out.

246
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:41,459
I thought that the Shaoyang Sect had a new talent.

247
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,779
She's not that powerful, though.

248
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:47,497
I hope that you can stay away from her from now on.

249
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,100
How dare you!

250
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,672
How dare you talk to your superior like that for a girl?

251
00:20:52,672 --> 00:20:56,019
I haven't punished you for the mask yet. Do you want to add another offense?

252
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,693
I've promised to marry Sifeng already. What else do you want?

253
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:01,642
It's still a crying face after you took off Sifeng's mask.

254
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:04,194
It means that you don't truly love Sifeng.

255
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:06,792
How am I going to explain that to Lize Palace?

256
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:10,842
But since Sifeng is Lize Palace's head disciple,

257
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:13,410
I'll give you a chance.

258
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:18,769
Deputy Chief, are you asking Xuanji to grow the Heart Lantern?

259
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:20,900
Your life depends on this test.

260
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,578
Don't you want to give it a try?

261
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:25,259
That way, I'll be able to give Palace Master an explanation.

262
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:27,669
What is the Heart Lantern?

263
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:33,579
Little girl, bury this shard in the soil and water it with your qi.

264
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:36,269
If you have someone you want to love with all you have,

265
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:39,379
it'll grow within two days and bear the fruit of the Heart Lantern.

266
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:43,149
After that, take that Heart Lantern and put it in SiFeng's hands.

267
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:45,945
If the Heart Lantern is as bright as before in his hands,

268
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:49,947
it means that your love for Sifeng is true.

269
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,380
Do you want to give it a try?

270
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,100
It's just a Heart Lantern. I'll plant it.

271
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,717
Fine. I'll wait for the result then.

272
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,099
Xuanji, it was so dangerous just now.

273
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:10,300
Why didn't you use the power of the Dingkun Sword to fight him?

274
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,874
I don't know what's wrong with this Dingkun Sword.

275
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,180
It's like it was throwing a tantrum just now.

276
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,242
I don't care about that now. I must plant this first.

277
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:18,820
I must grow it.

278
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,973
Then, the Deputy Chief and the others won't pester you again.

279
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,386
Hero Yu,

280
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,882
this is the Shaoyang Sect's courtyard.

281
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:41,818
It's not right for you to just barge in here, right?

282
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,900
Senior Hao Chen, long time no see.

283
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,673
Xuanji always mentioned you.

284
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:51,131
She said that you are the one who taught her all of her skills.

285
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:52,499
She has really learned a lot from you.

286
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:54,978
But I didn't really hear of Xuanji mentioning you.

287
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:57,183
Looks like both of you are not that close.

288
00:22:57,183 --> 00:23:00,057
Xuanji is innocent, naive, and doesn't know the way of life.

289
00:23:00,057 --> 00:23:03,922
It's not surprising that she'll agree to anything just to help you.

290
00:23:03,922 --> 00:23:06,596
Please don't take it to heart,

291
00:23:06,596 --> 00:23:11,652
and don't hope for any result for your one-sided love.

292
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:26,988
<i>Xuanji, will you be able to grow that Heart Lantern?</i>

293

297
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,527
Junior Sister, eat something.

298
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:07,629
I don't want to eat. I don't want to eat anything.

299
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,218
If you continue like this, your body will not be able to take it.

300
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:14,310
I don't want to eat. Don't ask again.

How can you grow a Heart Lantern?

00:25:07,203 --> 00:25:09,605
Yu Sifeng is the one who seduced you.

316
00:25:09,605 --> 00:25:12,266
He deserves this.

317
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:25,850
<i>She managed to grow the Heart Lantern?</i>

318
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,235
<i>She was just away from me for a few months</i>

319
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,832
<i>and she already has the ability to love?</i>

320
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:34,520
<i>With this ability, her last chance of passing this trial will be destroyed.</i>

321
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,230
♫ <i>Because at that time the destiny of our love was not over yet ♫ </i>

322
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,470
♫ <i> Meeting again in this lifetime </i>♫

323
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,970
♫ <i>How many lines of tears will it pass through <br>on this sandy road </i>♫

324
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,980
♫ <i> Fate is just going to stir up trouble like this </i>♫

325
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:55,190
♫ <i>Teaching one how to be utterly miserable </i>♫

326
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:01,020
♫ <i> Love without tears will not be headed toward </i>♫

327
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,620
Now, they won't be able to tell.

328
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,499
Her two days will be up tomorrow.

329
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:11,107
Without the Heart Lantern, it's time for Yu Sifeng to give up.

330
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,200
<i>[WEST WATER PAVILION]</i>

331
00:26:19,483 --> 00:26:21,699
Look how unhurried he is.

332
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:24,060
The daughter of a leader sect wants to marry him.

333
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,586
How wonderful.

334
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:28,402
He has really brought pride to Lize Palace.

335
00:26:28,402 --> 00:26:29,620
Brought pride?

336
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,867
The rules of Lize Palace have already become a joke.

337
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:35,473
He dragged the whole Lize Palace down with his matter.

338
00:26:35,473 --> 00:26:37,994
How thick-faced he is.

339
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,300
We are all from the same sect. Why do you have to say that?

340
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,741
Although Sifeng doesn't like to gossip,

341
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:52,078
it doesn't mean that these remarks won't fall into the ears of our palace master.

342
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:56,194
Don't be bothered by them.

343
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,278
Ruo Yu.

344
00:27:00,163 --> 00:27:02,018
Your scar...

345
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,637
You know about Lize Palace's rules, too.

346
00:27:06,637 --> 00:27:10,153
Losing my mask is a grave crime. Of course, I'll be punished.

347
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:13,328
This scar is just a minor punishment as a warning.

348
00:27:13,328 --> 00:27:15,515
The Tianxu Hall is going to make a ruckus today

349
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:17,739
and I've fought them before.

350
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:21,302
So, Palace Master allowed me to come with Deputy Chief to deal with it.

351
00:27:21,302 --> 00:27:24,282
After it's done, I'll be sent into the 13 Punishments Tower of Oblivion.

352
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,305
I still naively think that maybe the palace rules

353
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:33,354
will be more humane now.

354
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:37,400
But by the looks of it, I was too hopeful.

355
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:41,275
So, I'm even more worried about you, Sifeng.

356
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:43,857
I didn't know that your mask was like that.

357
00:27:43,857 --> 00:27:45,540
Today is the day.

358
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,433
Will Xuanji be able to grow the Heart Lantern?

359
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:55,467
This is a first.

360
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,947
So, I don't know.

361
00:27:58,947 --> 00:28:00,623
I believe in Xuanji.

362
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:04,654
Since she could take off my mask, her love for me

363
00:28:05,218 --> 00:28:07,358
must be real.

364
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:22,526
When did I fall asleep?

365
00:28:24,098 --> 00:28:25,994
Heart Lantern?

366
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:32,370
I managed to grow the Heart Lantern.

367
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,117
King Bailing!

368
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,899
King Bailing, so the Kunlun wood that you planted

369
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:49,995
can grow into a Heart Lantern, too.

370
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,100
That's not right.

371
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,631
You practice Heartless Tactics in both the heavenly realm and the human realm.

372
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:56,338
How can you grow a Heart Lantern?

373
00:28:56,338 --> 00:28:59,623
And it's such a huge Heart Lantern.

374
00:28:59,623 --> 00:29:02,979
When Chu Xuanji took your Heart Lantern, not only doesn't it wither,

375
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:04,723
it shines even brighter.

376
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:07,979
Interesting. Interesting.

377
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,900
This is just a tactic to make Yu Sifeng give up.

378
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,360
Si Ming, if you think that you have too much time in Siming Hall,

379
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,822
I don't mind throwing you into the Water of Forgetting and let you go through the Path of Reincarnation.

380
00:29:21,822 --> 00:29:24,379
King...

381
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,884
Farewell, King Bailing.

382
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:38,034
Chu Xuanji is still not here.

383
00:29:38,034 --> 00:29:42,178
Sifeng, looks like the true love that you are hoping for

384
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:44,207
is not going to happen.

385
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:54,939
Sifeng! Sifeng!

386
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:58,287
Sifeng, I managed to grow the Heart Lantern!

387
00:29:58,287 --> 00:30:00,967
Look. I managed to grow the Heart Lantern.

388
00:30:04,461 --> 00:30:07,740
I knew that you would be able to grow it.

389
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:12,079
Great.

390
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,559
This Heart Lantern is so pure.

391
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,064
It means that you really have someone you love.

392
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,741
I already grew the Heart Lantern.

393
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:28,518
So, you won't take him away now, right?

394
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:31,185
Hurry up and give it to Sifeng.

395
00:30:31,186 --> 00:30:34,900
The disciples of Lize Palace will be your witness today.

396
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,373
If the Heart Lantern still shines like it is shining now,

397
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:40,974
it means that the one you love is Sifeng.

398
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:44,728
And Lize Palace will have nothing to say.

399
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,317
Don't break your promise then.

400
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,109
Why is it like this?

401
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,360
Xuanji, the one you love is not Sifeng?

402
00:32:13,842 --> 00:32:17,165
Sifeng, I'm the one who grew the Heart Lantern.

403
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,665
Why will it wither? I...

404
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:25,318
Of course, you are sincere to save Yu Sifeng from danger.

405
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,599
Xuanji, let me ask you.

406
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,082
You agreed to marry him because you want to help him and save him from

407
00:32:42,082 --> 00:32:45,493
being punished by Lize Palace, right?

408
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,451
Yes.

409
00:32:48,452 --> 00:32:51,479
I want to help Sifeng. Isn't that sincerity?

410
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,599
Yes.

411
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,010
Shaoyang Sect has always been kind and righteous.

412
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:58,126
My junior was just feeling compassionate towards him

413
00:32:58,127 --> 00:32:59,926
and wanted to help him.

414
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:01,679
That's it.

415
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,030
All the misunderstandings have been resolved today.

416
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:08,805
Please forget about this marriage agreement between them.

417
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:10,599
Let's not talk about it anymore.

418
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,940
Thank you for your understanding.

419
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,709
Xuanji, let's go.

420
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,273
But, Sifeng...

421
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,582
I...

422
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:22,825
I'm fine.

423
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:25,102
Xuanji,

424
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,399
you have already done a lot for me.

425
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,269
Next, I'll settle it myself.

426
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,695
Go back.

427
00:33:35,486 --> 00:33:37,119
Sifeng,

428
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,418
did I screw this up?

429
00:33:46,447 --> 00:33:47,839
Forget it.

430
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,501
Who can say that wanting to save your friend is insincere?

431
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:54,493
This is so touching.

432
00:33:54,494 --> 00:33:57,974
I won't blame Sifeng on this then.

433
00:33:57,975 --> 00:34:02,565
Chu Xuanji, you don't have to worry now.

434
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,725
Really?

435
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:08,546
Look. Deputy Chief has already forgiven me.

436
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,690
I'll be fine.

437
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,847
Don't worry. Go back.

438
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:16,301
Xuanji, let's go.

439
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,489
- Sifeng... <br> - I'm fine.

440
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,790
♫ <i> You are the breeze between my lips </i> ♫

441
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,820
♫ Blowing away the sorrow on the sea of clouds ♫

442
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:42,700
♫ <i> Moves my soul, build my gentleness and become immortal </i> ♫

443
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:49,920
♫ <i> I'm willing to fall to this state, <br>willing to bear this thousand years wait ♫ <br>[West Water Pavillion]</i>

444
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:56,510
♫ <i> The dream you gave me is sufficient, <br> I've been happy for a long time </i> ♫

445
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,450
Sifeng.

446
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:01,080
♫ <i> The feeling of deep love is fast asleep </i> ♫

447
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,520
♫ <i> Fall into a red dot at the corner of my eyes </i> ♫

448
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:11,550
♫ <i> If I still don't understand in this lifetime, <br> wake me up in the next lifetime </i> ♫

449
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:19,110
♫ <i> Seen all the luminosity of this world and experienced <br> all the hardship, befriending the moon </i> ♫

450
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,693
What a pity. Your Loveless Curse has no chance to be broken now.

451
00:35:22,694 --> 00:35:25,223
Stay here if you want.

452
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:29,714
Nothing is more painful than having your hope crushed by the one you love.

453
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,397
And no punishment

454
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:37,498
is more painful than the flare-up of an episode of the Loveless Curse.

455
00:35:42,798 --> 00:35:44,025
Sifeng.

456
00:35:46,968 --> 00:35:48,362
I'm fine.

457
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,671
Xuanji...

458
00:35:52,055 --> 00:35:54,599
is different from others.

459
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,039
Since the first time I met her,

460
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,341
she was very different from normal people.

461
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,891
I should've stayed away from her a long time ago.

462
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,398
So, unless it's Xuanji's personal choice,

463
00:36:16,398 --> 00:36:18,719
I won't believe in anything else.

464
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,519
<i>Clear your mind.</i>

465
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,621
<i>The cloud is thin, and the wind is light.</i>

466
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:36,399
<i>This Star Cloud is very calm.</i>

467
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,653
<i>It means that my Spell of Tranquility is working well.</i>

468
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,134
<i>I won't be scolded by Senior Hao Chen now.</i>

469
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,868
<i>I'm fine.</i>

470
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:47,354
<i>You have already done a lot for me.</i>

471
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,810
<i>Senior Hao Chen said that I made a joke out of Sifeng.</i>

472
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,639
<i>Sifeng looked so sad just now.</i>

473
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,779
<i>Will Deputy Chief trouble him again?</i>

474
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,674
<i>This is bad. I disrupted my qi because I was distracted.</i>

475
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,020
- Sifeng! <br> - Why were you so careless?

476
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,722
I was practicing the Spell of Tranquility just now, but I kept thinking about you.

477
00:37:30,722 --> 00:37:33,653
So, I accidentally disrupted my qi.

478
00:37:33,653 --> 00:37:35,458
You kept thinking about me?

479
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:38,958
What about your heart then?

480
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,005
- I... <br> - Xuanji,

481
00:37:42,006 --> 00:37:43,797
when you said that you'd marry me,

482
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:47,438
did you say it out of friendship and pity only?

483
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:53,580
Don't you feel anything different for me?

484
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,181
What kind of different feelings are you talking about?

485
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,682
When we were at the wine cellar, I told you how I felt.

486
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:09,540
If you don't understand,

487
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,020
I'll...

488
00:38:13,495 --> 00:38:15,810
make you understand it better then.

489
00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:44,399
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

490
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,119
<i>Why is my heart beating so fast?</i>

491
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,700
<i>I feel ill.</i>

492
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,543
Sifeng, do you want to eat this fruit?

493
00:39:02,544 --> 00:39:04,199
It's especially sweet.

494
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,246
You were scolded by Deputy Chief today. You must be in a bad mood.

495
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:09,133
You'll be happier after eating this fruit.

496
00:39:09,134 --> 00:39:10,555
Sifeng!

497
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,621
Sifeng, I...

498
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,333
Sifeng, why are you acting so weird?

499
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,358
Sifeng, I...

500
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:34,010
Xuanji, I like you.

501
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:38,201
More than anyone and anything.

502
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,700
I don't want to share you with others.

503
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,339
I hope that you'll always be mine alone.

504
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,319
This hairpin is a love token from my father to my mother.

505
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,599
I'm giving it to you now.

506
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,746
Sifeng, this hairpin is too precious.

507
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:10,690
You should keep it well. How can you give it to me?

508
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:15,022
I'm giving it to you because it's important.

509
00:40:15,023 --> 00:40:20,700
I hope that you can understand my feelings for you and yours for me.

510
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,224
<i>There were many misunderstandings because I took Sixth Senior's thing last time.</i>

511
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:27,690
<i>I can't casually take someone else's thing again.</i>

512
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,959
Sifeng, I never thought that

513
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,319
you'd become so strange after taking off your mask.

514
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,117
If I had known that it would be troublesome, I wouldn't have taken it off.

515
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:39,000
I can't take this hairpin. Keep it.

516
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,956
Xuanji.

517
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:40,293
Xuanji.

518
00:41:40,293 --> 00:41:42,730
What are you doing?

519
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,557
Why is this cold water?

520
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:47,040
I...

521
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,929
It's so hot and uncomfortable.

522
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:52,123
What happened?

523
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,641
Xuanji.

524
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,799
Yu Ning, is something wrong with my mind?

525
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,282
I can't stop thinking about Sifeng.

526
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:14,142
<i>I...</i>

527
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:17,339
I don't know what's wrong with me.

528
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:20,159
It's so uncomfortable and hot.

529
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,773
Am I sick?

530
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:25,713
Or did someone cast a weird spell on me?

531
00:42:25,713 --> 00:42:26,856
Yes.

532
00:42:26,856 --> 00:42:30,754
I think Sifeng cast a spell here.

533
00:42:30,754 --> 00:42:33,879
Here? Really?

534
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,742
<i>You really don't know?</i>

535
00:42:35,743 --> 00:42:39,171
<i>This spell is called affection.</i>

536
00:42:39,171 --> 00:42:40,834
<i>Affection?</i>

537
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:46,962
It's like when I see my handsome Pianpian,

538
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:51,618
my heart will beat so fast like there's a rabbit inside it.

539
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:00,119
Xuanji.

540
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,174
But I've never felt this way before.

541
00:43:03,175 --> 00:43:05,365
And I don't feel the same way towards others.

542
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:07,949
That's because Sifeng is different.

543
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,379
Different?

544
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:13,595
Is everyone who feels affection the same as me?

545
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,997
You look innocent.

546
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:19,181
But you are actually very bold.

547
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:22,585
But if it wasn't because I was worried that it would affect my cultivation,

548
00:43:22,585 --> 00:43:25,611
Pian Pian and I would have...

549
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,859
- It'll affect my cultivation? <br> - Of course.

550
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:33,192
Do you know how many couples have given up the chance to be a deity

551
00:43:33,192 --> 00:43:35,672
in order to defend their love?

552
00:43:36,986 --> 00:43:40,995
Looks like this is not something good.

553
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:42,715
It's our personal choice.

554
00:43:42,715 --> 00:43:45,359
It's not up to others to decide whether it's good or bad.

555
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,466
You must decide for yourself.

556
00:44:05,822 --> 00:44:07,968
<i>You should've been heartless and senseless.</i>

557
00:44:07,968 --> 00:44:10,010
<i>How did you fall in love?</i>

558
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,795
<i>I can't let you fall into this love trap.</i>

559
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:21,639
Xuanji, what's wrong?

560
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,746
I don't know why I'm feeling hot and bothered.

561
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:26,097
I'm going to take a cold bath.

562
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,929
This is a symptom when your basics for the Heartless Tactics are not stable.

563
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:36,453
If someone gets too close to you and says something seductive,

564
00:44:36,454 --> 00:44:39,001
you'll feel that kind of weird feeling just now.

565
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:42,049
Did you encounter that lately?

566
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,643
I...

567
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:47,618
When I talked to Sifeng before this,

568
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,829
the same thing happened.

569
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:53,439
Is this really because of a mistake during my training?

570
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,920
It happened to you, too, when you were with Yu Sifeng?

571
00:44:57,726 --> 00:45:00,852
This is a symptom showing that your cultivation is not stable enough.

572
00:45:00,853 --> 00:45:03,479
Be careful not to get too close to him.

573
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,680
I don't want you to overdo it and harm yourself and the others.

574
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,199
It's this serious?

575
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,275
Why would I lie to you?

576
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:14,620
You should listen to me, and get rid of all distractions,

577
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,101
practice your Spell of Tranquility, and cultivate yourself well.

578
