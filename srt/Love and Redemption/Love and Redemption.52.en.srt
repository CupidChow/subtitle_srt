00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:39,980
Because I'm afraid.

00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,980
I'm afraid that you'll look for me,

00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,380
yet I'm afraid that you won't come.

21
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,820
I wanted to return to the past with you,

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,547
yet I'm afraid that everything

23
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:52,607
will disappear just like a bubble.

24
00:01:52,607 --> 00:01:54,429
If that's the case,

I would rather not see you.

Sifeng, believe me.

Sifeng,

55
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:25,093
do you know that I've traveled everywhere

56
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,954
in order to look for you?

57
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:31,593
Guess where I've been to?

58
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,500
I'm sure it's the places that we went to before.

59
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,625
How did you know?

60
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,306
Because I went to the same places

61
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:46,164
and reminisced our past there.

62
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,160
Sifeng, do you feel that

63
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,054
I deserved everything?

64
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,285
Not at all.

65
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:01,480
I know you cared for me,

66
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,700
and you looked everywhere for me.

67
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,840
Now, I feel smug.

68
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,460
Don't think too highly of yourself.

69
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,576
Listen. If you dare to run away again, I'll ignore you.

70
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,980
You told me that you'd follow my wish

71
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,699
when you tried to coax me earlier.

72
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,420
Were you lying to me?

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,286
Sifeng, you've been to many places.

74
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:37,240
Why did you decide to stay here?

75
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:44,154
Don't tell me it's because of that A'Lan?

76
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,250
No.

77
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,849
I'll tell you the details in the future.

78
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:56,320
But I want to know what happened in the past two years.

79
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,440
I want to know what you were up to.

80
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,020
I want to know if you've met any other girls

81
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,480
other than A'Lan.

82
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,745
No.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,292
Xuanji, actually,

84
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:20,900
I missed you every day.

85
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,078
I wondered what you were up to every day.

86
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,399
I wondered if you were happy or not.

87
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,140
I wondered if you'd met someone better than me.

88
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,040
I've found the best person in the world.

89
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,538
As for this hairpin,

90
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:47,200
I actually asked Miss A'Lan to repair it for me.

91
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,639
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

92
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,360
I was upset for nothing.

93
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,420
I'd finally made you jealous.

94
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,660
This hairpin has made a huge contribution.

95
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,941
Anyway, you mustn't give this hairpin to anyone else in the future.

96
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:02,620
Not even for repairs.

97
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,820
If not, I won't let you off.

98
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,420
I don't dare to do so when you're so fierce.

99
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,988
Here, I'll put it on for you.

100
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,351
This is great.

101
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:32,040
Everything is just like the past now.

102
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,840
By the way, Sifeng, I've been meaning to ask you something.

103
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,940
What exactly happened when you saved me in the secret ground?

104
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,734
Why can't I remember anything?

105
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,280
You were hurt by the Crystal Lamp's malignant aura

106
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,914
and you fell unconscious.

107
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:54,919
Of course, you don't remember anything.

108
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,613
How did you get there in time then?

109
00:07:57,614 --> 00:08:00,714
How did you know I wasn't able to destroy the Crystal Lamp?

110
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,180
It was just a guess.

111
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,834
Think about it.

112
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:10,314
If the soul within the Crystal Lamp could be destroyed easily,

113
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:12,551
the heavens would've acted long ago.

114
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:15,020
They don't need to wait 1,000 years for it.

115
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,620
But I feel like something

116
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,079
was beckoning me when I was trying to destroy the Crystal Lamp.

117
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,760
And when I tried to destroy it, I felt terrible.

118
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:34,097
I feel like I was related to the Devil Star somehow.

119
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,839
You defeated the Devil Star personally.

120
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,918
Of course, you feel familiar with it.

121
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:44,460
There's nothing strange about that.

122
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,560
That's not the case.

123
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,406
Actually, I've thought about this, too.

124
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:53,960
There are so many brave warriors in the heavens.

125
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,039
But why did they only send the God of War to face the incoming Asuras?

126
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,940
Every immortal in the heavens has their own past.

127
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,060
Some were cultivators in their past lives.

128
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,840
Some became immortals after absorbing the essence of Heaven and Earth.

129
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,700
But what about the God of War?

130
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,574
What's her past?

131
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:21,030
How did she become the God of War?

132
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:26,051
Xuanji, don't overthink stuff.

133
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:28,461
The Devil Star is trying to control you.

134
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:30,239
It's trying to bewitch you.

135
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,240
You should never go near the Crystal Lamp again,

136
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,956
understood?

137
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,020
Yes. I'm just curious.

138
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,691
Promise me this.

139
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,440
Let's spend the rest of our lives in peace

140
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,600
and forget about the past.

141
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,970
Don't pursue them any longer, okay?

142
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,919
Sifeng?

143
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,282
Sifeng, what's wrong?

144
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:13,815
Why do I feel like you're much weaker now?

145
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:24,100
I sustained some injuries while I tried to seal the Crystal Lamp.

146
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,966
It's fine.

147
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,033
Really?

148
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,119
Yes.

149
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,411
It's just a minor injury.

150
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:39,560
Sifeng, please don't hide anything from me,

151
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,740
no matter what happens.

152
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,333
I don't want you to suffer in silence.

153
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:48,374
I don't want you to suffer alone.

154
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,524
Okay.

155
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,440
Xuanji, you should rest now.

156
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,970
It's late.

157
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,379
<i>You're here because of the Glacial Pool and the Snow Lingzhi.</i>

158
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:36,460
<i>You borrowed the powers of the Juntian Loop and Chehai Hook,</i>

159
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,460
<i>and saved Xuanji by sealing the Crystal Lamp.</i>

160
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,033
<i>But your body can't withstand their immense power.</i>

161
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:45,253
<i>If I'm not mistaken,</i>

162
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:49,440
<i>it triggers much faster than the Lover's Curse.</i>

163
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,980
<i>The weapons are still inside your body. They're torturing you, am I right?</i>

164
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:03,038
<i>So, you avoided Xuanji because you thought you would die soon.</i>

165
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,939
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

166
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,980
<i>You do know everything.</i>

167
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,980
<i>Wu Zhiqi told me that with my powers, I can only survive one year at most.</i>

168
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,419
<i>I didn't expect myself to survive until this day.</i>

169
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:20,004
<i>That Glacial Pool saved you.</i>

170
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:22,404
<i>I remembered something while I was on my way here.</i>

171
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:27,206
<i>Rumor has it that there's a freezing pool at the end of the land of Xigu.</i>

172
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,719
<i>And there's a super rare Snow Lingzhi that grows around that part.</i>

173
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,300
<i>I guess that the Snow Lingzhi can temporarily suppress</i>

174
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,096
<i>the powers of the Juntian Loop and Chehai Hook in your body.</i>

175
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,834
<i>That's why you chose to settle down here.</i>

176
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,699
<i>If you're lucky, when the Snow Lingzhi grows into a Nine Rings Lingzhi,</i>

177
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:46,440
<i>maybe it can fuse the two weapons into your body when you consume it.</i>

178
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,580
<i>How is it then? Did you find the Snow Lingzhi?</i>

179
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,689
<i>I'm always unlucky.</i>

180
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,460
<i>The Snow Lingzhi is only a small sprout.</i>

181
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,879
<i>For it to grow into a Nine Rings Lingzhi, maybe</i>

182
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,828
<i>I'll have to wait 1,000 years.</i>

183
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,236
It did grow.

184
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,080
The gods are still on my side.

185
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,517
The Demon Citadel has been in ruins for over 1,000 years.

186
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:46,839
I wonder if the ancient records still exist?

187
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,780
We found nothing after a long search.

188
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,239
The Demon Citadel is a huge place.

189
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,820
Don't give up yet. Let's continue our search.

190
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,149
Ruo Yu, look!

191
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,304
Ancient records?

192
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:19,180
All the ancient records are here!

193
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,199
I'm sure this is the library of King Asura!

194
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,460
No one was able to come due to the strong malignant aura.

195
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,580
I'm sure this place will provide us the solution.

196
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,759
Let's split up and search.

197
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,308
Okay.

198
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,999
Are you okay?

199
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:56,060
I'm fine.

200
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,100
This place is collapsing. You better be careful.

201
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,980
Spirit Beasts of the World?

202
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,860
Is there a way to terminate my blood contract?

203
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,380
It does exist! In the book,

204
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,180
it states that there's a type of moth that lived around the Calamity Pool.

205
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,340
If their cocoons absorb the blood of the spirit beast's master,

206
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,100
they'll follow the blood of the spirit beast

207
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,680
and terminate the blood contract.

208
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,079
This is great!

209
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,053
Let me see.

210
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:37,440
But why were the other pages torn down?

211
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,001
Here.

212
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,135
It stated that if you want the moth to turn into cocoons,

213
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:45,936
you need to feed them with rare herbs.

214
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:49,071
Rare herbs? I guess it means something like Lingzhi.

215
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:50,460
Isn't that easy?

216
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,218
The most important thing now is to find the moths.

217
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:55,668
It's stated in the book as well.

218
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:58,461
Calamity Pool is their habitat.

219
00:15:58,462 --> 00:15:59,640
Let's look for them!

220
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,800
But Little Silver Flower, don't you think this is too much of a coincidence?

221
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,099
And why were the other pages torn down?

222
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,140
Maybe we're missing some vital information.

223
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,944
I'm sure it's not that dangerous.

224
00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:11,688
Anyway, everything is stated in the book.

225
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:13,659
We should find the moths before anything else.

226
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:16,496
- Let's go. <br> - Wait.

227
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,978
Okay. Let's go.

228
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:22,631
Let's go.

229
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,519
<i>Yu Sifeng, you spoiled my plan. I will never let you live in peace!</i>

230
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,624
<i>You want to use the Snow Lingzhi to save yourself?</i>

231
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:37,175
<i>In your dreams!</i>

232
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:39,529
Where exactly are they?

233
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,236
Ruo Yu, let's look over there.

234
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,390
Little Silver Flower, you mustn't go there!

235
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,730
That's the Calamity Pool. The water will corrode your body!

236
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,037
Stay here if you're afraid. I need to find them, no matter what.

237
00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:55,898
Little Silver Flower!

238
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,179
Ruo Yu, are you okay?

239
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:02,210
I'm fine.

240
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,600
I didn't ask you to save me!

241
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,673
Seems like we can't find any of them here.

242
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:10,032
Let's take a look over there.

243
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,287
Ruo Yu, look!

244
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:43,153
Is this the moth's larva?

245
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,639
Seems like they fit the bill.

246
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,745
This is great!

247
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,700
Ruo Yu, look!

248
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,170
Look what I've found!

249
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,079
Lingzhi? I thought you went to gather food?

250
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,488
Calm down.

251
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,383
It's stated in the book, right?

252
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,887
We need to feed the larvae with rare herbs.

253
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:16,869
Only then will they grow and form cocoons.

254
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,304
I'm so lucky.

255
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:22,400
I found this Lingzhi before our food.

256
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,519
Relax. We'll continue after I feed them with this.

257
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,159
Lingzhi?

258
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,289
But why is there Lingzhi around this area?

259
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,420
I don't know, either.

260
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,559
I saw a crow holding it with its beak.

261
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,420
And I grabbed it from that crow. I'm amazing, right?

262
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,340
A crow?

263
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,580
Little Silver Flower, don't you think there's something wrong with the crow?

264
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,740
The crow lead us here in the first place.

265
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,980
Now, it even gave you a Lingzhi.

266
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,263
How is that strange?

267
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,563
It's only a crow. I'm sure we can defeat it if it's a foe.

268
00:18:54,563 --> 00:18:56,119
Look!

269
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,900
They finished the Lingzhi already.

270
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,899
Calm down. I'll get more rare herbs for you.

271
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:05,144
Grow up fast and I'll take you to Sifeng, okay?

272
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,239
<i>Xuanji, how are you?</i>

273
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:30,041
<i>I wonder where you are right now?</i>

274
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:31,697
<i>Do you have any news of Sifeng?</i>

275
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:33,300
<i>All of us miss you.</i>

276
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,119
<i>Father's birthday is on the 16th. We've invited all the other sects.</i>

277
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,144
<i>I hope you can celebrate it with us. From Linglong.</i>

278
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,205
Sifeng! Sifeng!

279
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,700
Sifeng!

280
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,332
Sifeng, Linglong sent us a letter!

281
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,486
Sifeng?

282
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,819
Sifeng!

283
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,010
Sifeng!

284
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,576
Sifeng!

285
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:20,200
Sifeng! Sifeng!

286
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,262
Sifeng!

287
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,220
Ruo Yu, look! The larvae are turning into cocoons!

288
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,819
Our effort wasn't in vain.

289
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:45,459
Now, we just need to let them absorb Sifeng's blood.

290
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:48,782
And the moths will be able to terminate my blood contract.

291
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:51,160
Let's look for Sifeng right now.

292
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,020
But how do we find Sifeng?

293
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,879
Although I don't know if Sifeng has recovered his power,

294
00:20:57,879 --> 00:20:59,639
I can sense him now.

295
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,204
And although his power is weak, I can still locate him.

296
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,552
Ruo Yu.

297
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,399
Ruo Yu, although you did help me out,

298
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,360
you've hurt Sifeng many times as well.

299
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,799
Maybe he doesn't want to see you.

300
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,080
Forget it. I think I should go alone.

301
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,400
You're right. I'm too ashamed to see Sifeng.

302
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,136
No one would want to see a person like me.

303
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,700
But Yan Ran, I'm worried about you.

304
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,452
Just treat this as my last trip with you.

305
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,876
And one more thing.

306
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,259
This bangle was supposed to be a pair.

307
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:54,712
I wanted to give one to Ruo Xue and one to you.

308
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,921
But Ruo Xue is gone now.

309
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,697
I hope you can stay happy on her behalf.

310
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,719
Ruo Yu, I can't accept that.

311
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,763
You're really good to me. Thank you.

312
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:10,280
But I only have Sifeng in my heart.

313
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,879
You know that.

314
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,882
Of course, I know that.

315
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:16,930
Being good to you is my own business. It has nothing to do with you.

316
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:19,139
I treat you like my little sister, just like Ruo Xue.

317
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:22,688
Just treat this as a brother's blessing.

318
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:25,769
After you terminate your blood contract with Sifeng,

319
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:28,297
I will disappear by then,

320
00:22:28,297 --> 00:22:30,015
and I won't bother you again.

321
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,569
I...

322
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,172
Sifeng!

323
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,432
Sifeng! Sifeng!

324
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,524
Sifeng!

325
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,954
Sifeng!

326
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,257
Why are you here?

327
00:23:19,257 --> 00:23:20,780
Why is this happening?

328
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,020
Sifeng, what's wrong?

329
00:23:23,882 --> 00:23:25,300
It's nothing.

330
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,459
It's nothing? Look at your injuries!

331
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,660
How long do you intend to hide this from me?

332
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,449
Sifeng!

333
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,435
Xuanji, it's useless.

334
00:23:34,435 --> 00:23:38,867
I'm in this state because I've absorbed the Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook

335
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:41,314
and my body can't withstand their power at the moment.

336
00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:43,974
I'll be fine after some time.

337
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:46,365
The Juntian Hoop and Cehai Hook?

338
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,859
No wonder.

339
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,520
That's why you could seal the Crystal Lamp

340
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,620
even though I couldn't suppress it.

341
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,548
Do you know how powerful the Devil Star is?

342
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:00,279
You actually withstood this pain because of me?

343
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,537
And you tell me that it's a minor injury? No way that's a minor injury!

344
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:06,960
It's because I overestimated myself.

345
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,780
It's lucky that I'm the 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird.

346
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,384
It can't kill me.

347
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,159
Is that why you made me angry on purpose and asked me to leave?

348
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,967
Is it because of this?

349
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:22,759
How could you do that?

350
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,300
Didn't we agree that we'll take on problems together?

351
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,552
Silly girl, I'm fine since I told you so.

352
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,319
Look. You see that Snow Lingzhi?

353
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,979
When it matures,

354
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,240
it can merge the powers within me after I consume it.

355
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,093
Really?

356
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,707
Can that Snow Lingzhi really save you?

357
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,228
Silly girl, I wouldn't need to come here every day if it couldn't save me.

358
00:25:05,228 --> 00:25:06,841
Stop crying.

359
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:11,474
If you cry, you'll affect its growth.

360
00:25:11,474 --> 00:25:13,672
By then, it won't be able to save me.

361
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:16,440
How is that possible?

362
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,681
You're lying.

363
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,875
There's a golden ring on the top of the Lingzhi.

364
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,060
Yes.

365
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:33,060
This is the rare Nine Rings Lingzhi.

366
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,420
I was lucky to discover it.

367
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,600
It takes 1,000 years for it to sprout, to grow roots,

368
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,873
and to mature.

369
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,920
And the Lingzhi will mature this year.

370
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,720
It will be able to save me once it matures.

371
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,030
You can rest at ease now.

372
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,504
Sifeng, if you want me to care for you,

373
00:25:58,504 --> 00:26:01,325
you need to forget about your worries first.

374
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:03,740
You can't just ask me to change

375
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,991
without changing yourself.

376
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,199
I was silly then.

377
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,640
I won't do this in the future.

378
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,853
Lord God of War, it's all my fault.

379
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,549
In the past, you always protected me.

380
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:32,720
From now on... I'll protect you.

381
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,100
Lord Teng She?

382
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,870
Lord Teng She, I didn't know you were here! Please forgive me!l

383
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,426
Keep it down!

384
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,466
I will be done for if Green Dragon hears about this!

385
00:27:19,466 --> 00:27:21,680
But, Lord Teng She—

386
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,097
Lord Teng She, you don't need to panic.

387
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:26,519
The Four Sacred Beasts and Lord Winged Dragon

388
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,740
were sent to the mortal realm by King Bailing.

389
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,886
You almost scared me to death.

390
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,796
That was close.

391
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,267
Why did King Bailing send them to the mortal realm?

392
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:41,359
I heard that he ordered them to slay demons.

393
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,367
Slay demons? What demons?

394
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:46,143
I think it's those who were connected to the God of War.

395
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:48,389
God of War?

396
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,928
- You are dismissed. <br> - Okay.

397
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,992
<i>He actually sent those people down there?</i>

398
00:27:57,993 --> 00:28:00,973
<i>Don't tell me King Bailing wants to hunt down that stinky woman?</i>

399
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:04,448
<i>This is bad. I need to rush there.</i>

400
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,125
Yu'er, did you finish your homework?

401
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,486
I've bought you some food!

402
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,582
Why are you flying?

403
00:28:47,582 --> 00:28:49,100
Where did you thieves come from?

404
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,460
How dare you trespass my territory!

405
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,087
Thieves?

406
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:55,070
You stole an item from the heavens,

407
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,000
- yet you dare to say we're thieves? <br> - Heavenly Officers?

408
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,460
What? You don't know how to use the celestial eye you've stolen?

409
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,219
- Don't you know Winged Dragon and White Tiger? <br> - This is bad!

410
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:08,900
How dare a Rose Gold Bird like you steal from the heavens?

411
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,340
Return it to us immediately!

412
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,311
Don't try to struggle like that half-demon we met earlier.

413
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:15,199
You'll only make it hard for yourself!

414
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,082
You mean Yu'er?

415
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:18,739
Where is she?

416
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:23,268
My Lords, my daughter and I are just lowly demons.

417
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:25,499
You can take back the celestial eye if you want to!

418
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:28,908
- But my daughter... <br> - That demon is fierce and stubborn.

419
00:29:28,908 --> 00:29:32,440
She will receive her punishment somewhere else since she had offended us.

420
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,279
My Lords, you two just barged in without notice!

421
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,976
Of course, she'll try to defend herself!

422
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,400
I know you are magnanimous! Please don't hold it against her!

423
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,079
- Please let her! <br> - Enough!

424
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,786
She'll handle the consequences of your misdeeds!

425
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:46,438
I was the one who stole the celestial eye!

426
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:48,860
You should punish me instead of her!

427
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,314
What has that got to do with my daughter?

428
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:52,943
Don't blame her for something she didn't do!

429
00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:55,104
A lowly demon like you has no right to question us!

430
00:29:55,104 --> 00:29:57,250
Winged Dragon, save your breath.

431
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:58,579
Retrieve the celestial eye.

432
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:00,260
You are so unreasonable!

433
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,960
How dare you touch him! Are you looking for death?

434
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,346
Here's another lowly demon.

435
00:30:41,346 --> 00:30:43,299
Purple Fox, be careful.

436
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:47,244
They're sacred beasts from the heavens, Winged Dragon and White Tiger.

437
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,900
So what? Listen up!

438
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:54,599
Wu Zhiqi will come soon.

439
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,651
If you dare to touch me, he'll beat you up!

440
00:30:57,652 --> 00:30:59,199
Wu Zhiqi?

441
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,985
That damned monkey?

442
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,128
Stop wasting our time!

443
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:07,739
You lowly demon!

444
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,158
Wu Zhiqi!

445
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,957
Winged Dragon, let's go!

446
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,477
We're no match for Wu Zhiqi!

447
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,685
So, they're over there.

448
00:32:47,686 --> 00:32:50,579
How dare she lie to me!

449
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:54,829
Under King Bailing's order, we're to capture the demons which are related to the God of War.

450
00:32:54,829 --> 00:32:56,434
We shouldn't mess with that monkey

451
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:57,859
so that he'll not cause trouble for us.

452
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:59,439
I'll catch that merman then!

453
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,960
You keep an eye on the God of War!

454
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,850
<i>Little Lingzhi, I'll feed you some of my qi.</i>

455
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,310
<i>Please grow quickly.</i>

456
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,413
I heard that Teng She became her spirit beast.

457
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,900
You don't need to mention that useless fellow.

458
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,911
Are you trying to tip him off?

459
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,215
But as brothers, I need to remind you something.

460
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:43,900
With his bad temper, I don't think he'll listen to you.

461
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:46,961
You feed the Lingzhi so much qi every day.

462
00:33:46,962 --> 00:33:51,390
Aren't you afraid that it'll turn into a spirit instead of maturing?

463
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,260
That can't be!

464
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:58,400
I think the Snow Lingzhi will mature soon.

465
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,680
It will mature within two or three days.

466
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,049
That means we can attend my father's birthday.

467
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:10,014
By then, we'll return to the Shaoyang Sect together to celebrate his birthday,

468
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:13,890
and I'll ask him for your hand.

469
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,700
Who said I'm willing to marry you?

470
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,354
I don't think it's good for your reputation

471
00:34:20,354 --> 00:34:22,834
if I tell everyone that you stayed with me.

472
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:26,340
But you wanted me to marry you.

473
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,084
That doesn't count. Bye!

474
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,659
Where did you two go?

475
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,619
I'm starving to death!

476
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:43,739
Teng She, why did you come back?

477
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,269
I'm surprised that you still remember me.

478
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:49,648
I missed you, you know?

479
00:34:50,932 --> 00:34:54,839
It's meaningless for me to stay here and see you two act all lovey-dovey.

480
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,680
That's why I took a nap in the heavens.

481
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,639
Seems like you two have reconciled.

482
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,155
That's pretty good. My personal chef is back.

483
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:06,576
Go and make me some nice food.

484
00:35:06,576 --> 00:35:09,915
Don't treat Sifeng as your cook.

485
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,891
It's fine. It's easy to feed him.

486
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:15,359
It's fine.

487
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,780
Little Snake, tell me what you want to eat.

488
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,479
Did you find out about their reaction towards the God of War?

489
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,722
I have bad news. The heavens have issued an order to arrest her.

490
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,430
The Four Sacred Beasts have descended to the mortal realm.

491
00:35:44,204 --> 00:35:48,380
The heavens want to deal with Xuanji because of her identity.

492
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,164
I thought something was weird, too.

493
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:52,248
But I saw that the God of War and the Devil Star were

494
00:35:52,248 --> 00:35:55,008
the same person on the paintings in the Demon Citadel.

495
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,894
I'm sure there's something behind that.

496
00:35:57,895 --> 00:36:00,180
Don't you know what's going on?

497
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,812
The scroll I saw in the heavens wasn't complete.

498
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,766
I didn't see the most crucial part.

499
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:07,426
I really wanted to know...

500
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,606
I really wanted to know what happened as well.

501
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:13,999
I wanted to know how the Devil Star became the God of War.

502
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:18,520
I think King Bailing is the only one who knows the whole truth.

503
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,426
You're a heavenly officer,

504
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:23,767
yet you don't care whether Xuanji is a demon or not.

505
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,080
She was Chu Xuanji when I first knew her,

506
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:32,861
and that's the person I know.

507
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,630
Right. She's Chu Xuanji.

508
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,107
She has nothing to do with their past feuds.

509
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,880
Why won't the heavens let her off?

510
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,652
I just hope that

511
00:36:51,402 --> 00:36:54,462
Xuanji will never know about these facts.

512
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,979
Don't worry. The Perfect Fruit will help to hide your presence,

513
00:36:56,979 --> 00:36:59,387
and I've set up a protective barrier.

514
00:36:59,387 --> 00:37:03,668
It won't be easy for the Four Sacred Beasts to find this place.

515
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,890
Sifeng, look!

516
00:37:32,891 --> 00:37:35,971
The Snow Lingzhi will mature soon.

517
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,620
Gods are fair, indeed.

518
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:45,237
Now... we just need to wait for one more ring to appear.

519
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,800
<i>Sifeng!</i>

520
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,141
- Sifeng! I've finally found you! <br> - Yan Ran?

521
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,983
Ruo Yu?

522
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:58,209
How dare you still appear when you've committed so many atrocious deeds?

523
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,026
Xuanji, I know I'm sinful.

524
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:03,667
I'm too ashamed to see you two.

525
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:07,288
But I'm here to help Yan Ran with her last wish.

526
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:11,322
When she's done with it, I will commit suicide to atone for my sins.

527
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,939
Ruo Yu was forced to do them!

528
00:38:12,939 --> 00:38:15,374
Sifeng, Deputy Chief captured his sister.

529
00:38:15,374 --> 00:38:17,119
He had no choice, too.

530
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,659
Even so, that doesn't justify his misdeeds.

531
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:23,306
Sixth Senior was hurt because he trusted him.

532
00:38:23,307 --> 00:38:25,298
Sifeng treated him as his best friend,

533
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:29,460
yet he almost killed Sifeng with his sword!

534
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,788
Chu Xuanji, no one can compare to you

535
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:34,599
when it comes to hurting Sifeng.

536
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,206
You–

537
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:40,860
Ruo Yu, you had no choice in the past.

538
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,340
It's fine if you change for the better.

539
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,774
I'll just treat it as if we're strangers.

540
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,680
Xuanji and I are leading a happy life,

541
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,819
and that's enough.

542
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:54,959
How could you lead a happy life with her?

543
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,100
Sifeng, I'm the only one who truly cares for you.

544
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:03,000
Little Silver Flower, do you still not understand?

545
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,330
Our ties were severed

546
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:07,719
a long time ago.

547
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,949
I know.

548
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,947
That's why I wanted to terminate our blood contract.

549
00:39:10,947 --> 00:39:12,724
I've found a way to do so!

550
00:39:12,724 --> 00:39:14,316
It's true!

551
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,010
Sifeng, look!

552
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:19,240
If you let them absorb some of your blood,

553
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:22,641
they will follow my blood and terminate our blood contract.

554
00:39:22,642 --> 00:39:25,780
By then, you won't be my master anymore.

555
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,931
No.

556
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:29,471
Why not?

557
00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:31,186
Sifeng is seriously injured.

558
00:39:31,186 --> 00:39:33,860
His body won't be able to take it if you terminate the contract by force.

559
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,002
Chu Xuanji, what are you up to?

560
00:39:36,002 --> 00:39:39,520
I won't stop you from terminating the contract. But not today.

561
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,842
Maybe after some days.

562
00:39:40,842 --> 00:39:42,656
After the Snow Lingzhi matures,

563
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:46,554
you can terminate your contract whenever Sifeng feels like it.

564
00:39:46,554 --> 00:39:50,891
You're just afraid that I'll take over your place after I terminate the contract.

565
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:52,559
Yan Ran, don't force me!

566
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,722
I'll do it.

567
00:39:54,722 --> 00:39:56,220
You were my spirit beast.

568
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,879
I will give you everything you want.

569
00:39:59,879 --> 00:40:01,239
Sifeng...

570
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,641
I knew it!

571
00:40:02,642 --> 00:40:04,642
I knew it!

572
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,389
But I'm doing this just to return you your freedom.

573
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:12,548
There's nothing else to this.

574
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:16,373
You never know what will happen in the future.

575
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,695
Let's terminate the contract now.

576
00:40:18,695 --> 00:40:23,845
Little Silver Flower, you'll face a thunderous calamity if you terminate the contract.

577
00:40:23,845 --> 00:40:25,805
You should be careful.

578
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,637
I'm not afraid.

579
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:30,780
So what if there's a thunderous calamity?

580
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,384
This flower?

581
00:40:54,005 --> 00:40:55,940
Isn't it familiar?

582
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,890
That's the flower you left behind when you left the realm.

583
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,180
Green Dragon?

584
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,740
This is impossible!

585
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,476
We ate the Perfect Fruit. You shouldn't be able to detect us.

586
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:08,188
What trick did you use?

587
00:41:08,188 --> 00:41:10,137
You were a heavenly officer for so many years.

588
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:14,980
Did you forget the one item that could help us locate everything?

589
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,199
You...

590
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:25,029
You took back Liu Yihuan's celestial eye by force?

591
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,962
The celestial eye belonged to the heavens in the first place.

592
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:29,618
It was stolen by Liu Yihuan.

593
00:41:29,618 --> 00:41:31,475
Now, we're just taking it back.

594
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:34,356
This shouldn't be a surprise.

595
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:36,889
Who killed Liu Yihuan?

596
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,279
So what if I did kill him?

597
00:41:40,279 --> 00:41:41,619
Not only that,

598
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:45,180
I will chop off Chu Xuanji's arm to terminate her blood contract with you.

599
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,359
Try it if you dare!

600
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,844
I'm a dragon! You're a snake!

601
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:57,224
Do you think you can win against me?

602
00:41:57,224 --> 00:42:01,580
Although I'm weaker than you, I'll make you regret it

603
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,016
if you dare to touch Chu Xuanji!

604
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,279
Are you out of your mind? Liu Yihuan isn't dead!

605
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,400
We just took back the celestial eye!

606
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,420
I wanted to terminate her blood contract with you because...

607
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,966
King Bailing had issued a kill order.

608
00:42:44,966 --> 00:42:47,813
Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, Black Tortoise, and I

609
00:42:47,814 --> 00:42:50,377
are here to deal with her.

610
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,492
I'm here to tip you off.

611
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,073
I don't want you to die with her.

612
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,856
It's rare for you to care about me.

613
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:05,946
But, Green Dragon,

614
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:09,885
it seems like you don't understand me well enough.

615
00:43:09,885 --> 00:43:13,871
I, Teng She, have never been afraid of death!

616
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:17,720
Even if there's a kill order, even if the Four Sacred Beasts are here,

617
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,797
you need to get through me before you touch Chu Xuanji!

618
00:43:21,797 --> 00:43:24,678
Do you want to die so badly?

619
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,128
Green Dragon, the heavens is a cold place.

620
00:43:32,129 --> 00:43:34,179
You should come to the mortal realm when you have the chance.

621
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,281
There are many things more important than one's life here.

622
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,839
You're acting like this because you involved yourself in mortal affairs!

623
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,160
Seems like you won't wake up if I don't beat you up!

624
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,226
Fine. I've been avoiding you for so many years.

625
00:43:46,226 --> 00:43:49,559
It's time for us to have a fight!

626
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,389
- Sifeng! <br> - Little Silver Flower!

627
00:44:30,389 --> 00:44:31,999
Sifeng!

628
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,740
- Sifeng, how do you feel? <br> - Sifeng.

629
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,823
Sifeng!

630
00:44:35,823 --> 00:44:37,580
I'm fine.

631
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,230
The blood contract is gone!

632
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,983
The blood contract is gone!

633
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,257
- Little Silver Flower! <br> - Little Silver Flower!

634
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:28,597
- This is bad! <br> - Why are you stopping? Are you scared?

635
00:45:28,597 --> 00:45:30,039
Leave now!

636
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,619
Fine! You better leave, you coward!

637
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:36,187
Didn't you see that?

638
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,619
This is a thunderous calamity.

639
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:44,079
I don't know who attracted the thunderous calamity,

640
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,312
but this area is under the watch of the heavens now.

641
00:45:47,313 --> 00:45:49,853
It'll be too late if you don't leave now.

642
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:54,102
Xuanji is in danger.

643
00:45:54,102 --> 00:45:55,419
Teng She, come back!

644
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,827
Green Dragon, here's an order!

645
00:45:57,827 --> 00:45:59,139
By the order of King Bailing,

646
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:02,803
the Four Sacred Beasts are to meet up and hunt down the God of War!

647
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:04,784
Yes, My King!

648
00:46:20,936 --> 00:46:22,537
Ruo Yu!

649
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,340
The third strike. It's actually the Golden Lightning?

650
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,244
Sifeng, no!

651
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,140
Sifeng!

652
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:57,340
Sifeng! Sifeng! Sifeng!

653
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,560
Sifeng!

654
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,432
Sifeng, why is your body so hot?

655
00:47:07,432 --> 00:47:10,399
Sifeng, is it because you can't control the Juntian Hoop and Cehai power anymore?

656
00:47:10,399 --> 00:47:12,920
Sifeng, hang in there!

657
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:17,439
Why is this happening?

658
00:47:17,439 --> 00:47:20,239
It's hard for me to find you, you know? Please be safe!

659
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,620
Hang in there! Please be safe!

660
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,971
You must be safe!

661
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:50,020
