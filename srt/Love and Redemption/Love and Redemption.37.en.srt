00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,180
Palace Master?

19
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,740
Looks like all of you are very forgetful.

20
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,700
- What happened? <br> - We fell into a trap.

21
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,411
I never thought that the Fire Lion will store Putrid Mist inside its belly. We can't get out now.

22
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:20,420
We can't get out?

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,780
Be careful!

24
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:28,580
- Teng She, are you okay? <br> - This is not okay.

25
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,020
Fire Lion grew up in the Putrid Mist.

26
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,010
Here, it is almost invincible.

27
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,640
Teng She!

28
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,540
- What should we do now? <br> - How do I know?

29
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,840
It can swallow Dingkun's energy as well as my fire.

30
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,580
Now that it has come to this, there's no need to say anything else.

31
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,360
- Attack! <br> - Noon is here.

32
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,690
Let's activate the Demon Prison Formation now.

33
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:40,940
Today is the end for Lize Palace.

34
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,514
Annihilate Lize Palace to save the world from disaster.

35
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,569
All of you came prepared.

36
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:50,163
You must have put in so much effort to use so many precious weapons to attack Lize Palace.

37
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,851
But you have to know one thing.

38
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,560
No matter how good you are,

39
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,980
demons will always be better than you.

40
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,520
Purple Fox?

41
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,690
Who is Purple Fox?

42
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,720
Long story. I'll tell you later.

43
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,310
Be careful.

44
00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:30,580
I don't know why the Sun Stone became tainted.

45
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:36,059
If you burn the Neidan of Fox Demon with Bone-Quenching Fire,

46
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:40,330
you can use the fox's aura to corrupt all magical weapons in this world.

47
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:14,604
What else can you do? Show me.

48
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:16,135
Although our weapon is destroyed,

49
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:21,260
as long as any of us are still standing, we'll fight you demons to the end!

50
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,030
<i>Fight you demons to the end!</i>

51
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,890
Kill them all!

52
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,150
We can't keep fighting like this.

53
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,800
Be careful!

54
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:19,700
Teng She, your arm!

55
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,520
I even used my Life Fire to burn it. But it still bit me.

56
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,540
What should we do now?

57
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,547
Why are you always whining after turning into a mortal?

58
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:33,019
I'm a heavenly officer. I can just use a few thousand years of my spiritual power to heal it.

59
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,470
Moreover, I'll look really fierce with this wound, right?

60
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,660
I'm really fierce.

61
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,950
No. We can't just waste our energy here.

62
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,110
We have to find a way to go out.

63
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,220
I want to go out, too.

64
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,382
But you are a mortal now. You can't use God of War's Ninth Heaven Fire.

65
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:54,600
You can't break this Putrid Mist. How can we get out?

66
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,730
Ninth Heaven Fire? Teng She, teach me.

67
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,800
Maybe I'll be able to use it.

68
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:02,270
Only God of War knows how to use the Ninth Heaven Fire.

69
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,820
The fire of creation has its own spiritual power.

70
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,389
It'll take a massive amount of one's spiritual power to use it.

71
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,520
You are a mortal now. You only have a little bit of spiritual power.

72
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,500
Xuanji, I have a solution. You should run away now.

73
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,080
I won't run away. We have a blood oath.

74
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,770
I won't leave you behind.

75
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:21,030
We'll stick together until the end.

76
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,560
Stinky woman, I'll transfer my qi to you.

77
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:06,560
- Master. <br> - Silver Snake.

78
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,760
Demon's blood can loosen this Demon Rope.

79
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,390
Master, leave now.

80
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,270
No need to care about me.

81
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,230
Leave now!

82
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,468
Deputy Palace Chief.

83
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:59,159
Let's go. Let's leave Dianjing Valley at once.

84
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,628
Didn't Palace Master ask you to meet up with him after you get the stalactite?

85
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,638
You are really loyal.

86
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:09,670
Don't you care about our clan's survival?

87
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,459
Go and tell Palace Master that I already took care of the vital matters of Lize Palace.

88
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,620
As for his personal matter, ask him to settle it himself.

89
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,654
I don't have time to take the stalactite. Ask him to get it himself.

90
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:30,540
Palace Master.

91
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,253
- What is it? <br> - Deputy Palace Chief has left on his own.

92
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,660
Where's the stalactite?

93
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,378
He said that he didn't have the time to take it.

94
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:43,058
He asked you to get it yourself.

95
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:44,695
Let's go.

96
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,599
Master.

97
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,118
Linglong!

98
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,500
Die!

99
00:12:00,523 --> 00:12:02,583
Stinky woman.

100
00:12:03,203 --> 00:12:06,840
I'm exhausted because of you.

101
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:10,755
- Teng She! <br> - Xuanji!

102
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:12,050
Xuanji, are you okay?

103
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,990
What happened?

104
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,040
This is Lize Palace's doing.

105
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,657
They are the demons' accomplices.

106
00:12:17,657 --> 00:12:20,450
They even burned Purple Fox's Neidan to taint our weapon.

107
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,830
They killed a lot of our people.

108
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,085
Take care of Teng She for me.

109
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,786
Master!

110
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,020
Stop pressuring me!

111
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,322
Master, what are you going to do?

112
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:51,490
Why do you have to attack those sects? They are ready for you.

113
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,802
Ask our people to retreat now.

114
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:56,949
Sifeng, stop being so naive.

115
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:59,418
There's no turning back.

116
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:03,216
My junior already took away Dianjing Valley's Seven Star Disc.

117
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:08,399
If we don't kill them, they are going to retaliate and kill us all.

118
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,770
Seven Star Disc?

119
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,485
Deputy Palace Chief took away the spirit key?

120
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:16,459
Master, tell me the truth.

121
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:19,099
What's the relationship between Lize Palace and Tianxu Hall?

122
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,354
I don't care about Tianxu Hall.

123
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:23,620
I just want to revive Haofeng.

124
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,780
He took away the Seven Star Disc and left my stalactite behind.

125
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,218
When I go back, I'll punish him!

126
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:34,331
Master, you've been used by Deputy Palace Chief and Tianxu Hall.

127
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:36,451
They are using you to cripple the sects.

128
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:39,530
This is their conspiracy plan. Let's leave at once.

129
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:43,577
Leave? It's too late.

130
00:13:43,577 --> 00:13:45,463
This time,

131
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,672
I'm going to avenge your mother.

132
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,454
My mother?

133
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,917
[DIANJING VALLEY: WEN HAOFENG]

134
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:20,048
Haofeng is your mother.

135
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:27,548
Dianjing Valley doesn't have the right to keep the portrait of her.

136
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,702
This is my mother?

137
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,399
But, Master, you told me that Haofeng is your...

138
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,210
That's right. Haofeng is my wife.

139
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,817
She is your mother too.

140
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:54,439
Then, Master...

141
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,773
Who are you?

142
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,642
I...

143
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:02,454
I am your master.

144
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:09,195
But I am your father, too.

145
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:25,108
Sifeng.

146
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:37,296
You've grown up now.

147
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:41,252
It's time for me to tell you everything.

148
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,891
Father?

149
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:54,023
Back then, I fell in love with your mother.

150
00:15:56,058 --> 00:16:00,773
That's why she was forced to kill herself by Dianjing Valley.

151
00:16:00,773 --> 00:16:05,528
Luckily, after all these years, after so much effort that I put in,

152
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,994
I've finally found the 1000-year-old stalactite that can revive your mother.

153
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:20,427
After we go back to Lize Palace and revive your mother,

154
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:24,566
I'll tell you everything.

155
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:29,507
Could it be that my mother has always been in Lize Palace?

156
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:31,180
That's right.

157
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,514
I've been keeping her in an ice coffin under the underground palace

158
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:39,064
so that I can one day revive her.

159
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:42,759
Sifeng, I've kept you in the dark for so many years.

160
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:45,483
Do you hate me?

161
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,770
I'm such a dummy.

162
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,589
When I was young,

163
00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:00,877
you gave me my mother's silver hairpin and portrait.

164
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:04,003
You even told me a lot of stories about you and mother.

165
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:08,244
Others would have already guessed it.

166
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:12,397
Palace Master, this is bad.

167
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:14,500
We have a lot of casualties. They ganged up on us.

168
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,959
They are already outside now!

169
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,672
Master, stop fighting!

170
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:48,740
Sect Leader Chu, there's must be some misunderstanding. Let me explain.

171
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,579
You are just the jackal of Tianxu Hall.

172
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:52,740
You worked with them to steal the spirit keys.

173
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,103
I won't let you escape today.

174
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,410
Master, stop fighting.

175
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,090
You want to side with the human clan?

176
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,162
How dare you!

177
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,790
Master, no!

178
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:34,140
Rose Gold Bird Demon!

179
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,359
So, everyone in Lize Palace is a demon.

180
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,744
All these years, we've let you demons join our righteous sects.

181
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,100
What a humiliation!

182
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,951
Today, we are going to annihilate Lize Palace!

183
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:50,497
I'm going to destroy every sect here today!

184
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:38,740
Master!

185
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,220
Sifeng!

186
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,020
Sect Leader Chu, don't fight him.

187
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,671
Mortals can't defeat 12 Feather Rose Gold Bird Demons in full power.

188
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,153
Shoot those demons down!

189
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,480
Hurry up! Let's fight them together!

190
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,579
Sifeng, you unfilial son!

191
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:10,353
Master, they are just innocent mortals.

192
00:23:10,353 --> 00:23:12,079
Don't hurt them anymore.

193
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,208
Move aside!

194
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:22,771
Don't hurt Sifeng!

195
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,900
Xuanji!

196
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:29,998
Sifeng!

197
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,064
Sifeng! You are hurt.

198
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,531
Xuanji.

199
00:23:43,246 --> 00:23:45,219
- Why are you here? <br> - Sifeng.

200
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:46,626
What happened?

201
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,958
What happened to Lize Palace?

202
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,499
Xuanji, you still don't understand?

203
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:55,179
Everyone in Lize Palace is a demon. Yu Sifeng is a demon, too!

204
00:23:55,179 --> 00:23:56,906
You are the daughter of the Shaoyang Sect's leader.

205
00:23:56,906 --> 00:23:59,251
But you are still siding with that demon now.

206
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:01,931
Have you no care for Shaoyang?

207
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:05,340
Father, there must be a misunderstanding.

208
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,980
Sifeng is not a demon.

209
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,739
Even if everyone in Lize Palace is a demon, he's not.

210
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,969
I've never detected a hint of demon aura from him.

211
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:15,049
Moreover, you've already checked his identity with the Demon Whip, right?

212
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:17,810
Why are you accusing him now?

213
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,735
Xuanji, look at this.

214
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:23,802
This is a crystal dragon seal that can conceal the aura of the Rose Gold Bird Demon.

215
00:24:23,802 --> 00:24:25,644
Every disciple of Lize Palace has one.

216
00:24:25,644 --> 00:24:28,357
That's why he could bear the two whips from Demon Whip.

217
00:24:28,357 --> 00:24:31,646
If it wasn't because you stopped me the third time, he would've shown himself.

218
00:24:31,646 --> 00:24:35,058
Xuanji, you've been tricked by him!

219
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,538
<i>What is this?</i>

220
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:45,874
<i>I've seen it on you as well.</i>

221
00:24:45,874 --> 00:24:50,899
<i>I know. Ting Nu gave you this to help you recover, right?</i>

222
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,620
<i>Yes.</i>

223
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,653
Senior, you've misunderstood.

224
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:00,858
Ting Nu gave this to Sifeng to help him recover.

225
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:03,097
It's not a seal to conceal his demonic aura.

226
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:05,899
Father, I can guarantee with my life.

227
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:07,530
Sifeng is not a demon.

228
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,000
Xuanji.

229
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,239
Stop it.

230
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,576
Why should I stop?

231
00:25:13,576 --> 00:25:15,579
I'm going to explain it to them.

232
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:17,446
I'll tell them that you are not a demon.

233
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:18,580
- Yu Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng.

234
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,785
You still don't dare to tell Xuanji whether you are

235
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,269
a human or a demon?

236
00:25:24,794 --> 00:25:30,097
Sifeng, you told me that you were not a demon on Fuyu Island.

237
00:25:31,174 --> 00:25:33,339
You wouldn't lie to me, right?

238
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:36,019
Tell me that you are not a demon, Sifeng.

239
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:39,105
I'll believe whatever you say.

240
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:41,708
- I'll believe you. <br> - I'm sorry.

241
00:25:45,036 --> 00:25:46,796
I'm sorry.

242
00:25:56,483 --> 00:25:59,479
<i>You are Sifeng. Of course, I trust you, Sifeng.</i>

243
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:01,001
<i>I know that you are not a demon.</i>

244
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:04,257
<i>You have nothing to do with Tianxu Hall.</i>

245
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,199
I am not a demon from Tianxu Hall.

246
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,220
No.

247
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:20,579
No.

248
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,535
<i>Sifeng, you look so handsome when you smile.</i>

249
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,080
No.

250
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,409
Impossible.

251
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:38,250
<i>I've never thought that you were troublesome.</i>

252
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,704
<i>And I've never wanted to stay away from you.</i>

253
00:26:43,026 --> 00:26:44,866
Impossible.

254
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,179
Impossible.

255
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:50,830
<i>With me by your side, no matter what we face,</i>

256
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,210
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

257
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:54,240
<i>Sifeng!</i>

258
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,247
<i>Are you leaving because you are upset after I pushed you away?</i>

259
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:03,419
<i>I took off your mask.</i>

260
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,179
<i>Of course, I'll take responsibility of you.</i>

261
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,327
<i>Really?</i>

262
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:10,580
<i>You have different statuses.</i>

263
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,880
<i>And that is the greatest sin in their eyes.</i>

264
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,514
<i>You didn't see anything.</i>

265
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,243
<i>But you are so sure that I was wronged.</i>

266
00:27:20,243 --> 00:27:22,329
<i>- Do you trust me that much? <br> - Of course</i>

267
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:25,344
<i>I know what kind of a person you are.</i>

268
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,010
You are different from them.

269
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,857
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

270
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:34,920
<i>No matter what happened, you'll always be Chu Xuanji.</i>

271
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:38,143
<i>I do have some things to tell you.</i>

272
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:41,899
<i>But... I can't write it on the wind bell.</i>

273
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:43,995
<i>Because this is...</i>

274
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,583
<i>a secret that I have to bring to my grave with me.</i>

275
00:27:48,258 --> 00:27:52,317
<i>After you unlock this Lugong puzzle, you'll see it.</i>

276
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:54,402
<i>If she finds out about your real identity,</i>

277
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:56,679
<i>do you think she'll still protect you?</i>

278
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,840
<i>Xuanji is different.</i>

279
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,942
<i>She won't hurt me.</i>

280
00:28:17,474 --> 00:28:19,897
You are different from her.

281
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:24,480
The human clan always kills those who are not from the same clan.

282
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,671
Didn't you say that you'll love him forever?

283
00:28:28,671 --> 00:28:30,339
So what if he's a demon?

284
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:31,899
You can't love a demon?

285
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:34,459
Xuanji, time to wake up.

286
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:35,699
No.

287
00:28:35,699 --> 00:28:37,651
Lize Palace has killed so many people today.

288
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:39,899
If we don't get rid of them, there'll be serious consequences!

289
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:42,040
Arrest him!

290
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:08,780
Sifeng!

291
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,287
No.

292
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,037
No.

293
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,779
Sifeng!

294
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:23,014
Don't hurt Sifeng!

295
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,560
Sifeng.

296
00:29:32,323 --> 00:29:35,339
Sifeng! Say it.

297
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:40,299
Tell them that no matter what Lize Palace did, it has nothing to do with you.

298
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:45,079
Sifeng, tell them that what Palace Master did has nothing to do with you.

299
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:47,100
He and you are different.

300
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,680
You've never hurt anyone before.

301
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,620
Sifeng!

302
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,266
Sifeng, explain it to them!

303
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:59,664
Sifeng!

304
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,039
No!

305
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,599
Sifeng!

306
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,965
Xuanji, stop this obsession!

307
00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:06,479
Look carefully!

308
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,221
Not only is Yu Sifeng a demon,

309
00:30:08,221 --> 00:30:10,139
he's from the Rose Gold Bird Demon Clan who killed your mother!

310
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:14,379
That's right! Back then, your mother brought you to a medic and ran into

311
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,099
Heroine Haofeng who had been missing for years outside of Dianjing Valley.

312
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:18,894
She was chased down by the Rose Gold Bird Demon.

313
00:30:18,894 --> 00:30:22,648
You remember how your mother died, right?

314
00:30:22,648 --> 00:30:26,594
We and the Rose Gold Bird Demons are sworn enemies!

315
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,917
- Xuanji, believe me. <br> - Sifeng.

316
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:39,299
There must be a misunderstanding.

317
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,899
I'll get to the bottom of this.

318
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:47,251
Sifeng, are you still going to make things right for this girl?

319
00:30:47,251 --> 00:30:52,059
Fine. You should just let her kill me then.

320
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:55,079
It's you.

321
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,499
So, you are that woman's child.

322
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:01,858
If I had known, I would've killed you, too.

323
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,880
Master, what did you say?

324
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:28,104
The Rose Gold Bird Demon who killed my mother is you?

325
00:31:29,778 --> 00:31:33,277
You've always known about this right, Sifeng?

326
00:31:35,738 --> 00:31:38,019
I didn't keep this from you.

327
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:41,806
You've been lying to me, Sifeng!

328
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,675
Sifeng!

329
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:49,109
There must be a misunderstanding.

330
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:50,777
Xuanji.

331
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:58,899
Sifeng, you should've known that this is the result that you'd get!

332
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:13,233
So, you are that Rose Gold Bird Demon.

333
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:15,923
Today, I'm going to avenge my mother!

334
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:17,665
Come on!

335
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,641
Dingkun Sword!

336
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,677
Xuanji.

337
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:38,814
No.

338
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,760
Xuanji.

339
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,474
What kind of demonic spell is this?

340
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:19,582
He is absorbing our qi.

341
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,499
Master, no.

342
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,545
Master! No!

343
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,587
Xuanji.

344
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:53,974
Master, don't kill anyone anymore!

345
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:20,415
I'm going to kill you!

346
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,439
Xuanji, don't go there.

347
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,739
He's using his demonic core to gather up spiritual power.

348
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,667
It's very powerful. You'll get hurt.

349
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,199
I can't let him hurt them anymore.

350
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,191
Let go of me! I want to kill him!

351
00:34:33,191 --> 00:34:35,260
You can't kill him with your power now.

352
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,459
Believe in me. Xuanji.

353
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,189
Don't force me!

354
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,402
Sifeng!

355
00:35:15,234 --> 00:35:18,599
Xuanji, don't worry.

356
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,010
I won't let him kill anyone anymore.

357
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:08,330
Sifeng, you've been lying to me.

358
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,385
I'm sorry.

359
00:36:28,247 --> 00:36:30,078
Master.

360
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,904
Sifeng! What are you doing?

361
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:39,740
Master, stop.

362
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:41,899
Stop!

363
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,059
Yu Sifeng is a 12 Feathers Rose Gold Bird Demon, too.

364
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:48,276
Let's kill them together! Xuanji! Do it!

365
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,415
Sifeng!

366
00:37:18,885 --> 00:37:20,799
Sifeng.

367
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:30,340
Sifeng, your Lover's Curse has been activated.

368
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,221
Sifeng.

369
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:59,631
<i>Why is it like this?</i>

370
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,820
<i>I have to get to the bottom of this.</i>

371
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,554
Xuanji!

372
00:38:12,243 --> 00:38:13,911
Sifeng.

373
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,985
Xuanji is your demon. You are too obsessed with her.

374
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:30,781
Sifeng.

375
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:33,388
Master,

376
00:38:33,388 --> 00:38:37,504
am I going to die soon?

377
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:39,640
You'll be fine.

378
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,521
This is just the pain from the Lover's Curse.

379
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:49,547
With me here, you'll be fine.

380
00:38:57,554 --> 00:38:59,151
Come.

381
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,009
Sifeng, how are you feeling?

382
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:22,040
Go now.

383
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,124
I have to go back.

384
00:39:24,124 --> 00:39:25,899
Go back?

385
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:27,839
You are still thinking about that girl?

386
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,019
She saw that you were a demon.

387
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:31,130
She'll just think about the grudge with Rose Gold Bird Demon.

388
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,718
She just wants you dead.

389
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,978
No.

390
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:41,306
Xuanji will not be like that.

391
00:39:41,306 --> 00:39:44,002
I owe her this.

392
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:46,019
I have to make things right for her.

393
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:49,399
What a cursed relationship. What can I do to make you give up?

394
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:52,187
You know that she won't forgive you.

395
00:39:52,187 --> 00:39:53,886
She hates you.

396
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:56,841
Listen to me. Forget about her.

397
00:39:56,841 --> 00:40:00,661
Put her away from your mind and don't mention about her again.

398
00:40:00,662 --> 00:40:04,496
If you go back, you'll die.

399
00:40:04,496 --> 00:40:07,459
<i>You've been lying to me, Sifeng!</i>

400
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:09,644
<i>Sifeng!</i>

401
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:20,939
Sifeng.

402
00:40:41,227 --> 00:40:42,738
Sifeng!

403
00:40:42,738 --> 00:40:45,378
Look. She still won't let you go.

404
00:40:45,378 --> 00:40:48,147
She wants to kill us!

405
00:40:48,147 --> 00:40:49,893
Sifeng!

406
00:40:50,707 --> 00:40:53,167
Let him go! Don't take him away!

407
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:56,380
He is Lize Palace's disciple. Let him go?

408
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,259
- And let you kill him? <br> - Why would I kill him?

409
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:01,970
You are the only one I want to kill!

410
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,616
You are killing him with your heart.

411
00:41:04,616 --> 00:41:05,999
Nonsense!

412
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,960
This is all...

413
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:11,720
your fault.

414
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,215
I'm going to kill you!

415
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,858
Sifeng.

416
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,759
Sifeng!

417
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,934
Sifeng! Sifeng!

418
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,285
Why, Sifeng?

419
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,842
Tell me why you did this, Sifeng.

420
00:41:35,842 --> 00:41:38,860
Tell me.

421
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,450
Leave!

422
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,163
I don't want to see you anymore!

423
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,760
- Sifeng! <br> - Sifeng!

424
00:42:16,674 --> 00:42:19,679
<i>I told you that I'll teach you how to fall in love with me.</i>

425
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:21,499
<i>I won't leave.</i>

426
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:24,340
<i>Our previous lives are not important.</i>

427
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,461
<i>The one in front of me right now</i>

428
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:29,102
<i>is the one I care about the most.</i>

429
00:42:31,442 --> 00:42:33,902
You promised me.

430
00:42:33,902 --> 00:42:37,375
You said that you won't lie to me.

431
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,840
I trusted you so much!

432
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,120
Linglong!

433
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:39,694
This prosthetic hand is quite nimble.

434
00:43:39,694 --> 00:43:43,100
Long time no see. Do you know how much I missed you?

435
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,259
Do you miss me?

436
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:47,996
Let go of me!

437
00:43:51,243 --> 00:43:52,968
Don't be afraid.

438
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:57,120
You know that I won't hurt you.

439
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,012
You are indeed my Linglong.

440
00:44:03,012 --> 00:44:05,599
I love this personality of yours.

441
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,979
What are you doing?

442
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,296
- Let go of me! <br> - Come here!

443
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,139
- Let go of me! <br> - Wu Tong!

444
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:22,060
Stop! I'll fight you!

445
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,860
Linglong, are you okay?

446
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,779
- I'm fine. <br> - Linglong.

447
00:44:29,779 --> 00:44:32,539
Have you forgotten how intimate we were?

448
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,459
Shut up!

449
00:44:34,459 --> 00:44:36,482
I'm going to kill you.

450
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,579
Let go of me!

451
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:10,039
Linglong!

452
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:12,220
Let go of me!

453
