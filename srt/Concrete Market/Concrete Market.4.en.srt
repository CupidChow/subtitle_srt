4
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:56,553
I also boil seaweed soup like this...

5
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,153
You are in room 902

6
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:39,155
Have you ever thought about going in?

7
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:45,328
I think you want to be the owner of this market

8
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:46,538
Have you never tried it before?

9
00:02:53,753 --> 00:02:56,422
Put a knife in the chairman’s back?

10
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:58,091
There's nothing I can't do

11
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:00,343
Chairman Park is not really your father.

12
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:07,308
What was it like living outside for you?

13
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:11,980
Why is that?

14
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,773
Talk to me

15
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,526
How did I survive this far alone?

16
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,196
- It's nothing - so try it.

17
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,288
I am

18
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:33,001
I was born in a place that was ruined from the beginning.

19
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,461
I lived my life using waste

20
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:39,048
Suddenly the world came to ruin?

21
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:47,724
I guess that's why I lived longer than others, huh?

22
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:52,228
you?

23
00:03:52,854 --> 00:03:54,480
Um, what am I

24
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:59,485
Originally, I was at a convenience store in Cheonho-dong.

25
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:03,531
There, we were fighting over the leftover food.

26
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:05,742
I got stabbed in the leg

27
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:08,661
It festered there and I got a fever.

28
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:13,666
They say the gang is moving because the food is running out.

29
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:16,127
therefore

30
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:19,214
Those bastards voted in front of me

31
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:23,343
Then the guy who was the leader there came to me and took it.

32
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:26,596
He said, ‘I’m sorry, but I decided to leave you behind.’

33
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:31,809
in the basement

34
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:34,687
Dying alone like that

35
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:38,566
someone came down

36
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,747
It was the chairman.

37
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,710
If it weren't for the chairman at that time

38
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:00,213
I'm just in the basement

39
00:05:00,797 --> 00:05:02,131
would be dead

40
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,013
Even after coming here

41
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:10,765
For a long time, I thought about dying or not.

42
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:14,727
I barely recovered

43
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:21,234
To the Chairman and Lee Mi-seon

44
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:23,194
I owe you a lot

45
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:57,187
Are you here?

46
00:05:58,271 --> 00:05:59,314
huh

47
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:01,191
Sorry, are you awake?

48
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:03,526
that...

49
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:06,613
Do you remember what I said before?

50
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:08,072
what?

51
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:13,244
Well, I was on the 8th floor

52
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,371
I will take it out

53
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,419
Don't try too hard

54
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:28,968
sleep first

55
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:39,479
Why aren't you sleeping?

56
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:43,650
just

57
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:48,321
I think we should start with Park Sang-yong.

58
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:50,782
There's no way to meet you

59
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:53,910
Taejin Kim

60
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,623
I don't think I'll be able to afford it because I owe my life to Park Sang-yong.

61
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:08,883
I don't just owe you

62
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:11,970
It seems like I really love you

63
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:15,515
There's a problem here

64
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:17,934
Can you understand that?

65
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:25,108
Sister, what's wrong?

66
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:27,110
Where does it hurt?

67
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:31,739
Sehee

68
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:36,286
I need to meet the people selling drugs in person.

69
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:40,498
Oh, this is difficult.

70
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:42,709
Ah, we do business by digging in the ground.

71
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:43,751
No, that drug

72
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:44,711
I can't sell it even if I have it, that's

73
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:45,879
Hey, let's go

74
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,006
Just go, go

75
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,675
It's really the size of a mouse...

76
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:59,517
Stand in line, there's a lot to line up

77
00:07:59,517 --> 00:08:00,852
Canned food first

78
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:02,437
one by one, one by one

79
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:05,481
uh? Uh, why is this like this?

80
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:06,399
uh?

81
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,859
IC

82
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:09,903
Oh, is this a urine stream? Why is this happening?

83
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:11,738
Hey, what's wrong?

84
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:13,072
Why aren't you coming?

85
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:14,657
No, the water...

86
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:17,076
water...

87
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:18,077
what?

88
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,997
Chairman

89
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:23,374
Hey, Chairman.

90
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:25,752
in front of me

91
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:28,671
The sewer pipe in front of me was full of water and overflowed.

92
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:30,632
And there's this bastard's mask...

93
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:32,926
Not a single person can come down the sewer road.

94
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,177
You bastards, sir.

95
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:36,554
Let them do business and eat again, tsk.

96
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:38,389
This is definitely a curse

97
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:43,144
Because we eat well here and live together like this.

98
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:45,396
If water doesn't come out again this time

99
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:48,191
We'll all die this winter

100
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:50,068
Unlucky from the morning, Mr.

101
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:54,531
With sewage pipes blocked

102
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:56,074
I think it's happening again?

103
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:02,914
Someone who can solve this

104
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:06,125
doesn't exist?

105
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:17,136
Erra, Mr.

106
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:24,185
This is because the water from the Han River flows back into the sewage system after the rainy season.

107
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:26,813
uh?

108
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:28,398
I heard it was like that last year too?

109
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,319
If you listen to me, you won't ruin your business this time of year.

110
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:37,198
I'm in a sensitive state right now

111
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:39,826
Think carefully before speaking

112
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:42,161
That's tap water coming from the well over there and the mountain behind here, right?

113
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,498
If something exploded in front of me

114
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,500
If you find an external water pipe

115
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,669
We will be able to turn on the new water in a few days.

116
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,004
Do you have a map of the area?

117
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:54,966
A woman's intuition, something like that?

118
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:57,510
Fluid dynamics.

119
00:09:58,511 --> 00:09:59,470
what?

120
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:02,932
It's like opening a toilet.

121
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,225
Hey, Mr.

122
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,643
Oh my...

123
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:09,355
If you give it to me, I will solve it within 3 days.

124
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:14,444
Did you hear?

125
00:10:17,322 --> 00:10:18,239
yes

126
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:21,784
Have you had lunch?

127
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:26,206
Would you like to have lunch with me?

128
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:29,292
Can we solve it?

129
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:30,585
First of all, what

130
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:32,378
Hey, I'm doing something.

131
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:02,909
Why did you come forward?

132
00:11:03,284 --> 00:11:04,827
Don’t you know when to wear it and when not to wear it?

133
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,497
No, can you say that even after looking at the night ghost mask?

134
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:09,499
It's definitely the work of bastards

135
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:11,793
Ha, do you want to become Yagwi’s food?

136
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:13,795
Talk to the chairman somewhere

137
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:16,506
And don’t you remember Han Se-jeong?

138
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:18,800
Hehe, that's a different case

139
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,426
People say that

140
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:22,637
Sejeong had red spots on her body.

141
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:24,597
I guess he's not just dead, huh?

142
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,484
Does business seem to be going well?

143
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:49,914
It's that day

144
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:54,294
There's nothing dangerous, right?

145
00:11:58,506 --> 00:11:59,507
Get out of the way

146
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,801
I have to powder it.

147
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:02,886
send it to me

148
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:07,515
Let's go, cba...

149
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:18,943
Uncle, what is this?

150
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:20,862
That's listening to music, music

151
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,032
It's like a computer, right?

152
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:35,084
Write, I mean

153
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:36,336
If you look around,

154
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:39,130
The water may come out normally again within a few days.

155
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,131
This is it, right?

156
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:41,508
yes

157
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:43,551
I'll solve it if you add a few people.

158
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:46,262
Yeah, yeah

159
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:55,355
Why meat...

160
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:56,981
Don’t you like steak?

161
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:02,153
I liked Sejeong

162
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:05,823
Oh, you don't know?

163
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:07,575
Stay, my friend.

164
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:10,119
How old are you?

165
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:14,207
I'm eighteen

166
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:17,126
Hmm, I guess we were the same age.

167
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,882
I don’t think I’ve seen any girls my age here?

168
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:23,925
huh

169
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:27,345
Because he died

170
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:37,981
Ah, but how can you just see that?

171
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:40,149
Did you know it was a water pressure problem?

172
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:41,985
There's no way you don't know

173
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:43,695
The answer is obvious

174
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:46,072
It's a waste to have Kim Taejin by your side.

175
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,411
Did you study well?

176
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:54,747
What did you want to be?

177
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:57,750
Prosecutor

178
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:01,254
test

179
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:04,257
Because the ransom is high at law firms.

180
00:14:04,674 --> 00:14:05,800
law firm

181
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,015
When the world goes crazy

182
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,726
Those proud ‘buyer’ bastards

183
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:17,729
You couldn't adapt and just gave up first.

184
00:14:18,605 --> 00:14:19,564
But I

185
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:21,941
what am i originally

186
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,694
It was a jungle, living was

187
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:33,244
There's no need for laws or anything like that.

188
00:14:34,662 --> 00:14:35,788
thanks

189
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:37,957
I own this whole place

190
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,296
What do you think I used to do?

191
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:47,091
pharmaceutical company salesperson

192
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:51,304
Salary worker, whatever.

193
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:55,975
Oh, I was active in the union at that time and lived really hard.

194
00:14:58,061 --> 00:14:59,437
While I was doing that

195
00:15:00,188 --> 00:15:01,648
There's only one thing I learned

196
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:04,526
This is the company and the union.

197
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:07,904
He couldn't have everything he wanted

198
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:10,198
however

199
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:13,952
These scam bastards who are clinging to this company

200
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:16,371
These kids are getting higher salaries.

201
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:18,873
Because he got everything he wanted

202
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:20,750
In the end

203
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:25,630
Neither the company nor the union will win.

204
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:29,050
The only winner is Prakchi

205
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:35,098
Just looking at it now

206
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,017
You look like a winner

207
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:46,192
Are you asking me to become a friend?

208
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:47,151
What the heck

209
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:49,112
Sometimes while watching

210
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:52,824
Well, we talked about various things like this.

211
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:53,992
Let's have dinner

212
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,619
Taejin Kim

213
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:59,414
Even if something is wrong...

214
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:01,082
Taejin is good to me

215
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:03,835
however

216
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:07,964
I'm not really good at trusting people

217
00:16:08,882 --> 00:16:11,092
I don't know if I know his weaknesses

218
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:14,637
Why do I believe it?

219
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,432
I just told you

220
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:21,227
'Cause I know your weaknesses

221
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:23,980
yes?

222
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,440
I heard you were trying to buy medicine?

223
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,610
heart medicine

224
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,241
I need to meet the people selling drugs in person.

225
00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:42,498
what

226
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,127
But they say they take great care to prevent drugs from being sold separately?

227
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:47,837
don't worry

228
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:52,175
It's not insulin I'm dealing with, it's another drug.

229
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:54,177
What medicine?

230
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:57,263
A drug that without it, your life could go back and forth.

231
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:10,777
you give me information

232
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:13,363
I am to you

233
00:17:14,155 --> 00:17:15,615
give heart medicine

234
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:19,494
how is it? Simple, right?

235
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,965
your life belongs to me

236
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,725
See you often when I have work

237
00:17:57,699 --> 00:17:58,700
Sehee Han

238
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:01,119
Hey, Sehee

239
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:24,225
let's talk with me

240
00:18:57,926 --> 00:18:58,927
Whew

241
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:21,991
That's right

242
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,327
The clothes are the same

243
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:28,164
Ha, Mr.

244
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:35,171
Sejeong Han

245
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:38,049
Sejeong Han

246
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:40,134
Sejeong Han

247
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:08,037
What did you talk about with the chairman?

248
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:09,956
Not really

249
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:13,751
What about me?

250
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:14,919
Why don’t you say something?

251
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:18,423
Did my story come out?

252
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:20,717
Why, what are you saying?

253
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:22,427
They say you're doing great

254
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:25,096
- Really? - okay

255
00:20:25,763 --> 00:20:26,890
okay

256
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:28,933
what? speak quickly

257
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:31,519
Ah, there

258
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:34,439
There's actually one thing I'd like to ask of you.

259
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:38,193
I want to bring just one person here.

260
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:41,654
Room 802 is Lee Mi-seon.

261
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:44,032
Is there no way?

262
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:48,036
Park Cheol-min robbed us and made a living on the 8th floor.

263
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:49,913
Will you listen well?

264
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,836
I'm going to change it with the things I've collected so far.

265
00:20:56,836 --> 00:20:58,463
Ha, what?

266
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,173
Hey, it's in the warehouse.

267
00:21:00,173 --> 00:21:02,592
Are you saying we have to change the oil in time for winter?

268
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:04,969
And Park Cheol-min gave them money.

269
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:07,013
How many canned goods do you think you'd trade?

270
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:08,306
- Hey - What?

271
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:11,976
I know you're smart and I know you're good at it.

272
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:14,145
Are you saying I'm the boss?

273
00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:15,897
The decision is mine.

274
00:21:15,897 --> 00:21:18,483
Think of a way to bring Lee Mi-seon here first.

275
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,239
Oh, why the atmosphere...

276
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:26,324
What, did you just get scolded for confessing?

277
00:21:27,825 --> 00:21:28,910
Write a post, write a story

278
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:31,663
Our Taejin has tastes a little like this.

279
00:21:31,663 --> 00:21:32,705
Because it's unique, uh

280
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:34,207
That's right, that's right

281
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:35,458
think about it carefully

282
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:42,632
Hey, what's wrong? Hey, ah...

283
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,299
Should I at least lock the door from the outside?

284
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:32,223
How many canned goods did you exchange this for?

285
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,144
Are you only interested in canned food?

286
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:46,529
I'm sorry about earlier

287
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,782
I know you're doing it because you're worried about me.

288
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:57,081
Sejeong asked me for you

289
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:01,461
I am

290
00:23:03,129 --> 00:23:05,215
I definitely think so.

291
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:09,761
I really won't go out anymore

292
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:13,473
No one has seen your face, right?
