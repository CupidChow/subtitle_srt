1
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,042
Taejin Kim

2
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,333
I have to clean it up.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,125
You want to clean it up...

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:20,917
Let's kill him

5
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:26,042
From the moment that bastard touched my water

6
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,292
I'm already out

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,917
But I have the answer

8
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:33,625
There is no solution

9
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,167
To kill directly

10
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,208
Are you having trouble managing the remaining people?

11
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:48,583
Park Cheol-min, please lend me a hand.

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,375
That way the kids won't get mixed up.

13
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,375
where?

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,417
Well, I have something to tell you, so tell me to come up at 9 o'clock.

15
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:08,292
hey

16
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,333
Park Cheol-min tells me to come up.

17
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,708
yes!

18
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,167
Well then, as for Taejin Kim...

19
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll go and tell you

20
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:23,750
Still, I'm ignoring the guy I used to eat with.

21
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,958
You don’t even blink?

22
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:42,042
hey

23
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:45,292
I made it all up so just say you understand.

24
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:46,583
Ah, why are you like this?

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,125
I also have a style that adults find very attractive.

26
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,708
Take care of yourself

27
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,208
what's the matter?

28
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,083
Chairman Park is here

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,000
At 9 o'clock in room 902

30
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:25,792
why?

31
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,208
You want to make up and have a drink?

32
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,750
Why would I tell you that?

33
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,333
We met by chance, why?

34
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,042
What happened to you and Chairman Park?

35
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,542
just

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
okay

37
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:48,125
don't worry too much

38
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:33,458
Did I tell you?

39
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,292
They say they will let me eat everything here.

40
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:38,042
under...

41
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,792
What are you doing here?

42
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,792
You came alone?

43
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,167
Are you asking me to come alone?

44
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,333
Ah, I don't have that much doubt

45
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:20,167
What should I do?

46
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,708
from now on

47
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:22,708
Chairman?

48
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:27,667
here

49
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,125
What is this?

50
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,375
This is the chairman?

51
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,375
Close the door when you leave

52
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:40,000
thank you

53
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,500
Still, I'm the only one, right?

54
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:12,750
Chairman's heart

55
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,750
Ah, then

56
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:22,792
Then, hmm

57
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:25,792
When do you do that work?

58
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:27,167
I can write it, can I?

59
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,958
one...

60
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,792
I told you to come around 9 o'clock

61
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:39,417
Then I killed him on the street corner.

62
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,167
Write it then what

63
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,250
Can Taejin Kim just catch one person?

64
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,708
I told you to come alone

65
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,583
Well, since I'm an obedient kid, I'll come alone.

66
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,875
Ha, by the time it comes out

67
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,333
just kill it like that

68
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,708
yes!

69
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,208
Oh, by the way, Chairman.

70
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:04,208
Well, may I ask why you’re suddenly like that?

71
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,542
그 새끼가 선을 넘었어

72
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,042
Well, hmm

73
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,792
Well, I think there's some misunderstanding.

74
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,000
yes, well

75
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,875
You think that's what you did

76
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,792
Didn't someone, Park, Park Cheol, and Park Cheol Min do it?

77
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,958
And aren't you blaming me like this now?

78
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,000
Tae Jin Ah

79
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,333
That's not important now

80
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,292
I believe you did it

81
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,833
What's more important is that I've already decided to kill you.

82
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,667
I can't turn it back now

83
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,792
What am I like, tsk

84
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:09,583
The Chairman brought me in, gave me medicine, and saved me.

85
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,458
I thought you cared so much

86
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,375
Taejin probably knows that.

87
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,583
however

88
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,083
I brought it here because I thought it might be useful.

89
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,250
Ah, he kept making a fuss so I just left him to die.

90
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,583
Lee Mi-seon saved me.

91
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,833
So the medicine I gave you back then was

92
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,458
Just whatever, cheap vitamins

93
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:33,625
I'm going to save a bastard like that, that, that, mama's boy

94
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,958
Using antibiotics doesn't make sense.

95
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,375
It doesn't fit too well

96
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,458
Even if it’s like this?

97
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,917
What should I do?

98
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,750
You kill me first.

99
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:01,583
Park Sang-yong

100
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,542
If I know you're alive after today

101
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:08,083
You're done anyway

102
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:10,917
The only chance is today

103
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,667
Chairman Park is more evil than you know.

104
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,750
I'll do it

105
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,250
I'm going to kill you

106
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,125
I will also decide the time

107
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,375
What about Park Cheol-min?

108
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,000
don't worry about that

109
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,583
아, 이 개새끼 도망친 거야, 뭐야, 씨

110
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:56,958
kid!

111
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,083
No, I haven't figured out what happened for an hour.

112
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,083
I already solved it

113
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,333
I made a deal

114
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,625
Every time you say you're going to the 8th floor

115
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,958
Actually, I'm going to meet Park Sang-yong.

116
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,958
I don't know if your friends know?

117
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,375
Hey, Geunseok

118
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,750
근석이 개새끼

119
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,708
You have a severe headache because of your hearing loss.

120
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,250
You probably got the same offer as me for headache medication.

121
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,667
If you help me

122
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:07,500
All the headache medicine that comes in from now on is yours.

123
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,250
And now to Park Cheol-min’s seat.

124
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,542
I told you to come alone

125
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,708
Well, since I'm an obedient kid, I'll come alone.

126
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:22,708
Ha, by the time it comes out

127
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,167
just kill it like that

128
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,667
yes!

129
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,125
and

130
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,833
No, fuck, how could you do this to us, huh?

131
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,500
What should I do?

132
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,417
we'll do whatever you say

133
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,833
Ah, but we can run a bit on our own.

134
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,208
Park Sang-yong

135
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,083
There was always something being said to me

136
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,250
Stop acting like a brat

137
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,500
Become an adult

138
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,375
But we

139
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,250
The world abandoned me before I even grew up.

140
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,125
Now no one is spoon feeding me

141
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,375
survive on our own

142
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,458
You have to become an adult yourself

143
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,833
Now after tonight

144
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,333
There will be no one here more mature than us.

145
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,000
It's going to be a little noisy outside.

146
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
Don't go outside though

147
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,000
Didn’t Park Sang-yong notice?

148
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,042
Park Sang-yong is preparing dinner.

149
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,167
Without even dreaming

150
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,583
Who do you think you invited?

151
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,875
Same as my sister

152
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,625
dinner invitation

153
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,375
Look at this

154
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,042
It's true that Park Sang-yong also needs to die.

155
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,333
If things continue like this, everything could go wrong

156
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:50,875
What are you talking about?

157
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,375
It seems like the person who killed Sejeong was someone else.

158
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:08,917
Are you advertising that you know how to make poison?

159
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,708
There were red spots on Han Se-jeong's body.

160
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,292
Didn’t she take her medicine too?

161
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,000
It's like poisoning

162
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,875
There was a red spot

163
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,750
They say it's a poison that will do that if you eat it

164
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,458
Mi-seon Lee and her sister Tae-jin Kim are trying to take it out together.

165
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,208
He said he worked in a research lab.

166
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:40,667
You probably did it to get Park Sang-yong’s attention, right?

167
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,333
Because for that to happen, my sister has to disappear.

168
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:53,042
No evidence, need to check

169
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,625
After today, when you enter the 9th floor of Taejin Kim,

170
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,667
Doesn’t this all belong to her?

171
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,167
I'll check it later tonight

172
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,208
So you don't go out

173
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,167
Got it, go see it

174
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,458
Ah, headache medicine, headache medicine

175
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,250
yes

176
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,458
This bastard is asking you to take care of him.

177
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:48,417
Did Choi Hee-ro say it was room 109?

178
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,625
Yes, I think so.

179
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,583
Well, dinner is ready.

180
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,042
Will Lee Mi-seon call me?

181
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,125
I'll eat there tomorrow

182
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,333
Today I will meet someone different.

183
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,958
I have something to check.

184
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,417
What are you looking for here?

185
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,667
I want to occupy this place like you

186
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,542
Do you know that Miseon was trying to go to the 9th floor?

187
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,250
I only see what I want to see

188
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,042
Without even knowing why we are here

189
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,000
sorry

190
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:47,958
I saw that

191
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,042
Park Sang-yong...

192
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,333
개새끼가, 씨

193
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,792
okay

194
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,375
Everyone has to work to live here.

195
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,042
our kids

196
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,875
I let it in through the collapsed building.

197
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,750
Yeah, it's okay, it's okay

198
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,375
Daddy will be here

199
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,750
Oh, you're good, yeah

200
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:40,917
From then on

201
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,500
Park Sang-yong stayed away from us.

202
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:48,333
Sejeong was trying to help us.

203
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,792
So Sejeong used it?

204
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,875
like everyone

205
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,500
I don't just take advantage of others.

206
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:06,000
Sejeong wanted to kill me more than anyone else.

207
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:11,958
that day

208
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,292
thank you

209
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:26,958
For helping me

210
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,500
something is wrong

211
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:56,708
Mi-seon Lee

212
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,000
Where is Lee Mi-seon?

213
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,167
are you okay?

214
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,000
Choi Hee-ro

215
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,000
Why are you here?

216
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:15,542
what's the matter?

217
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,542
no

218
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,458
Park Sang-yong on the first floor

219
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,375
They said they kidnapped the girl.

220
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,167
Sehee
