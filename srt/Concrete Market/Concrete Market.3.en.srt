1
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:31,986
- Do you want to make a living? - Let’s do this now.

2
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:33,571
uh?

3
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:36,950
child, Mr.

4
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:38,201
Hey, catch it!

5
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:39,202
hey!

6
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:50,255
Ah, you fucking bastard!

7
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:11,359
Fuck you bastard...

8
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:32,338
hey

9
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:34,299
What if I faint?

10
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:35,383
Do you want to drag me along?

11
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:04,055
Hey listen to me

12
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:05,932
no

13
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:11,062
When we first started here together

14
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:12,939
Let's not be like the guys before.

15
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,357
What did I say?

16
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:15,608
water

17
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:18,152
It keeps coming out, so let’s wrap it up tightly and stop searching.

18
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:19,779
yes, water

19
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:22,448
Water is oil. Let’s create a market with it.

20
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:24,242
So what happened?

21
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:27,620
There was a rumor

22
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,623
Yes, that's right, the rumor got around.

23
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:32,625
Now, let's think about it.

24
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:36,504
What if I find just one convenient store that was buried neatly?

25
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:39,841
Medicine, food, oil,

26
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:42,802
They find everything and bring it to us.

27
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:47,056
So we all live well together, huh?

28
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,726
this

29
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:52,770
Isn’t this the Saemaeul Movement, huh?

30
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:55,023
Right, right. Uh, right.

31
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:57,275
It's all thanks to the Chairman that we live like this.

32
00:03:57,692 --> 00:04:00,153
Ah, but why did you do that?

33
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:03,364
I hope you live well because of me

34
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:06,117
I shouldn't have touched the items I sell.

35
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:08,286
Antibiotics, why, why

36
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:10,747
Why did you save it like that?

37
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:12,540
No, that's all nonsense.

38
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,958
Ah, indeed

39
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:18,505
I found it on the radio.

40
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:20,632
Oh, I said there was no canned food for this.

41
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:23,426
If you just take care of the things you keep bringing,

42
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,136
I was thinking of eating some leftover...

43
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,975
Now you're being honest.

44
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:33,269
Look, it’s good.

45
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:36,940
They say if we talk honestly like this, everything will be resolved.

46
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,733
Uh, I had no other intention.

47
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,069
I have no other intentions either.

48
00:04:47,325 --> 00:04:49,827
Huh? Oh, go to the temple

49
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,707
- Chairman! - Fuck, not like this!

50
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,459
Oh, fuck

51
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:59,838
Ah, ah, fuck

52
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:02,423
Oh, fuck

53
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:05,218
Man, this is so tough, Mr.

54
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:11,641
Sejeong is

55
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,477
I went there once, tsk

56
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:21,442
If we all let go

57
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:23,736
uh? Fuck, electricity, huh?

58
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:25,363
The wiring, fuck.

59
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:27,323
hey! Fuck this

60
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,326
It's like that again

61
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:37,458
Ah, me

62
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:41,713
what?

63
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:43,506
it's crazy?

64
00:05:43,756 --> 00:05:44,799
What are you doing?

65
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,259
child, Mr.

66
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:49,429
I also took books and tools from the radio shop.

67
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:51,556
I can do it

68
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:56,227
Well, shouldn't you be tempted by technology that doesn't matter?

69
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,021
Hey, who are you?

70
00:05:58,438 --> 00:05:59,272
ah

71
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:02,025
I am a new member who recently joined the family.

72
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:03,568
I will educate you properly.

73
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:04,819
No, no, no

74
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:06,571
That's right.

75
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:08,156
uh?

76
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:10,408
If you assume that you know how to do something,

77
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:12,160
I can't run here

78
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:15,371
Do your best

79
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:17,707
Ah, but

80
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:22,545
How did you know the medicine would leak through radio waves?

81
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:26,132
Oh, you said before that it seemed like less medicine was coming in.

82
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:29,302
Hey, did you use your head?

83
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:30,887
Oh no

84
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:32,305
then?

85
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:35,558
I counted the people coming in and the people leaving.

86
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:37,769
Did you tighten them one by one?

87
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:38,770
How many days?

88
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,940
yes yes

89
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,818
This is why I can't help but love Taejin Kim, Mr.

90
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:49,531
Do your best

91
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:51,449
Yes, I will work hard

92
00:06:56,955 --> 00:06:57,789
hey

93
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:00,917
Why do you keep doing things you weren't told to do?

94
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:05,797
Who was it that saved you without asking you to do so?

95
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,509
Hey, me too, Mr.

96
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:12,136
Fuck me too, I saw him catch that bastard driver earlier.

97
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:14,597
I tried to avoid you when you came, but you took the first step.

98
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:15,723
What is he?

99
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:18,601
I don't know, I guess it's Taejin Kim's new family.

100
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:20,436
- Ah - What are you looking at?

101
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:38,079
Come and see

102
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:39,539
Sehee Han

103
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,421
what?

104
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,174
What electricity?

105
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:52,385
Electricity secretly traveled from Park Sang-yong’s house to a radio shop.

106
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:53,595
I brought a bunch of them

107
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:55,805
This is also from there

108
00:07:58,808 --> 00:08:00,810
No more worries about storing insulin

109
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:07,025
Good

110
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,277
I could live trapped a little longer.

111
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:13,489
You didn't go out, did you?

112
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:17,160
I

113
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:20,455
I think I saw the person wearing that outside.

114
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:22,457
I guess it’s a trend

115
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:23,917
Why are you lying?

116
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:25,543
what?

117
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,342
Did you spy on me?

118
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,927
Post it in front of the door?

119
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:35,678
I have an idea

120
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:39,265
You decided to stay inside until it was safe.

121
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:42,101
What did you do outside?

122
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,022
They said Park Sang-yong killed someone again today.

123
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:50,902
What are you doing out there in danger alone?

124
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:55,198
What is this?

125
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:59,327
Are you going out dangerously just to buy something like this?

126
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:01,454
I need it

127
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:03,289
If Park Sang-yong finds out you are there...

128
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,000
Why do you see what you want?

129
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:32,694
Hey, in the meantime...

130
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:33,945
Oh, get out.

131
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:40,702
Do you have a lot of time?

132
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:42,787
Get ready for business

133
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:53,423
president

134
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:54,924
Just take a look and I'll pay you back.

135
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:57,051
So, can you please just take a look at the 8th floor?

136
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:00,763
go there

137
00:10:04,642 --> 00:10:06,186
Crawl back in

138
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:09,355
Make your choice

139
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:13,651
Ah, ah, no.

140
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:15,320
Just take a look!

141
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,285
Oh yeah, here's just one condom.

142
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:32,045
seed

143
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,258
Are you going to room 802 again?

144
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,761
what? Are you in puberty?

145
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:41,221
Don't start a fight for no reason

146
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:42,722
What does it matter to you?

147
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,307
I'm good, you idiot

148
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:45,725
It brings money to our area.

149
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:52,941
Wow, the cigarette seeds have dried up in our area these days.

150
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,901
Who said that

151
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:57,028
If you go to the first floor, there will be plenty of cigarettes.

152
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:03,576
So, fuck this

153
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:05,787
I went down to buy cigarettes myself.

154
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:08,957
But when I went there, they sold one can of cigarettes for a pack of cigarettes.

155
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:15,922
So, how much do I pay for a cigarette?

156
00:11:20,176 --> 00:11:21,386
They gave me three

157
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:25,306
what?

158
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,891
Is that business?

159
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:29,978
hey

160
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:31,855
No matter how much I buy it and how much I sell it...

161
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:34,274
But I also saw something interesting there.

162
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,568
Are you curious?

163
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:40,697
Do you know what this is?

164
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45,743
I marked it on our cigarettes.

165
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,290
Apparently, when I sold this, I sold it for two.

166
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:53,585
Hey, you guys are selling it again

167
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:55,503
What are you planning?

168
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:00,300
well

169
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:03,511
Well, if people buy from you and sell to me

170
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:04,512
I guess they knew it would make money

171
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:05,680
Fuck you, you stupid bastard

172
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,141
Where are you playing with prices, Mr.

173
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:10,518
We'll die together

174
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:11,895
Hey, you damn shoes

175
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:15,064
I just need to catch you

176
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:18,902
If you're broke too, sell it cheaper, you idiot.

177
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:20,570
You can't do it, right?

178
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:22,697
You can't do it, you idiot

179
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:27,660
I found out later than I thought

180
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,125
What is it

181
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:37,212
hey

182
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:41,090
Trust is the lifeblood of a transaction

183
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:44,010
Relationships are created through transactions.

184
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,887
In a world without family or anything else

185
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:48,556
Once you and I decide to be together

186
00:12:48,556 --> 00:12:50,600
Please give me the strength to believe in you

187
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:54,020
I explained everything.

188
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:58,566
What did you tell me?

189
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:01,027
As for canned food, collect Park Cheol-min's cigarettes.

190
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:03,321
Collect oil and solid fuel from leftover canned food.

191
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:04,822
What did you tell me about this?

192
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:05,823
Is this your explanation?

193
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:08,743
hey

194
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:11,162
Are you going to set a fire somewhere?

195
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,167
Oh, please explain.

196
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:19,212
The can that you said would make you make ten times as much is now gone.

197
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:20,213
What about cigarettes?

198
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:23,341
There are more people trying to sell than people trying to buy.

199
00:13:26,594 --> 00:13:27,470
good

200
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,015
Hey, what is good?

201
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:34,018
Even if I buy too much and sell it all, there won’t be any left.

202
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:39,065
Wow, these idiots, really.

203
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,859
fuck

204
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:43,403
Uh, does anyone know what day today is?

205
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:45,238
By the way, hey

206
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:46,698
In today's world, Mr.

207
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:49,325
Is the date important?

208
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:50,451
The weather doesn't matter

209
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:52,412
Today is September 23rd

210
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:56,499
were you counting it?

211
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:58,543
Don't you count?

212
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:05,884
This is enough

213
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:11,055
The rainy season will start soon

214
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:13,850
What do you need most at that time?

215
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:19,355
There won't be any new items arriving for a while from now.

216
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:21,816
The wood will be wet and it will be difficult to make a fire.

217
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:23,276
therefore

218
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:27,280
From then on, the price of solid fuel and oil was tripled.

219
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,991
Wow, Mr.

220
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:32,243
Oh, that's awesome.

221
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:34,162
What day is the hardest to quit smoking?

222
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,330
Day 3

223
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:37,332
okay?

224
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:41,878
Then they said there would be no items until the 3rd day.

225
00:14:41,878 --> 00:14:44,923
From the 4th day, 5 canned food

226
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,234
hey

227
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,444
- Bring it - Oh, yeah, yeah

228
00:15:06,444 --> 00:15:07,904
Hey, hey, get it right, get it right

229
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:09,781
Now, five cans, five cans.

230
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:11,324
here...

231
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:13,868
yes? Ah, here, here

232
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:14,869
Now, now, now

233
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:18,289
Okay, five cans, uh.

234
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:19,707
solid fuel

235
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:20,708
2 cigarettes

236
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,336
Now, stand in a straight line. Line, line, man.

237
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:24,587
Now, gasoline, 6

238
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:26,673
Now, now, next, next

239
00:15:26,673 --> 00:15:28,341
- Hey, don't take it. - Huh?

240
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:31,469
Oh my, really

241
00:15:34,556 --> 00:15:35,932
Now, give me some canned food first.

242
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,475
Quick, quick, uh

243
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:39,435
Now, solid fuel, oil, cigarettes

244
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:41,104
Ah, all around, all around

245
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:41,938
Now, now, now

246
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:43,857
Now, get the cans, five of them.

247
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:44,858
5

248
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:55,201
Didn't you collect the money?

249
00:15:58,121 --> 00:15:59,831
Because it's rainy season...

250
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:01,457
Business wasn't good

251
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:02,876
Things aren't coming in well.

252
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:05,253
Oh, what, is it only rainy season in your area?

253
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,672
That's because Kim Tae-jin hoarded it.

254
00:16:07,672 --> 00:16:08,965
Hoarding?

255
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:11,259
Why do you make excuses like that for everything you do?

256
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:15,805
I did it in advance to prepare for the rainy season, just

257
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,225
Oh, your risk management skills.

258
00:16:19,684 --> 00:16:22,187
Don’t hidden abilities come out in times of crisis?

259
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,273
If you leave it to me

260
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:27,150
We will prevent it from raining until the 8th floor.

261
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:31,446
Wouldn’t that be much more efficient for the imperial palace?

262
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:34,324
Cheolmin needs to make a living too.

263
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:36,326
Why are you being so greedy?

264
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:39,787
Let's stay still

265
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:43,208
Then

266
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,962
Taejin Kim ate the entire parking lot.

267
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,757
Manage it back to the 2nd floor

268
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:53,426
Chairman, but then we

269
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:55,845
What should I eat for a living?

270
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:57,722
There's the 8th floor, the 8th floor.

271
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:01,768
Hey, what is going on there all year round?

272
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:09,734
But what?

273
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:12,904
‘What should I eat for a living?’

274
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:18,535
What you're saying is a bit hard to hear.

275
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:20,453
Are you angry?

276
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:24,791
no, sorry

277
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:30,713
Taejin does it all the way to the 4th floor.

278
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,676
thank you

279
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:35,802
Uh oh

280
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:38,221
Hey, take this.

281
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:40,723
thank you

282
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:41,724
I'll do well

283
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:43,017
huh

284
00:18:05,248 --> 00:18:06,165
ruler

285
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,668
I measured it two days ago too.

286
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:10,253
That was back then

287
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:12,589
Postprandial blood sugar is also important.

288
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:15,425
look

289
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:18,428
look

290
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,056
Without me, you have to take care of everything.

291
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:24,267
The same thing happened last time

292
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,144
What are you going to do without me then?

293
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:52,212
How old are you that you can’t do that?

294
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:55,924
just

295
00:18:56,508 --> 00:18:58,343
Because there was no need to do anything

296
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:05,433
We were close

297
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:07,477
It's really different from my sister.

298
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:16,528
I was sorry last week

299
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,656
I will now help my sister with her plans more.

300
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:22,075
What are you going to do next?

301
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:24,994
I found a refrigerator

302
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:28,623
I need to get a steady supply of insulin.

303
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,961
It is not easy for Park Sang-yong to manage the medicine alone.

304
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:40,093
Hey, Choi Hee-ro, it's me.

305
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:47,267
Uh, why?

306
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:50,103
Well, I guess Hyunmin isn’t feeling well.

307
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,688
Come stand guard with me.

308
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:53,648
okay

309
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:01,698
Hey, you don’t know the lyrics, right?

310
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,535
You don’t know, Yongseok, huh?

311
00:20:05,827 --> 00:20:08,621
How frustrating must it be for me to call without knowing it?

312
00:20:08,913 --> 00:20:10,081
You little bastard

313
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:12,083
This bastard is now a palace idol...

314
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,543
Idols are gone, hey

315
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:23,386
Hey, what is that sound coming from over there again?

316
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,356
Hey, don't be scared, don't be scared

317
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:37,817
Ah, just look at those bastards again, huh?

318
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:39,402
Look to see if there's anything

319
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,447
There’s a guy at that radio station.

320
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:43,948
I saw you the day before yesterday?

321
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:45,700
It was all ripped away

322
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:48,786
Ah, you disgusting bastards.

323
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:50,872
They're fucking bastards, really.

324
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:53,249
Ah, Mr.

325
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:54,542
Oh, fuck, I'm surprised.

326
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:56,628
Oh, what a surprise.

327
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:58,671
You little bastard

328
00:20:58,671 --> 00:20:59,881
Hey, take shifts.

329
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:01,549
What about Hyeonmin?

330
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:02,634
They say it hurts

331
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:04,135
Damn, I was fine until now.

332
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:05,094
Where does it hurt?

333
00:21:05,094 --> 00:21:07,013
They say it suddenly hurts everywhere

334
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:08,848
Why are you angry...

335
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:09,849
hey

336
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:11,559
what?

337
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:13,186
Hey, did you really bring it?

338
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:14,312
Yay, Mr.

339
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,481
Hey, wait a minute

340
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:23,613
Hey, it's cool, huh?

341
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:26,699
Thanks to Choi Hee-ro, I can eat something refreshing for the first time in years.

342
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:27,909
thanks

343
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:30,787
Hey, don't eat it all by yourself.

344
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:31,996
Take care of Hyunmin too

345
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:34,624
You shouldn't feed this to a sick child.

346
00:21:50,932 --> 00:21:51,808
what?

347
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,393
Do you have anything to say?

348
00:21:58,064 --> 00:22:00,066
Starting tomorrow, we will eat up all the parking lot.

349
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:02,068
We decided to manage up to the 4th floor.

350
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:04,279
That's good

351
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:11,202
Anyway, that's how it happened

352
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:14,247
Well, this time you...

353
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:15,498
Thanks to me?

354
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:17,667
I know, stop mumbling

355
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:23,298
Well, at first it was a bit

356
00:22:24,174 --> 00:22:26,634
I was tied up like shit, but

357
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:28,469
Well, now together

358
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,054
Well, like this

359
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:32,265
Because we are a team

360
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:35,727
You have some faith in us too, huh?

361
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:37,979
why are you laughing?

362
00:22:39,063 --> 00:22:40,773
Ah, what a bluff.

363
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:43,568
Can't you do anything without them?

364
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:45,528
Hey, what can't you do? I'm all alone too...

365
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:47,322
Do it all

366
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:49,282
Well, there are some things I can't do alone.

367
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:51,034
anyway

368
00:22:52,994 --> 00:22:55,079
Well, if I keep being with you

369
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:58,374
Well, I think you can eat upstairs.

370
00:22:58,374 --> 00:22:59,959
Something like that, I thought about it.

371
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:10,678
I do what he wants

372
00:23:10,678 --> 00:23:12,889

376
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:29,656
I will take revenge

377
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:34,786
