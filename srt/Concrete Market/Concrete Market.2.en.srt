1
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,083
Sejeong

2
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:40,958
what?

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,708
What happened to this?

4
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:45,833
This is Chairman Park’s woman.

5
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:12,500
What are you doing?

6
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,750
You're telling me to clean it up.

7
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:21,792
one, two

8
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,250
Hey, hold my arm, hold my arm

9
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:29,708
Oh, wait, wait

10
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:30,917
Hey, is this your first time catching a girl?

11
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:33,000
What the fuck, he really is

12
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,833
Hey, what are you doing without opening the door, you bastard, hurry up

13
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,125
Hey, come out, come out, come out

14
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,708
Oh, fuck, the door is so damn narrow.

15
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,500
No, but why did that bitch lose?

16
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,417
I don't know, fuck

17
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,167
Hey, do you want to rummage too?

18
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:35,875
No, ah...

19
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:40,500
No way, you bitch

20
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,500
이 쥐새끼 같은 년 야, 통조림 얻다 놨냐, 어?

21
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,375
Hey

22
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,375
I got some canned food! You fucking bitch, huh?

23
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:50,166
what's the matter?

24
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:51,667
what?

25
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:10,375
Hey, you have to find your bag first.

26
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:49,833
Hey, it's cool

27
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,292
huh

28
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,208
Are you on a diet?

29
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,875
wow

30
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,542
No, but what did Han Se-jeong do wrong?

31
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:05,875
After receiving so much joy,

32
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,792
Why did they really kill him?

33
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,417
Something must have upset me

34
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,208
i saw it before

35
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,083
He hates it even if my fingertips touch his body.

36
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,917
But why do you always go whenever I call you?

37
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,333
He's a diabetic.

38
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,208
ah

39
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,292
I can't live without insulin injections.

40
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:25,333
But who manages the medicine that comes into the imperial palace?

41
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,542
ruler

42
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,500
- It's Chairman Park. - Um.

43
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,792
Hey, once you move in here

44
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,208
Park Sang-yong can't live without medicine.

45
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,500
So what the fuck, you don’t like this, huh?

46
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,958
Can we get out, huh?

47
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,375
Hey, it's not Park Sang-yong, it's the chairman?

48
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,250
What the fuck is the Chairman, your friend?

49
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,333
Oh, I really think I'm going to pretend

50
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,125
Fish oil, anyway, loyalty loyalty

51
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,625
Ah, but bro

52
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,542
Room 109, where Han Se-jeong lived.

53
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,792
Can you give it to me there?

54
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,000
Hey, you bastard, you

55
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,875
Hey, be quiet.

56
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:06,250
Be quiet. Shit. I think he's awake.

57
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,792
Hey, where did you put your bag?

58
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,375
Tell me, where did you put your bag?

59
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,250
Why are you looking for my bag?

60
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,750
There's our canned food in there.

61
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,542
Do you have any proof that I stole it?

62
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,333
You were disguising yourself from the beginning, right?

63
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,417
To make it easier to steal

64
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:39,083
Wow, she's a bitch

65
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,583
When you say something nice, it blows quickly

66
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,500
Yesterday was the worst because of you, Mr.

67
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,458
Hey, the thieves here are just executed.

68
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:49,292
Pigeon

69
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:53,375
Then as you say

70
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,208
If I see canned food in my bag, I'm going crazy.

71
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,292
Why should I tell you?

72
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:04,458
I can't do it.

73
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,083
how is it?

74
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,583
Do you feel like talking?

75
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,750
me today

76
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,667
Did you think it would be better to just die?

77
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:43,875
therefore

78
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,958
Just kill me, you fucking bastard.

79
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:56,917
You guys are out.

80
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,042
hey

81
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,875
Just tell me where your bag is

82
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:18,875
They say they will just send it to you once the item is confirmed?

83
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,000
Originally, I couldn't even imagine it in the imperial palace.

84
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,875
It's unprecedented

85
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,500
I said I would do that.

86
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,167
yes me too

87
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,625
I just want to go back too

88
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,667
Sejeong

89
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,625
It's too dangerous today, so let's go home first.

90
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,625
He's a diabetic.

91
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,167
I do what he wants

92
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,792
I get what I want

93
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,792
But Sejeong

94
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,917
I didn't have diabetes

95
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:20,917
what?

96
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:22,458
What did you say?

97
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:23,708
what?

98
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,792
I'll tell you everything, I can explain everything

99
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,417
I have to go early today

100
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,208
He looks like him

101
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,417
Of course they look alike, they are sisters

102
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,708
They really look alike

103
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,042
Sehee...

104
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,375
Come to your senses

105
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,208
Where is your bag? Bag!

106
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:57,875
Is the bag location wrong?

107
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,000
Ah, we searched here and there in our spare time.

108
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:02,417
I can't see it

109
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,208
Hey Taejin

110
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,750
no time anymore

111
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,542
There really isn't one, you fucking idiot

112
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,083
I'm tearing my jaw apart, Mr....

113
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,792
fuck

114
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:25,042
I said I would rip you apart, you fucking bitch.

115
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,042
uh?

116
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:32,125
hey! Fuck you guys, I told you not to knock on the door, right?

117
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,125
- what? - Brothers, you're in big trouble.

118
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,708
Park Cheol-min's kids are coming in with weapons...

119
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,542
Hello, you idiots?

120
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,167
What the fuck are you doing in someone else’s territory?

121
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,292
high

122
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,792
No, here, these bastards who sell alcohol

123
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,333
I heard it was all torn down and empty.

124
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,583
I'm trying to get my kids to enter the store.

125
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,667
Did you turn around?

126
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,458
It seemed like there was something to hide.

127
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,125
What happened to the money you collected?

128
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,792
Damn it, you idiot.

129
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:20,083
I'll turn a blind eye to that

130
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:21,458
hand it to me here

131
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:28,125
Well, fuck you bastard.

132
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,083
야, 내가 너희들끼리 욕하지 말랬지, 이 개새끼야

133
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,000
This fucking guy is going to die

134
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,333
Hey, fuck off.

135
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,208
You don’t like it?

136
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,708
It's falling apart

137
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:39,667
Is it happening?

138
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,458
Try it

139
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,417
You can’t do it, you stupid bastard?

140
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,667
Before the world turned to this way

141
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,792
I've never heard your bastard's name

142
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,333
Be honest.

143
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,542
Have you heard my name?

144
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,917
Have you ever been ripped off by me?

145
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,958
Damn it, you bastard

146
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,167
Did you go crazy trying to get it?

147
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,167
Ugh, I was crazy.

148
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:03,458
This fucking bastard

149
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:26,917
why

150
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,667
Are you scared?

151
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,958
It's scary, fuck

152
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,917
I'm excited to beat you

153
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,875
Brother, brother, I have to go out.

154
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,458
Wake up, this is an aftershock

155
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,042
brother

156
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,708
It's okay, stay where you are!

157
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,750
Announcement from the merchant association

158
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,833
Because this is just a brief aftershock

159
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,042
They just ignore me

160
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:14,708
Get ready at the opening time as usual.

161
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,458
Hey, I'll just do this for today.

162
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,500
Damn that shit

163
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
But you

164
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,417
How about you all just come under me?

165
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:35,917
I'll take good care of your salary

166
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,417
hey

167
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,708
Then do I have to shave my head like you do?

168
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,792
Your hair style is so lame

169
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,333
I'll refuse that

170
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:46,875
Tae Jin Ah

171
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:51,167
Do you really not know why the Chairman is raising the two of us?

172
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,500
The two of us compete for loyalty

173
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,792
He runs the palace with total ease.

174
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:56,792
우리 지금 저 개새끼한테

175
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,000
- You're being eaten, you idiot! - 이 개새끼야

176
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,792
회장님이라고 부르라고, 개새끼야

177
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,333
이 개새끼가 또 이상한 데서 발작을 하네

178
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,042
Do you want to lose?

179
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,375
But today

180
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:21,208
내가 못 봐 줘, 이 개새끼야

181
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,542
hey

182
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,583
Now, let's go, okay?

183
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,625
씨, 개새끼가

184
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,542
Oh, fuck bastard

185
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,958
Isn't that what I originally came here for?

186
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,417
What, you said you couldn’t watch it?

187
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:51,583
Try it, okay?

188
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,417
하려던 거 해 봐, 이 새끼야

189
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,167
해 봐, 하려던 거 이 개새끼야!

190
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,542
Oh, fuck, really.

191
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,000
씨, 개새끼야

192
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,833
Fuck, say that again.

193
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:20,208
이 씨발 놈이, 개새끼야

194
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,125
This fucking bastard is going to die

195
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,917
죽어, 이 개새끼야

196
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,167
Hey, what are you doing?

197
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,167
What are you doing?

198
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,125
You asked

199
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,542
I'll explain everything.

200
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:48,542
explain

201
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,458
It's 30 minutes before business starts.

202
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,625
Why are you going crazy here?

203
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,292
Park Cheol-min said he would do business as he pleased in an abandoned commercial building...

204
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:58,167
And about the Chairman...

205
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,292
Taejin Kim lost his payment.

206
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,458
It was stolen

207
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,583
So I said I would help, and this guy...

208
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,208
Is it true?

209
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,833
No, I never asked for help...

210
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,958
no

211
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,458
Is it true that the down payment was stolen?

212
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,917
Room 109, where Han Se-jeong lived.

213
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,500
Can you give it to me there?

214
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,583
I caught the thief in room 209.

215
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,875
Oh, fuck

216
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,875
here

217
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:08,500
Let’s open the store with Cheolmin’s family.

218
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,417
and

219
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,875
Cheolmin does all the management here.

220
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:21,958
you

221
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,333
i am now

222
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:29,042
I'm glad they didn't kick you out.

223
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:19,667
I'm a diabetic

224
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Sehee

225
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:36,208
Sister...

226
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,708
sister

227
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,792
Why are you here so late?

228
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,375
I...

229
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,292
Sehee

230
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:07,333
Sehee

231
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,708
sister

232
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,833
Sister...

233
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:32,917
My sister

234
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,750
If you know I'm a patient

235
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,208
Park Sang-yong said that person would be targeting him.

236
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,708
on my behalf

237
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:59,333
I made fake needle marks on my arm.

238
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,625
I do what he wants

239
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,000
I get what I want

240
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,833
Did you die because of me?

241
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,542
Sehee Han

242
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
no

243
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,000
I didn't die because of you

244
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,583
At this rate, it will all melt in two days.

245
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,167
sister

246
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,208
She said it would be dangerous if she got caught.

247
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,125
Don't worry about me, just get out of here.

248
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,458
I'm anyway

249
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,125
There's nowhere else to get insulin if it's not here...

250
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,042
Sehee Han

251
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,042
you

252
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,125
Don't think about anything else

253
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:28,208
I will take revenge

254
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,458
you just

255
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,875
Just think about being alive

256
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,458
I'm going to live here until you're safe.

257
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,292
This is not a place where you can live just because you want to.

258
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,542
Sister Sejeong too

259
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:49,208
I was able to buy it through a deal with Park Sang-yong.

260
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:52,875
don't worry

261
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,792
I have something I can trade too

262
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,000
Just hold on a little longer

263
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,667
I'll get it out somehow

264
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,083
What on earth are you?

265
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:24,417
I also took all the luggage from your trunk.

266
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:31,792
What do you want?

267
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,583
Yes, I stole it.

268
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,917
I know, fuck, I know everything.

269
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,875
If you just do one favor to me

270
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,417
I'll give it all back to you gently.

271
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:46,542
I want to live here

272
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:48,875
Please accept me as your subordinate.

273
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,583
what?

274
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,500
It's dangerous to go outside

275
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,125
I kind of liked it here.

276
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:59,292
But we can't live together in this pigsty.

277
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,833
I heard there is an empty house on the first floor?

278
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,000
What are you doing in your right mind?

279
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,042
You said you gave it back

280
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,542
Now this is our capital

281
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,125
What capital?

282
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,167
Fuck, are you really a idiot?

283
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,792
This is the market

284
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:34,042
Let’s try doing business with this too.

285
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:38,875
Isn't this supposed to be stolen anyway?

286
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,667
It's driving me crazy, really.

287
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:54,917
I will increase this canned food tenfold within two months.

288
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:01,792
no?

289
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,292
How can I trust you?

290
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:19,917
This is enough

291
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:24,292
I will increase this canned food tenfold within two months.

292
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:28,292
The rainy season will start soon

293
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:51,292
fuck

294
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:54,417
okay

295
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,375
I don't know either

296
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:04,708
Let's do our best

297
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,250
colon
