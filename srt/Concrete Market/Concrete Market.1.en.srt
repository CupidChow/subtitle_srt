1
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:08,083
You listen to music all the time, what do you want to do when you graduate?

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,292
Hey, that's enough

3
00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:13,167
I wonder who is number one in the whole school?

4
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,167
Do you like it?

5
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,333
I don't like it

6
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,958
- Hey, let's do that later. - What?

7
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, you know how to take pictures yourself?

8
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:23,125
Are you doing well? You can't do this alone.

9
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,000
Ah, I wanted to try this flavor too.

10
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:26,542
please

11
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,333
It's red grapes

12
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:31,250
Look, this comes in three flavors.

13
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,667
Is this a carrot?

14
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:39,375
So what are you going to do?

15
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,042
What does it have to be?

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,208
just listen to music

17
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,667
I can play with you for the rest of my life

18
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:52,833
Ah, it's dazzling

19
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,750
- Do you want to eat? - delicious?

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm eating it and it's delicious

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,542
delicious?

22
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,167
Fucked.

23
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,292
I thought it was all over like that

24
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,708
But these cockroaches and humans

25
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,208
This is a bit harsh, huh?

26
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,542
Wow

27
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:42,625
Exchanging what we need

28
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:45,167
I survived very well.

29
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:46,750
No, no, no.

30
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,250
- No, no, no! - Give it to me!

31
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,458
I told you no!

32
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,500
As this keeps piling up,

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,125
A market is created?

34
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,250
And at the top of the jungle

35
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,750
I just stood up

36
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:31,417
huh

37
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,833
You can get anything if you come here

38
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,125
What about canned food?

39
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,583
When the siren sounds

40
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,208
Remember that everyone has to leave

41
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,083
Because if you don’t go out, you’re considered a thief.

42
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't misunderstand me

43
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:48,958
You won't make it to the 8th floor in that condition.

44
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:50,958
Go see

45
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:52,708
8th floor?

46
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,667
That's where the idiots with nothing to sell go.

47
00:06:58,667 --> 00:06:59,667
If you go to the 9th floor

48
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,542
Maybe there is something we can give and receive.

49
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,333
Go see

50
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,167
open your ears

51
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:20,708
open your heart

52
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,542
You must open your mind and listen to the sounds of the world.

53
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,792
Folks, the end of the world has come

54
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,667
It's all in the Bible

55
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,292
Look at the Bible, folks.

56
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:36,542
Everything is contained in this

57
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:37,917
Today again, without fail

58
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:39,333
Is it raining or is it windy?

59
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,500
To all of you who came to our market in one step

60
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,458
Expressing gratitude to the Merchants' Association

61
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,542
Please let me know

62
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,875
As you know

63
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,958
When a transaction that does not belong to the merchant association is detected

64
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,292
Don't forget to be summarily disposed of.

65
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:57,042
I hope you have a happy shopping day today too.

66
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,292
The end of the world has come!

67
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,500
It's all in the Bible

68
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:05,917
Look at the Bible, folks.

69
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,708
Everything was predicted

70
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,042
Give me some oil, just one bottle

71
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:13,792
Oh, there's money here. They said they'd give me money, money

72
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,708
- Oil... - Child

73
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,583
Don't do anything useless

74
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,667
Bring the canned food, canned food

75
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,792
Everyone, you have to believe what I say.

76
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,708
open your ears

77
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,458
open your heart

78
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,333
You need to listen to the sound of heaven, everyone.

79
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,125
Oh my, I guess I'm crazy

80
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,708
Look at that, look at that, oh my, oh my

81
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,500
개새끼야

82
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,042
Ah, you really are a Jesuit bastard, Mr.

83
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,167
These friends are like this

84
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:58,417
That's not what you guys do, huh?

85
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,375
- No matter how bad the world is, it's like that - The end?

86
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,458
Jesus

87
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,917
He sacrificed himself on the hill of Golgotha.

88
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,667
Let's all live together

89
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,167
They said so, but these friends

90
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,750
Oh, fuck

91
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,375
The people who were nailed next to him

92
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:22,792
You know that they are all thieves, right, Deacon?

93
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,125
catch

94
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,542
Hey, hey, what is it?

95
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:29,667
Let go, hey, hey, hey, wait a minute

96
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,625
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

97
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,917
Hey, don't shake it, hold it tight

98
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:40,417
Wait a minute, wait a minute

99
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,875
Oh my, really

100
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,458
What are they?

101
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,500
Chairman Park Sang-yong’s harpsichord

102
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,500
Are there only boys?

103
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,250
All the young women are on the 8th floor

104
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,750
What are you looking at? Are you not doing business?

105
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,708
- Hey, come out, come out, come out - Ugh, tsk.

106
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,917
Fuck, really

107
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,792
don't doubt me

108
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:07,375
Trust in the Lord, trust in me

109
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,333
believe in the lord jesus

110
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,625
Are you in a lot of pain?

111
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,500
This, this

112
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,333
hello

113
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,833
So, uh, ah, okay.

114
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:28,667
next

115
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,083
Baby, don’t worry, just give it to me quickly.

116
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,333
Next, next Mincheol has 3, right?

117
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,167
kid, it's good

118
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,417
okay

119
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,625
Where are we left now?

120
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,458
moonshine shop

121
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,708
- what? Fuck - what, huh?

122
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,917
Where did these bastards go without doing business?

123
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,500
- Hey, open the door - Uh.

124
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,083
what's the matter?

125
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,250
- Oh, open the door. - Okay, okay.

126
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,375
Do it fast, you bastard.

127
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,458
Anyway, fuck this guy

128
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:04,083
Ah, sir...

129
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,875
I think you're all lost here, bro?

130
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,792
Hey, come out

131
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,292
Ah, what are these bastards doing?

132
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:13,000
It fell apart after the accident, you idiot.

133
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't you have eyes?

134
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,583
Hey, take it out

135
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,250
Ah, these guys are real

136
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,583
Ah, you damn answerless bastard

137
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,417
Ah, it's so fucking heavy, ah, sir

138
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,625
Hey, what about our canned food?

139
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,708
uh?

140
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,625
Oh, fuck

141
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,500
Hey, fuck

142
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,667
What are you doing! Quickly go out and find it!

143
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,667
Oh really, Mr.

144
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,417
Everything was robbed

145
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,292
Everything was robbed

146
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,083
Everything was robbed

147
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,125
Everything was robbed

148
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,375
The good Samaritan stole it all.

149
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,375
What are you talking about?

150
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:13,625
So, wave your hands

151
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,542
Me, ugh!

152
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:19,042
Baby, don't talk nonsense, tell me straight, Mr.

153
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,833
Oh boy, fuck

154
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,167
do not worry

155
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,208
Believe in Jesus, believe in me...

156
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,917
No, fuck, how many times?

157
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,667
Are you saying there's no need for this?

158
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,667
You said this was a prophetic book, right?

159
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,333
yes

160
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,250
From earthquakes to tsunamis, it was all here.

161
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,458
No, then what are you doing reading now?

162
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,292
It's already ruined

163
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,042
Why is this?

164
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,083
I heard it's a barter here.

165
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,083
for a moment

166
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,667
This is expensive.

167
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,000
Would you like a refund?

168
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
huh?

169
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:10,542
ah...

170
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:13,458
Give me a bottle and give me medicine

171
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,167
I want you to shake it all off and follow me.

172
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,667
I thought you guys were a gang.

173
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:20,708
You followed us?

174
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:21,750
uh

175
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,375
stealthily

176
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,167
He chased after me with the dust on the dog's tail.

177
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:27,167
seed...

178
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:30,708
No, I looked around everything.

179
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,917
There was no bastard with a gunny sack.

180
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,500
What are you doing? Are you not looking for it again?

181
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:51,583
Oh, fuck, I'm fucked.

182
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,833
Hey, didn't you go out?

183
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,333
Oh fuck, just follow me

184
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,042
Where are you going?

185
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,500
We have to block the entrance first.

186
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:01,000
What are you talking about? It's already deadline

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,167
Ah, if you get caught, you'll be screwed.

188
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,542
Wait, wait, wait, wait

189
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,542
What are you doing now?

190
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,167
It's no big deal

191
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,917
Because I received a report that there was a thief.

192
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:16,542
Don't open until closing time

193
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,708
Hey, did you find it?

194
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,708
Did you find it?

195
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,292
Ah, Mr.

196
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,833
No, we're always behind on our payment to Park Cheol-min's, Mr.

197
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:32,958
Fucked.

198
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,083
You're a good asshole, huh?

199
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,917
Can't you take care of any of that properly?

200
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:38,708
Hey, fucking idiot, did I do that on purpose?

201
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,958
Are you complaining about what you did well?

202
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,750
Stop it, stop it! fuck

203
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,375
Taejin hyung

204
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,667
Bro, I found this on the second floor.

205
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,708
Take a look quickly

206
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,083
duffel bag

207
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:04,208
duffel bag man girl

208
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:07,500
he's still here

209
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,417
He couldn't go out

210
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,292
Hey, hey, hey

211
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:13,583
The chairman wants to come up now.

212
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,792
fish oil

213
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,625
Oh, fuck, really.

214
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:23,250
For now, keep looking

215
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:25,667
If you catch them, kill them.

216
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:26,667
yes

217
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,750
Hey, don't be lazy, look for it properly.

218
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,625
no?

219
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,250
Hey, did you look in every corner?

220
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,417
- None - I told you to do well, Mr.

221
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,500
Hey, duffel bag

222
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,208
- None, none, none - Ah

223
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,750
Oh man, I'm going crazy

224
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,458
Hey, let's get to work first.

225
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,333
Please give me this and that

226
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,708
Whew

227
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,083
Whew

228
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:16,417
Ah, me

229
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,667
They say I like long straight hair

230
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:23,250
Why did you cut it off like this without saying anything?

231
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,458
Wow, really

232
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:27,833
why?

233
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,875
Injured pride?

234
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,792
Don't touch it when it's over

235
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:37,708
Hey, Sejeong, what does that mean?

236
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,917
If it weren't for the medicine, I wouldn't come here.

237
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:45,833
So don't be mistaken, don't touch it when it's over.

238
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,292
no, that's not it

239
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:49,542
Sejeong

240
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,750
Why do you decide the end

241
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,792
you give me joy

242
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:08,458
I give you what you need

243
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
That's the deal between us

244
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,250
know?

245
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,667
I want to do something now

246
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,125
I feel bad

247
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,458
Come to dinner later, I'll give it to you then.

248
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,833
crazy bastard

249
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,542
This is what I think of every time I see you guys

250
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:55,542
I really feel sorry for Korean kids, huh?

251
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,500
At the age when I was in full swing

252
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,458
You can't smoke, you can't drink.

253
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,958
Well, palm trees and all.

254
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,208
I'm still holding on to school

255
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,167
They don't even let us have sex.

256
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:08,542
But now

257
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,583
School is gone

258
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,917
The world has collapsed and I am in complete disarray.

259
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:16,208
How long are you guys going to act like brats?

260
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:17,917
sorry

261
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,542
Sorry, Chairman.

262
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:21,167
And what does the gatekeeper say?

263
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:23,458
Who blocked the entrance?

264
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,375
- He blocked me - Why did he stop me?

265
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:27,208
Oh, it's no big deal.

266
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,083
Tae Jin Ah

267
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,208
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

268
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,458
I think you are useful

269
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,042
I just gave it to you

270
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,625
Hey, if it's hard to manage

271
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,375
Should Cheol-min tell me to do everything?

272
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:39,583
no

273
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,875
I can do well

274
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,708
The deal is

275
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,542
Trust is life

276
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,667
In this world where everyone, including family, has died

277
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,750
Made in this market

278
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,542
So many relationships like this

279
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,625
How beautiful and romantic is this?

280
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,458
you're right

281
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:07,333
Oh, give me less and less water, Mr.

282
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,083
Oh, Sejeong, hi

283
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,625
Today, thanks to you, something got better.

284
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,917
Well, how can I get your help next time?

285
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:24,542
Maybe if you learn some manners

286
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,542
Fuck my eyes

287
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,375
Mr. Sejeong

288
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,625
Come here

289
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,792
I guess there were a lot of customers yesterday?

290
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,625
Ugh

291
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,750
The chairman said not to accept anything from you.

292
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,583
go

293
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,417
I'm late because of you, so why not just accept it?

294
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,000
Anyway, the canned food was given to me by the chairman.

295
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:02,792
condescension

296
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:09,417
sorry

297
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,208
Let's take a good look

298
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:32,542
Sejeong Han

299
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:08,083
Good thing I'm alive

300
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,917
How did you get here?

301
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,000
It's quite far from the neighborhood.

302
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,208
hmm

303
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,125
if alive

304
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,917
I think we can meet

305
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,833
What happened earlier?

306
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,042
Oh, be careful there.

307
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,917
uh? What is it?

308
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,292
This is what I planted

309
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,917
I just planted it because it was pretty.

310
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,042
a moment ago

311
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,125
those people

312
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,792
They're from the 8th floor.

313
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,208
Whether it's a man or a woman there

314
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,333
There's nothing else I can sell

315
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,792
But Park Sang-yong was the only one looking for me on the 9th floor.

316
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,083
What is this?

317
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,208
Is this what you survived for?

318
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,583
I do what he wants

319
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:30,583
I get what I want

320
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:35,042
That's our deal

321
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,625
let's get out of here

322
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,125
Let's get out of here...

323
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,000
I want to go out with you too

324
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,375
To a place where we can be happy

325
00:24:58,958 --> 00:24:59,958
however

326
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,958
There's no place like that anymore

327
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:14,542
Market will close in 10 minutes

328
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:16,583
After that, entry is absolutely prohibited.

329
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,750
If caught, you are summarily executed.

330
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,917
It's not as bad here as you think

331
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:22,208
safe and

332
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,833
Don't just leave, come live here with me.

333
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,208
Market will close in 10 minutes

334
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,542
Let's go to my house first

335
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:35,125
I'm going to my house today

336
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:36,292
go

337
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:38,542
I'll tell you everything

338
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:41,125
It's too dangerous today, so let's go home first...

339
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,167
Heeroya

340
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,292
I have to go early today

341
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:45,417
Oh, are you here?

342
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:47,417
sit

343
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,458
Let's have dinner first

344
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,333
Ah, parsley

345
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,250
There is no parsley

346
00:26:58,667 --> 00:26:59,917
Sejeong, I’m sorry.

347
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:01,667
If you go to the warehouse, there's parsley.

348
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:03,208
Could you bring me that?

349
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,625
huh?

350
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:18,625
Hey, what, what are you talking about?

351
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,042
where are you?

352
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:21,292
Hey, hey bathroom, bathroom

353
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:22,458
There, there, there, there

354
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:25,042
what? What is it?

355
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:28,250
- Isn't that him? - Oh, fuck, that sucks.

356
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,292
What is that?
