00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:13,042
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms"

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,417
Ah, ah, ah

3
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,333
however?

4
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:36,875
away?

5
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:11,750
I know everything that's inside

6
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,542
I don't think we're meant to meet late at night?

7
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,583
Huh, what a fucking iron wall?

8
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,500
Wait, put some clothes on.

9
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,250
high

10
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,625
What's going on at this hour?

11
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,625
ah

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,083
A thief went into hiding today.

13
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,708
I'm checking right now

14
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes, but I don't think this is on our floor.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,292
Oh, shit

16
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,167
Where did this guy go?

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,167
Excuse me for a moment

18
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,542
Ha, I didn't hear that?

19
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:56,000
Hey, I'm living well, huh?

20
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,625
Let’s close that door first, right? It's cold

21
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,292
Do you know Han Se-jeong?

22
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,542
Who is that?

23
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,125
Yes, pretty girl

24
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:15,917
She was so pretty

25
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,958
The day you came in here you fell and fell.

26
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,000
uh?

27
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:22,583
Now that I think about it, this is where Han Se-jeong originally lived.

28
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,042
so?

29
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,708
however

30
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,833
I went out today

31
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:31,250
Did you see a kid who looked strangely similar to Han Se-jeong?

32
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,042
My kids say we went in here.

33
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:35,542
Wow, that's what I thought.

34
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:37,333
Maybe more than Choi Hee-ro

35
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,958
I wonder if that girl lived here first.

36
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,375
Is it in here? Han Se-jeong's younger brother

37
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,917
Well, maybe it's the older sister, but it's probably the younger brother.

38
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,292
If you look at what they guarded while going in and out of room 902,

39
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,208
If you want to believe what your psychosis tells you

40
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,792
No matter where you look

41
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,000
I decided to find that out a bit slowly.

42
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,417
What kind of trick is this?

43
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,375
That's what I want to ask

44
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:19,792
What, is Han Se-jeong trying to get revenge?

45
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,417
hey

46
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,792
Then you drew the wrong card.

47
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:28,792
Taejin Kim, that idiot can’t be like that.

48
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,333
I know Park Sang-yong as my father.

49
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,292
So what's different about you?

50
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,542
I am different

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,833
Because I want to rip Park Sang-yong to death.

52
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:40,417
How can there be Lu Bu under Dong Tak?

53
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:43,833
Oh, you don't know the Three Kingdoms well?

54
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,667
If I were you, I would line up with Yeo Bu.

55
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,292
What if you don't help?

56
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:53,917
I revealed your identity to Park Sang-yong.

57
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,458
Han Se-jeong's younger brother opened a room on the 8th floor.

58
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,083
You have to treat me like a dog

59
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,125
This fucking bastard

60
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,875
Hey, I

61
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:12,250
I've never seen you wearing a mask or listening to music.

62
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,042
Time is one week

63
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,458
If there is no answer in it, then I have no idea.

64
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,375
Sleep well too pretty girl

65
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,500
Did you go to room 803 again?

66
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,167
Where have you been?

67
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,583
I left without saying a word.

68
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:48,833
I came and went without saying a word.

69
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,417
What's wrong with you, you crazy bastard?

70
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:01,917
Are these two hands too?

71
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:03,417
Yeah, like this

72
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,125
hmm!

73
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:18,667
yes

74
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,083
Have you always liked alcohol?

75
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,208
I hated company dinners.

76
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,750
I miss even that these days

77
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,458
Were you an office worker?

78
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,375
then

79
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:40,042
Just two years ago, I worked at a really good company.

80
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,833
A big company you could never join?

81
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,625
I studied well

82
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:46,792
okay?

83
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,375
I studied really well

84
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,083
Oh my, did you?

85
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,208
what?

86
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,583
Taejin did well

87
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,500
Someday my son

88
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,458
When I get to your age

89
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,917
I wanted to teach you this way

90
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,083
I just sent it today too

91
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,458
Did you still have it?

92
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,167
Ha, no

93
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,208
Two large cans and one can of water.

94
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,333
It's a period of IC water disconnection.

95
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:11,917
what?

96
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,708
- Weren't you caught? - Did you get caught?

97
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,167
I tried to run away during the night but was caught.

98
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,625
oh my god

99
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,708
It won't be complete

100
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,167
- really? - uh

101
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,625
Do you really have to kill me?

102
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,958
no

103
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,500
Oh, they said the water would come out again in a little while.

104
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,458
why? Why did you want to leave?

105
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,333
I wasn't trying to run away either.

106
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,375
I'm going to go out and get some food.

107
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,458
Food, food...

108
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,458
They say there's another market out there

109
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,542
Weren’t you trying to go there?

110
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,542
Oh, just take a look

111
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,958
We've been together for a long time

112
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,292
I'm going out

113
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,250
- Hey - Send it to me?

114
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:09,250
Okay, thank you

115
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,750
Thank you, thank you

116
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,542
Wow

117
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:17,833
Go out if you can

118
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,125
honey...

119
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,125
uh?

120
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:34,917
sister

121
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,208
What are you going to do?

122
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,667
I kind of hate that person, Park Cheol-min.

123
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,042
He seems like a dangerous person

124
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,458
And you might actually keep your promise.

125
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,208
First of all, my purpose is right.

126
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,250
I don't think it's Taejin Kim.

127
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:54,875
however

128
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,375
If your sister betrays you, won't that person die?

129
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,917
What are you going to do with me?

130
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,250
If Park Sang-yong finds out you are there...

131
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,417
I'm sorry, sister, because of me.

132
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:10,042
Since I got caught for this, I'll take it away.

133
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:14,500
lend me this

134
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,000
Room 802, Lee Mi-seon, who was mentioned at that time

135
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,375
I found a solution

136
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,250
really?

137
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,292
Park Cheol-min's this time

138
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:20,667
I was trying to start a liquor business properly.

139
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,000
They say they don't have enough water

140
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,542
The condition of the deal is to save a lot of water.

141
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
okay

142
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,333
Because it's a water outage period right now.

143
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,250
There is a limit to the amount of water one person can live with, right?

144
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,333
I'll do it like I did with cigarettes

145
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,333
They say if you buy water and sell it to us, we will pay double the price.

146
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,500
I know too

147
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,083
I'll give instructions to the kids.

148
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,500
Did we already talk about it?

149
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,708
okay

150
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:58,875
Hey, and

151
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,417
I was sorry last time

152
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,042
me too

153
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,250
I feel sorry

154
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,042
Do you have a large pet?

155
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,583
Oh, I guess the canned goods will run out before the water.

156
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,792
What are you getting?

157
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,542
I'll do it

158
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,583
I found a way to deal with it or something.

159
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,375
uh? Ha, you do it?

160
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,708
First of all, I'm going to get Taejin Kim out first.

161
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,083
But there are three conditions

162
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,542
If you take the 9th floor, I will take care of the medicine.

163
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:04,250
And promise not to touch Sehee.

164
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:05,792
okay

165
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,125
The empire is mine, but there's only one woman, okay?

166
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:11,042
Yes, but I'm opening a pharmacy, haha

167
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,667
That's a real deal

168
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,250
Don't change your mind and say it

169
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,542
- I promise - I promise.

170
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,625
so?

171
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,875
What's the plan?

172
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,875
You don't want your subordinates to know about the plan?

173
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:28,875
That's the third condition

174
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,042
ah

175
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,833
he's okay

176
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,458
I heard you can hear it?

177
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,792
Where did you know that? kid

178
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:38,083
He has hearing loss and tinnitus is severe.

179
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,708
I live here completely blocked off

180
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,167
What about lip reading?

181
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,500
Well, I do a little bit.

182
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,708
All I have to do is not show the shape of the mouth, right?

183
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,750
Hey, Geunseok

184
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,500
근석이 개새끼

185
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:51,958
Look, I don't know.

186
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,042
ruler

187
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,208
What's the plan?

188
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,708
Oh, fuck, what is this?

189
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,292
The water collected by Park Sang-yong will be poisoned.

190
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,333
Ah, what the fuck is this nonsense again?

191
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,417
I am

192
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,667
I want to live in a decent apartment.

193
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,583
That won't work?

194
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:31,292
I already rode it

195
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,917
fuck

196
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,750
Oh my, fuck, ow...

197
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:44,375
It's just the beginning, so just watch

198
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,708
Get out of the way, out of the way, Mr!

199
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,875
Ana, fuck!

200
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,167
Hey, who is this?

201
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:53,125
Who did it?

202
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,500
Yesterday I saw a person wearing a night ghost mask

203
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,292
I think the sentry saw it.

204
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,708
I stand guard here at night.

205
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,792
A wild ghost

206
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,833
It was moving on the wall over there.

207
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,083
Oh, why doesn't this bastard report?

208
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,500
Oh, I chased after you and it wasn't there?

209
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,417
- Hey, hey - Hey, hey

210
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,917
Is it true that you bastards did it?

211
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,042
Oh, the mask is correct, uh.

212
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,792
clothes, clothes

213
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,208
The clothes were not those of night demons.

214
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,125
Hey, hey, hey, I can't give you water today

215
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,417
What is this, are you trying to clean something?

216
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:38,875
Oh, crazy, fuck.

217
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,792
Well, do you have a chance to drink bleach and drink water?

218
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,000
it's crazy

219
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,750
This lady is so stupid, just, tsk.

220
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,083
The main ingredient of bleach is sodium hypochlorite

221
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,458
When mixed with water, a chemical reaction occurs

222
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,000
It can dissolve and sterilize bacteria and microorganisms.

223
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,833
Because I have to calculate it and put in the exact dosage.

224
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,958
Get out of the way from that stupid woman

225
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,625
Try to calculate well

226
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:16,250
56 64 to 44

227
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:19,708
325 liters

228
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,875
You'll be able to drink again starting tomorrow.

229
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,000
Uh, I'll contact you.

230
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,500
Let's have dinner together later.

231
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,167
sister

232
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,292
Are you advertising that you know how to make poison?

233
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,167
Why are you like this?

234
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,542
I decided to hold on until I was sure.

235
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,250
What if I become like Han Se-jeong?

236
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,542
therefore

237
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,708
If I want to meet Chairman Park like Sejeong, I have to do something like this.

238
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,792
Oh my, it's me

239
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:04,042
What kind of bastard is this again?

240
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,875
Oh my!

241
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,875
Who are you?

242
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,917
Oh my, really

243
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,708
what?

244
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:23,458
well today

245
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:25,833
I know who did it

246
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,417
Are you going to go and snitch?

247
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,250
okay

248
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:36,792
You just have to tell your men that they saw a night ghost.

249
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,042
Found in room 209

250
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,542
okay

251
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,208
Well, actually this is

252
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,542
Tsk, the mask alone is a bit weak, isn’t it?

253
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,375
Taejin Kim Are you sure what that bastard did?

254
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,292
What makes you so sure?

255
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:04,958
Yesterday, Taejin Kim’s family

256
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,042
I changed all the canned food I had to water.

257
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,375
Well, have your subordinates check it.

258
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,333
Oh, and the water...

259
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,667
Oh, never mind that.

260
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,333
I solved it

261
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:23,667
ah...

262
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:25,542
yes

263
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:28,583
wait for a sec

264
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:31,750
stand there

265
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,000
I have to take this.

266
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:49,667
Well done

267
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,708
Close the door when you leave

268
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,208
high

269
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,875
What are you?

270
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,083
Don't fall asleep

271
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, that’s not what I came here to do.

272
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,042
anyway

273
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:24,125
Well, now, shit, I can't do that.

274
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:25,958
What does that mean?

275
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,542
No one can touch that girl anymore

276
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:30,833
- Business is over. - Hey, what kind of bullshit are you talking about?

277
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:31,917
Tell me so you can understand

278
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,583
He's the new Han Se-jeong

279
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,208
The president you respect

280
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,042
He said he took a picture of that woman

281
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,375
Then what about water?

282
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:48,833
what?

283
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,458
What is ‘what’?

284
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,792
You decided to take it out if you watered it.

285
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,458
Aren’t you finished talking with Choi Hee-ro?

286
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,125
ah

287
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,667
Oh, hey, I'm sorry about that. What should I do?

288
00:20:58,667 --> 00:20:59,625
Canceling the deal, whatever.

289
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,792
Fuck you really

290
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,542
They say drinking a lot of water is good for your health

291
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,458
What happened?

292
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:29,833
please explain

293
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,792
You said you would take it out if I waited.

294
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,792
Oh, please say something to me

295
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,167
I can't go alone

296
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,500
Chairman Park is more evil than you know.

297
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,333
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

298
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:38,792
hey

299
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:41,500
you

300
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:44,125
You said you bought a lot of water?

301
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,375
Wow, even the well was destroyed.

302
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,875
I'm going to touch some canned food.

303
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,875
Ah, I, tsk.

304
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,208
I guess I'll have to close down the business for a while, hey

305
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,042
I know

306
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,250
You should have looked further ahead.

307
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:04,292
When you are interested in something else

308
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,250
Tae Jin Ah

309
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:15,250
When I say that you are doing well, you are doing well.

310
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,042
I know it will clear up, tsk

311
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,750
sorry

312
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:37,875
I think the circumstances are correct.

313
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:43,833
Uncharacteristically reckless like Kim Taejin

314
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,667
Reckless

315
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,083
huh

316
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,083
'This time...'

317
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,792
Baby, it's dangerous

318
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:14,958
No, I have something to ask you.

319
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,750
Oh, hey, wait a minute.

320
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,500
wait and see

321
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,333
uh

322
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:12,375
seed...

323
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,250
Uh, okay, go ahead.

324
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,750
Ah, headache medicine, headache medicine

325
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,083
ruler

326
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,417
Oh, right

327
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,042
wait for a sec

328
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:33,667
I have to take this.

329
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,458
This bastard is asking you to take care of him.

330
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,125
hey

331
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,333
Park Cheol-min canceled the deal.

332
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,417
What are you going to do with this?

333
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,750
Park Sang-yong is currently spinning because of the water.

334
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,542
If you put that out, wouldn't we all be ruined?

335
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,250
Take care of it

336
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,250
Because it doesn't matter to me anymore

337
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,208
Choi Hee-ro

338
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,708
- Are you there? - why?

339
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:09,583
The chairman will take a look.

340
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:11,458
Come up to the 9th floor

341
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,458
You called me?

342
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:49,542
uh

343
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:54,708
Taejin Kim

344
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,208
I have to clean it up.

345
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,542
You want to clean it up...

346
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:05,167
Let's kill him
