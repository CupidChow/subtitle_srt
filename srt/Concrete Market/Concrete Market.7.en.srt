1
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,667
When I found out that I was played by Choi Hee-ro

2
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,000
I was thinking about how to break you

3
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:29,417
however

4
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,167
Is it really necessary?

5
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, I think so too.

6
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,208
We could be happy together

7
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:41,542
uh?

8
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,292
Sejeong wants to survive

9
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,792
I didn't think he was going to the 9th floor.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,792
So you and Han Se-jeong

11
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,125
Because of his younger brother

12
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,083
You've been using us all this time to get revenge, huh?

13
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:16,917
let's stop

14
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,583
Sejeong has to save her younger brother first.

15
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,500
Park Sang-yong has gathered all his subordinates on the 9th floor.

16
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,000
I couldn't hit it as originally planned.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,250
Se-jeong's younger brother is also being held captive.

18
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,208
Will it be okay?

19
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,667
You said the water would come out today

20
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,833
When water comes out, Park Sang-yong’s men won’t come down to drink water.

21
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,250
Can’t I just hit it then?

22
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,667
There is no such thing

23
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,708
- what? -There is no such thing.

24
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,583
I just made it up

25
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,625
Hey, Mr...

26
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:53,625
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

27
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,833
That's because Park Sang-yong tells me to kill you.

28
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,208
How do you control whether water comes out or not in the first place?

29
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,083
It's probably just frozen.

30
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:09,042
What did you just say?

31
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:15,250
Did you tell Park Sang-yong that I did it?

32
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,542
Hey, hey, hey

33
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:20,958
hey

34
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:24,542
What's different about you from Park Sang-yong?

35
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,417
Can someone who has something to protect have anything to protect?

36
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,458
It's all the same

37
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,167
I wish Mi-sun put that in Park Sang-yong’s food.

38
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:39,375
It's all over

39
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:42,000
Another way...

40
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:50,542
water

41
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,333
There is nothing but water

42
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,292
Because of you, I'm in trouble and now there's only water left on the second floor.

43
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,250
we'll help you

44
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:24,083
You said transactions start from real relationships, right?

45
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,250
Trust me just once

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,833
Chairman, Chairman!

47
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:00,917
water

48
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,125
the water comes out again

49
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:04,792
we lived

50
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,125
Come out and see me

51
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,833
- IC - Oh

52
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,958
Come out, come out, come out

53
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,417
- Drink - Wow, Mr.

54
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:00,125
Is it really pierced?

55
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,750
Hey, what are you doing, drink

56
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,250
Ah, Choi Hee-ro, how...

57
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,250
Go quickly

58
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,458
-What about your sister? - I'll take the insulin and go.

59
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,667
Go quickly

60
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:30,333
- Hey - Yeah

61
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,833
- Hey - Yeah

62
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:34,208
-Who's guarding it up there? - yes?

63
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,792
These idiots, really, sir.

64
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,875
- IC - Come to work.

65
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,083
Hey, hey, hey

66
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,250
uh?

67
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,458
Hey, what is that?

68
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:07,792
fuck

69
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:21,708
fuck

70
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:27,667
Oh, fuck

71
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,208
Fuck you bastard

72
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
What is it, Mr.

73
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,833
씨발 놈이, 건들지 마, 개새끼야

74
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,417
My sister

75
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,875
Just come here

76
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,875
You are Sehee

77
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,208
come this way

78
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,375
What about Heero?

79
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,042
My sister said she brought medicine with her.

80
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:24,750
okay

81
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:52,500
IC

82
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,583
hey

83
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,375
Four crabs

84
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,375
Did you think you could beat me?

85
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,250
A kid like you?

86
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:08,000
I came all the way up here...

87
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,583
ah

88
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,625
- You talk so much? - Ha, Mr.

89
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,708
What is the jungle, mr.

90
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,750
cheesy

91
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,750
Shit, tsk

92
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,208
if you were in the jungle

93
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,000
I was living in hell

94
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,833
'Cause I'm alive to kill you

95
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,167
A bastard like you needs to die.

96
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,333
you

97
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,625
Are you doing this because of Sejeong?

98
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:36,250
I know very well, bastards like you.

99
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,833
You probably thought Sejeong had no one.

100
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,250
So it must have been like that.

101
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,917
But you're wrong

102
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,417
To Sejeong

103
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:50,625
I also have

104
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,625
Sehee was there too

105
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:00,375
Are you laughing?

106
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,792
Sejeongi

107
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,000
I didn't kill him

108
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,250
Don't talk bullshit

109
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:14,083
You killed him by poisoning him that night.

110
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,667
poison?

111
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:20,542
What poison...

112
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,958
ah

113
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,667
So then

114
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,875
Did you enjoy it that much?

115
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,750
that...

116
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,208
uh?

117
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,000
Ah, parsley

118
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:16,917
There is no parsley

119
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,083
Sejeong, I’m sorry.

120
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,583
If you go to the warehouse, do you find parsley?

121
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,250
Could you bring me that?

122
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,250
nice

123
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:37,125
ruler

124
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:43,583
ah!

125
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,625
cheese

126
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,417
Ah, indeed

127
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,667
I didn't put any cheese on it.

128
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:51,417
no way

129
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,542
cheese

130
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,833
Come on, write it.

131
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,333
okay

132
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,792
Ha, write it

133
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,458
Hey, come quickly, let’s eat.

134
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,042
Uh, parsley.

135
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,042
Keep going, keep going, keep going

136
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:19,833
eat

137
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,708
why? Why are you looking at me like that?

138
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:43,125
are you okay?

139
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,458
huh? what?

140
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,125
no

141
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,042
however

142
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,833
I don't think there was any cheese at first.

143
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,333
huh

144
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, I forgot.

145
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,708
I sprayed it again

146
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,250
I see?

147
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,042
Why didn't I see that?

148
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,458
Whew

149
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,875
You know what?

150
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,417
no matter how much you are here

151
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:10,375
Even if I pretend to be proud while drinking wine that doesn’t suit me

152
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,917
There's no one who will truly love you

153
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,458
'Cause you're just disgusting

154
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,333
Oh really, Mr.

155
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,625
It was like this and that, you crazy bitch.

156
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,125
Hey, where are you going, Mr.

157
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,583
My heart has always been like this

158
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:34,792
Hey, hey!

159
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,292
hey

160
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,167
Whew

161
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,708
Hey, what are you doing there?

162
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,042
Come down

163
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,417
no

164
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:54,875
hey!

165
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:03,250
therefore

166
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:07,375
Sejeong died because of that little brother.

167
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,833
Are you shaking this shit at me now too?

168
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:15,375
Aw, you're so cute I want to kill you

169
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,292
crazy bastard

170
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:17,500
seed...

171
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,167
Why did I bring just one person now, huh?

172
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,083
The rest of the pups

173
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,917
I went underneath

174
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,708
He said he was under his younger brother.

175
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,333
Stop, you fucking...

176
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,333
Ah, uh, ah, wait a minute.

177
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,083
Stop you fucking bitches.

178
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,583
If you move from now on

179
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,292
I'm going to slit this bitch's throat.

180
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,625
don't mind me

181
00:15:57,917 --> 00:15:59,000
Run away quickly

182
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,583
Living like this

183
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,042
I'm sick of it too

184
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,125
no!

185
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,625
I hope it doesn't get too bad

186
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,667
My kids are under a lot of stress these days.

187
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,083
It's so intense

188
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,958
Don't be a dick

189
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,542
Is it time to die now?

190
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,500
Ah, what kind of bullshit are you talking about?

191
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,583
I'm dying to hear this, Mr.

192
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,333
I poisoned the well

193
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,167
This time it's not poop, it's real

194
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:50,250
The poison you should have taken in the first place

195
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,417
I poured it all into the well

196
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:56,333
no!

197
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,167
what's the matter?

198
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:18,458
Wow, Mr.

199
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,250
Fuck you bastard

200
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,167
Hey, what is it?

201
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:31,792
What have you done, you crazy...

202
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:36,125
I haven't distributed anything like poison, Mr.

203
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,333
Detergents and cosmetics can all be turned into poison.

204
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,833
There's nothing dangerous, right?

205
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,750
It's a gift from the 8th floor.

206
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:10,417
fuck

207
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,000
Choi Hee-ro!

208
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,250
Choi Hee-ro

209
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,000
sister

210
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,375
Just die, Mr.

211
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,542
Park Sang-yong, open the door!

212
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,292
Heero, ah, Choi Hee-ro

213
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,833
Choi Hee-ro, Hee-ro

214
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,417
Heeroya

215
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,500
sister

216
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,542
Sister, are you okay?

217
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,000
Hey you bitches

218
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:21,333
You guys I

219
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,042
you

220
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:28,667
I fed them, put them to sleep, did everything.

221
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,458
Mr. Lee...

222
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,375
Like this...

223
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:39,167
Damn, this pair...

224
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:41,500
Ha, these

225
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,917
Fuck this

226
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,000
Man, these bitches

227
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,000
This fucking guy is on fire until the end.

228
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:29,000
Hey, it's done.

229
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:30,833
what?

230
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,958
You said you were sorry, right?

231
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,208
No need for a master here

232
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,083
just

233
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,042
We can live together

234
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,542
Can you do me a favor instead?

235
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,250
What is it?

236
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,417
Make it like school

237
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:59,792
Teach me how to survive

238
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,667
Protect people too

239
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,792
It's everyone's first time in a world like this.

240
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,750
okay

241
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,333
Well, someone has to bring civilization back...

242
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,292
no, what

243
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,917
It's not that grand

244
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,250
just

245
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,292
Because I miss school

246
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,958
"A collection of my favorite songs"

247
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:48,292
- Sell a lot - Yes.

248
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:49,958
- Come again - Yes.

249
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,042
Hey, you bastard, what did you say?
