00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,200

2
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,300
Lee Doo Hak, put your hands up and get on your knees.

3
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,740
Let go!

4
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,490
Don't move!

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,440
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

6
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,550
Just stop now, Hyung.

7
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,990
Everything is over.

8
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,780
It was you, as expected.

9
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,880
Let's stop now.

10
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,750
If I stop,

11
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,170
will you carry out...

12
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,640
my sentence in my place?

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,840
Just like I how I carried out yours–

14
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,550
Let the hostage go.

15
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,770
I can really shoot you, Hyung!

16
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,000
♫  I can't figure it out  ♫

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,760
 Hyung! Please save me.

18
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,670
 If you do this for me just this once,

19
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,770
 I will take responsibility for your life!

20
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,880
 No,

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,130
 I will devote my life to becoming successful,

22
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,650
 and I'll give you all I have.

23
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,730
 You can't take my child away!

24
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,760
 Mom! I'm sorry!

25
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,260
♫  It's such a useless thing to say  ♫

26
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,330
♫  It's over already  ♫

27
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,720
♫  But I can't hide it  ♫

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,830
♫  My longing for you erupts  ♫

29
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,680
No!

30
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,450
No!

31
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,260
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

32
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,500
Hyungnim!

33
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,530
Doo Hak!

34
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:52,030
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

35
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:59,820
♫  Above the rough sky, my heart floats away  ♫

36
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,800
Hurry up and find him!

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,660
♫  Only your name is engraved like this  ♫

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,440

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,360

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,650
Hey!

41
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,660
Hey, sit down. Sit down!

42
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,550
Don't you hear me? Sit down!

43
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,650
Are you crazy?

44
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,360
Have you lost your mind?

45
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,870
What happened?

46
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,700
Did you find him?

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,910

48
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,370
I asked if you found him!

49
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,200
We couldn't find him.

50
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,790
Well...

51
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,690
It appears he's drifted far into the ocean.

52
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,390
D*mn it!

53
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,000
Find Doo Hak!

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,210
Hurry up and find Doo Hak, you b*stard!

55
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,480
Did...

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,690
Did Hyung Doo Hak really die?

57
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,050
I asked you if he died!

58
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,100
Please find him...

59
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,710
The ocean would be too cold for him.

60
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:21,580

61
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,850
Why must it be when it's cold like this?

62
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,590
Gosh, darn it.

63
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,360
I didn't think I would go back.

64
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,330
I thought that even if I did return, I would return confidently as a boss.

65
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,030
But we're back to being nobodies.

66
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,850
Hey, you b*stard! Who says we're just nobodies?

67
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,200
Although it was just a moment,

68
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,480
we were core members of the council who united all gangs in the country.

69
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,340
Did we do that by fighting?

70
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,160
They just joined us as it was profitable.

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,170
You're so stupid.

72
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,250
Fighting takes skills, and money also needs skills.

73
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,190
How do you think Silla united the three kingdoms?

74
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,160
Kim Chun Chu (king) did it through business, while Kim Yu Sin (general) used his sword.

75
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,840
Doo Hak and Hyung Joo did the business, while you and I are the muscle.

76
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,950
So it was half business and half muscle.

77
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,040
We united the gangs using both.

78
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,130
Listening to you like this, you're right.

79
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,300
But even in muscle, didn't Hyung Doo Hak do everything?

80
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,610
No matter how much dirty work the subordinates do, history only records the bosses.

81
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,300
Isn't that right, Hyung Joo?

82
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,100
Let's go quietly, instead of reminding me of the one who isn't here.

83
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,180
This b*stard.

84
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,570
Hey! Do you think I want to talk like this?

85
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,630
I keep being reminded of that dead one if I stay still while heading to jail.

86
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:01,790
If I don't talk this nonsense, I feel I'll go crazy from being reminded of him!

87
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,690
Why the heck are you crying?

88
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,500
No matter what I do or say,

89
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,900
I keep thinking of Hyung Doo Hak.

90
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,040
Gosh, you stupid b*stard.

91
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,590
Darn it, darn it!

92
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,900

93
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,800
Cheol Woong.

94
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,190
Happy birthday!

95
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,070
Thank you.

96
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,500
All right. Happy birthday, and congratulations on coming up to Seoul.

97
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,720
Thank you, Father.

98
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,380
You should have come back sooner! You lack nothing.

99
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,500
All right. Was it fun working near your hometown?

100
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,250
Whenever I had time at holidays, I dropped by the school I used to go to with Hyung Doo Hak

101
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,200
and also the house we used to live in.

102
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,860
What about Jung Shin?

103
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,190
Why is she so late?

104
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,270
Did you tell her to join us for dinner?

105
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,560
Yeah, that's strange. She said she was coming.

106
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,370
She shows her face once a year for your birthday,

107
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,600
but I guess she forgot it this year.

108
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,810
Hello?

109
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,770
Director Go?

110
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,750
Didn't Boss say anything to you?

111
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,440

112
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,590
You know this is wrong, don't you?

113
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,950
Why is she suddenly like this?

114
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,060
Please tell Boss to wait just a little bit.

115
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,430
I feel I will have to put an end to this once and for all.

116
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,490
She probably won't have the leisure to come this year.

117
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,200
Excuse me?

118
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,010
Did something happen to Jung Shin?

119
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,960
- Hey, Jung Shin! 
 - I'm sorry I'm late.

120
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,120
It's been a while. I'm sorry I'm late.

121
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,550
All right, you should take a seat.

122
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,640
But are you all right?

123
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,890
Did something happen?

124
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,420
Have you supposedly a problem?

125
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,840
"Problem"?

126
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,890
I don't.

127
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,370
The problem would be that business is going all too well.

128
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,030
Oh, and this is your gift.

129
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,520
Gosh, you didn't have to.

130
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,980
You're the only gift I need.

131
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,420
Oh, why are you so cheesy?

132
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,990
Thanks.

133
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,070
All right. We should all make a toast.

134
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,190
For Cheol Woong's birthday and for his success.

135
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,140
Congrats!

136
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,300
Thank you, Mother.

137
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,070
- Congrats. 
 - Thanks.

138
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,940
Ahjumma, what brings you all the way here?

139
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,440
Hey.

140
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,130
I had dinner plans near here.

141
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,330
I just dropped by after I finished.

142
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,070
How are you?

143
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,710
Well, yes.

144
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,330
Jung Shin, you, too?

145
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,920
Mother.

146
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,670
I should have visited you more often. I'm sorry.

147
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,430
You should come inside. It's been a while.

148
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,180
Have some tea with us before you leave.

149
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,580
No, it's all right.

150
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,320
These are side dishes you like so you should eat them.

151
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,490
Also, whenever you have time, drop by.

152
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,170
Yes. I'll make sure to visit.

153
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,600
At least if I get to see your face, I feel a bit better.

154
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,610
Happy birthday.

155
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,150
I was a bit sad that I couldn't see you every year I dropped by,

156
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,400
but somehow, this time I was lucky.

157
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,270
Have you dropped by before?

158
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,360
I usually just returned right after seeing my parents.

159
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,330
But since I returned to Seoul,

160
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,040
I will visit you from time to time.

161
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,890
Yes, all right. Thanks.

162
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,350
Thanks a lot.

163
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,770
I'll be going.

164
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,620
Yes, get home safely.

165
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,850
Please drive safely.

166
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,320
Let's go inside.

167
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,600
Actually, I have to go.

168
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
What?

169
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,240
Already?

170
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,940
You should eat before you go.

171
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,960
Yes, have a cup of tea with us before you go.

172
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,810
No, it's already too late.

173
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,920
All right then.

174
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,500
- Are you really leaving? 
 - Yes.

175
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,510
See you. I'll call you later!

176
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,800
Let's go inside.

177
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,730
Then have a good night.

178
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,140
Hey.

179
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,390
Congratulations on returning to Seoul.

180
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,200
Come inside.

181
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,800
How did you know it was me?

182
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
Since I mentioned something about Jung Shin,

183
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,900
it's obvious you would ask me about it.

184
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,370
Intelligence work is gathering facts,

185
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,510
but reading people is the first step to intelligence work.

186
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,770
You must be preparing for a business trip to Japan.

187
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,460
That's right.

188
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,550
It'll appear to ordinary people as a usual business trip to Japan.

189
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,100
It seems something really important.

190
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,590
You can always ask Team Leader Oh, if you want info on Jung Shin.

191
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,440
I don't want to do that.

192
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,930
Jung Shin is... cornered due to problems with shares in her film company.

193
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,400
She will probably get kicked out soon with only a few dollars to her name.

194
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,030
Have you still not changed your mind about pulling out your shares?

195
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,150
If your mind hasn't changed, Mom, my mind won't change, either.

196
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,200
Then was it right to spend company money without permission for Film Academy or whatever?

197
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,190
How many times must I tell you?

198
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,590
I made that investment under their promise

199
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,740
to recommend the best directors and writers to our film company!

200
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,110
I see. Is that so?

201
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,100
Will you argue you're right to the very end?

202
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,660
Okay. Director Go.

203
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,450
Yes.

204
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,840
Here. Take this.

205
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,990
It's your shares.

206
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,880

207
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,550
You're saying this is my share?

208
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,570
Yes. That's your share.

209
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,640
It's half my shares of 400 million won.

210
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,950
No. From what I know,

211
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,040
half of your shares in the Gyeonggang region, excluding Gwangju and Jeonnam,

212
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,130
that is my share.

213
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,380
That should amount to at least 2 billion so what's this?

214
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,100
Two billion? Give me a break.

215
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,170
Director Go, break it down so she gets it.

216
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,060
Y-Yes.

217
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,800
So the thing is,

218
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,330
it's true you own 50% of Boss' shares in Gyeonggang region, Branch Manager.

219
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,860
But since I spent all my life

220
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,610
going through all hard times at the start, Boss said I should have my shares, too.

221
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:26,200
So Boss gave me 90% of the shares in Gyeonggang region.

222
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:34,670
So when we do the math, well, half of Boss' shares of 10%

223
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,810
is 5%. That is your share.

224
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,480
It came to exactly 200 million won.

225
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,270
- Do you really expect me to believe this? 
 - Goodness.

226
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,120
Are you saying it's not true?

227
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,200
Look at this. We even have a contract we signed together!

228
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,370
If this is really Director Go's shares, I will change my last name.

229
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,430
This is clearly prejudice! Isn't this too much!

230
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,410
You're the one who is being too much!

231
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,160
- Mom! 
 - "Mom"?

232
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,210
Although you became my adopted daughter, you originally agreed on your knees to live as my maid!

233
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,400
Are you a goldfish that you already forgot?

234
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,200
How dare you argue with me?

235
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,210
I gave you this due to the time we've spent together

236
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,560
so you won't go around begging for food.

237
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,130
You choose to pay the rent for this office or to leave.

238
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,530
I'm done with you so get lost!

239
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,190
Let me ask you just one thing.

240
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,390
Was I a maid or a daughter?

241
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:45,100
Let me ask you one thing, too. Was I your master or your mom?

242
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,510
I won't leave the film industry.

243
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,900
Gosh...

244
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,260
That's what you want.

245
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,540
Branch Manager, Branch Manager!

246
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,450
Aigoo!

247
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,510
Don't do this.

248
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,760
Just get on your knees and beg for forgiveness!

249
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,670
Although she speaks coldly like that, do you know how much she loved you?

250
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,240
You're telling me to go back to living as a maid?

251
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,960
You can be her servant for a long time, Director Go.

252
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:26,130
And just wait and see... who will survive in this film industry.

253
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,980
B-B-Branch Manager!

254
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,040
Gosh, that girl, seriously!

255
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,050
Well... Father.

256
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,130
Could you help Jung Shin a little bit?

257
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,580
Do you want to help her?

258
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,030
Yes.

259
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,670
Then help her.

260
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,280
However, you are an adult now.

261
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,640
If you want to help the one you love, do it with your own hands.

262
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,250
As a man, shouldn't you do that?

263
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,620
What is your heart?

264
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,790
If you can't forget her, then give your all to get her.

265
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,350
If you can't do that, forget her.

266
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,790
I never forgot your mother,

267
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,480
and so,

268
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,460
I tried everything

269
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,830
in my power to

270
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,620
find her again and protect her.

271
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,140
But what about you?

272
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,200
Have you put in that kind of effort?

273
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,310
♪  I will go  ♪

274
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,300
♪  I will leave  ♪

275
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:41,590
♪ Holding my young son's hand ♪

276
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,900
♪ To where we plant potatoes ♪

277
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,710
♪ And great millet ♪

278
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,170
I don't have a husband who'd come home to me or children to visit me.

279
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,950
So who the heck is ringing the bell at this hour?

280
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,070
Who is it? Is it you, Jung Ok?

281
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,210
It's me, Jung Shin.

282
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,710
I came because we didn't get a chance to catch up.

283
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,640
Oh, my.

284
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,160
What brings you here?

285
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,430
After my husband and Doo Hak departed...

286
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,870
and now that even Jung Ok left home,

287
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,750
how could I live sober?

288
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,870
If I don't have some alcohol like this, I can't even fall asleep.

289
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,820
You're going through a hard time, too, right?

290
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,010
It just wasn't meant to be so what can you do?

291
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,070
So you should just forget that rotten rascal.

292
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,130
Drink up.

293
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,640
It feels like my heart is punched full of holes

294
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,690
and wind just blows through them.

295
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,660
And I don't know why I keep thinking of Cheol Woong.

296
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,430
Since it's his birthday, I dropped by wondering

297
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,280
if maybe he would have come up.

298
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,700
But did you see it?

299
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,600
How that witch glared at me?

300
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,120
Her eyes were saying "How dare I come to see Cheol Woong without her permission".

301
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,150
That probably wasn't what she thought.

302
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,910
That's not what she thought? Bullsh*t.

303
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:46,570
Do you know what that snob said to me a long time ago?

304
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,290
 It should be enough for you to start whatever business you want.

305
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,060
 Oh my!

306
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,860
 Then is this all money?

307
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,150
 In return, I have a favor to ask you.

308
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:12,120
 It may be difficult, but I would like for you to never meet my family again.

309
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,080
 Especially, do not ever contact Cheol Woong again.

310
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:30,220
 But can't I see him once in a while when I am reminded of Doo Hak?

311
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,160
 Well then, take care.

312
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,520
 Was it a month after that?

313
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,300
 Oh my! What brings you all the way here?

314
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,870
 Why? Did I come somewhere I shouldn't have?

315
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,160
 Here.

316
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,840
 It's beef so please eat it and enjoy.

317
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,470
 Gosh. Why would you bring something very expensive and so much of it?

318
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,380
 Because I may not be able to come very often.

319
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,330
 I was stationed in the countryside.

320
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,760
 Where are you going?

321
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,400
 Well, to Gwangju.

322
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,580
 That's quite far.

323
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,490
 Until I return again, please stay healthy.

324
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,100
 Since you are living in a far new place,

325
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,260
 you should watch your health.

326
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,350
 I'll quickly make some food for you so eat before you leave.

327
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,030
 Oh, wait.

328
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,120
 I must go since I have a lot to do.

329
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,370
 I'll be going then.

330
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,810
 All right.

331
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,110
 Whatever it is,

332
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,230
 if you need anything, let me know.

333
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,000
 Whether it's side dishes, undershirts,

334
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,520
 or underwear,

335
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,270
 I'll send you whatever you need.

336
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,990
 I'm sorry.

337
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,900
 No.

338
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,600
 I'm just grateful.

339
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,140
 You're all I have now.

340
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,740
 You have to.

341
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,090
 You have to stay healthy, all right?

342
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,170
 At that moment, it felt like

343
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:43,730
 an icicle that was frozen in my heart fell off.

344
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,950
That brat...

345
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,940
I guess he has some humanity in him.

346
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,960
Of course, of course. Whose son is he that he wouldn't?

347
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:05,560
That stuck-up woman should have seen us like that.

348
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,840
They say that even a fox faces its homeland before it dies.

349
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,780
Everything's bound to return to its original intended place.

350
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,290
Don't you think so?

351
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,840
You're right.

352
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,560
Jung Shin.

353
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,670
Yes?

354
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,180
Our Cheol Woong is quite nice, isn't he?

355
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,760
Of course.

356
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,970
It's just that he's a bit too greedy,

357
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,860
but he's quite a good guy.

358
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,760
You should marry Cheol Woong.

359
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,250
Goodness, Mother.

360
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,190
It appears Cheol Woong can't seem to forget you

361
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,310
and keeps thinking about you.

362
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,200
The dead are gone,

363
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,880
and the living should live on.

364
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,610
After he sent off Doo Hak like that, whom he had followed like a brother,

365
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,320
life must have been torturous for him.

366
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,500
Both you and Cheol Woong,

367
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,070
when Doo Hak watches you guys from Heaven,

368
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,570
wouldn't he want that as much as I do?

369
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,760
Gosh, Mother, please.

370
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,000
Listen to what I have to say.

371
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,930
Cheol Woong...

372
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,040
- is actually– 
 - I think...

373
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,970
of him even while I'm eating.

374
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,010
I think of Doo Hak even while I am walking.

375
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,790
He just refuses to disappear from my heart.

376
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,210
So how could I accept someone else into my heart, Mother?

377
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,200
My poor girl.

378
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Aigoo, my poor girl.

379
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,060
Aigoo.

380
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,580
Aigoo, my poor girl.

381
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,610
Still,

382
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,890
it's just that you don't know it,

383
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,080
but Cheol Woong also

384
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,280
came from my womb,

385
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,260
from my womb.

386
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,640
But as soon as I gave birth to him, Doo Hak's father...

387
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,090
he took him and gave him away.

388
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,040
If it has to do with that family,

389
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,640
he would not only offer up his child but his life.

390
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,510
So what would he not do for them?

391
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,500
At that time, Doo Hak...

392
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,510
always lived giving things up for Cheol Woong.

393
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:06,100
I feel so bad for my son.

394
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,990
I should have stopped him with everything I had.

395
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,100
My poor child.

396
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,790
My poor child.

397
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,930
As I've heard, the steak is fantastic.

398
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,070
It's not much different from a first-class hotel in New York.

399
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,660
Thank you.

400
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,230
Honestly, I was a bit surprised when I heard you would dine with us, Chairman.

401
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,210
I don't think you came just for some steak.

402
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,870
Can I ask what brought you here?

403
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,000
As I expected, you are quite direct.

404
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,890
Actually, the president of an affiliate company is heading into prosecution today.

405
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:56,010
She should have arrived at the prosecution about now.

406
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,840
 That president is my youngest daughter.

407
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
Oh, I see.

408
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,990
That child's company set up a slush fund with dollars

409
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,600
using its branch location in a foreign country.

410
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,300
 I don't know how they managed to get the information,

411
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,380
 but the prosecution is investigating her for breaking the Foreign Exchange Control Act.

412
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,400
I am Geum Yeon Hee of Changsung Fashion.

413
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,730
That slush fund was set up to increase company assets

414
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,600
by buying real estate in Japan.

415
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,440
Our family doesn't live that poor

416
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,330
to take that kind of money for our personal use.

417
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,580
- I see. 
  - As you know...

418
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,050
 But that prosecutor...

419
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,140
Everything you say can and will be used against you in court.

420
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,410
You've amassed quite a bit in the fund you set up through your foreign branch.

421
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,700
According to this report,

422
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,380
it was for buying real estate in Japan. Is it the trend among chaebols right now?

423
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,190
I'm not sure.

424
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,010
What if you end up being a latecomer?

425
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,060
- "A latecomer"? 
 - Yes.

426
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,680
What real estate in this world only increases in value?

427
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,780
What do you mean?

428
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,780
Real estate in Japan is number one in the world.

429
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:14,780
Haven't you heard that even if you just sell land in Tokyo, you could buy the entire land of the U.S.?

430
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,190
I have heard of it.

431
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:23,870
That is why I am saying you should be more careful.

432
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,170
Taking advantage of such good times

433
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,570
also means that if something goes awry,

434
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,690
it will be even easier for all to collapse.

435
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,860
Instead of an investigation, you are putting on a lecture.

436
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,000
 Please put in a good word to your son.

437
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,530
He's not someone who listens to a request like that,

438
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,860
but since you asked me like this,

439
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,610
I will try putting in a word.

440
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,160
You must study economics a lot.

441
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,580
They say we are in an unprecedented economic boom,

442
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,490
but financial crimes boom unusually.

443
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,780
So I am studying hard.

444
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,130
I see.

445
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,100
 Honestly, the Japanese real estate investment

446
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,470
 was what I had pushed for.

447
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,020
 My daughter was actually against it.

448
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,750
Then... indict me

449
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,990
for breaking the Foreign Exchange Control Act.

450
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:19,600
You probably lack witnesses and evidence so I'll provide all that for you.

451
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,260
You do know what you're saying, right?

452
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,140
Of course.

453
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,780
I am admitting to my crime.

454
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,650
What's the reason?

455
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,210
To be honest,

456
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,400
I feel the same way as you, Prosecutor.

457
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,430
Siphoning company funds earned by blood and sweat

458
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,780
to invest in Japanese real estate isn't just illegal,

459
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,820
but it can also cause major losses to the company.

460
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,050
Honestly, I reported it.

461
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:57,740
If I am indicted for violating the Foreign Exchange Control Act, it will be all over the news.

462
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,220
If that happens, even our Chairman would have no choice

463
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,420
but to put both his hands up.

464
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,130
Give up!

465
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,240
If we don't suffer losses, it's good for our company and for our country.

466
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,190
Is patriotism anything special?

467
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,830
I'm saying we should try being patriots for once.

468
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,400
I brought a few files for evidence.

469
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,130

470
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,060
I said to let go of me!

471
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,000
Prosecutor!

472
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,030
I said let go of me!

473
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,620
Please hurry and get in.

474
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,320
Hey, Prosecutor!

475
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,030
We chose to confine you during the investigation

476
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,050
due to the risk of you destroying evidence and fleeing.

477
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,230
We've got a warrant for your arrest as well.

478
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,250
As you wanted, you will appear on the news starting tonight.

479
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,540
Hey,  Prosecutor.

480
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,790
Couldn't you indict me without confinement?

481
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,090
That's your opinion.

482
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,540
Let's go.

483
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,640
Prosecutor.

484
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,640
- Prosecutor! 
 - Oh, wait a minute...

485
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:12,210
Usually, I would escort you,

486
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,420
but I have really important business today.

487
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,630
Prosecutor Choi.

488
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,150
Hey!

489
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,480
Aigoo, take her.

490
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,510
- Careful, careful. 
 - Let go!

491
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,560
Well, no matter how I think about it...

492
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:33,610
"007: License to Kill" will be the next most profitable movie.

493
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,250
Should I proceed?

494
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,810
There's no question about "007."

495
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,210
Go ahead.

496
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,270
Yes. I got it.

497
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,130
What about Jung Shin?

498
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,040
She hasn't called?

499
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,030
No, she didn't.

500
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,800
That stubborn wench, that bold wench,

501
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,740
that foolish girl.

502
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,720
♪ Can't you hear me? ♪

503
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:29,090

507
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,730
 But Cheol Woong also...

508
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,950
 came from my womb,

509
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,490
 from my womb.

00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,380
 Didn't you say we should stay friends for a year?

515
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,210
 My feelings

516
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,250
 just turned out like that.

517
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,000
♪  Look you in your eyes  ♪

518

♪  I collect new...  ♪

519
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,070
 Apart from the reason for not being able to handle you,

520
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,430
 have you no other sound reasons?

521
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,520
 Jung Shin!

522
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,490
 Don't grow any feelings for me.

526
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,520
You seemed down so I planned this special event.

527
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,740
But you don't seem that impressed.

528
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,990
There was a really strange criminal today.

529
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,850
You could even use her as a character in your movie.

530
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,310
Do you want to hear it?

531
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,930
Next time.

532
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:40,110
Okay. Let's eat.

533
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:51,390
When we used to live in Yeosu, you and Doo Hak always were together, right?

534
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,690
Doo Hak always seemed to be protecting you...

535
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,240
and sacrificing for you from behind you,

536
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,250
even how he transferred to an agricultural school.

537
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,200
Why do you say that out of nowhere?

538
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,070
Let me ask you one last time.

539
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,640
Back then, did Doo Hak really kill a person?

540
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,970
Then and now... you still don't see me as a man, do you?

541
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,920
Cheol Woong. Just tell me the truth.

542
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,070
The truth is...

543
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,750
that I've been waiting for you forever,

544
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,500
and you push me back whenever I do this.

545
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,860
Look me in the eye.

546
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,710
Is Doo Hak really the culprit?

547
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,070
Are you saying you think someone else is the real culprit?

548
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,270
And you're saying it's me? That's what it is, right?

549
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,810
When...

550
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:10,350
I heard you got kicked out from the film studio unfairly,

551
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,970
I couldn't even sleep or digest food because I was upset.

552
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,480
I really want to protect and help you.

553
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,380
But why do you always push me back when I try to get closer?

554
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,740
And doubt me?

555
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,820
I'm sorry if I was doubting you for no good reason.

556
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,810
I'm really sorry.

557
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,450
I should get going.

558
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,640
After Hyung Doo Hak ended up like that,

559
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,470
I waited until your feelings settled.

560
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,270
So can't you look at me now, please?

561
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,630
Please let me breathe for once, Jung Shin!

562
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:01,100
What must I do to make you look at me?

563
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,660
I can't look at you, Choi Cheol Woong.

564
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,790
You remind me of Doo Hak.

565
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,990
I'm sorry.

566
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,570
♫  I want to hold your hand  ♫

567
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,300
Jung Shin, I...

568
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:25,170
I can really do anything if it's for you. I can even kill a person.

569
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,770
All right.

570
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,510
All right!

571
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,140
Let's just say I killed Young Tak. Okay?

572
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,830
Let's just say I did!

573
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:44,250
Even if I was the one who killed him... that was all for you.

574
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,370
Do you understand?

575
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:53,190
♫  Let me go, in my life  ♫

576
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:59,880
♫  Let me go in your life  ♫

577
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,500

578
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,770

579
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:19,150

580
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,670
Gosh, I black out whenever I drink these days. This is bad.

581
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,660
Thanks for the meds, President Go.

582
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,530
The cause of that isn't alcohol; it's loneliness.

583
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,180
You feel lonely since there's no one there and you drink

584
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,750
like there's no tomorrow so you black out.

585
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,990
Thus you need to treat the cause.

586
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,190
Let's get back to work.

587
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,070
Wouldn't it be better to invest in the First New Town region?

588
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,440
Look over here.

589
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,120
That's Ilsan, right?

590
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,600
Joongdong...

591
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,880
Pyeongchon...

592
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,000
Sanbon and...

593
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,950
Bundang, right here.

594
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:05,010
I went around all the decent cities, but there was no space to even stick a needle into.

595
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,450
Couldn't we at least get on the last bus?

596
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:13,120
Maybe if the last bus' tire goes flat, how else will we get on it?

597
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,290
That's why real estate is an intelligence battle.

598
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:21,400
Still, since you know a lot of information, you must have some land near the new town.

599
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,680
Aigoo.

600
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,560
The entire world knew once the government announced it.

601
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,260
That's not really knowing information.

602
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,420
I couldn't even buy an inch, either.

603
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,420
So is there really nowhere else?

604
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,750
Oh, my goodness.

605
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:45,110
In my opinion, this land has the most potential.

606
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,770
The west coast?

607
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:54,400
Although reclamation and the west coast highway were announced, there is just so much land.

608
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,930
There must be some decent properties somewhere.

609
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,710
I want to recommend Pyeongtaek, first and foremost.

610
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:06,650
Once we start doing business with China, I have a very realistic expectation that

611
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:10,620
the Pyeongtaek docks will get so much better.

612
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,340
That makes sense.

613
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,570
Well, then

614
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:19,200
let's combine our funds and go look at some properties soon.

615
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,370
Are you worried I might scam you and run off?

616
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,250
No, that's not it...

617
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:35,530
In that case, will you trust me if I put my money in your bank account?

618
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,850
Why would you go that far?

619
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:43,410
I mean, if you do, it does make things certain.

620
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,650
Let's do it then.

621
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:52,910
But just what do you owe Doo Hak to be going this far?

622
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,730
It's a long story to tell.

623
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,290
Let's take our time to talk about that.

624
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,450
Let's go eat.

625
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,060
No. They say to strike while the iron is hot (seize the chance).

626
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,930
Let's go visit the sites.

627
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,080
We can just have a quick meal at the sites.

628
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,370
My goodness. Don't be like that.

629
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,690
Let's go to a nice restaurant and—

630
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,310
Gosh, Madam Heo!

631
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,210
My goodness.

632
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,820
My goodness, this is really crazy, right?

633
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,670
The sea is now the land.

634
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,730
It's like the creation of the world.

635
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,040
Gosh, I told you.

636
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,090
It's the largest national land development project since the creation of our country.

637
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,590
If the west coast highway comes in after this,

638
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:38,120
multiplying the capital is just child's play.

639
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,540
Gosh, what a nice view.

640
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:57,700
What's the matter? Is she someone you know?

641
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,540
She is Cheol Woong's mother.

642
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,580
What? Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong's?

643
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,440
The wretched prosecutor?

644
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,880
Is this where I'll get the goose that lays golden eggs?

645
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,580
Yes, there is no mistake.

646
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,430
I investigated and confirmed it myself.

647
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,670
In that case, what must I do for you?

648
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:22,460
You just need to do as you have been doing.

649
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,390
Ten percent of the profit?

650
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,240
Team Captain Oh, you are still just as greedy, right?

651
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,330
Well...

652
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,370
since I also have a few mouths to feed...

653
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,600
Okay then.

654
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,700
That's a deal.

655
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,230
He's not wretched.

656
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:54,210
Anyhow, seeing how that woman showed up, this land must be the jackpot.

657
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:26,230
- Take your time and eat. 
 - Yes.

658
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,400
Here.

659
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,370
Thank you every time, and I'm sorry.

660
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,730
I've been waiting for you to contact me.

661
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:55,310
Please, let's meet at least once a month...

662
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:59,180
or once every two months, at least.

663
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,290
You know I can't contact you regularly.

664
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:07,920
Also, we're gathering our comrades again.

665
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,460
Everything will be a waste if I get caught.

666
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,160
I know it must be hard on you, but please endure a little longer.

667
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,570
In that case, I'll also join you.

668
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,580
I can't allow that.

669
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,010
If you get caught again, everyone will be in danger.

670
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:25,090
Please... please stay with me, Oppa.

671
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:27,210
Jung Ok.

672
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:38,990
♫  If in those pure eyes, the raindrops well up  ♫

673
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:51,990
♫  That beautiful being is a person  ♫

674
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:58,170
Wh-What's the matter?

675
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,160
I don't want to do it. Let's not.

676
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,740
Don't you love me?

677
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,460
I do love you.

678
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,830
Then... why?

679
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,350
I'm scared.

680
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,970
Later.

681
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:19,770
Later.

682
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:25,970
Jung Ok.

683
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:37,400
♫  If one embraces the wind in his passionate heart  ♫

684
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,830
I'm sorry, Oppa.

685
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,070
♫  That beautiful being is a person  ♫

686
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,970
It's okay.

687
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:47,290
I'm really sorry.

688
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:50,100
Stay healthy.

689
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,730
Mother.

690
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,870
Oh my, Jung Shin!

691
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,400
Did you get home safe that day?

692
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,930
I really said such a thing?

693
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:22,050
Yes.

694
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,790
It's what you clearly said,

695
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:26,970
that you gave birth to Cheol Woong.

696
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,510
That makes no sense.

697
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:32,610
I've been losing it whenever I drink lately.

698
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:36,640
If I said such a thing, I must have really gone crazy.

699
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,420
It's all nonsense so don't even worry about it.

700
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,650
You really didn't? You're sure, right?

701
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,500
I didn't. I really didn't!

702
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,500
It must be that I said such nonsense since Doo Hak and Cheol Woong

703
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,440
hung out together all the time.

704
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,480
I did.

705
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,770
Cheol Woong's my son,

706
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,800
whom I gave birth to with my heart.

707
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,020
Gosh, Mother.

708
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,430
I was really shocked.

709
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,240
You're such a wimp (coward).

710
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,350
Aigoo, you're so funny.

711
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:19,140
And you believed that?

712
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,970
- I need to drink some water. 
 - My goodness.

713
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,080
Were you shocked?

714
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,590
Welcome.

715
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:31,530
I even made a request to you, Madam.

716
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:33,840
This is a bolt from the blue sky,

717
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,520
to lock her up like this...

718
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,170
I heard the story on the way here.

719
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:44,010
I didn't even have time to talk to my son about it.

720
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:51,800
I'll go home and ask my husband to speak to the district attorney.

721
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,610
Such levels of violations are always happening in chaebol corporations.

722
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,270
In fact...

723
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:03,750
I intended to let my daughter and Prosecutor Choi see each other.

724
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:10,030
I heard your son, Prosecutor Choi, is competent and full of potential.

725
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:15,140
As a father, I was trying to introduce her to a good man.

726
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:20,080
My daughter also was interested in Prosecutor Choi after hearing about him,

727
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,680
saying she will approach him naturally.

728
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,780
That's why she voluntarily appeared for the summon.

729
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,070
I really didn't know you had such intentions.

730
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,660
I'll apologize in his place.

731
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,330
By the way...

732
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:37,160
according to the attorney who came back from meeting my daughter...

733
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,720
 Please tell Father.

734
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,560
 I chose him as my man.

735
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,590
He said my daughter took a liking to Prosecutor Choi.

736
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,730
My goodness.

737
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:55,520
What does she like about a man who sent her to the detention center?

738
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:01,480
Please tell Deputy Director to have her released on bail.

739
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,540
Afterward, let's have our families meet on the field.

740
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,790
The children's feelings are what matter.

741
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:12,370
What would it matter what the parents wish for?

742
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,770
Anyhow, please don't worry too much.

743
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:18,450
I'll make it so your daughter will be let out soon.

744
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,240
Regarding Changsung Group, your information was very useful, Team Captain Oh.

745
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,140
Most groups would want to become in-laws with Deputy Director.

746
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:36,800
Especially groups like Changsung Group that are having financial difficulties;

747
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,690
they can't help but be more eager.

748
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,720
On top of that, he has only daughters

749
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,970
so he's dying to find decent sons-in-law.

750
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,910
Although CEO Geum Yeon Hui is a mistress' daughter...

751
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:51,200
I'm aware of that.

752
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:58,380
I know Chairman Geum cherishes and acknowledges her abilities the most.

753
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,170
Yes.

754
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,470
Although the group is having difficulties at the moment,

755
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:06,070
they rank twentieth in the financial sector as a corporation.

756
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:09,940
Only if Changsung Group can become Cheol Woong's safety net,

757
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,830
he could harbor a grand dream in the future.

758
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,940
Anyhow, Cheol Woong must think they met in a natural coincidence.

759
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:22,920
Otherwise, he will respond negatively so be careful.

760
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,960
Of course.

761
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,160
Madam, you would have made a great politician if you ever tried.

762
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:35,910
If things go well, I'll make sure you get paid for your work.

763
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:38,970
I'm always grateful, Madam.

764
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,440
By the way...

765
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,060
Does Deputy Director also know about Prosecutor Choi's marriage talks?

766
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:50,860
We'll need to make it that way,

767
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:56,390
since he's also innocent when it comes to love.

768
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:02,310
She will be arriving soon as well.

769
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,470
Welcome, President Cha.

770
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:09,800
I did everything you asked of me.

771
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,140
You did well.

772
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,110
I shouldn't be doing this with my daughter.

773
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:22,100
Just know that it really wasn't easy at all.

774
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:26,360
As I promised, in addition to evading the tax audit,

775
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,720
we'll also help you get your hands first on foreign movie imports.

776
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:37,710
By the way, it occurred to me that Prosecutor Choi is the one...

777
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:41,390
who's madly in love, not my daughter.

778
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:46,410
All of this is done to separate my daughter and...

779
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,260
Prosecutor Choi, right?

780
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,170
President Cha.

781
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:57,570
If you're done, you may leave now.

782
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:05,830
Although I've met all kinds of people doing the film business, I've never met someone like you.

783
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:09,970
Wow. With such a pretty face,

784
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:14,100
you consider people as nothing more than pawns on the chessboard.

785
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:20,170
If I get the chance, I must use someone like you as the main character in my movie.

786
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,450
Please make it a happy ending if you can.

787
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,080
We'll have to wait and see.

788
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:33,540
If you keep doing this, the deal will...

789
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,560
I got it.

790
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,820
Anyhow, I did what you told me to do.

791
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:47,070
So don't ever interfere with my daughter and me anymore.

792
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:01,840
If you're tired, please go home and take a break, Madam.

793
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,810
It must be a happy ending.

794
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:10,010
For me, Cheol Woong, and my husband, too.

795
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:16,000
It will be.

796
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,550
NSA Director's Special Aide?

797
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:20,670
I've been assigned a critical secret order by the president.

798
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,920
I need someone I can trust entirely.

799
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,610
That's why  I called you.

800
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:29,070
But... I like my job as a prosecutor.

801
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,900
If you want to go back to

802
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,200
the prosecution, when this job is done, I won't stop you.

803
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:38,070
Just think you're helping me.

804
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:40,690
What's the important secret order?

805
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,670
Northern policy.

806
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:45,890
"Northern policy"?

807
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:50,110

808
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,490

809
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,750

810
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,150
Thank you for your work.

811
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:39,310
Thank you for your work.

812
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,000
Hey, why are we going this way?

813
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,540
Give me back all my money.

814
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,900
I know you guys run a gambling scam.

815
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,460
Give back all my money before I kill you!

816
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,020
How much?

817
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,970
Ten million yen ($182,000 in 1989).

818
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:22,340
There.

819
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,950
You can have that.

820
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,400
Doo Hak, fighting!

821
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:36,400
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

822
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:43,090
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

823
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:49,960
♫  Above the rough sky, my heart floats away  ♫

824
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:56,940
♫  Only your name is engraved like this  ♫

825
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,390
- All good? 
 - Yes, to the dot.

826
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:40,260
We'll be having important guests here tomorrow. Make sure to prepare properly.

827
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,100
When are we going to Korea?

828
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,760
I choose the time.

829
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,810
You'd better keep your promise.

830
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:49,520
I also choose whether or not to keep promises.

831
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,390
Only those with power get to doubt and object.

832
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:56,390
Before you can do that, hide your true feelings.

833
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,920
That's how you'll be able to survive.

834
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,530
 What's that?

835
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,900
 It looks like a person.

836
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,520
 Hey. Pull him up.

837
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,750
 Pull him up! Hurry!

838
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,690
 Returning from visiting the home country after a long time,

839
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:16,730
 I saved you from the verge (edge) of death, and even smuggled you in.

840
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,070
 He's alive, Gramps!

841
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,740
 - He's alive! 
 - Hey, his wound is deep!

842
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:23,180
 Hurry! Move quickly!

843
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,160
You lost your life once.

844
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,860
Shouldn't you try to stay alive for a long time now?

845
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,260
Thank you so much for coming this far.

846
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,810
My name is Chae Dong Pal.

847
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:55,400
Nice to meet you. I'm Hwang Choong Sung.

848
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:00,330
And this is Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong, my aide.

849
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:04,260
I brought some good rice wine from Korea.

850
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,570
Would you like to have some while we talk?

851
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,520
Sure thing.

852
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,490
Northern Policy. Sounds good.

853
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:18,680
We're attempting to contact the Soviet Union via many routes.

854
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,630
But nothing has been confirmed yet.

855
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:23,880
And North Korea also interferes with some success.

856
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,620
I know you have been making deals in Kazakhstan for a long time.

857
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,070
If you help us...

858
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:32,470
The South Korean government will compensate you for sure.

859
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,880
Sounds great.

860
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,690
I'll also do my best then.

861
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,840
Thank you!

862
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:47,140
My granddaughter will be going to Korea first, as my representative.

863
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,840
Oh, there she comes, just in time.

864
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:53,720
All right. This is my granddaughter, Chae Ha Yeon.

865
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,670
Introduce yourself. They're from South Korea.

866
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:58,530
Hello, my name is Chae Ha Yeon.

867
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,540
Nice to meet you.

868
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,600
My name is Choi Cheol Woong.

869
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,530
Thank you for your help in advance.

870
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,580
Sure.

871
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:34,910

872
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:44,260
♫  Somebody please tell me now; what am I supposed to do?  ♫

873
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:54,600
♫  Maybe you'll come lie to me now; what am I supposed to do?  ♫

874
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:02,190
♫  Most beautiful, most cheer is full  ♫

875
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:07,210
♫  Darling, it's all in your mind  ♫

876
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:15,010
♫  I'll really come back. They're hauling me back, a lot of men  ♫

877
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,670

878
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:23,180
 You will get a medal of honor and promotion.

879
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,470
 I missed you all.

880
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:25,670
 Doo Hak...

881
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:28,910
 If I want to live at ease, I need to put everything back in its original place.

882
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,940
 In a gangster's way.

883
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:33,080
 Did I kill Hyung Doo Hak or something?

884
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,700
 Doo Hak's mother told me to marry Jung Shin, saying we look great together.

885
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,830
 So treat me better from now on.

886
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:42,230
 He went around and collected bribes from every pachinko (gambling) place.

887
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:44,900
 Fire him right away and arrest him for investigation.

888
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,000
 Who ordered the hit-and-run?

889
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,630
 You're that kind of person to me.

890
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:49,540
 Like a precious memory.

891
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,650
 Jung Shin.

892
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:56,340
♫  Nobody knows, nobody knows  ♫
