1
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,670

2
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,600

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,770
I'd like to have someone watched.

4
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,500
Who is it?

5
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,520
 Doo Hak may hit other gangsters,

6
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,660
 but he'd never be a scum.

7
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,550
His name is...

8
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,150
Lee Doo Hak?

9
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,930
So you want someone to watch him?

10
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,290
Usually, one is looking for an end result.

11
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,380
If you tell me your aim, then the job could be a lot easier.

12
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,990
One hundred redevelopment stickers for Myeongdang-dong?

13
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,710
Yes.

14
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,730
Supposedly, they bought a 700 sq. ft. sticker

15
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,270
for less than 3 million won ($8,000 in 1980s).

16
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,140
But that's reselling for 40-50 million won ($140,000 in 1980s).

17
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,170
My goodness!

18
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,590
The value increased so dramatically!

19
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,800
- "Stickers"? 
 - Not stickers that children play with.

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,210
"Sticker" is the right to residency for an apartment during a redevelopment.

21
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,850
Supposedly, it was a war out there.

22
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,590
Everyone from the Blue House, government agencies, ministries, and City Hall

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,560
all had their relatives buy it up before the redevelopment news got out.

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,630
Gosh, that's why the news didn't reach us.

25
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,900
Gosh, seriously. It's literally a war.

26
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,740
Make sure the evictees can't return.

27
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,260
Make sure there is no bloody situation like before.

28
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,140
- Yes, Hyungnim. 
 - Tomorrow I'll change shifts with you.

29
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,390
Good luck.

30
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,760
- Hyungnim, make sure to come quickly. 
 - I got it, you b*stard.

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,000
 You went through a lot to take care of something big.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,200
Use this to feed the guys some meat, and use this for yourself.

33
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,660
Hey, do you really have to check the money?

34
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,730
Hyungnim, this really will be enough to only feed the guys some meat.

35
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,060
The guys got injured in many places.

36
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,970
Just their hospital bills would be quite a bit...

37
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,570
Hey, if I received a lot for this, I would give you generously, too.

38
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,030
Why, what?

39
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,090
Gosh!

40
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,890
I mean it, Man!

41
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,030
You really think I would siphon the money earned by the blood and sweat of my brothers?

42
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,080
Hey.

43
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,600
We can't get full from just the first bite.

44
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,050
If the next contract with them goes well,

45
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,300
I will make sure to pay you handsomely.

46
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,180
I should get going.

47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,800
Hey, Gil Su, someone threw up in the restroom.

48
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,660
Please clean that up. It's disgusting. Who'd use it like that?

49
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,860
Yes, I'll have that cleaned up right away, Hyungnim.

50
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,790
Bye, Hyungnim!

51
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
How much is that?

52
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Two million won for the guys, and 1 million won for me.

53
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,310
Is he joking?

54
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,230
It's ₩2 million ($5000 in 1980s) just to use red ointment (prevents scars) on the guys!

55
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,430
Gosh, this is too much!

56
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,590
We could earn this much from scalping baseball tickets!

57
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,900
Hyung, give this to the guys.

58
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,000
- Okay. 
 - What about us?

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,450
- We get our monthly pay from here. 
 - Wait, what...

60
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,010
All right.

61
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,510
I should add to the guys' share.

62
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,020
I can't take away what little they're getting.

63
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,490
- She is here, Hyungnim. 
 - Let her enter.

64
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,390
Come in.

65
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,290
Welcome.

66
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,930
You were surprised since I asked to see you abruptly, right?

67
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,810
You know the amount Hyungnim asked you to deposit.

68
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,400
How much was it?

69
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,010
Well...

70
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,010
if the CEO finds out, then I'll be in big trouble.

71
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,370
Don't worry.

72
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,030
We will surely keep it a secret.

73
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,390
How much was it?

74
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,380
Fifty million won ($140,000 in 1980s).

75
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,400
F-Fifty million won?

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,300
Did Hyungnim Kwang Tak really give you 50 million won to deposit?

77
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,350
Yes, it's true. He gave me five

78
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,650
₩10 million checks.

79
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,850
Geez! He's blown a hole in our loyalty!

80
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,540
Gosh, seriously!

81
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,180
"Fifty million"? Fifty million!

82
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,300
The guys have lots of complaints, and they have a good reason.

83
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,570
Now is the time.

84
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,640
The time has come!

85
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,130
Doo Hak, let's

86
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,630
overthrow Kwang Tak.

87
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,170
I will stand at the forefront and fight!

88
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,650
It's true that the time has grown ripe.

89
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,080
The big hyungnim wasn't like that before.

90
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,900
It's because of greed, his greed!

91
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,720
Doo Hak said it himself.

92
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,470
Although you would split a bean,

93
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,700
you would never split a crate full of beans.

94
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,090
Then...

95
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,030
are we going to do it?

96
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,100
- No, we can't. 
 - Why? Why can't we?

97
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,460
Because that's what I decided.

98
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,560
Hey, Doo Hak.

99
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,800
Doo Hak!

100
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,410
Hyungnim...

101
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,770
Non-obstructive azoospermia (few sperm)

102
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,480
and the diagnosis date was three months before the wedding...

103
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,830
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,720
If I had known earlier,

105
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,680
I would not have put Cheol Woong through all that.

106
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
 I'm really sorry.

107
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,180
Life is quite strange.

108
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,320
I almost...

109
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,520
I almost...

110
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,390

111
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,580
I'm asking because I'm curious,

112
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,600
but it's been a while since you saw Deputy Director Hwang, right?

113
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,400
Yes.

114
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,660
Did he completely stop coming here?

115
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,060
I guess so.

116
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,880
If Deputy Director Hwang stops coming here,

117
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,650
she will be stranded out here alone.

118
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,250
I know. Maybe we should find another location.

119
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,920
Oh my!

120
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,520
Welcome, Deputy Director Hwang!

121
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,230
We were just about to leave as well.

122
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,720
Let's go.

123
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,400
Have a good time!

124
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,710
Such vulgar women...

125
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,590
Their husbands are being crushed by public opinion.

126
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,950
- People might hear. 
 - Let them hear.

127
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,390
It wouldn't be strange for their husbands to be fired at any moment.

128
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,590
Have you been very busy?

129
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,450
Shall I get you some coffee?

130
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,690
No.

131
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,390
Then alcohol?

132
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,350
No, not that.

133
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,250
Even if you were busy,

134
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,880
how could you not have eaten dinner until this hour?

135
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,370
People think that we live luxuriously, eating nine meals a day,

136
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,900
but many times we have to miss meals.

137
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,060
They said that a meal missed can never be made up again.

138
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,770
Don't miss a meal ever again.

139
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,360
Please do that for me, Yeo Jin,

140
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,690
even if it's starting now.

141
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,590
So you came all the way here at this time of night?

142
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,560
Then what can I do?

143
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,730
She told me over the phone to sleep elsewhere tonight.

144
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:03,330
I don't have any relatives in Seoul, and it's scary to sleep at an inn by myself.

145
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,040
Yes. You did well to come here.

146
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,120
It appears that she's found a man.

147
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,070
She must be seeing a man.

148
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,210
If not, why would she have you leave so urgently?

149
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,740
What kind of nonsense is that?

150
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,190
How is that nonsense?

151
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,150
She has no husband. So what's wrong with that?

152
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,700
Wh-Wh-Wh-What?

153
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,600
Must she live as a loyal widow and die alone like in Joseon era?

154
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,320
I will sleep in Jung Ok's room.

155
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,070
You two sleep soon.

156
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,330
That room must be cold.

157
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,960
So she's seeing a man...

158
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,890
Gosh, what is going on here?

159
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,340
So embarrassing.

160
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,060
Gosh, gosh! That's so embarrassing!

161
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,770
Gosh!

162
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,280
Cheol Woong's pajamas, I don't know if they will fit you, though.

163
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,330
If you had told me earlier, I would have bought one ready for you.

164
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,550
Please rest comfortably.

165
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,410
The pajamas will likely fit me, even if I don't try them.

166
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,710
They're my son's pajamas.

167
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,180
Oppa!

168
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,690
Let's live together.

169
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,060
I don't ever want to miss my meals or you again.

170
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:42,650
♫  And the night starts to sing a melody  ♫

171
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,310
I will compensate you

172
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,730
for all that you've suffered.

173
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,730
I like the way things are right now, Oppa.

174
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,910
Thank you, Oppa.

175
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,790
I'll look for an opportunity to tell Cheol Woong soon

176
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,830
about our relationship.

177
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,420
 You understand what I'm saying, right?

178
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,780
 I said, "I got it."

179
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,730
 How many times will you tell me?

180
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,020
 If anyone asks,

181
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:10,950
 I will tell them I delivered your baby myself so don't worry!

182
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,690
 "Non-obstructive azoospermia"?

183
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,230
 Please, I beg you, Doctor.

184
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,090
 Supposedly, there might be an issue

185
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,880
 with my son becoming a prosecutor due to his father's ideology.

186
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,130

187
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,220
 Please help me, Doctor.

188
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,680
 Now, all I have is that child.

189
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,790
 If something happens to him, I'll have no choice but to end my life.

190
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,850
 Please help me.

191
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,240
 I won't ever forget this debt.

192
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,850
Is it you, Kyeong Ja?

193
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,700
Yes, it's me.

194
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,720
Have you been well these days?

195
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,390
Kyeong Ja, I'm sorry, but you should go outside for a bit.

196
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,930
Yes.

197
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,590
So... what did you tell him?

198
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,750
I was so shocked that I couldn't say anything!

199
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:47,100
But right then, this guy entered and told him that he was your real son.

200
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,020
I've heard that doing a background check

201
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,970
is standard if you want to work in an important position.

202
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,130
But something felt really off.

203
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,860
It was a bit strange that he came looking for us when we had left our hometown.

204
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,660
- And... 
 - And what?

205
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,310
I felt like his face looked a bit familiar.

206
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,970
When we used to live in Yeosu,

207
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,130
I passed this guy who used to drop by your place often.

208
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,490
He kind of looks a bit like that guy.

209
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,890
No way. You probably saw it incorrectly.

210
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:25,090
I felt like he came knowing something so I was so scared.

211
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,660
"Knowing something"?

212
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,660
What are you saying that he knows?

213
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,220
- Excuse me? 
 - Erase those wrong thoughts from your mind.

214
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,820
Cheol Woong is my son.

215
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,890
You got that?

216
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,050
Gosh, I wish that was true, too.

217
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,180
But it's because I can't control how I feel.

218
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,390
Honey!

219
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,370
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,580
I will make sure to keep her mouth shut.

221
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,950
Then we shall be on our way.

222
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,240
Hurry and get up!

223
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,920
Wait.

224
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,070
Doo Hak's mother,

225
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,380
would you like to help me with my work?

226
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,660
Excuse me?

227
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,200
I did ask many favors of you,

228
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,260
and I hope I could be some financial support to you as well.

229
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,580
I seem to remember that you were quite good driving the cultivator.

230
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,840
I just can't believe it.

231
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,760
She used to avoid me like I was a snake; she's asking me to help her with work?

232
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,480
Also, is she asking me to get a driver's license at my age?

233
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,530
Gosh, so ridiculous.

234
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,050
Don't nag and just help her.

235
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,490
No matter how I look at it,

236
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:58,100
it appears she is trying to keep watch over me because she is worried that

237
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,600
I might say that Cheol Woong is not her real son?

238
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,350
So why do you have lingering desires for Cheol Woong?

239
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,830
How can I erase that from my memory and forget?

240
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,550
If there is an eraser like that in the world, bring it to me!

241
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,190
This woman, seriously!

242
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,700
So are you saying you won't do it?

243
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,210
Of course, I should do it.

244
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:18,310
I'd get to see my baby often, who will become a judge or prosecutor.

245
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,950
Just try to say that one more time.

246
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,850
- Then I will really– 
 - Okay, okay!

247
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,720
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't!

248
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,000
Look at this... oh my.

249
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,220
Gosh, well, I'm good at driving.

250
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,230

251
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,760
All right. So these are the redevelopment plans.

252
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,280
The regions left are these three sections.

253
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,710
I think it would be good to do all three.

254
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,890
If we were to choose just one, I would get this one.

255
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,970

256
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,240
The next time we do a job like this time, Hyungnim Gil Su...

257
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,780

258
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,220

259
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,030
Congrats on becoming a prosecutor.

260
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,600
I tried to live with some distance between us.

261
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,620
But since you really became a prosecutor,

262
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,540
I thought you'd sulk all your life if I don't congratulate you.

263
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,400
- So I made efforts to come here. 
 - All right.

264
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,930
If you didn't come out today, I was going to prosecute you.

265
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,890
Thanks.

266
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,160
A lawyer told me it'd be tough to become a prosecutor if you get a minor red mark

267
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,980
on your record, even if it's fine.

268
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,930
So I honestly thought you wouldn't make it.

269
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,310
I commend you.

270
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,950
Well, I was too good of a talent to miss for just receiving a fine.

271
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,190
My company's higher-ups were quite discerning.

272
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,990
Showing off again.

273
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,400
That's an illness, you know!

274
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,990
Do you meet with Hyung Doo Hak often?

275
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,370
Aigoo, that stupid b*stard moved since then.

276
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,180
So I'm looking for him right now.

277
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,670
He will come here later.

278
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,810
I called him.

279
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,960
Really?

280
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,080
At times like this, you're quite useful.

281
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,300
- Does he know I'm here? 
 - Of course, I told him.

282
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,300
Do you think he won't show up if I'm here, and he wants to avoid me?

283
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,190
He will come for sure.

284
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,930
He's been waiting for me to become a prosecutor more than anyone.

285
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,330
Also, we have some important things to discuss.

286
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,470
What is it?

287
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,980
I'll tell you if you promise not to get angry.

288
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,100
I won't get angry. What is it?

289
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,380
I have a colleague

290
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,230
in the room next door, but a report came in.

291
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,570
A violent outbreak at Myeongdang-dong redevelopment site.

292
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,900
We are still trying to find out their identities,

293
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,810
but I got so shocked after seeing this.

294
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,110
♪ I should have told him ♪

295
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:03,500
♪ The one who left after hesitating ♪

296
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,000

297
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,720
- Hey, Prosecutor Choi, congrats. 
 - Hey.

298
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,550
♪ Gave you my tears ♪

299
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,590
Have you been well?

300
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,760
♪ Gave you my dreams too ♪

301
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,420
Hey, you thug.

302
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,230
Did you move to avoid me so you could do this?

303
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,750
This is you, right?

304
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,530
It is.

305
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,460
Where did you get this?

306
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,660
A report came in.

307
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,790
This is the job of a thug.

308
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,210
If you're going to rebuke me again, then I'm leaving.

309
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,700
Hey, Choi Cheol Woong.

310
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,420
Why didn't you just arrest him and put him in jail?

311
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,310
And why are you showing me this?

312
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,040
You guys are the same as always.

313
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,520
Why don't you use that good brain of yours for something good, Cheol Woong?

314
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,940
- Hey, Jung Shin... 
 - Hey, are you crazy?

315
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,000
The end is never good when we three meet.

316
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,820
So you shouldn't get photos of you taken like this.

317
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,080
That's why I had you become a prosecutor.

318
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,120
What do you want me to do?

319
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,020
You should pass on info like this to me and help me out.

320
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,220
A prosecutor... help a thug?

321
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,060
Have you forgotten?

322
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,370
It's true that I'm indebted to you, Hyung.

323
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,880
But still, I don't think I should repay you like this!

324
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,060
Whatever it is that I do, and whatever it is that you do,

325
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,710
you should repay me until I tell you to stop.

326
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,430
Okay, okay! But...

327
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,370
don't get Jung Shin involved.

328
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,260
She will become miserable due to you.

329
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,250
I never got her involved.

330
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:27,080
That's why I moved. Also, you're the same.

331
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,730
You're afraid of losing Jung Shin to me.

332
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,630
Why?

333
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,000
Because you can't stand losing. But...

334
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,090
that's not love but greed, you b*stard.

335
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,030
He's here! He's here.

336
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,120
Who is he, Hyungnim?

337
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,740
I don't know.

338
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,580
 Welcome, Hyungnim!

339
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,080
You've done well, CEO Yeom.

340
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,100
Thank you. Call on me whenever I can be of service to the country.

341
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,450
Hey.

342
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,500
Oh, say hello.

343
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,690
This is Team Captain Oh, who is serving our director as his right hand.

344
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,520
He's the real boss behind our company, you know what I'm saying?

345
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,390
Team Captain Oh said he wanted to see you so he came along.

346
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,550
I am Yeom Gwang Tak. Thank you in advance.

347
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,210
I am Oh.

348
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,760
Oh, I see. This here is my junior who led this past operation.

349
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,870
He is my sworn brother

350
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,110
who is like Guan Yu and Zhang Fei ("Three Kingdoms") to me.

351
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,720
All right, please introduce yourself.

352
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,880
My name is Lee Doo Hak.

353
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,190
We've met before, right?

354
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,180
All right, great job.

355
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,070
Although a bit of violence broke out,

356
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,990
you did a great job of it.

357
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,180
Thank you.

358
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,470
Mr. Yeom.

359
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,920
Yes.

360
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,640
- You know the apartment on the redevelopment site? 
 - Yes.

361
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,070
You can be the sole contractor

362
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,940
- for delivering the windows. 
 - Excuse me?

363
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,390
So I'm not getting stickers?

364
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,420
"Stickers"?

365
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,260
Isn't it good enough for you?

366
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,830
Do you know what great profit windows bring in?

367
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,510
Oh, no. Thank you. Thank you, Manager.

368
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,260
What are you doing not bringing in the girls?

369
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,070
Manager, I called a special girl to come in just for you.

370
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,730
Oh, really?

371
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,790
- I'm looking forward to it. 
 - You can look forward to it.

372
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,710
- Yeon Ju! 
 - Boss!

373
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,330
- Let me ask you a favor! 
 - Wait!

374
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,570
I've never asked you for something like this before!

375
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,590
- This is really not it! 
 - I'm sorry, Yeon Ju.

376
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,250
- I really don't want to do this! 
 - Yeon Ju!

377
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,840
Please just save me this once!

378
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,150
Boss, you spare me.

379
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,960
You know I hate this stuff!

380
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,320
I know, I know. I know it very well so...

381
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,080
just this once!

382
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,170
Please, I beg you!

383
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:36,610
One of the men who came today is really powerful.

384
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,570
Hey, it would be really good for you to get to know him, too!

385
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,630
I will just quit being an actress instead.

386
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,220
Hey!

387
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,520
Hey. Are you seriously going to be like this when I'm begging you?

388
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,900
Will you seriously be like this?

389
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,260
Boss, you really shouldn't be like this!

390
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,340
I took it easy on you, and you are acting like this? I should just–

391
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,370
What are you doing?

392
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,020
What the...

393
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,130
Let go of me.

394
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,290
 - Move! 
 - W-Wait—

395
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,620
 - Aigoo. 
 - Gosh, no!

396
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,140
 You a**holes!

397
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,960
 Gosh, this little!

398
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,300
 Hey.

399
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,690
 Escort her politely.

400
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,230
 - Yes, Hyungnim. 
 - I'm sorry.

401
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,250
Hey, hey!

402
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,420
I came to see your boss!

403
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,340
Then go inside by yourself. She said she didn't want to go.

404
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,760
What?

405
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,250
Get going quickly.

406
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,220
Hey, Song Yeon Ju. Hey, Song Yeon Ju!

407
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,010
Hey, where are you going?

408
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,150
- Wait, wait, wait! That hurts! 
 - Why is it so loud out here?

409
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,420
That hurts!

410
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,430
What are you doing not coming inside, CEO Yoon!

411
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,850
Where is Song Yeon Ju?

412
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,560
So this b*stard bent my arm back

413
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,500
and just sent Song Yeon Ju off.

414
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,240
- Gosh! 
 - What?

415
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,250
I'm sorry, Hyungnim. He was dragging her in when she didn't want to.

416
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,920
You b*stard! You a**hole...

417
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,760
Do you know what an important meeting this is?

418
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,020
Also, whom do you think you are to tell her to go or not!

419
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,780
You should stop, Hyungnim.

420
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,450
What's this?

421
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,930
You'd better move it.

422
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,850
Hyungnim.

423
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,030
You rude b*stard!

424
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,420
Are you going to teach the boys like this?

425
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,510
Go run over there and bring back Song Yeon Ju.

426
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,560
- I told you to go bring her back– 
 - Hyungnim!

427
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,270
It's my fault. Please hit me instead.

428
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,160
Look at these b*stards.

429
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,090
Hey, Lee Doo Hak.

430
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,500
Educate this b*stard in front of me.

431
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,960
Hurry and do it, you b*stard.

432
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,540
You should do your job properly.

433
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,660
Are you joking?

434
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,910
This is how you educate someone, you b*stard.

435
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:04,910
Get up, get up. Come here. Come here.

436
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,860
Educate him.

437
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,830
Look at this b*stard.

438
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,760
What's this?

439
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,920
Geez.

440
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,020
What?

441
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,980
Stop!

442
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,590
Song Yeon Ju!

443
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,020
CEO Yoon. Hurry up and take her!

444
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,700
- Yes. 
 - You guys.

445
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,860
We'll talk about this later, okay?

446
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,990
CEO Yoon, hurry up!

447
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,210
Yeon Ju, hurry up and come!

448
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,500
Hello, I'm actress Song Yeon Ju.

449
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,380
I'm a fan.

450
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,830
I've watched every movie you're in, Ms. Song Yeon Ju,

451
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,690
without my wife knowing.

452
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,400
All right. Look at her. She's pretty, good at acting,

453
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,840
and lacking nothing.

454
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,760
Thank you.

455
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,610
Well, Ms. Song Yeon Ju will sing a song for us.

456
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,050
All right. Give her a round of applause!

457
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,510
Thank you, but...

458
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,860
I don't want to sing.

459
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,390
And I don't want to pour you drinks, either.

460
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,220
H-Hey, S-Song Yeon Ju, why are you suddenly doing this?

461
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,960
I don't want to be Song Yeon Ju either.

462
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,460
You guys came to see actress Song Yeon Ju, right?

463
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,820
My real name is Park Jeong Mi.

464
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,250
So from now on, I am no longer an actress or Song Yeon Ju.

465
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,520
I will just live as Park Jeong Mi.

466
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,580
Then I can go, right?

467
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,970
- Wh-What... get her... 
 - Why is she being like that?

468
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,940
I will go and bring her back quickly!

469
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,030
I'm sorry. It appears something went wrong.

470
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,310
Do you want a rolled omelet and a drink?

471
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,350
No honorifics?

472
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,720
I'm older than I look.

473
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,040
I don't drink with actresses.

474
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,900
I just quit not too long ago.

475
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,490
I don't drink with a woman who is older than me.

476
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,480
An egg is useless to get rid of bruises.

477
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,130
Apply this on it.

478
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,160
After you ice it a couple more times,

479
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,970
when the pain goes away, and the bruise spreads more, apply a warm wet towel on it.

480
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,090
It'll get better really quickly.

481
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,880
Are you also a thug?

482
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,770
You know that well.

483
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,450
Of course, I know it well.

484
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:16,610
At least gangsters get to hit back when they're hit.

485
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:20,000
It's always one-sided beatings in my field.

486
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,230
Since rumors spread if you go to the hospital,

487
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,610
you must just become an expert on bruises.

488
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,660
Well, ask away if you're curious about other types of injuries.

489
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,430
What if your bone breaks from getting hit by a club?

490
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,280
Why?

491
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,240
Don't you know about that one?

492
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,480
You need to go to the hospital then. You idiot.

493
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,090
You're such a nutcase.

494
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,270
Well!

495
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,460
I'm really sorry about this.

496
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,660
Please forgive me.

497
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,890
Gosh, it's okay.

498
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,930
I didn't come to drink in the first place.

499
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,240
I just came to have a discussion with you.

500
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
So don't worry about it.

501
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,170
If there's anything I can help you with,

502
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,000
I'll do anything.

503
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,420
Monopoly on the windows isn't enough for you, is it?

504
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,210
O-Of course, it is enough.

505
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,610
Instead of just dealing with tenants,

506
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,020
- why don't you do the construction yourself? 
 - Pardon?

507
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,660
"The construction"?

508
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,980
Well, I wish I could do that too.

509
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,880
But I don't have enough capital for that yet.

510
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,480
CEO Yeom, you just prepare 20% of the construction cost.

511
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,470
We'll fill in the rest for you.

512
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,170
Also, we'll personally tell you where to do the construction.

513
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,660
It's 100% certain.

514
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,020
This isn't only about Seoul.

515
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,750
It's a development encircling the entire area around the capital.

516
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,490
It's a phenomenal amount of money.

517
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,260
There's a condition, though.

518
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,700
Please go ahead.

519
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,220
Firstly, we get 70% of the shares, and you get 30%.

520
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,110
We're giving you 10% more shares than your capital

521
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:17,460
because you'll be taking care of laundering the funds and the taxes.

522
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,750
I understand.

523
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:23,680
Secondly, you may not tell even the King of Hades that we're involved in this.

524
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,600
If you violate this condition, you won't be able to handle it.

525
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,800
I'll swear to you! And you'll have my loyalty.

526
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,390
Oh, and also... I have one more favor to ask of you.

527
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,110
Yes, sure.

528
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,570
Please take care!

529
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,250
Please take care!

530
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,430
Please take care.

531
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,760
Aigoo.

532
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,280
Yes, Doo Hak.

533
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,490
Hey, was I a bit too harsh earlier?

534
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,200
Not at all, Hyungnim.

535
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,800
- But what did he want to see you for? 
 - What?

536
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
Oh, it's nothing.

537
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,600
He just asked for my help going forward, just like I've been doing so far.

538
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,430
- How anticlimactic. 
 - Seriously, those people.

539
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,980
We do our job without them telling us.

540
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,650
Hey, Doo Hak.

541
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,610
Feel better, Man. All right?

542
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,750
I'm the so-called boss, right?

543
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,920
So I got a little carried away, being humiliated before the customers.

544
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,470
Oh, that's right.

545
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,730
Take this.

546
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,520
Treat the boys to some good food.

547
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,690
And let them unwind a bit.

548
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,540
- Thank you, Hyungnim. 
 - Sure.

549
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,350
You can all take off now.

550
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,740
 Take care, Hyungnim.

551
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,920
Geez, what a tight space.

552
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,730
Where is it?

553
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,990
Oh, it's right here.

554
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,780
No, this isn't enough capital.

555
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,860
Gosh, there's just no answer.

556
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,550
Take a shot.

557
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:14,140
There's nothing to waste about a cow, from its head to its tail.

558
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,390
We're probably the only people who make a stew out of the insides.

559
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:25,730
Wow, we ate so many intestine soups at this place, right?

560
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,510
We did.

561
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,860
And you said we'll be brothers who show

562
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,530
our insides to each other until death.

563
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,770
Of course!

564
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,450
That's why I came back to see you.

565
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,600
You remember what I said, right?

566
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,930
The one to inherit my business isn't Lee Doo Hak, who came in from outside.

567
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:48,650
It's you who went through sh*t with me since we were young.

568
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,110
Hey, tigers, you see...

569
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:56,710
They push their cubs against a cliff and only raise the ones who climb back up, right?

570
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,820
That's who you are!

571
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:05,490
Also, Doo Hak, that b*stard, will never be the one to eat intestine soup with me.

572
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,750
Come on. You hung in there.

573
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,040

574
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,880
 Firstly, we get 70% of the shares, and you get 30%.

575
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,790
 We're giving you 10% more shares than your capital

576
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,190
 because you'll be taking care of laundering the funds and the taxes.

577
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,280
 I understand.

578
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,800
 Secondly, you may not tell even the King of Hades that we're involved in this.

579
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,420
 If you violate this condition,

580
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,500
 you won't be able to handle it.

581
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,830
I had to know what Hyungnim was scheming.

582
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,720
Just how much does 30% of the shares in a construction company come out to?

583
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,960
Even if it's 30%, it's at least on the billion-won scale ($3 million in 1980s).

584
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,930
Moreover, the entire area around the capital,

585
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,390
it's more or less a major corporation.

586
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,540
Let's...

587
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,510
take this deal for ourselves.

588
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,020
It was given to Hyungnim.

589
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,220
Will they give us the job if we get rid of Hyungnim?

590
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,730
Seriously.

591
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,600
It's not who you are that matters to them;

592
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,870
it's how good a hunting dog you are.

593
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,420
You said we're talking major corporation level.

594
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,850
Let's pull off a big one and stop sh*tty stuff.

595
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,770
Let's get ourselves out of this sh*thole.

596
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,590
How long will we live like this?

597
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,410
You suspect what company these people are from, right?

598
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:45,460
What about that? Why does it matter?

599
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,330
Let's be careful here.

600
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:51,190
These people are on a different level from us. They could...

601
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,650
get rid of us without breaking a sweat.

602
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,520
"Get rid of us"? All of us?

603
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,930
Which organization are they from?

604
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:03,260
We already experienced them once, you idiot. What was it?

605
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,840
The KCIA!

606
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,290
KCIA again?

607
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,930
Darn, this is scaring me.

608
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,750
Stay out of it if you're scared.

609
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,190
Are we doing it?

610
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:24,670
I heard you're selling drugs these days.

611
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,860
Sorry?

612
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,390
Wait, how did you know?

613
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,160
I'm sorry.

614
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,250
I was struggling a lot. So I was making my rounds.

615
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,810
I know you really hate it, though.

616
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,880
- I'll stop it right away— 
 - No, no.

617
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,220
Sit down.

618
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,160
Hey, it could happen when things are rough.

619
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,980
Also, since you're doing it anyway, go big like a man. I'll have your back.

620
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,510
Hey, for gangsters nowadays, money is power and what gets things done.

621
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,390
Especially if you're trying to become national level.

622
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,170
You can take your hands off the drugs when things go well. Isn't that right?

623
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,160
Hyungnim, why so suddenly?

624
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,180
Young Pil,

625
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:11,320
how long must we live in this single-bedroom house?

626
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,040
Shouldn't we at least be able to let out

627
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,180
a big fart in a proper mansion, even if it's not the 99-bedroom one?

628
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,100
So that it'll look nice and grand when you succeed me.

629
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,400
Hyungnim...

630
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,650
it could cause dangerous rumors if I start going big out of nowhere.

631
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:33,140
- Even you could— 
 - Just do it.

632
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,620
This is only a final test for the baby tiger, all right?

633
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,000
However,

634
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,430
my name can never be involved with drugs.

635
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,860
You know, right?

636
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,790
I'll keep that in mind, Hyungnim.

637
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,030
- We can't. 
 - Wait, why?

638
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,560
Why on Earth? Why do you always say we can't?

639
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,610
If you say we can't, then it means we can't?

640
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,930
Of course, it does.

641
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,680
Am I a dog? Do you think I'm a dog?

642
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,670
I'm the boss, am I not?

643
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,060
This must be kept between only you and me.

644
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,360
No one else in our company may know about this.

645
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,550
Yes, Sir.

646
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:25,420
By the way, how much do they know about this?

647
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,930
Only the chief manager and the chief of security know.

648
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,080
Don't support them with our company's funds.

649
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,410
Let them get a loan from the banks.

650
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,360
Don't leave any trace of trade with us.

651
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,810
- I understand. 
 - Oh, and also... take aside about 10% of ours for yourself.

652
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:45,380
There's no guarantee how long I'll be sitting in this seat.

653
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,220
You also need to prepare for retirement, don't you?

654
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:55,140
Thank you.

655
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,910
What are you doing? Hurry up and get in position.

656
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,300
Doo Hak, o-one second, please.

657
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,600
What capo (crime leader) dares to call his boss' name without hesitation?

658
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,690
Get in position!

659
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,580
Doo Hak, that's enough.

660
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,830
Hey, try embezzling one more time.

661
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:44,900
I'll really get you a coffin then. Okay?

662
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,620
Are you okay, Hyungnim?

663
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,000
- Easy. 
 - Let go, you b*stards!

664
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,800
F***!

665
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,200
One million won?

666
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,200
He beat you up like a ragdoll just for stealing a mere million won?

667
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,420
And I didn't even use it by myself.

668
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:14,060
I gave it to Wolf and Rotary, the rookies, to buy themselves a suit.

669
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,330
Since he doesn't let them use a penny besides rent and food.

670
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,240
Gosh, seriously. Hyungnim and Lee Doo Hak those b*stards.

671
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,840
They're really too harsh.

672
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,980
Did you guys really work without any allowances?

673
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,890
Yes, Hyungnim. I borrowed money from my family.

674
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,720
I borrowed money even from my friends, Hyungnim.

675
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,150
Those two shoved everything for themselves?

676
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,950
It was so bad—

677
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,820
I had to steal company money.

678
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,590
They say family this and family that every day.

679
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,080
Hey, is this what family does?

680
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,300
We're not really a family.

681
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,060
Hey, Young Pil, please take us in.

682
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,890
I'll lead this revenge at the front lines.

683
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,470
You used to be with Doo Hak from jail.

684
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,900
How could I trust you?

685
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,790
I stole it from the safe in Doo Hak's office.

686
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,260
Thirty million won, I could have just taken it and run.

687
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,860
But I came to you,

688
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,940
to get my revenge!

689
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,760
Wow, I'm feeling your sincerity now.

690
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,160
This is only a drop in the bucket.

691
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,810
Over 10 times more are in Kwang Tak's vault.

692
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:52,690
I know well because I run money errands every month.

693
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,870
You know how Gwang Tak never liked the banks.

694
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,390
That's true.

695
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,570
For gangsters nowadays...

696
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,550
money is power, isn't it?

697
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,570
If we just heist Kwang Tak's vault,

698
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:07,360
we can gather at least a few hundred more men.

699
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,830
We can get rid of...

700
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,490
Gwang Tak and Doo Hak, those b*stards, in one blow.

701
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,770
Hey, I want to do that, too.

702
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:23,230
But the timing isn't that great.

703
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,810
- Hey! 
 - What's with the noise?

704
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,160
- What are you doing? 
 - What the heck!

705
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,820
Move aside!

706
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,430
- Move aside. 
 - Everyone, freeze!

707
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,910
Oh, I'm...

708
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:39,500
Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong.

709
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,970
You're Young Pil, right?

710
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,380
Nice to meet you.

711
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,650
Actually...

712
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,540
my target isn't... you, but Yeom Kwang Tak.

713
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,740
You know how Yeom Kwang Tak kicked you out and

714
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,850
has been building up his gang with this guy named Lee Doo Hak, right?

715
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:13,030
Well, nightclubs and liquor stores are just the classics.

716
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:16,440
Breaking union strikes with thugs, assault and violence on tenants of redevelopment sites,

717
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,000
he's such a pain in the neck.

718
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,520
However...

719
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,350
I don't know if someone has their backs,

720
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:26,160
but they keep getting loose like snakes.

721
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,430
That's why our reputation is the worst in the media.

722
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:33,850
Saying the government protects them and stuff. That's why

723
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:37,120
we need to execute one figure as a symbol,

724
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,160
in order to calm the media, as decided by our chief executives.

725
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,890
You just need to hand us proof of

726
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:47,010
Yeom Kwang Tak and Lee Doo Hak's crimes, after taking over the gang.

727
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:51,490
In the end, we did our part of patriotism, calming people's anger.

728
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:54,500
And you'll get your revenge and also take over the gang.

729
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,280
A favor for a favor, I scratch your back if you scratch mine.

730
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,800
How is it?

731
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,360
Are you telling me to believe that right now?

732
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,780
Young Pil,

733
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,240
what's the use of arresting a small fish like you?

734
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,350
Our goal is to catch a big fish.

735
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:15,190
Even if your name comes out in the newspaper, no one would know.

736
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,790
We need someone at least on Yeom Kwang Tak's level for people to know.

737
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,010
Don't look down on me!

738
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,430
No one knows what will happen in the future.

739
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,110
Sure, yes. That's why...

740
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,990
Young Pil...

741
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:33,640
in this world, day and night must exist.

742
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,940
All right?

743
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:37,070
How can we only have grass and flowers?

744
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:39,430
There are also rabbits that feed on grass and flowers.

745
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:43,530
Then wolves and tigers feed on those rabbits, yes?

746
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,980
Even if you don't, someone will take over that position.

747
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,340
So you go ahead and take it!

748
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,730
Instead, you just need to cooperate and don't cause major trouble.

749
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,350
Okay?

750
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,980
Hey, step on it more!

751
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,800
Y-Yes.

752
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,080

753
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,630
During the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592,

754
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,400
Admiral Yi Sun-sin didn't obey the king's order to move out,

755
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,090
after which he was beaten and removed from his position, right?

756
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:25,690
If you don't listen to the king, it's the death penalty right away. However...

757
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,290
Admiral Yi Sun-sin made great contributions before that,

758
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,440
and the king gave him a letter of pardon.

759
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,670
What's a letter of pardon?

760
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,520
It's a certificate saying you'll be pardoned

761
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,050
from the death penalty once, regardless of whatever crime.

762
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,350
This is what that is.

763
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:48,850
Hey, this is really hard to get, all right?

764
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,490
You can't show it to other people or brag about it, okay?

765
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:57,360
All right. Now, I'll stamp—

766
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,230
I mean, I'll put my fingerprint on it.

767
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,580
And after yours, your safety is guaranteed.

768
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,980
And it's game over.

769
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,380

770
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,060
You're here?

771
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,930
- I'm sorry for coming late. 
 - It's okay.

772
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,730
Please take a seat.

773
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,200
- Let's order some tea first. 
 - No. I don't need tea.

774
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,330
I'm thankful you thought of me, but I really retired.

775
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:44,930
When did you retire?

776
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:46,640
Yesterday.

777
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,960
So please cast another actress.

778
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,860
This movie will really succeed.

779
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,830
The role is perfect for you.

780
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,870
- And I'll give you a good guarantee— 
 - Then...

781
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:58,480
an actress who fell in love with a gangster,

782
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,580
will that be okay?

783
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:05,770
Not in a movie, but in real life.

784
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,130
I'm also a crazy b*tch.

785
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:13,870
You know those gangsters who took me from the film set before, right?

786
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,020
O-Oh, yes.

787
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,310
I can't help my feelings for him.

788
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,340
Yes, I'm going to date him.

789
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,640
I'm crazy, right?

790
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,000
Thank you for coming out today.

791
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,570
All right then.

792
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,680
You're indeed crazy.

793
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:59,520
You'll get indigestion. Slow down.

794
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,660
I need to finish quickly and go back to work right after.

795
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:09,400
By the way, what's the serious talk you mentioned?

796
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,070
Don't you have any woman you're seeing?

797
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:19,360
I heard matchmaking madams flock to other judges and

798
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,280
prosecutors ever since they were in the training institute.

799
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,360
You called me in to ask me that?

800
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,650
Why?

801
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:30,230
Are you worried your son won't get married?

802
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,670
That's not it.

803
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,820
What is it then?

804
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:40,360
If you get married, your father's seat will be empty, you know?

805
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:46,420
Never mind.

806
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,980
Let's discuss it again later. Do you want coffee?

807
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,210
Mom, are you seeing someone?

808
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,810
That's not it.

809
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:00,360
You are. Right?

810
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,280
Well...

811
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,990
How great.

812
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,290
That's really great!

813
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,100
Is that really what you think?

814
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,750
I mean it!

815
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,410
For my mom, who's so young and pretty,

816
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:15,340
does it make sense for her to spend the rest of her life alone?

817
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,510
If you didn't have such interests,

818
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,880
I was thinking about getting you a guy myself.

819
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,450
It's really great.

820
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,710
Cheol Woong...

821
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,540
Why?

822
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:41,530
Were you worried I would be against it?

823
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,480
Because of Dad?

824
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:51,110
Dad has me, who's continuing the Choi family heritage.

825
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,600
By the way, what does he do for a living?

826
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,110
When, where, and how did you meet him?

827
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:05,180
He's a good person.

828
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,870
I'll arrange a meeting later.

829
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:12,450
My goodness. I'm really looking forward to it.

830
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:16,300
Mom, dating and all...

831
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,770
You're better than your son.

832
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,080
It's cold.

833
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,620
Hurry and go inside.

834
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,760
- Take care. 
 - All right. I'm off.

835
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,970
"Baseball stadium, the audience is cheering loudly."

836
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:56,750
Hey, Jung Shin!

837
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,860
If you sign the papers with Director Lee Jang Ho,

838
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,240
you must let me sing one of the OSTs, okay?

839
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,440
If you don't, I'll pack my things and go to Yeosu.

840
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,400
Just go now. All right?

841
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,860
Who is it at this hour?

842
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:18,230
"Today's victory alone is really..."

843
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,820
Oh my. Cheol Woong!

844
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,270
Well, pork belly with soju?

845
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:27,740
Hey, Jung Shin!

846
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:32,390
Hey!

847
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:35,700
What's the occasion?

848
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,600
Is this to celebrate your mom getting a boyfriend?

849
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,200
You need to drink with your mom. Why are you celebrating here?

850
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,120
Are you unhappy my mom got a boyfriend?

851
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,080
I'm not.

852
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,590
It's not like you're a stranger. Can't you just congratulate her?

853
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,630
All right. I congratulate her. I do.

854
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:06,460
But I'm just not sure if it's my place to congratulate her. It's weird.

855
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:10,880
I sincerely congratulate you and your mom, Cheol Woong.

856
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,050
Hey, Cheol Woong...

857
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:17,050
you're really cool.

858
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:19,550
There wouldn't be that many men in this world

859
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:23,220
who'd celebrate his mom's remarriage.

860
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:28,360
Cheol Woong, would you like to listen to a song I wrote?

861
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,820
Sure.

862
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:41,620
♪ It's all in the past already ♪

863
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:49,190
♪ Even though I turn away, telling myself that ♪

864
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:56,240
♪ The sorrowful eyes only become blurrier ♪

865
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,220
- That idiot. 
 - ♪ Sadder than breaking up ♪

866
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:05,340
♪ Is your wish for my happiness ♪

867
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:11,890
♪ Like the stars that used to shine at night ♪

868
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:16,620
 ♪ Above your eyes ♪

869
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:21,420
Listening to this song, it feels... just how I feel.

870
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,180
Oh my, is that so?

871
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,110
♪ Again ♪

872
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:35,120
♪ Tears fall down endlessly ♪

873
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,340
Gosh, that stupid dog.

874
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:01,690
What's wrong with them?

875
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:08,210
 I'll take care of Hyungnim.

876
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:11,700
 Take both Achilles' heels from Doo Hak.

877
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,600

878
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,190
 You mustn't fail.

879
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:49,600
 If Doo Hak joins forces with Hyungnim, things will be harder.

880
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,810
- Hey! 
 - What?

881
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,510
What the heck?

882
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,910
Stop!

883
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,350
- Hyungnim! Hyungnim! 
 - Why?

884
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:23,420
- What's the matter? 
 - Hyungnim, please escape through the emergency exit.

885
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,440
That son of a b*tch.

886
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,260
Sh*t!

887
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:07,700
Where did he go?

888
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,660
Geez...

889
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:29,950
Who is it?

890
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,620
- You're here? 
 - Who is it?

891
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:41,560
Oh! Young Pil.

892
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,870
Hey, you came just in time.

893
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:46,510
You're really the only one.

894
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:50,850
Hey, this is Doo Hak, that a**hole's doing, right?

895
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,470
That f***er, I knew it.

896
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:59,240
Hey, Young Pil... by the way...

897
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,830
how did you know to come here?

898
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:03,540
I know, right?

899
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,960
How do you think I knew?

900
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,850
Young Pil!

901
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,190
Even though we ambushed him, he fought back so much.

902
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,090
We had a bit of trouble.

903
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:03,840
Great job.

904
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,260
Hyungnim.

905
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,950
Doo Hak, your favorite one, is here.

906
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:15,040

907
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:21,770
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

908
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:28,240
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

909
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:35,280
♫  Above the rough sky, my heart floats away  ♫

910
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,150
♫  Only your name is engraved like this  ♫

911
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:42,290

912
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:46,150
 If things go well, the day you slap a silver bracelet on me just might come, Prosecutor Choi.

913
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,610
 I told him.

914
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,370
-  Told him what? 
 - That I want to break up.

915
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:52,520
 These are confiscated goods from Yeom Kwang Tak's house.

916
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,530
 - I actually found who was behind it already. 
 - Who was it?

917
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:57,140
 Before we become one family,

918
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,160
 there's one more fact you must know, Madam.

919
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,880
 Jung Shin, if I quit being a gangster,

920
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,620
 will you live with me?

921
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:07,030
 Those people aren't humans.

922
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,810
 Die.

923
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,550
 It's punishment for killing my hunting dog.

924
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,000
♫  It's such a useless thing to say  ♫
