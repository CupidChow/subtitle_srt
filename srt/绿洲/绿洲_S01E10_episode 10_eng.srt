1
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,230

2
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,530
What brings you here, without a call?

3
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,410
Don't do it.

4
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,750
What's with you? What do you mean "don't do it"?

5
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,020
Marrying Lee Doo Hak.

6
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,440
I didn't come to whine about why you chose Lee Doo Hak over me.

7
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,270
You just can't marry Lee Doo Hak.

8
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,100
I told him to leave the business for good.

9
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,330
In return, I will be with him.

10
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,420
It's not that he left the business for good;

11
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,450
he's handling it under the table.

12
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,420
Lee Doo Hak is currently managing the funds of an even larger organization.

13
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,940
Lee Doo Hak? Isn't he Hyung to you?

14
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,740
Well, he could become a defendant.

15
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,430
When he commits a crime, then put him in jail.

16
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,710
When that happens, I'll leave him, too.

17
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,000
You will...

18
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,430
definitely get hurt.

19
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,300
That is for me to handle.

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,930
- You don't know what kind of a man you're with. 
 - Cheol Woong,

21
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,840
please just leave Doo Hak and me alone.

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,080
If you don't, only you will suffer.

23
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,940
Hello?

24
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,990
 It's Yeo Jin.

25
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,830
 I was blackmailed today as well.

26
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,580
I really feel like dying...

27
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,590
 Yeo Jin, Yeo Jin!

28
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,910
 Yeo Jin!

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,450
Team Captain Oh.

30
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,640
Yes, please speak.

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,040
This has nothing to do with the country or the people, but it has to do with my family.

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,650
I need you to take care of some difficult business.

33
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,210
All by yourself, without anyone else knowing.

34
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,500
I believe your peace is connected to national peace, Deputy Director.

35
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,750
Just give me your orders.

36
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,090
Thank you.

37
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,440
I will be with you until the day I die.

38
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:08,750

39
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,020
I heard from Mother

40
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,140
that you're my biological father.

41
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,180
Really?

42
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,870
You must have been shocked.

43
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,590
Yes.

44
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,380
I planned on being together with your mother for the rest of our lives.

45
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,680
It is not your mother's flaw.

46
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,600
I know.

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,380
But...

48
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,940
I will keep Choi as my last name.

49
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,430
Please understand.

50
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,270
Also...

51
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,730
I have a favor to ask you.

52
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,430
Lee Doo Hak...

53
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,030
please cut ties with him.

54
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,210
I'll do the same.

55
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,590
Is it because he knows your secret of being a murderer?

56
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,030
I thought he was a rather useful hunting dog.

57
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,770
Please find another hunting dog.

58
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,180
Why are you so concerned with Lee Doo Hak?

59
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,930
Since he is a criminal,

60
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,150
and I am one who catches criminals.

61
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,330
Weren't you guys friends?

62
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,990
Lee Doo Hak helped you out before, too.

63
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,840
I know how to separate professional and personal matters.

64
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,020
If you do not cut ties with Lee Doo Hak, Deputy Director...

65
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,710
If I don't?

66
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,580
Then I will handle this according to the law.

67
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,840
I mean it.

68
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,810
I'll consider it.

69
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,140
Gosh, you scared me!

70
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,420
It's so late, why are you awake?

71
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,330
Aren't you sleepy?

72
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,180
Are you waiting for a call?

73
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,940
Did you fight with Doo Hak?

74
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,450
Gosh, you're being so bothersome.

75
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,860
Just go back inside and sleep.

76
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,380
I'm going to the bathroom.

77
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,300
Also, you're more bothersome, B*itch!

78
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,950
She should just hurry up and get married! Aigoo.

79
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,570
Is that you, Doo Hak?

80
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,200
What on Earth is going on?

81
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,840
Does it have to do with the news from earlier?

82
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,910
My father passed away.

83
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,450
What did you say just now?

84
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,590
Your father?

85
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,090
Yes.

86
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,920
Why did your father die?

87
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,250
I know...

88
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,320
Why did he die here?

89
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,180
Maybe you saw incorrectly? Are you sure it's your father?

90
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,710
 The cigarette that Father used to always smoke is here

91
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,970
and the matches from the restaurant where we last ate together

92
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,470
is here too.

93
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,040
So I think it really is Father.

94
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,430
Oh, no...

95
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,580
Oh no!

96
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,010

97
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,110
I should have...

98
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,170
I should have told him to eat before he left.

99
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,410
I should have held on to him.

100
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,460
I didn't even get to say that.

101
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,920
Darn it...

102
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:08,120

103
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,120
 Where were you all this time instead of working?

104
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,450
 Gosh, your hand is rough like tree bark.

105
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,850
 Why are you being like this suddenly?

106
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,520
 You've really gone through a lot.

107
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,760
 Gosh, it appears you've finally grown up.

108
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,100
 Be good to me from now on, okay?

109
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,630
 Where are you going now? You should eat!

110
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,070
 Doo Hak's father!

111
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,970
 Doo Hak's father!

112
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,750
Doo Hak's father...

113
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,310
Doo Hak's father!

114
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,780
Doo Hak's father!

115
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,250
Is this old man cheating on me or something?

116
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,540
Why does he keep making me worry like this?

117
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:16,080

118
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,220

119
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,000
Lee Doo Hak?

120
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,020
I am Prosecutor Park Jae Hwan from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

121
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,910
You are under arrest for charges of violence and related offenses.

122
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,810
You have the right to remain silent.

123
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,760
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

124
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,450
- Arrest him. 
 - Yes, Sir.

125
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,440
Doo Hak!

126
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,990
- Hyungnim! 
 - Doo Hak!

127
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,850
- Move over! 
 - I told you to move!

128
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,720
Who are you guys? What are you doing?

129
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,240
We're from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, and we are arresting Lee Doo Hak, the ringleader of gangs.

130
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,010
- Excuse me? 
 - What kind of BS is that?

131
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,720
He is a normal businessman!

132
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,330
That's right! He left the gang business for good!

133
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,290
You guys are his underlings, aren't you?

134
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,040
Don't worry.

135
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,300
I will reunite you guys and have you interrogated together.

136
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,700
His father just passed away. This is too much!

137
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,470
My father also passed away, but I am in the middle of doing official duties,

138
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,500
although that was a few years ago.

139
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,780
Are you happy about this?

140
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,970
You sons of b*tches!

141
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,190
Father's cigarettes...

142
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,370
Father's cigarettes!

143
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,370
Don't worry. I'll make sure to hold on to it.

144
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,500
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

145
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,260
Doo Hak! Let go!

146
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,780
 We suddenly got a problem.

147
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,670
 Prosectuor Choi took things into his own hands.

148
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,930
What did you say?

149
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,720
Lee Doo Hak just got arrested.

150
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,490
 Since he had another prosecutor do the work

151
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,640
instead of him, I didn't realize it.

152
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,420
 What should I do?

153
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,330
Hurry up and go! Stop struggling!

154
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,990

155
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,260
I'm Goo Pan Shik of the council!

156
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,550
Hurry up and move!

157
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,780
Tell me where Moon Dong Soo is hiding.

158
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,850
I'll let you rest easy if you do.

159
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,620
I really don't know.

160
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,470
How could I tell you what I don't know?

161
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,730
I know you guys are dating.

162
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,570
So how could you not know?

163
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,830
We are not like that.

164
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,450
I'll ask you one last time.

165
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,300
Where is Moon Dong Soo?

166
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,170
The gangs in your council

167
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,300
have committed a whole variety of crimes.

168
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,130
Is it a department store? You have all sorts of things there.

169
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,980
And you, Lee Doo Hak, are their ringleader.

170
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,800
The council...

171
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,470
is just a fraternity.

172
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,310
If a member of a joint fund society steals,

173
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,050
does the group's president become the ringleader of thieves?

174
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,470
What did you say?

175
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,000
Is a union meeting of gangs the same as a common fund society?

176
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,750
I will exercise my right to remain silent from now on.

177
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,850

178
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,660
I wondered why that old man was acting so mature all of a sudden.

179
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,260
What about Doo Hak?

180
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,260
He is at the Prosecutors' office because he had to be questioned about something.

181
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,290
What about Jung Ok?

182
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,790
We are asking around about her whereabouts.

183
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,520
Then...

184
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,110
Am I the only one left?

185
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,890
I'm sorry, Mother.

186
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,770
Let's hurry and go.

187
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,740
Doo Hak's father will be lonely by himself.

188
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,090
Why are you here like this?

189
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,130
It must be cold.

190
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,120
Why are you here?

191
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,880
 Cheol Woong.

192
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,180
 Let me give you a hug.

193
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,170
 I'm...

194
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,870
 really proud of you.

195
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,770
 I'm totally fine, okay?

196
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,670
 I really...

197
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,850
 don't regret it at all.

198
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,640
It's yulmoo tea. Drink it.

199
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,680
I was really shocked after hearing the news from Jung Shin.

200
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,370
About my father?

201
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,990
Or about me?

202
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,390
Both.

203
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,110
I don't know if you'll believe me,

204
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,830
but I really liked Ahjussi a lot.

205
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,890
Sometimes,

206
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,570
he acted more like my father than my biological father.

207
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,710
The autopsy results came out.

208
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,220
It is a hit-and-run accident by a truck.

209
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,910
I'm sure Ahjumma couldn't get in touch with Jung Ok.

210
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,070
Ahjumma will be going through a lot by herself.

211
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:02,550
I asked that they resume the investigation after the funeral rites are over

212
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,500
so you should go.

213
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,460
Jung Ok.

214
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,750
- Oppa. 
 - You've endured much, right?

215
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,510
I had no idea you were here.

216
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,050
I went through a lot trying to find you.

217
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,020
Let's go.

218
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,250
Your father must be waiting for you.

219
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,350
Great work.

220
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,640
I don't have to worry about the driver, right?

221
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,220
I took care of that completely.

222
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,420
You should not worry about it.

223
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,400

224
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,600
It looks like Lee Doo Hak is here.

225
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,060
What should I do?

226
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,810
If Lee Doo Hak is arrested, there will be major problems with the redevelopment

227
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,210
we are undertaking.

228
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:37,450

229
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,090
Hyungnim!

230
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,020
Doo Hak.

231
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,150
Ahjussi...

232
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,610
Your father...

233
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,620
Your father, what do we do about your father?

234
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,860
I feel so bad for him!

235
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,240
What do we do?

236
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,930
What do we do?

237
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,350
How could this be?

238
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,430
I feel so bad for our dad.

239
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,590
Girl, what took you so long?

240
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,840
Why?

241
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,920
Do you know how much your father waited for you?

242
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,440
I'm sorry, Father...

243
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,600
Why are you here now?

244
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,260
Jung Ok...

245
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,420
Jung Ok...

246
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,140
Do you know how much your father waited for you?

247
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,800
Your father...

248
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,300
What do we do?

249
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,700
Cheol Woong.

250
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,830
You should bow and pay respects.

251
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,050
Do it together with Hyung and Jung Ok.

252
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,700
Yes.

253
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,820
Doo Hak.

254
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,820
Cheol Woong.

255
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,450
To tell you the truth...

256
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,190
Let's...

257
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,980
bury Ahjussi at the burial site of the Choi family.

258
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,060
Excuse me?

259
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,930
Yes.

260
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:32,030
Ahjussi was pretty much an elder of our family.

261
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,890
I also want to bury Ahjussi there, just like my mother said.

262
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,810
Even so, that's a bit...

263
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,110
We have always been in his debt.

264
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,490
Please allow me to repay some of my indebtedness.

265
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:53,190
That would also be... good for these young ones here.

266
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,650
Things are hectic for them because they suddenly lost someone.

267
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,670
No, I can't allow that.

268
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,300
Are you saying Father should serve the Choi family even in death?

269
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,080
Hyung, what did you just say?

270
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,250
Even if Father put that in his will, I can never let that happen!

271
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,390
You know that's not what we mean. Why are you saying this?

272
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,200
Hyung. Come on, Hyung!

273
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,180
Hyung!

274
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,860
Jung Ok, are you okay?

275
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,300
Unnie,

276
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,400
I am so scared...

277
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,580
It's okay.

278
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,920
Everything will be okay.

279
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,900
You came.

280
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:47,080
The elder asked me to convey that he is sorry he couldn't come.

281
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:54,360

282
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,850
You should have been more careful.

283
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,030
It appears the prosecutors are not communicating well with you, Team Captain.

284
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,490
I ask that you take care of this quickly.

285
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,850
I received the report, and it's already been concluded.

286
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,060
- Thank you. 
 - No.

287
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,310
The prosecution's leadership are opposing your release,

288
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,960
since you are the ringleader of a criminal organization.

289
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,510
Making the council was your downfall.

290
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,440
Since they are viewing all gangs in the country as part of the council.

291
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,460
Go on trial for now.

292
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,680
Excuse me?

293
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,520
Did you say a criminal organization ringleader can get the life-or-death sentence?

294
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,550
Yes, that is right.

295
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,220
But the business is one thing,

296
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,200
and there is no guarantee Lee Doo Hak will keep his mouth shut during the trial.

297
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,560
Since Prosecutor Choi decided to do this, let's support him all the way.

298
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,060
We also have a debt to repay.

299
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,450
- Deputy Director– 
 - It has to do with my son.

300
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,080
Then...

301
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,900
I will expose the crimes committed by the council members and depict the overthrow

302
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,460
of Yeom Kwang Tak as a horrific gang war on news media.

303
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,330
Go ahead and do that.

304
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,660
We don't just catch spies.

305
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,020
We also need to clean up society.

306
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,100
Plus it could be wrapped up before the trial.

307
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,740
Since all sorts of things could happen in prison, you know?

308
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:34,210
Such as a rival gang taking revenge or taking one's own life.

309
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:42,140
I will get you out on bail in the process so don't worry.

310
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,940
No way...

311
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,570
Are you ditching me right now?

312
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,040
Ditching you?

313
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,250
I remember you saying you will even die if you were told.

314
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,150
Right now is a very important time for me.

315
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,850
My father passed away and I need to get married soon too.

316
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,640
Please help me out.

317
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,330
I'll die if you tell me to die next time.

318
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,040
"Next time"?

319
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,690
There's no next time for us.

320
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:21,750
Just push your important matters to next time instead.

321
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,980
- Team Captain Oh... 
 - Don't get other ideas either.

322
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,670
Wait, Team Captain!

323
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,720
What? Is there no other way?

324
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,460
Is that something you should say right now?

325
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,180
If there's no way, find one.

326
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,400
He's finally trying to live properly, and will you watch him fall to the bottom again?

327
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,660
That's not the case. All right?

328
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:04,660
Jung Shin, this is the higher-ups going at him full throttle, okay?

329
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,850
Regardless of the investigation, the result is already set.

330
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,410
You heard of Samchung Re-education Camp, right?

331
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,980
Just like Samchung Re-education Camp,

332
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,980
they're quarantining all gang leaders as a way of purifying society.

333
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,690
Your marriage isn't the problem right now.

334
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,590
Hyung Doo Hak... will get at least 10 years

335
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:28,840
and maybe... he could even get a life-or-death sentence.

336
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,460
What?

337
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,920
This isn't something I can meddle with.

338
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,760
So what did I tell you?

339
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,680
I told you this marriage isn't right,

340
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,480
that you'll be hurt for sure.

341
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:50,380
You're... not the one who planned this, right?

342
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:55,820
Do you... really see me as that low?

343
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,830
Hey, I also... tried to look for other ways.

344
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,330
I also want to save Hyung Doo Hak if I have the power.

345
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,610
Then do whatever you need to do to save him.

346
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:17,880
Doo Hak's father passed away. And Jung Ok is under arrest right now.

347
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,380
You saw his mother earlier.

348
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,430
I don't have to get married so save Doo Hak, no matter what.

349
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,160
If you don't, I won't ever see you again.

350
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,960
Wait, h-how did so many things happen at once?

351
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,580
All of Loyal Brotherhood's bosses are under arrest right now.

352
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,320
We'll also have to stay low for a while.

353
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,510
The higher-ups also gave him up?

354
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,510
Something isn't right here.

355
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:54,420
If Doo Hak is locked up again, he'll never get out. We must get him out.

356
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,730
Yes, I agree with you.

357
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,090
But what do we do?

358
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,350
The cops are keeping a watch without blinking an eye.

359
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,330
We do whatever it takes to get him out.

360
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:11,280
I'll take care of this with Seon Woo so you stay out of this.

361
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,680
Will your brains be smart enough?

362
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,050
Is this not going to work without you, Honey?

363
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,030
I'm sorry.

364
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,830
Hurry and go.

365
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,250
Thank you.

366
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,470
We just returned from the honeymoon.

367
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,770
I'll kill you if you get caught by the cops.

368
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,920
Don't worry.

369
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,720
I don't want to die by your hands.

370
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,420

371
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:47,830
♪  I will go; I will leave  ♪

372
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:53,890
♪  Holding my young son's hand  ♪

373
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,190
 Doo Hak...

374
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:00,780
 Your father is in such a great mood today.

375
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,140
 He complimented me for raising you well.

376
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,670
You really worked hard, Honey.

377
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:25,650
Don't be born as a servant next time

378
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:32,130
and make sure to be born into a rich family.

379
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,310
Take care.

380
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,840
Goodbye...

381
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,460
We've done what we could to save your face, you know.

382
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,000
I know.

383
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,640
I know, but it's—

384
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,400
Can't you let him eat lunch with his family at least?

385
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,830
I can't. We're taking him back right after here.

386
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:17,770
Namsan people also told me not to give him any room since he's dangerous.

387
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,550
We're going back now.

388
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,570
There will be a short commotion.

389
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:48,310
When that happens... run toward the mountain in two o'clock direction.

390
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,930
- Ahjussi! 
 - Hey, come over here.

391
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,680
- Come here, A**hole! Drive properly— 
 - What?

392
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,290
- What are you saying? 
 - What nonsense!

393
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:32,990
- Gosh, this a**hole! 
 - Gosh—

394
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,490
Stop that b*stard!

395
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:57,040
♫  Somebody please tell me now; what am I supposed to do?  ♫

396

♫  Having you lost in your mind  ♫

Stop him!

414
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,600
Step on it!

415
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,680

Wait, I didn't get on yet!

421
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,880
I'll... I'll send him overseas.

422
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,080
What did you just say?

423
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,600
Have you gone crazy? Lost your mind?

424
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,980
Hey, Jung Shin, think carefully.

425
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,630
If you get involved in the wrong way, you might get in deep trouble, too!

426
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:26,140
I'll think about that later. We need to save Doo Hak first!

427
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,820
"Save Doo Hak first"?

428
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,190
What about me then? What about me?

429
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,590
Why do I need to put my life on the line?

430
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:41,430
Hey... don't say it's because we're friends.

431
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,050
You never know about the future, Cheol Woong.

432
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:50,450
I'll also save you once... with my life on the line.

433
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:03,040
He'll go there and smuggle himself out of the country somehow.

434
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,200
Doo Hak wouldn't want this, either.

435
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,080
We don't have the time right now.

436
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:15,100
♫  Like the sky that passes above us  ♫

438
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,530
Gosh, why am I so hungry?

439
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:28,250
- Do you want some soup and rice? 
 - Should we?

440
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:34,950
♫  The day was full of noise; I'll send it off on that wind  ♫

441
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,730
I put a little more than what we agreed, Captain.

442
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,210
Please take good care of him.

443
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,520
 We don't have the time so this is the only way.

444
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,350
 He's a seamen I got to know while filming a movie.

445
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:46,590
 He's sure to help since he owes me one.

450
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,660
I'm sorry.

451
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,280
They can't even swallow the food that was spoon-fed.

452
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,930
Well, that's how they are.

453
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,740
I'll take care of it myself.

454
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,270
Hold off for a while.

455
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:34,570
Lee Doo Hak is sure to contact me again after preparing something else.

456
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:39,480
I understand Prosecution trying to lock you up.

457
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,290
It's not like you failed to deliver the slush funds (payoff).

458
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,910
You kept the confidentiality and never had an attitude.

459
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:47,010
There is no loyal dog like you, but he cut you off so suddenly?

460
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,570
Yeom Kwang Tak?

461
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:53,440
It's not him. I confirmed he left for the U.S. long ago.

462
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,030
Prosecutor Park Jae Hwan is Choi Cheol Woong's colleague.

463
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,980
One who's trying to lock me up wouldn't uncuff me. Moreover,

464
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,610
I hold the greatest weakness of his life.

465
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,590
Anyhow, if Namsan ditched you, there's no other way.

466
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,110
Take this boat and escape to Japan.

467
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,860
- When you arrive in Japan— 
 - Whether I smuggle out or get locked up...

468
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,710
I'm losing everything anyway.

469
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,800
Are you saying you'll fight them or something?

470
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,330
Pull yourself together. It's not just us.

471
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:30,310
Even Jung Shin put her life on the line to smuggle you out.

472
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:34,480
If you get caught, Jung Shin will also be a criminal! Her life is over!

473
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:41,900
That's why... we need to put things back

474
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,260
so it's peaceful again.

475
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,700
Hey, Lee Doo Hak...

476
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,370
Doo Hak.

477
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,940
Hey, Lee Doo Hak.

478
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,010
Doo Hak...

479
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,280
If we shove the slush fund records into their faces,

480
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,280
they'll also have to give up one arm, at least.

481
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,490
If they don't accept it, they'll try to...

482
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:13,360
get rid of you fully, not just send you to jail.

483
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,080
Let's just kneel.

484
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,120
We can start again and get strong.

485
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:24,900
Hyung... I almost died... at least twice on the way here.

486
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,300
I was lucky.

487
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,700
I haven't heard of a guy who escaped three times out of luck!

488
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,560
I think I want to test that.

489
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,310
- Doo Hak! 
 - Hyungnim!

490
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,360
The guy who hit your father turned himself in.

491
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,560
He's called Lee Yong Deuk, and he has four criminal records.

492
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,410
Assault, fraud, and gambling.

493
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:47,890
He was driving drowsily so he didn't even know he hit someone.

494
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:51,560
We told our boys to look into him.

495
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,070
Also, the most shocking thing is...

496
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,510
Choi Cheol Woong's mother is remarrying,

497
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:02,970
and the man is... Hwang Choong Sung.

498
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,780
What did you say?

499
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,540
Hello.

500
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,700
 It's Lee Doo Hak.

501
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,140
I saw you caused quite the spectacle.

502
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,830
What's the reason?

503
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,710
 I told you. Things grew out of our hands.

504
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:29,020
 It shouldn't become a burden on the company.

505
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,730
I know it's something you all can easily take care of.

506
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,710
What's the real reason?

507
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,830
You're quite doubtful.

508
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:43,460
A hunting dog shouldn't be thinking too much.

509
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,280
You'll be getting a package.

510
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,140
Discuss it with the elder.

511
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,560
I'll call you again.

512
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:02,590
A slush fund ledger?

513
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,990
Didn't we agree not to leave these things?

514
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,330
I'm sorry.

515
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,050
My marriage is this week!

516
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:18,880
Make sure to end it before then.

517
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,600
And secure the original copy.

518
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,510
I understand.

519
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,210
I had an investigator and a police officer watching everyone he might contact.

520
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,150
But the core persons are nowhere to be found.

521
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,680
They're more or less the same as one person.

522
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,860
You should have gotten them with Lee Doo Hak!

523
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,810
What did I tell you?

524
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:44,100
Hey...

525
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,520
I'm sorry. Okay?

526
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:52,600
Gosh, but how did he undo the cuffs?

527
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:07,210
Lee Doo Hak... has been found.

528
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,390
Why? Don't you like it?

529
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,590
Not at all.

530
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,020
It's pretty.

531
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,990
Thank you.

532
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,660
Did you hear from Prosecutor Choi?

533
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,060
That Doo Hak ran away.

534
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:38,080
From Doo Hak's mother,

535
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,240
she was asking if I can help Doo Hak.

536
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,750
 Sorry?

537
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,700
 I know it's shameless of me to ask this.

538
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,400
 But if something happens to Doo Hak...

539
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,840
 when his father passed away like that...

540
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:58,430
 I really don't think I'll be able to live on.

541
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,580
 I know.

542
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:05,420
 I know how you feel better than anyone.

543
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:10,460
 Still, this matter is out of my hands.

544
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,260
 He's on the run after committing a serious crime.

545
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,140
 How can I help him evade the punishment?

546
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,570
 Of course, I know.

547
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:23,020
 He deserves punishment if he committed a crime.

548
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:26,450
 But what I'm saying is that men created the laws.

549
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,180
 Judges and the prosecutors are also human.

550
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,160
 Wouldn't they have some sense of compassion?

551
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:36,430
 They might decree only half of what they would have sentenced.

552
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:42,940
 But even if a country bumpkin like me goes and begs, it's obvious no one would listen to me.

553
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:47,660
 Since... your sir is at a high position...

554
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:52,170
 if he'll just give a word, wouldn't they at least pretend to listen?

555
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,100
 You don't really know well, Doo Hak's mom.

556
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,260
 Every high ranking official—

557
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:01,800
 In other words, the higher up you are, you get in huge trouble for accepting such requests.

558
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,540
 He might also get in trouble.

559
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,650
 Why wouldn't I want to help?

560
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:13,820
 If I can, I'll do anything I can.

561
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:18,840
 However, this really isn't what I can help with.

562
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:27,120
 Please help him, Madam.

563
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,400
 If you'll help me...

564
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:35,780
 I'll even pluck out and sell all my hair to make you a pair of shoes.

565
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:41,190
 I-If something happens my Doo Hak, how can I live on?

566
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:43,760
 Please, please. Just once...

567
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,050
 Please help him just once. Just once, please.

568
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,200
 I'm sorry, but this won't help with anything.

569
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,520
 Hurry and stand up.

570
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:01,730
 Is it really impossible?

571
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,650
 Yes.

572
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,020
 Even if my Doo Hak is...

573
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,870
 Cheol Woong's brother, who shares the same blood?

574
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,060
 Will it still be impossible?

575
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,650
 Doo Hak's mother.

576
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:23,500
 Even after giving my child to you,

577
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,890
 did I ever once ask you for a favor?

578
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:33,850
 Must you really... bring that up as well?

579
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:38,150
 You see, I'm not in the right mind.

580
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,700
 Should I seek out Cheol Woong... and plead with him?

581
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:49,150
 Doo Hak's mother, are you really going to be like this?

582
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:52,650
 Exactly... so please... just this once.

583
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:55,190
 Please help me just this once.

584
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,660
 Just this once.

585
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,990
 All right.

586
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:12,020
 When Doo Hak undergoes the prosecution investigation, I'll ask him for a favor.

587
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,870
 Thank you.

588
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,980
 Thank you so much.

589
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,310
 But don't hold high hopes.

590
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,140
 I'd be grateful if you could just put a word in.

591
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:25,480
 I'm very, very grateful.

592
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:33,220
 And don't ever... talk about Cheol Woong again.

593
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:37,350
 All right. That... that was my mistake.

594
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:41,330
 Of course. I'll never do that again.

595
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:44,530
So what are your thoughts?

596
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:50,030
Do you want me to pull some strings... for Lee Doo Hak?

597
00:52:54,940 --> 00:53:02,270
I wish... you'd pull some strings,

598
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,860
just for our son.

599
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:16,690
He's not hiding in escape... but coming to fight with his life at stake?

600
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:22,050
What does Deputy Director think?

601
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:27,830
He's not someone who compromises with his hunting dogs.

602
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,060
Oh Jung Shin.

603
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:40,590
Absolutely don't lose sight of Oh Jung Shin.

604
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:45,920
Lee Doo Hak will surely show up in front of Oh Jung Shin.

605
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:56,400

Gosh, you two are working really hard,

611
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:35,990
keeping an eye on me all day.

612
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:38,350
Well, I have no idea what you're saying.

613
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,030
I think you've got the wrong people.

614
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,750
Do you think I'm stupid?

615
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,310
Waiter! Bring us some alcohol.

616
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:47,900
It's on me.

617
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,300
- Young Lady, you're very drunk. 
 - Gosh.

618
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,360
Who are you calling drunk?

619
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,150
Do you know anything about Lee Doo Hak?

620
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,870
I'm also dying to know.

621
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:02,360
Tell me if there's anything you know.

622
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,540
It's my wedding soon, and the groom must be present.

623
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,660
Do you think he'll be there or not?

624
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:13,040
We should make a bet.

625
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,790
What will you bet on, Ahjussi?

626
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,170
"Ahussi"? Are you crazy?

627
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:19,710
Yes, I'm crazy.

628
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:23,160
Wouldn't you b*stards go crazy, too?

629
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,010
- Sh*t. 
 - Darn it.

630
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:28,850
What? Didn't you tail me so you could see me like this?

631
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:31,160
What's wrong with you? Come here.

632
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,360
I said, "Come here!"

633
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,550
Hey, you guys come out, too.

634
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:36,550
I'm going to crush both of you with my nunchucks.

635
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:37,400
I'm sorry.

636
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,570
She's very drunk. Sorry.

637
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,740
You think Lee Doo Hak will just appear in front of your eyes?

638
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,040
Where are you going?

639
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,020
I said, "Come here!"

640
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,180
Where the heck are you going?

641
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,770
Why don't you tail me until the end?

642
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:50,990
I said that's enough!

643
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,510

644
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:55,740
They left. That's enough.

645
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,560
Oh, Yeon Ju.

646
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,970
Doo Hak asked me to safely bring you to him.

647
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,650
What?

648
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,360
It's so romantic.

649
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,130
Isn't this like some Hollywood movie?

650
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,260
Wait, now's not the time. Yang Ja...

651
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,260
- Yang Ja... 
 - Yes.

652
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,520
Is there a back door here?

653
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,850
There is, that way.

654
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:26,900
Let's hurry.

655
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,010
 Jung Shin!

656
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,980
Yeon Ju.

657
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:53,790
Hyeong Joo.

658
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:04,200
♫  Somebody please tell me now; what am I supposed to do?  ♫

659
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:11,090
♫  Maybe you'll come lie to me now; what am I supposed to do?  ♫

660
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:13,910
A man's got to do what he's got to do.

661
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:16,210
Why are you still here?

662
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,860
Where would I go when you're here?

663
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,380
You're crazy.

664
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,340
Go before you get caught.

665
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:29,370
We promised... to live a long, peaceful life together.

666
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:32,610
We need to go pick up the wedding outfits too!

667
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,210
Can we really do this?

668
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:37,240
Of course.

669
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:41,170
♫  They charge for the darkness and doubt for the rhythm  ♫

670
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:44,930
Yang Ja always said I'm a crazy b*tch.

671
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:47,740
I really must be.

672
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,850
I must be a crazy b*stard, too.

673
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:54,800
♫  The sadness, the dark and touch me   ♫

674
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,480
- Hey! 
 - Geez.

675
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,710
Hey, let's go. Let's go.

676
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,690
Exciting!

677
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:07,840
♫  Is there somebody? I don't want to breathe in  ♫

678
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,950
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

679
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:14,290
There's a slush fund ledger I gave to the NSA.

680
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,140
If that's revealed to the world...

681
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,420
Hey, hey!

682
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:33,770
Lee Doo Hak. Arms in the air and kneel.

683
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,350
Come here!

684
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,610
Hyung Joo!

685
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:40,120
I said arms in the air and kneel.

686
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,430
Doo Hak...

687
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:44,110
Hey!

688
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,610
Jung Shin...

689
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:53,810
No!

690
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:58,330
Jung Shin, please.

691
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,670
Let go!

692
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:06,160
Put your hands up and get on your knees.

693
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:11,620
Let go!

694
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,780
Don't move!

695
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,730
Just stop now, Hyung.

696
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:33,330
Everything is over.

697
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,710
That's right.

698
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:41,480
It'd be a shame if you were left out, Choi Cheol Woong.

699
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:46,470
I heard the man your mother is remarrying... is Hwang Choong Sung.

700
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,020
Everything adds up now.

701
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,720
I was really curious.

702
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,240
But in the end... It was you, as expected.

703
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,290
Stop the bullsh*t.

704
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:03,380
That has nothing to do with this.

705
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:09,020
Let's... stop now.

706
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,620
Okay?

707
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:13,930
If I stop...

708
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:19,780
will you carry out... my sentence in my place?

709
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:23,540
Just like I how I carried out yours–

710
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,960
Let the hostage go.

711
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,140
I can really shoot you, Hyung!

712
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:52,630
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

713
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:59,210
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

714
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:03,190
♫  Above the rough sky  ♫

715
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:06,160
No!

716
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:12,700
♫  Only your name is engraved like this  ♫

717
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:26,950
♫  Where did it all go wrong? I can't figure it out  ♫

718
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:32,720

719
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,360
♫  If I could turn back time, would things be different?  ♫

720
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:41,750
♫  If I could turn back time, would things be different?  ♫

721
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:50,100

722
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,980
 You're all I have now.

723
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:56,130
 I intended to let my daughter and Prosecutor Choi see each other.

724
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,160
 She probably won't have the leisure to come this year.

725
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,680
 Did something happen to Jung Shin?

726
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,690
 I did everything... you asked of me.

727
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:03,830
 You did well.

728
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,860
 You should marry Cheol Woong.

729
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:09,800
 The dead are dead, and the living should live on.

730
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,200
 Does Deputy Director also know about Prosecutor Choi's marriage talks?

731
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,630
 NSA Director's Special Aide?

732
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,630
 Just think you're helping me.

733
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:20,140
 What's the important secret order?

734
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:24,580
♫  They're even more sorrowful  ♫
