1
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,730

2
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:55,250

3
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,890
This b*stard was alive this whole time?

4
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,250
Oh Man Ok, you committed too many sins

5
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,330
so you can't be convicted within the law's boundaries.

6
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,330

7
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,390
The drug addict, Lee Yong Deuk, killed Doo Hak's father and covered it up as an accident.

8
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,640
 Directly ordering him to do so was

9
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,600
 Oh Man Ok.

10
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,980
But Oh Man Ok has no particular motive

11
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,660
for killing Doo Hak's father.

12
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,150
Then that means that Oh Man Ok's boss gave him the order.

13
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,990
It could be the orders of just one person,

14
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,270
 or it could be the will of the entire family.

15
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,270
Can't we just report this to the police?

16
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,710
Geez! Hey, now that you've grown a bit older,

17
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,130
shouldn't your brain start working by now?

18
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,680
How could the police handle "Namsan" (NSA)?

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,670
Also, who would listen to the words of a drug addict?

20
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,840
Who would believe him?

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,450
Oh, you're right.

22
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,230
The police couldn't handle them.

23
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,470
But as Young Pil found in his background search,

24
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,890
Oh Man Ok is intent filling his own belly; he even takes money from casinos.

25
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,960
 Also, although he's the right-hand man of this family,

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,460
he's got a grudge against Choi Cheol Woong.

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,240
Then it's very likely that Choi Cheol Woong demoted him to Busan.

28
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,690
- Yes. 
 - But he was brought back right away.

29
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,360
The one who brought him back was probably Hwang Choong Sung,

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,390
 since he was his long-time, right-hand man.

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,490
 I mean, Choi Cheol Woong likely couldn't do anything about it.

32
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:27,710
More importantly, he best knows the corruption of that family.

33
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,980
So it appears he decided it was best to keep him around,

34
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,970
coddle him, and keep an eye on him.

35
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,960
Usually, the traitor is someone who's closest to the boss or knows him well.

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,880
Really? The closest one...

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,360
Gosh, you b*stard!

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,070
I'm just joking!

39
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,130
In any case, if they all stick together, we can't touch them.

40
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,040
They have power, money, a prosecutor who has the right to investigate cases,

41
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,860
and a vicious hunting dog who wouldn't hesitate to kill.

42
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,230
We need to break apart what's tightly clumped together.

43
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,760
Bingo.

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,960
How?

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,480
We'll have to cause them to doubt each other.

46
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,770
Who? Choi Cheol Woong?

47
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,320
No.

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,460
Within that group, the one who has the weakest connection

49
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,030
and has the biggest greed...

50
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,590

51
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,600

52
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,780
It's the hunting dog.

53
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,950
"The hunting dog."

54
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,050

55
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,090

56
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,310
What do you mean?

57
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,570
Are you saying I protected Team Captain Oh?

58
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,030
Yes.

59
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,340
That's what it looked like.

60
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,890
Mother, does Team Leader Oh know a weakness of yours?

61
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,080
What in the world are you talking about?

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,660
What weakness?

63
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,200
Cheol Woong.

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,190
I know that you hate Team Captain Oh, but he sincerely apologized to you.

65
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,530
Also, our family needs him.

66
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,640
Do we need him?

67
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,080
You should forgive him now.

68
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,090
I mean, I suppose you would need him, Mom.

69
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,370
He played a big role in helping you acquire your wealth, Mother, did he not?

70
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,730
Cheol Woong, I did that for your future–

71
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,960
No, no, no.

72
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,030
It wasn't for my future,

73
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,550
but you nearly screwed up my future.

74
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,780
Your real estate

75
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,750
was purchased with insider knowledge of the development plans.

76
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,510
It's not just me.

77
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,300
Everyone does it!

78
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,140
You know that much!

79
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,910
"Everyone does it"?

80
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,920
Ordinary people don't have access to such power or information.

81
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,020
There's no way Oh Man Ok did that for you purely out of loyalty.

82
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,140
And you are not the type to leave him uncompensated, Mom.

83
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,310
That will all become evidence later.

84
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,780
That is necessary.

85
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,390
Does a horse run only by whipping it?

86
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,370
It also needs to be given carrots to run!

87
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,170
That's because a horse is a beast that can be tamed.

88
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,700
Oh Man Ok is not a beast you can tame, Mom.

89
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,790
Cheol Woong.

90
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,630
We have your father.

91
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,520
Team Captain Oh can't do whatever he wants against us or betray us.

92
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,150
Everything that Oh Man Ok knows about us,

93
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,760
that will all be a deadly weapon that he can use against us, Mom!

94
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,430
Cheol Woong. Why are you being like this?

95
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,320
Your father, you, and I all agreed to move past this already.

96
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,960
Let's stop this now, please?

97
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,830
Oh Man Ok threatened me before,

98
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,300
in this very spot.

99
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,650
What?

100
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,050
He threatened me,

101
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,700
knowing that I murdered someone and had Doo Hak take the blame.

102
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,430
And...

103
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,390
And what else did he threaten you with?

104
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,480
 And you killed a crucial witness to that,

105
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,780
 via the closest person to you.

106
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,410
I'm asking just in case,

107
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,200
about Ahjussi Joong Ho...

108
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,200
were you responsible, Mom?

109
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,690
What are you talking about?

110
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,520
Are you trying to say that I ordered him to kill Ahjussi?

111
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,230
That was an accident!

112
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,270
If you weren't responsible, then tell me so.

113
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,330
Don't look at me with those eyes!

114
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,650
It's not me.

115
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm not responsible for that!

116
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,390
Then...

117
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,900
was it Father?

118
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,400
Cheol Woong.

119
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,450
Tell me the truth, Mom.

120
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,050
Do you know what that guy said to me?

121
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,100
He said the one closest to me did it.

122
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,960
So please tell me the truth.

123
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,610
Lee Joong Ho threatened your mother.

124
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,390
Honey...

125
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,070
- Excuse me? 
 - While Team Captain Oh was acting as your mother's security,

126
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,940
he found out about Lee Joong Ho's threats.

127
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,460
I found out later after receiving his report that he took care of it by himself.

128
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,390
Does that make any sense?

129
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,150
How could Team Captain Oh do that by himself?

130
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,260
There are times in our field when we act first then report later.

131
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,270
You know that as well.

132
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,550
But even so, that is a bit–

133
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,590
Don't make this a problem anymore!

134
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,850
You can't make this a problem, and you shouldn't either.

135
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,760
Do you want the truth?

136
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,940
The truth is... knowing the truth is not always right and worthwhile.

137
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,830
An uncomfortable truth can actually cause chaos in society and destroy a nation.

138
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,050
At times, it is often

139
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,750
more worthwhile not to know or right to cover it up.

140
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,690
But if you still feel you must know the truth, go ahead and try it.

141
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,230
In return, you will have to lay everything down:

142
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,630
your ambitions and your love.

143
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,930
I was so shocked as well.

144
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,330
I didn't know Team Captain Oh would go to that extent.

145
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,710
Did Ahjussi...

146
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,270
really demand money from you?

147
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,990
Yes.

148
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,400
And did you give it to him?

149
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,440
That real estate agency Doo Hak's mother is running

150
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,850
got started using my money.

151
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,730
It's the truth.

152
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,500
Honestly,

153
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,980
I can't believe it.

154
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,690
He's not someone who would do that.

155
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,030
I felt the same way.

156
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,380
I guess it was hard for him to come here without any money.

157
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,300
He was like...

158
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,730
a real father to me.

159
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,470
I know.

160
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,870
Even more the reason I couldn't tell you the truth.

161
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,860
 When I look at you, Cheol Woong,

162
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,770
 you take after your grandfather.

163
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,960
 You will become a great person

164
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,830
 just like your grandfather.

165
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,920
 Well... If I could be like him in the slightest, I would be happy.

166
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,930
 Aigoo, how you're also humble!

167
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,550
 You are truly an adult, really.

168
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,300
 Cheol Woong.

169
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,540
 Let me give you a hug.

170
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,220

171
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,660
Hello?

172
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,350
 It's me.

173
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,280
If you still can't believe me, you can ask Cheol Woong yourself.

174
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,030
Would Cheol Woong admit it even if I asked him?

175
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,260
Who would admit to being a murderer, especially without evidence?

176
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,830
Doo Hak, please–

177
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,490
You can think I am spewing nonsense out of vengeance.

178
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:00,260
Remember what I said to you before I got shot and jumped in the ocean?

179
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,300
 Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

180
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,560
 There's a slush fund ledger I gave to the NSA.

181
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,990
 If that's revealed to the world...

182
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,080
That...

183
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,720
You still have it, right?

184
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,250
Yes, I remember it.

185
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,490
Why do you ask about that?

186
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,240
You said not to open it or show it to anyone.

187
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,030
Because it's so dangerous, and you would get hurt.

188
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:25,590
I wouldn't be around so you had no one to protect you.

189
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,960
Within the slush fund ledger,

190
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,920
there is a notebook.

191
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,280
Yes.

192
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,300
I can say it.

193
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,020
I can say it's not true.

194
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,920
Even if I die and meet those two,

195
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,870
I can say it's not true!

196
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,450
Even if such ridiculous things took place,

197
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,510
would Hyung Doo Hak live not saying anything?

198
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,000
What kind of crazy b*stard

199
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,960
would live such a long sentence in prison for someone else, Jung Shin?

200
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,290
- Isn't that right? 
 - That's right.

201
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,090
Lee Doo Hak sure happens to be a crazy fool.

202
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,660
Choi Cheol Woong.

203
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,780
You were such a good friend to me,

204
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,850
and a friend I felt bad for.

205
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,080
I really hoped it wasn't you.

206
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,320

207
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,410

208
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,120

209
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,720

210
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,920

211
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,720
 That day,

212
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,420
 it was pouring raining so heavily.

213
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,360
 My father returned from Cheol Woong's house completely soaked.

214
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,240
 Doo Hak.

215
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,720
 He looked down at me while I was crouching under the eaves,

216
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,430
 with such a pitiful look in his eyes.

217
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,830
 And...

218
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,410
 with a gaze showing he had no choice,

219
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,900
 he said I should go to jail instead of Cheol Woong,

220
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,710
 and I shouldn't forgive my father.

221
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,550
 Jung Shin was looking down at me in disbelief.

222
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,250
 And she kept asking me,

223
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,230
 holding onto me.

224
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,860
 I couldn't say anything.

225
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,340
 In the police car on the way to the station,

226
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,380
 Cheol Woong told me he was sorry.

227
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,460
 I answered him saying,

228
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,660
 "What are you sorry about?"

229
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,830
 "You are human, while I'm the son of a servant."

230
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,830
 "I'm pretty much a dog or a pig so what are you sorry about?"

231
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,810
 And like that, I came here.

232
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,250
 The son of a servant dreamed a useless dream.

233
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,740
 I dreamed of becoming a Korean Literature teacher,

234
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,650
 and of eating dinner with Jung Shin, who looks pretty with her pigtails

235
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,060
 when I come home from work.

236
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,050
 That was a ridiculous ambition.

237
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,300
 How dare Lee Doo Hak, the son of a servant,

238
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,960
 nothing more than a dog or a pig...

239
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:12,520
♫  Back in your love, in my life  ♫

240
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:20,230
♫  Let me go, in my life  ♫

241
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:26,760
♫  Let me go in your life  ♫

242
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,370
♫  Love you, no more  ♫

243
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,830
♫  I want to be myself  ♫

244
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:42,190
♫  Let me go, in my life  ♫

245
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,700
I'm sorry, Jung Shin.

246
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,620
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,810
Why are you sorry to me?

248
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,800
What are you sorry about?

249
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,320
All of it.

250
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,060
I'm sorry about everything.

251
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,440
Why did you do that?

252
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,370
Why did you do that to that poor guy?

253
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,580
Why did you do that?

254
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,000
Why did you do that, Cheol Woong?

255
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,720
You read it, too.

256
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,850
His dream was to become a Korean Literature teacher.

257
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,000
He dreamed of living together with me.

258
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,650
But he wrote that was an absurd ambition and useless dream!

259
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,770
It's something everyone else could achieve!

260
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,900
How is that anything big or absurd to dream about?

261
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,800
He wrote it was a goal he shouldn't dream as a servant's son.

262
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,410
I was scared

263
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,460
that my life would end.

264
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,360
Of utmost importance,

265
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,790
I was most afraid of never seeing you again.

266
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,900
I'm sorry, Jung Shin.

267
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,250
I really wanted to be a decent guy to you.

268
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,580
Then what about Doo Hak?

269
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,350
Is it okay for Doo Hak's life to end?

270
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,050
Is that why you killed Doo Hak's father as well?

271
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,100
No, that's really not true, Jung Shin.

272
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,500
Doo Hak's father was really like a father to me, too.

273
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,200
How could I do that to someone I considered a father?

274
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,360
That was really an accident.

275
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,630
I did my best to look into it.

276
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,640
I can't believe anything you say anymore.

277
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,460
Jung Shin, I'm tormented, too!

278
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,350
I have done so up to this point,

279
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,560
but I will keep living

280
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,280
to atone for what I did.

281
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,540
Leave.

282
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,030
Killing that b*stard in Yeosu...

283
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,860
That was your fault.

284
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:08,150
I was able to endure him taking my money and beating me,

285
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,350
but after that b*stard hit you, I really

286
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,870
wanted to kill him.

287
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,730
Jung Shin, it's true that I was wrong,

288
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,330
but I can't turn back.

289
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,230
Just...

290
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,740
I-I'll just be good to you.

291
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,150
I'll be good to you and Ahjumma severalfold to make up for Hyung Doo Hak.

292
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,900
Choi Cheol Woong...

293
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,310
I don't know if I can stand to see you anymore.

294
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,310
Don't call me again.

295
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:13,090
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

296
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:20,000
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

297
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,340
♫  Above the rough sky, my heart floats away  ♫

298
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:35,410
♫  Only your name is engraved like this  ♫

299
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,180
Cheol Woong...

300
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,320
When did you come home?

301
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,970
You must be tired, wash up, and sleep early–

302
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,080
What's wrong with your hand?

303
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,520
How did you get hurt?

304
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,120
The skin on your knuckles has all peeled off!

305
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,820
Just wait a moment. I will bring ointment.

306
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,790
Mom.

307
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,570
Yes?

308
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,490
Why did you raise me like this?

309
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,230
What do you mean?

310
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,760
What happened?

311
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,280
If I did something wrong,

312
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,290
you should have scolded me and spanked me.

313
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,830
You should have corrected me until I was remorseful.

314
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,980
Cheol Woong... why are you being like that?

315
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,260
I even killed someone!

316
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,080
So how did you manage to do that, Mom?

317
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,700
Even if I begged you to save me,

318
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,660
y-you should make me pay the price

319
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:19,100
so that I grow up, live properly, and come to my senses, Mom.

320
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:26,030
Hyung Doo Hak's life was ruined, and he died because of me.

321
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,950
Ahjussi died, too.

322
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,730
After that, there was never a day I felt peace.

323
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,390
Mom,

324
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:43,800
if you'd sent me to jail instead of protecting me, would things be different now?

325
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,580
Cheol Woong, don't be like this.

326
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,610
You are my everything.

327
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:56,520
If I had sent you to prison then, I would probably be dead.

328
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,610
For you, I could do even worse things.

329
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,790
If I could just save you, I could even give up my heart!

330
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:11,460
You... you are my life.

331
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,980
You're right.

332
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,910
I... I'm your life.

333
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,910
Yes. That's right.

334
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,800
So...

335
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,130
Mom, you lived for yourself,

336
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,980
not for me.

337
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,780
Cheol Woong.

338
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,860
Why are you being like this?

339
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,120
What occurred that you're being like this?

340
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,040
Jung Shin...

341
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,510
found out...

342
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,400
that I'm a murderer.

343
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,540
How?

344
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,660
How could she know?

345
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,700
I told her, Mom.

346
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,720
Cheol Woong! What have you done?

347
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,560
Mom, I can't hold it in anymore.

348
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,170
I just can't deal with this anymore!

349
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,440
I'm sick of acting like I'm okay, and that I'm not the one.

350
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,510
Hyung Doo Hak ruined his entire life because of me!

351
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,810
I practically killed him myself!

352
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,480
Not only that,

353
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,100
Jung Shin even says she will leave me.

354
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,370
No, no!

355
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,560
What do I do, Mom?

356
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,680
Don't worry, Cheol Woong.

357
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,920
I will meet Jung Shin and shut her mouth.

358
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,100
She won't ever report you or anything like that.

359
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,780
Actually, even if she were to report you,

360
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,430
Doo Hak has already served the full sentence and died!

361
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,900
So what could possibly happen?

362
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,390
It's okay.

363
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,500
It's okay.

364
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,200
How did you endure that?

365
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,050
How? You idiot!

366
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,380
It's because you were there, Jung Shin,

367
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,060
for you.

368
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,040
He said he had nothing to do with your father's death.

369
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,130
Of course, he would.

370
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,150
It was his last chance to seem human to you.

371
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,560
No. That part seemed truthful.

372
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,120
You hope it was the truth.

373
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,190
Doo Hak, can't you just end it here?

374
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,110
You can't go back to the way things were anyway.

375
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,960
You should visit your mother and find Jung Ok,

376
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,850
and let's go to the U.S. or Japan and live there.

377
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,280
You should spend the rest of your life like a human being.

378
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,970
I know.

379
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,440
We should leave.

380
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,480
- Do you really mean that? 
 - I'm not interested in revenge or getting justice.

381
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,760
The reason why I fought with my life to return was to meet you again.

382
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,440
I thought I would be okay with all being forgotten

383
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,340
if I could just be happy with you.

384
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,040
But every night, my heart is engulfed in flames

385
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,540
and burns up my entire body.

386
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,790
I don't know how to describe it.

387
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,670
Jung Shin. I need to quench those flames.

388
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:44,720
If not, I'd burn to death from those flames even if I left this country!

389
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,880
And those flames will spread to you, too.

390
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,160
I'm scared.

391
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,740
I fear that I'll go insane.

392
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,100
All right.

393
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,390
Let's quench those flames together.

394
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,210
But promise me...

395
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,100
that you won't burn up in those flames.

396
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,210
Jung Shin...

397
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,700
Let's do it together, Doo Hak.

398
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,590
We can do it together.

399
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:11,800
♫  Somebody please tell me now; what am I supposed to do?  ♫

400
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:22,010
♫  Maybe you'll come lie to me now; what am I supposed to do?  ♫

401
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:29,710
♫  Most beautiful, most cheer is full  ♫

402
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:34,740
♫  Darling, it's all in your mind  ♫

403
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,880
♫  I'll really come back; they're hauling me back  ♫

404
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,560
♫  A lot of men  ♫

405
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:50,120
♫  They charge for the darkness and doubt for the rhythm  ♫

406
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,570
♫  Having you lost in your mind  ♫

407
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,420
Did you sleep well?

408
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:03,220
Yes.

409
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,680
♫  Kill me softly  ♫

410
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:14,270
Thanks for being alive, Doo Hak.

411
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,660
It took me too long.

412
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:22,000
My heart was tearing apart much more when we met again

413
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,800
than when we were separated,

414
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,030
afraid that it might be a dream.

415
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,890
I'm afraid I might wake up from the dream.

416
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,950
If this is a dream, then let's never wake up.

417
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,000
♫  Whoever you are; is there somebody?  ♫

418
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,700
♫  Please save me now. I don't know what you're doing  ♫

419
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:50,920
♫  Out of the darkness, where we don't have to trust it  ♫

420
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,330
♫  Nobody knows  ♫

421
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:58,250
♫  Nobody knows the pain  ♫

422
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,550
 You're here, Mother?

423
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,880
- Ta-da! 
 - Oh!

424
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,330
Oh, my goodness. What is all this?

425
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,360
Well, this is your first time coming to my house.

426
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,660
Even so, it's a housewarming, not a birthday party.

427
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,850
What? Is it a special occasion today?

428
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,910
Yes.

429
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,060
Housewarmings and birthdays aren't the only festive occasions.

430
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,410
If the day was peaceful without any trouble, it's also a special event.

431
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:33,200
My, you sound like a grandma who's lived a century.

432
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,430
Anyhow, it feels great to see you.

433
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,120
Me, too.

434
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,850
All right, now let's close our eyes and say our wishes.

435
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,740
Shall we?

436
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,010
Jung Shin...

437
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,910
I'm hallucinating here.

438
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,700
I see Doo Hak right now.

439
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,820
I must really be close to my death now.

440
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,660
Mom...

441
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,450
Oh my.

442
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,050
He even called me just now.

443
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,930
It is Doo Hak.

444
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:13,090
He came back alive. He did.

445
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,110
What's the matter with you?

446
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,400
Mom, I'm Doo Hak.

447
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,560
Your son...

448
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,980
Mom, I'm really sorry.

449
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,480
I-Is it you, Doo Hak?

450
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,220
M-My baby...

451
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,980
Are you my baby, D-Doo Hak?

452
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,790
Yes.

453
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,350
Mom, I'm sorry.

454
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,100
I'm really sorry, Mom.

455
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,280
Oh my heart!

456
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,690
I can't believe it!

457
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,430
My baby!

458
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:12,580
Lying together likes this reminds me of the days when we all slept in one room.

459
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:21,940
Mom... aren't there any countries you want to visit?

460
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,100
Why wouldn't there be?

461
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,520
I never even got to ride an airplane.

462
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,910
Why? Will you buy me a trip around the world?

463
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,910
Do you think that's all I can do for you?

464
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,990
Whether it's the U.S. or the U.K.,

465
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,040
you can just go and live there.

466
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:46,710
Is it because living in Korea is a bit difficult that you want to go live abroad?

467
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,110
Well, that's part of it.

468
00:35:54,950 --> 00:36:00,000
Doo Hak, I'm fine with wherever.

469
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,080
If I can just live with my child in this old age...

470
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,000
wouldn't that be my hometown?

471
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,100
Okay, Mom.

472
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:23,090
By the way, I just have one request for you.

473
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,380
Don't ever be a bad son again.

474
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,390
You should never pass on before your parents.

475
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,090
Don't pretend to be dead either.

476
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,050
Do you understand?

477
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,590
Yes, Mom.

478
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,960
Thank you, my baby.

479
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,520
Today is really your birthday.

480
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:58,290
It's better than the day I gave birth to you.

481
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,860
Please make preparations right away.

482
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,150
Yes, right away.

483
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,930
Hello, Madam.

484
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,550
What brings you here so early in the morning?

485
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,480
I brought some important information for you.

486
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,900
If you aren't interested, I'll take my leave.

487
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:34,330
Do you... want a separate reward again?

488
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,190
How could I?

489
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,350
So... what is this information?

490
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:43,550
Changsung Group's situation is worse than expected.

491
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:48,910
Even our agency is worried they might go bankrupt.

492
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,510
I thought that was why they wanted Choi Cheol Woong.

493
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,450
But that wasn't the case.

494
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:58,590
We were fooled.

495
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:03,160
They already knew Choi Cheol Woong liked Oh Jung Shin.

496
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,410
Why did they pull off such a show then?

497
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,790
It's all for the Sooseo District Development business.

498
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,930
How much did he say the profit was?

499
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,910
I assume he probably said something like 100 billion won.

500
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:23,160
In fact... it's at least 500 billion won.

501
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,580
He lowered the profit when telling his partners, in an attempt to take the rest for himself.

502
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:33,160
Additionally, he desperately needs you and Deputy Director for that business at the moment.

503
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,690
How did you find out about this?

504
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:40,400
Well, our company's work involves keeping a watch on corporations.

505
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,080
If there's anything else you want to confirm, tell Deputy Director—

506
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,560
No. He doesn't know of my deal with Chairman Geum.

507
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,720
But this isn't necessarily bad news.

508
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,930
It's wrong for Chairman Geum to have fooled you.

509
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:04,040
But your profit is also increasing as a result, isn't it?

510
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,530
And mine as well.

511
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,130
I must meet Chairman Geum.

512
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,470
No. Even if you meet him now,

513
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:17,510
he'll deny it, showing you the financial forecast.

514
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:21,460
Only after the business is accomplished, that's when you must strike him.

515
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:27,520
In the meantime, we must also prepare surefire evidence he can't deny.

516
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,200
That's how you'll be able to get your fair share.

517
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,440
Do you understand?

518
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,870
It's out of ammo.

519
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,730
Stop playing around and kill me right now.

520
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:09,110
I don't like playing with a person's life, either.

521
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,550
But there's one thing I'm sincerely curious about.

522
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,680
There was another person who wanted to kill you besides me.

523
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,210
Cut the bullsh*t.

524
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,770
 What? You want me to kill a person?

525
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,660
 Whom is this request from?

526
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,010
 I don't know about that.

527
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,060
 He only left the documents in the mail.

528
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,880
 But why would he come to me?

529
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,620
 I mean, you told me to bring you

530
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,130
 anything that will make money after you got out of jail.

531
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,030
 Come on, now!

532
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,110
 Even so, am I a human butcher or something?

533
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,360
 Gosh, Hyungnim, your knife skills are neat, aren't they?

534
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,930
 Man, that's only when we're at an all-out war.

535
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,530
 How could I kill a complete stranger?

536
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,320
 Aigoo, seriously, this guy.

537
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,410
 Just forget about it!

538
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,700
 Aigoo, all right.

539
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,200
 I'll look for something else. Let's go.

540
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,520
 How much are they paying?

541
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,310
 One hundred million won up-front, and 200 million won after the job is done.

542
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:10,230
 What? Three hundred million won?

543
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,550
 Yes.

544
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,900
 Whom do they want?

545
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,050
 The name is Oh Man Ok.

546
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,260
 He's in the NSA, apparently.

547
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,330
You know what's so funny?

548
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,750
The one who got the request is quite close to us.

549
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,070
So he came to consult us what to do.

550
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,560
Isn't it funny?

551
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,760
Do you think I'd be fooled by such tricks?

552
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,100
Hurry up and finish.

553
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,780
I'm not playing tricks.

554
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,180
You're my sworn enemy.

555
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,520
So I want to kill you right away.

556
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,850
However, I'm really just curious.

557
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,090
Don't you have anyone in mind?

558
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,530
I don't know, you a**hole.

559
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,740
Don't be like that, and use your brain a little more.

560
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,050
Don't play both sides against the middle.

561
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,990
By that, you mean it's someone who's close to you, right?

562
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,470
Oh Man Ok...

563
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:15,350
can you sleep at night if there exists someone who knows

564
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:18,250
all about you, including your flaws?

565
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,180
If you'll help us out,

566
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:25,580
you can have all the money of the person you suspect.

567
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,160
I'll get my revenge against the one who's trying to kill you, and you'll become rich.

568
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,800
Isn't it a once-in-a-lifetime chance?

569
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,190
 Think about it carefully.

570
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,590
 Kang Yeo Jin...

571
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,510
 Choi Cheol Woong...

572
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,920
 You two really did it?

573
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,930

574
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,810
Are you Park Dae Sung's hoobae (junior) from high school?

575
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:03,780
Yes, Sunbaenim!

576
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,480
Gosh, Park Dae Sung's living the good life, isn't he?

577
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,060
He was right to start his own office and quit being prosecutor.

578
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,770
He makes good money and got a great wife.

579
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:16,310
Aigoo, I'm so jealous.

580
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,910
I'm envious.

581
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,530
Please speak comfortably, Sunbaenim. (Skip formality)

582
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,340
Should I?

583
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,330
All right. What brings you all the way here?

584
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:30,400
You didn't come to ask me a favor or something like that, right?

585
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,730
Gosh, although I'm a prosecutor, my sword is all rusty and worn out.

586
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,820
It's falling apart into pieces.

587
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,410
In one word, I have no power.

588
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,060
Isn't it because you're too upright?

589
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,850
Hey!

590
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,970
All right. Say hi.

591
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,770
The journalist you asked me to cast.

592
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:54,090
Chun Doo Hwan fired this journalist when he consolidated

593
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,880
all the news agencies back then.

594
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,880
He's an old drinking buddy of Director Go,

595
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,950
whom he got to know due to the Ministry of Culture matter.

596
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,130
I'd like to introduce myself.

597
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:06,260
- I'm a film producer, Oh Jung Shin. 
 - Oh, yes.

598
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,560
My name is Shin Sik, and I run a small magazine publishing company.

599
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,310
His name is Shin Sik (newest style, trend),

600
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:15,360
but his way of life is so stubborn and old-fashioned.

601
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,810
Even when I tell him to just work for a news agency,

602
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:21,660
he keeps talking of realizing journalism's true spirit

603
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,590
with other journalists, who also got fired, altogether starving to death.

604
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,820
All right. What's your business?

605
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:34,120
In fact, I'm trying to run a resort around here.

606
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,590
And when you run a business, complaints and arguments are sure to follow.

607
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,040
That's for sure!

608
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,410
So I came in advance to get to know you while I'm at it.

609
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,690
Getting to know each other is great!

610
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,530
So what do you have for me?

611
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:50,490
First off, I'll give you 10 million won per month.

612
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,690
And I'll take care of all expenses you incur.

613
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,590
Also, I heard the house you have in Seoul is about 676 sq ft on an annual lease.

614
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,680
But it's a little small for your wife and children, right?

615
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,560
If you get back to your position in Seoul,

616
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,020
I'll buy you a 1,000 sq ft apartment in Gangnam.

617
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,160
You've got a lot of money, my lad.

618
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,840
Gosh, I guess this is my year, right?

619
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,480
Such a great sponsor came to befriend me!

620
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,360
All right!

621
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,040
Dear Hoobanim Sponsor, let's drink up.

622
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,020
Yes, Sunbaenim!

623
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,380
That's great.

624
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:30,950
Please take a bite, Sunbaenim.

625
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,880
Geez... No, no.

626
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,920
There's something else I like more than sashimi.

627
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,360
Sorry? Wh-What is that?

628
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,150
- You can order anything you want! 
 - You f**k!

629
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,260
I just love this taste, you see?

630
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,480
This flavor just delivers directly into my hand.

631
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,460
Wow, I didn't get to taste this in a long time.

632
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:59,530
Hyungnim, we need to starve in order for the people not to starve.

633
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:04,500
Once we get our bellies full of fat, that's when the people starve.

634
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,110
They'll starve since their brains don't get any truth, all right?

635
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:12,200
By the way, why did you want to meet him?

636
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,430
It's not even a film magazine.

637
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,590
Could we buy this company from you?

638
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:20,730
We'll hire more reporters and print more than enough volumes.

639
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,200
And you can keep your position as the CEO.

640
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,800
Sorry?

641
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,690
Why buy such a puny magazine company like ours?

642
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,770
It won't be puny anymore.

643
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:34,400
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Sunbaenim.

644
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,010
For what?

645
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,520
For trying to get insured.

646
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,070
That's right, you punk.

647
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,550
You came to the wrong person!

648
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,250
Stand up.

649
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,740
Sit down.

650
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:00,590
Even if my sword is in pieces like a rusty saw,

651
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:03,440
I can still take down someone like you.

652
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,120
And how much will it hurt when you get slashed by a sword that's rusty and old,

653
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,890
which won't even go in smoothly?

654
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,820
It'll hurt 2-3 times worse, right?

655
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,580
- Yes. 
 - Also, Man...

656
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,240
if you do a background search, do it right.

657
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,790
A house on annual lease, too small for my family?

658
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:22,600
Gosh, this a**hole!

659
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,310
I even gave all of that to my wife.

660
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,090
She divorced me a week ago!

661
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:30,560
I'm a prosecutor who's got jack-sh*t! All right?

662
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,380
I have nothing to lose right now and nothing to fear either!

663
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:40,320
Then you just went ahead and put salt on my wounded pride.

664
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,240
Do you think you were wrong... or not?

665
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,320
I was wrong.

666
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,020

667
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:49,220
Thank you for the trouble.

668
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,000
Hey, he's got quite the slaps.

669
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,770
My back tooth is still shaky.

670
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,080
Anyhow, we can say he passed the test.

671
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,290
You said he used to be in Special Investigations, right?

672
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:58,830
Yes.

673
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,430
Will you send the documents?

674
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,950
We'll first send the copy and get him back in Seoul.

675
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,350
All right. I'll ask the chief prosecutor.

676
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,430
Don't we also need to find a trustworthy journalist?

677
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,640
I'm already looking.

678
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,930
Prosecutor Kim, you've got a delivery.

679
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,410
Prosecutor Kim...

680
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,490
- Prosecutor Kim! 
 - Wh-What? What is it?

681
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:20,700
You've got mail.

682
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,700
- Oh, thank you. 
 - Sure.

683
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,800

684
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,370

685
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,250

686
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,590
Jin Hee...

687
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:38,700
- Yes? 
 - Well, check this address for me.

688
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,550
- Yes. 
 - Thanks.

689
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,790

690
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,150
This is the Seoul subway station.

691
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,780
- "The Seoul subway station"? 
 - Yes.

692
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,760
Yes, hello?

693
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:02,150
Prosecutor Kim Sung Yeob, did you get my mail?

694
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,390

695
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:07,910
Are you the homeless man in Seoul station?

696
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:10,490
Are you playing with me right now?

697
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,150
I'm not playing around, and we'll meet eventually.

698
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:17,730
Then I'll give you the original so keep that in a safe place for now.

699
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,390
Do you know what you're doing right—

700
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,830
Hello? Hello?

701
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,940
What's up with this a**hole?

702
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,340

703
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:34,220
What do you think you're doing?

704
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,530
Aigoo, Gramps, please talk it out.

705
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:41,210
I sent you back here to do my business.

706
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:43,450
I didn't do it to tend to your business!

707
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,810
What are you so angry about right now?

708
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:48,260
I didn't mess up any of your business.

709
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,650
Doo Hak, what's going on with Changsung Constructions?

710
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:53,100
What's the problem with them?

711
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,660
You really don't know?

712
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,050
You're a pathetic idiot if you didn't know!

713
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,260
Didn't you say Changsung Constructions will go bankrupt?

714
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,790
However,

715
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,300
they'll build a large apartment complex in a place called Sooseo District.

716
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,360
So did Chansung Constructions build those apartments already?

717
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,100
The rumor is already widespread.

718
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,950
There will be an official announcement soon.

719
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:14,340
Their stock price already rose 30% and will rise even more from now on.

720
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,120
How could you say that company will go bankrupt?

721
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,650
While waiting for Changsung Constructions,

722
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,550
I had to let go of a number of great companies!

723
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,480
You're causing this scene over something like that?

724
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,200
What?

725
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,170
That's great.

726
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,990
The rumor is up and about, and the stock price rose.

727
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,490
What are you saying? Explain so we can understand.

728
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:49,600
If they go bankrupt while getting the entire nation's attention,

729
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,220
it'll be easier to buy than scrap iron.

730
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,290
Even I can understand that,

731
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:57,730
but why are you saying Changsung Constructions will go bankrupt?

732
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,010
Because I'll make them go bankrupt.

733
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,320
By what means?

734
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,350
I can't tell you that right now.

735
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,090
Weren't we all one family?

736
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,800
I've never seen a family who throws an ashtray before getting the result.

737
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,730
Hey, Fish...

738
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:13,710
Can you take responsibility?

739
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:17,270
If you fail on this one, I'll report you!

740
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,920
It's clear we're not family.

741
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:27,710
If you just wait a bit longer, I'll bring you the news of victory.

742
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,960
I'm going.

743
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,530
What's that punk saying he'll do right now?

744
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:39,390
Pardon me. Are you enjoying your food?

745
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,250
Yes, it's delicious.

746
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,470
Sorry?

747
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,830
You're selling the building in Apgujeong?

748
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:49,130
That 15-story building, the cream of the crop?

749
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:53,130
Yes, I'd like to have it sold promptly, Accountant Yang.

750
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:55,980
Well, it's already valued at more than 15 billion won, and

751
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,240
it'll even exceed 20 billion won soon enough.

752
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,030
Isn't that too much of a waste?

753
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,930
Do you think I don't see that?

754
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:03,530
But what can I do?

755
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:08,800
I can't let my only son get locked up after bankrupting his company!

756
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,250
If you want to sell it in a rush, how much do you want for it?

757
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:14,430
I'll sell it for about 12 billion won.

758
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:15,720
Sorry?

759
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:20,040
Madam, I think that's way too cheap.

760
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,640
My son will die if we can't pay the loan within a month!

761
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,330
Hello. Are you enjoying your steaks?

762
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:30,080
Oh, yes. They're very tender and delicious.

763
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:35,890
I can't tell if this meat is going... into my mouth or my nose.

764
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:40,500
I'm sure people will line up to purchase it at that price.

765
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,780
I'm sorry for raising my voice.

766
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,070
No, not at all.

767
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:47,890
Right. When we get a new wine at our salon,

768
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:51,100
we invite only the VIPs for wine tasting.

769
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,650
If you give me your business cards, I'll contact you.

770
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:55,550
Wine sounds great.

771
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,550
One moment, please.

772
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,370
Here you go.

773
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:02,620

774
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,360
Oh, you're a CPA (Certified Public Accountant)?

775
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,690
Well, yes.

776
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,490
Okay, I'll be sure to give you a call.

777
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,660
Please enjoy your meal.

778
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:15,140
Gosh, the thing is really...

779
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:28,620
A little bit toward that way...

780
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,130
Hey, let's get out of here! Quickly!

781
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:35,540
- Hurry! 
 - Quickly!

782
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,650
Did you let it slip naturally?

783
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:44,070
Aigoo! Hey, I almost died of a heart attack!

784
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,450
I almost lost my own eyes from trying to pluck her eyeballs.

785
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:51,350
I had to watch her, but my limbs were trembling, and I almost spoke in my dialect.

786
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,140
I was really at my wit's end.

787
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,490
Hey, why aren't you starting the car? Let's get out of here!

788
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:58,140
This sh*tty car isn't starting! What can I do!

789
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,020
You mentioned Jo Se Hyeong and Hwalbindang (famous thieves),

790
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,190
but you can never be a big thief, Hyungnim.

791
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:08,540
Hey, Man, we're trying to pluck NSA Deputy Director's wife's eyeballs here!

792
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:12,650
Even Jo Se Hyeong, Hong Gil Dong, and Lim Kkeok Jung (Robin Hood types) would get scared!

793
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,110
Gosh, all right.

794
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:17,590
Anyhow, I hope they bite the bait nice and hard.

795
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:20,240
Seeing how her ears were sharp while pretending not to listen,

796
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,320
I think she will likely bite it 100%.

797
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,580
Hey, so let's be very cautious. Okay?

798
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:28,710
With one wrong step, forget a prison sentence.

799
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:31,540
We'll be torn limb by limb.

800
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:34,370
-  Oh! It started!  
 - Hey, step on it!

801
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,230
Let's go!

802
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:43,470
Welcome.

803
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:54,650
Your mom wanted to have lunch since there's a new head chef.

804
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,930
Let's all give our opinions.

805
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,740
Okay.

806
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:03,370
You're troubled lately due to CEO Oh Jung Shin, right?

807
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,130
I told him about her.

808
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:11,440
Why don't you go to a branch in the U.S. or Europe to take a breather?

809
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,870
No.

810
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,250
I don't want to run away for a reason like that.

811
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:20,250
I'll stay here, Father.

812
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:24,710
All right. If you can face and overcome it, that's better.

813
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:35,560
Here's your clam chowder in bread bowls.

814
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,070
Long time no see, Sir.

815
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,070
She's our special head chef for the day.

816
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:45,850
She wanted our family to try the food she learned to make in the U.S.

817
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,170
Yes.

818
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:50,430
Please try some and let me know how it is.

819
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,950
It's flavorful and delicious.

820
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,110
What about you, Dear?

821
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:03,310
I think I'll have to make this our salon's signature menu.

822
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,200
Why don't you try some, Sir?

823
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,320
Do you like me that much?

824
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,750
You like to cut to the chase.

825
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:15,020
Yes, I do.

826
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,980
Enough to treat you to a dish I spent two hours on.

827
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,530
Thank you.

828
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,500
I'll enjoy the food.

829
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:27,090
By the way, there's a woman I've been working on for 10 years.

830
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:30,770
But she hurt me recently so my heart is aching too much right now.

831
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:34,300
So since I don't want to hurt your feelings,

832
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,530
I'll enjoy today's food, at the very least.

833
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,400
Thank you.

834
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,600
You know, when you look at history,

835
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,120
neighboring countries exchanged prisoners,

836
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,420
formed marriages of convenience and stuff, right?

837
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,610
They claim to send their princess for marriage,

838
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:10,250
but send a commoner woman to the neighboring country instead.

839
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:15,390
In fact, that was my purpose in approaching you, too.

840
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:20,530
So my father and his company can approach Deputy Director and his wife,

841
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,880
I had to make my move.

842
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,820
Saying such stuff as I liked you,

843
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,060
although it wasn't completely false, it was all just a show.

844
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,860
But a few days ago, Father told me this.

845
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:38,880
He got to know Madam and entered a business together.

846
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,250
So I can stop putting on a show.

847
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:48,280
I apologize for acting toward you, although it wasn't my intention.

848
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,400
It's okay since I wasn't that serious of an audience.

849
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,100
CEO Oh Jung Shin, who runs a film studio,

850
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,850
I already knew you had her in your heart before I started all this.

851
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,580
Nonetheless,

852
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:14,070
we also have a department that finds all kinds of information for no reason.

853
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,650
So let me apologize, but

854
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:19,450
we also looked into CEO Oh Jung Shin's surroundings.

855
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:23,260
The lads who kept a watch around CEO Oh's house

856
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,390
told me an interesting story a few days ago.

857
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:30,830
It appears she's in love with someone.

858
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:40,530
Late one night, a certain man appeared around CEO Oh's house.

859
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,900
CEO Oh and that man

860
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,930
hugged each other in joy and cried for hours,

861
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:53,000
as if they were lovers who were apart for years.

862
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:57,560
I didn't know to tell you this or not.

863
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,040
But your face looked too lonely earlier.

864
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,600
All right then.

865
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:13,330
The preparations are complete.

866
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:15,980
I'm the publisher of that magazine starting this month.

867
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,620
 Let's meet up and talk.

868
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,420
 Thank you for the work.

869
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,660
 I had something to tell you anyway so it's great timing.

870
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,510
I'll buy you dinner today.

871
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:26,850
 Buy me something expensive, all right?

872
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,080

873
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:32,300

874
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:37,480
♫  Can't you hear me?  ♫

875
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:45,660
♫  You still linger around my ears  ♫

876
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:52,390
♫  I close my eyes again and take a deep breath  ♫

877
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:57,860
♫  I count the moments we'll meet again  ♫

878
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:04,660
♫  I hold you up among the waves  ♫

879
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:11,560
♫  You fill me, who is always winding  ♫

880
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:20,220
♫  On the dusty road, you're my only breath  ♫

881
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:25,400
♫  Will you breeze by from time to time?  ♫

882
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,200

883
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,100
 Be my Princess Pyeonggang (of Goryeo). I will repay you for the rest of my life.

884
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,690
 I just can't bear to watch you become miserable.

885
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,520
 Hey, Choi Cheol Woong.

886
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,150
 You can't do this to me.

887
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,340
-  Cheol Woong. 
 - You can't have Jung Shin.

888
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,820
 Cheol Woong!

889
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:43,090
 Cheol Woong might be fully ruined when the trigger is pulled.

890
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:46,190
 I heard you did it, right? In Yeosu...

891
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:49,160
 Why? Are you frustrated... I didn't die?

892
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,560
 - Yes, B*stard. 
 - Want me to tell you a funny story?

893
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,150
 Choi Cheol Woong's birth father...

894
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:54,870
 I also knew that...

895
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,830
 Yeo Jin must have had it tough due to you, Team Captain Oh.

896
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:58,730
 Deputy Director.

897
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:00,680
 I'll have someone else watch Lee Doo Hak.

898
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,400
 - No, I'll put an end to Lee Doo Hak— 
 - I told you to stop!

899
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,940
 People still don't know what kind of person Lee Doo Hak is.

900
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,100
 - Are you sure you can beat me? 
 - I won't let you win.

901
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:13,160
♫  I hold you up among the waves  ♫
