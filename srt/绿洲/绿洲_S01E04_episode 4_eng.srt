♫  Should auld (Scottish "old") acquaintance be forgot?  ♫

7
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,850
Thank you. Have a good time.

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:26,100
♫  Be forgot, and days of auld lang syne?  ♫

9
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,670
I introduce to you the CEO of Paris Salon, Kang Yeo Jin.

10
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,070
Thank you.

11
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,550
You've worked so hard today.

12
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,210
What do you mean, "hard work"?

13
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,090
More importantly, this is quite amazing. You did the interior design yourself.

14
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:32,020
It's like you returned to college days when you were bold, smart, and pretty.

15
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,320
Why do you keep flattering me like that?

16
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,940
I'm old now.

17
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,950
I mean it. You were more beautiful than any guests who came today.

18
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,020
You shouldn't say that even if you don't mean it.

19
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,530
But... how do I repay you for all of this?

20
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,910
You can repay me.

21
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,490

22
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:42,470
♫  Another moon rises tonight  ♫

23
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:49,490
♫  And the night starts to sing a melody  ♫

24
00:03:49,490 --> 00:04:00,040
♫  The sound from the city drifts to you. All I hear is a melancholy song  ♫

25
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:07,880
♫  Then your voice, another time speaking to me  ♫

26
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,140
 Do you know this song?

27
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,530
 Why is this LP here?

28
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,560
 It's a chanson I happened to hear once

29
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,110
 and ended up liking.

30
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,690
Oh.

31
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,990
I didn't know that.

32
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:28,110
I just asked the band to recommend some chansons with a nice vibe.

33
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,640
What a coincidence.

34
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,670
It is probably fate

35
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,490
or destiny.

36
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,120
♫  We've never told the truth. I waited for you all my life  ♫

37
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,330
I don't even know the meaning of the lyrics yet.

38
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,290
♫  Now, there's only a sad song left  ♫

39
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,680
"The life I've lived was in waiting for you."

40
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,740
That line pierced my heart.

41
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,630
If you keep doing this, I would be regretful.

42
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,480
♫  And the night starts to sing a melody  ♫

43
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,990
I must have drank too much. I'm getting a bit dizzy.

44
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,900
Are you very dizzy?

45
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,070
No, I think I'll be fine once I rest a bit.

46
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,160
It's quite late now.

47
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,630
My son also told me he was coming home today.

48
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,070
He will probably be waiting for me.

49
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,130
We should both go home now, Oppa.

50
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,870
Team Captain Oh will take you home.

51
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,690
♫  I'm awake, but I keep dreaming  ♫

52
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,450
Are you okay?

53
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,800
Yes.

54
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,500
It's a bit late, but congratulations on the successful launch of your business.

55
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,080
It is all thanks to you, Team Captain.

56
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,300
Also, thank you for the LP.

57
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,960
No problem.

58
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,170
It is a song the Deputy Director listens to often.

59
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,770
So wouldn't it be even better if he listened to it with you, Ms. Kang?

60
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,410
I'm grateful to you for asking.

61
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,330
Did you listen to it together?

62
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,880
Yes.

63
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,000
Also, please don't ever tell the Deputy Director that I asked you.

64
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,260
Of course not.

65
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,150
Here you go. It's not much, but it's a sign of my gratitude.

66
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,660
No, thank you. I would get in trouble with the Deputy Director.

67
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,090
I give this to you so that you take good care of the Deputy Director,

68
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,180
and it's all right for you to take it.

69
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,210
Thank you.

70
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,960
You've done a lot today.

71
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,280
Yes, thank you for all sorts of things.

72
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,810
You should hurry inside and rest.

73
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,500
Yes.

74
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,690
Mother.

75
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,640
Why are you coming home so late?

76
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,260
Who is he?

77
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,210
He's someone who helps out with my business.

78
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,190
Son, let's hurry and go inside.

79
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,630
Your mom is in such a good mood tonight!

80
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,590
Have a drink with your mother, okay?

81
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,150
I also want to have a drink with you,

82
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,300
but I must go now since I have exams starting tomorrow.

83
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,330
It's the first time you're home, and you're leaving?

84
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,190
I will come home often now.

85
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,470
- Really. 
 - Son...

86
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,030
You know that you're the only one I have now, right?

87
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,990
If an obstacle appears in your way,

88
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,450
I will do all to clear it, even if it means my body breaks.

89
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,950
So... you can't disappoint me, either.

90
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,540
You must take the bar exam, okay?

91
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,220
Don't worry.

92
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,220
Mom, I won't ever disappoint you.

93
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,780
I'm also...

94
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,850
thinking of becoming someone with power.

95
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,320
My child, you are so good!

96
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,410
I escorted her safely back to her home.

97
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,020
But I saw Choi Cheol Woong had gone home.

98
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,230
He wouldn't have recognized me.

99
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,970
But the thing is...

100
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,720
will it be okay if Ms. Kang finds out later that you were involved

101
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,690
with what happened to Choi Cheol Woong, Deputy Director?

102
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,890
She mustn't know for the rest of her life.

103
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,360
 - Home run! Home run, home run, home run! 
 - Hooray!

104
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,020

105
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,710

106
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,600
Ahjussi, I've got tickets for 30,000 won per ticket.

107
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,140
What the heck? It's the bottom (end) of the first inning.

108
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,190
Since the first inning is over, I'll buy it for 25,000 won.

109
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,310
Okay at 27,000 won.

110
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,000
Geez...

111
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,670
- Okay! 
 - Okay.

112
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,490
Hyung Joo, three tickets for 27,000 won.

113
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,170
Gosh, it's the bottom of the first inning.

114
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,330
Gosh, okay. Okay.

115
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,890
Here.

116
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,100
Have a good time.

117
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,500
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

118
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,820
Let's go watch baseball!

119
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,190
Let's go! Give us three tickets!

120
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,660
How much for each ticket?

121
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,650
For 10,000 won each so 30,000 won.

122
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,540
Gosh, this b*stard!

123
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,630
Hey, are we doing business by digging dirt?

124
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,160
We stayed up all night to buy these tickets! Geez!

125
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,860
We're not selling it to you. Leave.

126
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,660
How could you do this after promising to give it to us for 10,000 won?

127
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,110
How could I?

128
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,850
If I just did, so what?

129
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,890
Go and listen to the radio

130
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,500
while I tell you nicely. Okay?

131
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,940
- I'm sorry. 
 - Wait.

132
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,830
Take the tickets.

133
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,340
Aigoo.

134
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,650
Th-Thank you!

135
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,510
- You should say thank you! 
 -  Thank you.

136
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,270
Thank you. Thank you.

137
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,120
Have fun watching!

138
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,500
The children say they want to see it.

139
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,880
Are we almost done selling them?

140
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,100
- There's exactly one ticket left. 
 - Oh, one ticket.

141
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,070
Can't you just give me that one ticket?

142
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,990
Gosh, what jerk is saying that?

143
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,450
It's me.

144
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,870
Lee Doo Hak, you b*stard!

145
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,580
- You scared me, you b*stard! 
 - Hyungnim!

146
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,800
Hyungnims! Seon Woo!

147
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,810
- Doo Hak! 
 - Gosh, what are you doing scalping tickets?

148
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,860
Gosh, you lost a lot of weight.

149
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,140
No, I gained even more weight.

150
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,380
 All right!

151
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,860
I heard the news that you came out of prison when I went to visit you.

152
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,870
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,120
And you came to see us only now, you b*stard?

154
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,010
Come on, today's a good day!

155
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,190
- Hey, drink up. 
 - Yes.

156
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,700
But...

157
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,090
- did you hear about Young Pil? 
 - What?

158
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,980
- Hey! 
 - Gosh, that b*stard. I wonder what he's up to.

159
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,840
 The assemblyman who is serving in office for our district

160
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,770
 isn't satisfied with state punishment of a promissory note fraudster.

161
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,110
 Sh*t.

162
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,860
 The sentence the old man gave you is to never be able to lift a spoon.

163
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,790
 The old man you serve isn't an assemblyman, but a scoundrel and evil business owner.

164
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,820
 F-For me, I don't know that old man at all!

165
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,590
 Obviously, you wouldn't know the old man.

166
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:54,710
 But the old man's sister-in-law owns the building in Cheonan that you forged.

167
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,340
 I-I didn't know. I really didn't know!

168
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,940
 I'm sorry!

169
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,100
 - Start. 
 - P-Please don't do this!

170
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,400
 Take this.

171
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,750
 I can't do it!

172
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,580
 I can't do it, either!

173
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,780
 This b*stard!

174
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,470
 It's almost time for a close-out roll call so what's everyone doing here?

175
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,790
 Who's that guy?

176
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,620
 He is in their same cell.

177
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,370
 Hey, Boy!

178
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,320
 Are you talking to me?

179
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,860
 What are you doing, you b*stard!

180
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,070

181
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,970
 Oh my!

182
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,030
 Everyone, don't move!

183
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,700

184
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:26,140
 Boy, you must not know me well, but you can't live out your full lifespan now.

185
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:32,060
 And I guess you don't know me very well, but I have no desire to live out my full lifespan.

186
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,040
 If you even leave a scratch on my body, your body parts will scatter in all different directions.

187
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,180
 Really? Do whatever you want then.

188
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,990
 Either we both live or we both die.

189
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,010
 What's this! What's going on!

190
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,530
 Don't move!

191
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,330
 Don't move.

192
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,020
Don't move! I'll kill you!

193
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,440
Hey! Your body parts will scatter in all different directions.

194
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,490
Hey, Seon Woo! Do you really want to die?

195
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,920
When did I ever say, "I'll kill you"?

196
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,930
- Wasn't it "I'll kill you"? 
 - Of course not!

197
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,970
Hyungs, you tell him.

198
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,770
Yes, you should be more cool!

199
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,070
"More cool"?

200
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,790
- Try it again. 
 - "I'll kill you!"

201
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,140
You're making fun of me, aren't you!

202
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,620
 Doo Hak, you went through a lot because of that b*stard, Young Pil.

203
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,380
 They say solitary confinement supposedly changes a person after entering it just once.

204
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,690
You're probably the first person to enter it four times in the history of the Ministry of Justice.

205
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,950
That's right.

206
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,280
 In the solitary confinement,

207
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,670
 I realized why they call prison a "school."

208
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:52,940
You can never learn how f***ed up this world is from books.

209
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,290
That's right.

210
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,880
You have just got one star now, and you're already a professor.

211
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,180
I'm a one-star who's more like a five-star general.

212
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,330
- Isn't that right? 
 - Yes, that's right, Hyungnim.

213
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,360
- Right? 
 - Hey, lift your cups.

214
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,790
To our five-star general, cheers!

215
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,960
 Cheers!

216
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,600
You've traveled a long way to get here.

217
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,330
Wow...

218
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,350
Wow... I wasn't sure when my aunt might change her mind

219
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,890
so I quickly took some of her stuff and came.

220
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,030
Hey, even so, how could you bring unwashed clothes?

221
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,270
Just wash it here and wear it!

222
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,980

00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,060
I think he believes you're the landlord.

240
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,710
Of course, he should believe it. Gosh, it's not easy.

241
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,160
What's wrong with you, Man?

242
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,400
If so, then what about Seoul and Gyeonggi-do?

243
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,330
The copyright market is about 33% in Seoul, with the neighboring areas included.

244
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,660
For Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do, it's about 15%.

245
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,590
But if you want to enter the Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do markets,

246
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,740
you should target the central distributor.

247
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,730
Although I must put my neck on the line.

248
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,830

Gosh, Doo Hak!

290
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,900
Hey, where have you been all this time?

291
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,800
- Hyungnim Poong Ho got caught! 
 - What?

292
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,860
At which police station?

293
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,740
If it's the police, we could try bribing them, at least.

294
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,290
They took him to Kwang Tak.

295
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,680
I told you those guys are really after us since last time

296
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,080
so you needed to stay by Hyungnim Poong Ho at all times!

297
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,840
I'm sorry.

298
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,660
Doo Hak... they said you should come by yourself.

299
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,610
What do we do?

300
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,160
No, you shouldn't do it!

301
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,940
You would be going to die, Doo Hak!

302
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,560
It's just that Kwang Tak's gang didn't expand its influence yet.

303
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,330
Don't you know that it's already in the top five gangs in Seoul?

304
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:03,070
I know you're loyal, but this is just suicide!

305
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,330
Hey, Seon Woo. What do you think?

306
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,980
I mean, I don't care. I have you, Hyungnim.

307
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,430
Hey, do you know how many guys they have?

308
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,790
And they're not just using their fists. They're all carrying weapons!

309
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,660
Whether you ambush them or face them head-on,

310
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,720
that... wh-who, who was that again?

311
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,360
Yes, even Bruce Lee would have a hard time returning alive from that!

312
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,680
It doesn't matter to me. I would just need to beat up that one guy, Kwang Tak!

313
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,650
Hey! Is this the time to be cleaning right now?

314
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,150
Doo Hak, are you writing "Romance of Three Kingdoms" right now?

315
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,680
Will the war end once you defeat the other army's leader?

316
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,120
Is the world of gangsters really that clean and neat?

317
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,150
Is it?

318
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,960
Then what do you want me to do?

319
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,480
I can't just leave Hyung Poong Ho by himself.

320
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,400
Surrender.

321
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,570
What did you say?

322
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,780
I heard that Yeom Kwang Tak is a loyal guy.

323
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,530
If you really go by yourself to save Poong Ho, then he may accept your surrender.

324
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,490
After surrender, then what?

325
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,250
Are you telling him to become one of Kwang Tak's minions just to save one of our cellmates?

326
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,980
He should be a high-ranking gangster if he were to become one.

327
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,290
Then he shouldn't become a minion.

328
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,550
If not a minion, what else?

329
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,880
Hyung Young Pil, that fighter guy, he's here.

330
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,200
What are you saying, you b*stard?

331
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,370
Wow, whom do we have here? Long time no see.

332
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,030
Yoo Young Pil?

333
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,440
Do you remember what I told you in prison?

334
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,680
That you will die before your time.

335
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,290
B*stard, do you dare laugh?

336
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,860
Your hyungnim invited me.

337
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,350
So let's just go quietly.

338
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,350
He's here.

339
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,550
Doo Hak!

340
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,450
My name is Lee Doo Hak.

341
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,710
Gosh, you're quite successful, aren't you?

342
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,460
Seeing how you've become the boss of forgers at age 25.

343
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,440
B-B...

344
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,960
Y-You know, you are our b-boss.

345
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,970
What's this? Are you the boss or not?

346
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,360
I-I...

347
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,090
guess I am the boss. Yes.

348
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,490
In any case,

349
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,310
while growing up with Hyung Poong Ho in the orphanage, we were like brothers

350
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,780
and shared even a bean together.

351
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,510
Now he's a bit successful with his business, he's completely ignoring me.

352
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,500
What do you think? Since you're the boss, say something.

353
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,670
It's human nature to be okay to

354
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,500
split a bean to share, but not want to split a crate full of beans.

355
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,400
Oh, really?

356
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,930
Gosh, you're so stingy.

357
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,090
Then you will need to take responsibility as the boss, right?

358
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,000
But I don't want to live being so stingy.

359
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,260
I will split that crate of beans to share with you.

360
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,610
We will become part of your family.

361
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,770
What did you say? "Family"?

362
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,370
Hyungnim.

363
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,010
Hey, Seon Woo.

364
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,080
Is this b*stard on drugs or something?

365
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
So?

366
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,780
Will you accept us as your family?

367
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,340
It's half the money our family of four earned from scalping baseball tickets.

368
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:37,480
Law enforcement has been cracking down hard so we're not getting much business.

369
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,420
Doo Hak...

370
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,250
You've got guts! He's got what it takes.

371
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,430
Have a drink with me.

372
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,240
Hey.

373
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,670
I heard you're not one to bow your head to anyone.

374
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,850
I heard you refused to bow to Young Pil to the very end in prison.

375
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,140
How come you are trying to bow your head and come under me?

376
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,030
Do you want me to guess what it is?

377
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,970
There's a popular saying among youth these days.

378
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:24,390
"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."

379
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,800
It's easiest for those who are close to stabbing someone in the back.

380
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,560
That is what you call a coup d'etat (takeover), you b*stard.

381
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,540
You know what that is, right? A coup d'etat?

382
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:43,050
Are you trying to bring down my gang?

383
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,050
Tell me.

384
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,620
I'm right, no?

385
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:55,140
Darn it, you've found out my secret.

386
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,140
You're quite sharp.

387
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,730
Young Pil.

388
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,100
This son of a b*tch!

389
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,060
What are you b*stards doing! Hurry up and attack him!

390
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:25,170
 What if he doesn't accept my surrender?

391
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,860
 We picked up these tear gas grenades during a student protest near the baseball stadium.

392
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,580
 With this, you should be able to escape.

393
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,480
Seon Woo!

394
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,150

395
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,310
All right. Do you have a towel?

396
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,820
Put that away, you b*stard.

397
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,220
You think if you just kill me, all will be over, right?

398
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,830
My underlings will follow you to the ends of Earth and chew you up.

399
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,700
I won't kill you, Hyungnim.

400
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,870
You can't survive unless you kill me.

401
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,600
So it would be better for you to just kill me now.

402
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,250
I'll say it again,

403
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,160
but I won't die, and I won't kill you, either, Hyungnim.

404
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,060
Then what are you trying to do?

405
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,850
The water has already been spilled.

406
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:25,600
Even if the water is spilled, you can refill it if the cup isn't broken.

407
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,580
Hey, Hyungnim.

408
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,420
 Me?

409
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,400
Hurry and sit down.

410
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,280
Hyungnim, you're not broken yet.

411
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,020
We'll become your water.

412
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,590
Cut the crap, you a**hole.

413
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,470
We mean it.

414
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:07,110
If you accept us, we will give you half of our earnings from forgery.

415
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,540
What kind of game are you playing with me right now?

416
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,840
I know you have great ambitions.

417
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,610
You're not one to be satisfied with just Mugyo-dong.

418
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,330
If you want to take over Myeong-dong and Seoul,

419
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,620
you would need a fighter like me,

420
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,840
and I would need a lord and an organization like you and your gang, Hyungnim.

421
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:35,400
So are you saying that I am Liu Bei (famous warlord) and you're like Zhao Yun (general)?

422
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,720
Think of it however you'd like.

423
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,780
All right.

424
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,580
But... how do I trust that you won't stab me in the back?

425
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,630
Don't you think I'd need something as collateral?

426
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,030
If you hold collateral, that's a business transaction,

427
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,480
and we can't become a family.

428
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,650
You will be suspicious of me no matter what I give you.

429
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,300
All right.

430
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,110
We will look for someone else.

431
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,560
Go back home safely.

432
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,180
Oath of Brotherhood, let's do it.

433
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,470
Let's be a family, you b*stard.

434
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,970
Give me a cigarette.

435
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:02,230
All right, so have you done some studying?

436
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,630
Boss, you want to earn more money, right?

437
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,730
But there's a bit of a limit to your profits as an entertainment promoter

438
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,270
in Gwangju and Jeonnam, which is only 10% of the market.

439
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,650
Your introduction is way too long.

440
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,790
We should... enter the Gyeonggi-do market.

441
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,000
What?

442
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,210
Just 2-3 years ago, Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do together only made up 15% of the market,

443
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:31,910
but with satellite cities growing around the capital, the market grew much larger.

444
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,110
It means there is potential.

445
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,660
What in the world are you talking about?

446
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,840
Do you know what kind of a business this is?

447
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,330
If you try to take over someone else's territory, you'll be in big trouble!

448
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,140
You might get stabbed!

449
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,450
Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do are already split among three distributors.

450
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,190
So how would we force our way into the market?

451
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:54,640
We would break that triangle, bring one down, then take its place.

452
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,580
- How? 
 - We must figure out a way.

453
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:06,160
But if I manage to pull this off, if I succeed in this deal, will you give me some shares?

454
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,020
Gosh, this girl is like a sly fox!

455
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,360
All right, then go for it.

456
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,270
If you manage to succeed, I won't just give you shares, I would even marry you.

457
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,810
You mean that, right?

458
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,350
You have to keep this promise, okay?

459
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,320
This girl already has something in mind, right?

460
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,780
All right. Go ahead and try.

461
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,270
Wait... P-President Cha!

462
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,000
How many shares does Hyungnim Kwang Tak own again?

463
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,620
It's 30% on management, with no invested capital.

464
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,000
Is it 30%?

465
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,820
He's such a thief.

466
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,820
If you keep spending your own money,

467
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,990
then you're not a real gangster!

468
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,200
But those punks did some lousy bookkeeping,

469
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,450
not even to mention the sales.

470
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,690
Young Pil seems to be pocketing some money by creating

471
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,350
a false ledger with the liquor wholesaler he looks after.

472
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,840
I see.

473
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,760
I really can't understand what the boss was  thinking

474
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,370
when he decided to take him in.

475
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,640
Hey, let's say we take him in to boost our fighting power.

476
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,810
But how can he rank the same as our hyungnim?

477
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,120
Don't you agree, Hyungnim?

478
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,410
These punks, seriously.

479
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,380
You're ruining my appetite.

480
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,700
- I'm sorry! 
 - I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

481
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,880
Is this a soup and rice shop?

482
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:39,790
Aigoo, of course, there wouldn't be any customers at this luxurious hotel,

483
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,610
since it reeks of soup and radish kimchi.

484
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,180
I know he entrusted this place to you.

485
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:56,510
But I must have lunch and coffee here for good digestion.

486
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,700
I'll buy you digestive medicine for digestion issues.

487
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,230
So order from the existing menu from now on.

488
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,040
Make sure to pay, though.

489
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,090
This little punk...

490
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,830
Have some coffee before you go.

491
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,170
It's my treat today.

492
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,230
We're family, right?

493
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,710
Family, my foot.

494
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,450
I don't consider you my family.

495
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,360
Watch out.

496
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,860
Let's get along, okay?

497
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,990
I'll do my best!

498
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,540
- Let's go. 
 - How ridiculous.

499
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,110
Yes, President Yoon.

500
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:48,210
Me? I'm working.

501
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,890
For what business?

502
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,740
What did you say?

503
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:57,570
Why do you keep asking my guys for such embarrassing things?

504
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,560
What did you say? Okay.

505
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,670
Aigoo. Make sure you treat my guys then.

506
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,890
Yes, yes. Oh, and also...

507
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:10,410
you know, after the film shoot, the actress...

508
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,470
That's right.

509
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:19,570
Yes, yes. No, just naturally invite her to drink. All right?

510
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,680
Rotary club and full amenities,

511
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,160
this is a gift from Hyungnim.

512
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,270
Let me know if there's anything you need.

513
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,400
 Thank you, Hyungnim!

514
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,310
I'll make this short.

515
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:38,630
From now on, there's no such thing as one taking or eating more than the other.

516
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:44,010
A family eats, poops, and fights together. Understood?

517
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,300
 Yes, Hyungnim!

518
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,190
Raise your glasses.

519
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,960
- Cheers. 
 -  Cheers!

520
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,950
My, my.

521
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,700
Okay, okay.

522
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,450
Aigoo, sh*t.

523
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,350
Yes.

524
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,600
Hey, where's Doo Hak?

525
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,960
Aigoo!

526
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,230
Gosh!

527
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,690
 Got it.

528
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:25,860
Manager, I heard the film shoot was delayed a lot.

529
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,680
Can we finish by the premiere date?

530
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,840
I won't let those b*stards go.

531
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:34,650
I'll take care of it myself so Namdo Film Studio, stay out of this. Okay?

532
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,460
Gosh, Manager!

533
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,440
Where are you going?

534
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,010
Gosh.

535
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:48,010
- Open the criminal's mouth and feed her the poison! 
 -  Yes, Sir!

536
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,220
 Your Highness!

537
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,620
 No, Your Highness!

538
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,250
 Your Highness!

539
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,470
Is the poison she ate a real poison?

540
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,820
It's an herbal tea.

541
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,220
Oh, an herbal tea.

542
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,950
Gosh, I'm so glad.

543
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,040
 - No! 
 - Your Highness!

544
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,500
 Your Highness!

545
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,940
 - Your Highness!  
 - By the way...

546
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,140
That court lady seems to be wearing a watch.

547
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,900
Awesome.

548
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,290
Cut!

549
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,180
Gosh... hey!

550
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,680
- What's going on now? 
 - What's that? Oh my. Wait.

551
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,220
Stop! What the heck?

552
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,360
Director!

553
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,680
Wait, help me get back up.

554
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,740
Gosh. What the heck is this? Is it no good?

555
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,090
Bravo!

556
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,340
Song Yeon Ju, a male director wanted by the 21st century so badly

557
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,770
is waiting for you right now.

558
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,120
Please hurry and come out.

559
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,400
He seems to be from the other movie Song Yeon Ju is a part of.

560
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,880
Hey! Tell him to keep waiting!

561
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,310
We also need to finish this scene today, okay?

562
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,290
Hey, everyone, gather!

563
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,900
If you don't move out in three seconds,

564
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,680
- we won't hold back anymore. 
 - N-No one told you to hold back!

565
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,480
One!

566
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,600
Two!

567
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,660
- Go. 
 - Wh-Whoa—

568
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,870
- Move! 
 - W-Wait—

569
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,080
What's this?

570
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,050
- Aigoo. 
 - Gosh, no!

571
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,560
- Aigoo. 
 - Let go!

572
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,290
- What? 
 - Oh, my gosh!

573
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,500
Do you want to die?

574
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,290
- Sit down. 
 - You almost had me there!

575
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,230
- Sit down! 
 - Come on.

576
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,350
Aigoo! You can't!

577
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,540
Let go. Let go of me!

578
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,100
You a**holes!

579
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,720
Seriously.

580
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,040
Gosh, this little!

581
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,410
Hey.

582
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,640
Escort her politely.

583
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,730
- Mind your manners. 
 - I'm sorry.

584
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:49,420
Not to me. Okay?

585
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,040
I'm sorry.

586
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,880
Hey, forget it. Let's go.

587
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,260
Yes, Hyungnim.

588
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,670
- We're done here. 
 - Please come this way.

589
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,150
Who dares to intrude on a sacred film set?

590
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,880
You can't take her like that! We need to finish this scene!

591
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,040
- You can't! 
 - You can't do this!

592
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,590
J-Jung—

593
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,760
No, you can't—

594
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,680
Lee Doo Hak?

595
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,180
Long time no see.

596
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,290
Why are you here?

597
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,130
Jung Shin, what are you doing? Hurry and move aside.

598
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,800
Leave.

599
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,900
I'm sorry to interrupt, Hyungnim.

600
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,450
We need to take Song Yeon Ju quickly.

601
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:57,750
They insisted the daytime scene must be filmed today.

602
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,660
Are you a thug?

603
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,680
"A thug"?

604
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,220
- Excuse me, Lady. You talk a little too nicely. 
 - Seon Woo.

605
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,210
You can stay out of this.

606
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,830
I said, "Are you a thug?"

607
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,050
Yes.

608
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:32,040
You avoided my visits merely to live like this?

609
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,260
I never avoided them.

610
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,330
I ended up in jail due to you.

611
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,770
If it were you, would you want to see you?

612
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,730
You really...

613
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:44,070
- Do you really think I was to blame? 
 - Also...

614
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,920
I'm doing my best in life in my own way.

615
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,600
A thief who's diligently stealing is doing his best, too, right?

616
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,070
A petty thief who stole a wallet gets scorned,

617
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,090
but a big thief who stole a country

618
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,730
is feared by the world.

619
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,830
Have you really lost your mind?

620
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,750
That's not it.

621
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,760
The one you used to know back then was out of his mind.

622
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,450
Having ridiculous thoughts, such as you'll be blessed if you're loyal to your parents,

623
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:14,090
study hard, and be patriotic.

624
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,780
In this twisted world,

625
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,120
living twisted is the correct way.

626
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,880
Wow...

627
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,190
Lee Doo Hak, you really...

628
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,030
became complete trash.

629
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,680
"Trash"?

630
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,140
Sure.

631
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,990
The noble daughter of a theater-running family...

632
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,270
should never encounter this "trash" again.

633
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,790
- Hey, let's withdraw! 
 - Yes, Hyungnim.

634
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,360
You should drink slowly.

635
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,210
You somehow knew where I was, right?

636
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,840
Did you get used to Seoul yet?

637
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,060
Is something wrong?

638
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,650
You...

639
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,020
keep in touch with Doo Hak, right?

640
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,480
Yes.

641
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,660
Since he's my hyung and friend.

642
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,700
He's your hyung and friend, but you let him live as a thug?

643
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,270
Have you met him?

644
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,080
Yes.

645
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,920
I met him when...

646
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,470
he barged into our filming set to snatch out an actress.

647
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,360
It must be great to be you!

648
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,770
You have a thug as a friend.

649
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,430
We're not children anymore.

650
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,840
Who would listen to whom? We just...

651
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,390
live according to our fates.

652
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,570
Fates.

653
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,560
"Fates"?

654
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,070
Is your family servant's son fated to be a thug then?

655
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:22,250
Are all ex-convicts fated to live as thugs?

656
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:26,000
Even if the entire world points fingers at him, at least you...

657
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,420
You shouldn't be doing the same, you a**hole!

658
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,380
There's no such thing as fate in this world.

659
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,490
 Lee Doo Hak, you really...

660
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,390
 became complete trash.

661
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,940
Aigoo. Are you okay?

662
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,560
I told you to drink in moderation.

663
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,950
Cheol Woong...

664
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:12,210
I have a request.

665
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,130
Please bring...

666
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,170
Doo Hak out of that place.

667
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,010
Don't let him live as a thug, please?

668
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:25,490
You're really the only one.

669
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,190
If you let him live like that...

670
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,660
it's too unfortunate for Doo Hak.

671
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,530
It's too unfortunate for our poor Doo Hak.

672
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:49,830
Jung Shin... can't you...

673
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:53,020
forget about him now?

674
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,130
Cheol Woong...

675
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,170
I have something to ask you.

676
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,240
Please tell me honestly.

677
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,900
Go ahead.

678
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,450
Did...

679
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:13,470
Doo Hak really kill a person?

680
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,950
No matter how I think about it, he's not the type to do such a thing.

681
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,730
He did. Hyung Doo Hak was the one.

682
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,250
He was avenging me on the guy who beat me up,

683
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,120
and he died accidentally.

684
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,040
What a twisted life that a**hole has.

685
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:43,630
Isn't this really too harsh?

686
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:47,560
Aren't you being too harsh on that poor boy?

687
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,890
Gosh, I'm about to die, seriously.

688
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:11,500
Oh, just how much did you drink?

689
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,810
It still reeks of alcohol!

690
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,310
What's that? Is it hangover soup?

691
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,680
Gosh, Yang Ja, you're the best.

692
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,230
Gosh, the heartburn.

693
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,890
My heart burns more, you wench.

694
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:28,280
You even have a knight who brings your drunk butt home, right?

695
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,620
Who did?

696
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,120
Don't you remember?

697
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,050
Cheol Woong brought you all the way home.

698
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,840
Cheol Woong did?

699
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:41,080
Did you really black out, or are you pretending?

700
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,280
That can't be, though.

701
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,090
I haven't seen him since high school.

702
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:48,100
But he became really handsome.

703
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,160
By the way, since when have you two been talking?

704
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:58,600
Wait, more importantly... Where did it go?

705
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,290
What time is it right now?

706
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:04,810
Oh no! I'm late, late. So late! Okay.

707
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,880
- Hey, I prepared the meal! Eat before you go! 
 -  I don't have time!

708
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,870
But seriously, what's up with your hair?

709
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,520
Are you a ball of iron?

710
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,470
My hair just doesn't grow. What can I do?

711
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,080
Who is he?

712
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,260
He's my guest.

713
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:36,080
Wait, so...

714
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,950
did you come to advise me to stop being a thug?

715
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:42,010
No.

716
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:45,180
What right do I have? I'm also trash.

717
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,020
It seems...

718
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,390
Jung Shin still isn't over you, Hyung.

719
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,220
She cried a lot.

720
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:03,480
She must have pitied me.

721
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,990
I don't think that was all.

722
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:10,120
When you were in prison, it seems she wrote letters constantly

723
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,320
and visited you frequently too.

724
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,370
Why did you break up?

725
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,070
It was just too pathetic.

726
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,080
So I broke up with her.

727
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,280
Let's stop discussing this.

728
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,200
Talk of young love and memories, it's childish.

729
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,240
Hyung...

730
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,240
must I become a prosecutor?

731
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:51,780
Yes,

732
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,450
before you graduate.

733
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,200
In that case...

734
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,630
since I'm granting your wish...

735
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:03,250
you grant my wish, too.

736
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:09,860
I can...

737
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,430
go out with Jung Shin now, right?

738
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,600
Hey, Cheol Woong...

739
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:29,540
there's nothing between Jung Shin and me anymore.

740
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,220
You mean it, right?

741
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,350
You mean what you just said, right?

742
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:34,720
However,

743
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,010
you still shouldn't go out with her.

744
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,570
She's a stranger to you so for what reason?

745
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:51,430
You said it yourself earlier... that you're also trash.

746
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,640
At least, for old times' sake,

747
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,780
Jung Shin shouldn't go out with trash like us.

748
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,520
Isn't that so?

749
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,860
You're the one who turned me into trash.

750
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,690
What did you say?

751
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,450
Don't think you're the only victim, Hyung.

752
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:13,140
I haven't felt at peace even for a single day, ever since that day.

753
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,020
That's why...

754
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,490
I'm telling you to leave Jung Shin alone.

755
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:20,180
Will you go to Jung Shin and tell her?

756
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,520
That I'm actually the murderer?

757
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:27,050
If that's not the case, then why?

758
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:30,100
Why on Earth can't I?

759
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:35,620
Jung Shin looking at me

760
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:40,530
with disgust for being a thug, her standing beside you...

761
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,980
It annoys me just thinking about it.

762
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,300
You think you always yielded for me, right?

763
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,030
Don't be mistaken.

764
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:55,560
Hyung, you never really considered me your friend or brother.

765
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:03,080
Since you can't win Jung Shin's heart, are you telling me not to date her, either?

766
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,450
What kind of bullsh*t is that?

767
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,400
You and I are both sons of b*tches.

768
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,950
We're dogs talking nonsense.

769
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:14,750
Would we talk like decent people?

770
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:49,910

771
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,220
 Go and target Joongbu Film Distribution Company.

772
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:55,450
President Na there is famous for gambling.

773
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:58,090
I'm not sure if he got involved with qualified card sharks,

774
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,910
but he's rumored to be quite low on cash lately.

775
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:07,130
Oh, you work for President Cha?

776
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:08,940
Yes.

777
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,650
Well, I do know President Cha well.

778
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,870
Anyhow, what brings you here?

779
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:17,840
President Cha wants to partner up with you, President Na.

780
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,050
She wants me to join distributions in Jeolla-do?

781
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:23,110
No, she wants to do distributions in Gyeonggang with you.

782
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,670
What?

783
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,630
Wow...

784
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:30,160
Now, now. I complimented her as a heroine,

785
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,880
but President Cha has a lot of gall (nerve), right?

786
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,700
You can continue management as you've been doing.

787
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,070
President Cha just wants about 30% of the shares.

788
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:39,570
Hey, now.

789
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,550
People in this field are more territorial than gangs.

790
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:46,950
If you recklessly enter someone else's region, you'll be in big trouble.

791
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,760
Go and tell her, okay?

792
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,640
If she wants to have a long life,

793
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,830
she should just sit back and fart around in Gwangju.

794
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,620
Understood.

795
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,410
Right.

796
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,180
You must have borrowed a lot of money on the house.

797
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:15,050
In fact, President Cha doesn't know about your gambling.

798
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:18,630
That's why I was going to oppose her proposal.

799
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:21,830
But I didn't want to ruin her relationship with you so I just dropped by.

800
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:25,520
Thank you so much for rejecting it.

801
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,670
Wait!

802
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,910
Is it 30% of the shares?

803
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:41,010
How much will she pay per share?

804
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,210
 So?

805
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,530
- I called 100 million won ($277,000 in 1980's). 
 - What?

806
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,310
It's a little too much.

807
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:53,060
If you think of the market that will grow, it's nothing.

808
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:57,120
By the way, President Na had conditions, right?

809
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:03,960
- First off, he asked for complete confidentiality. 
 - Of course.

810
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,230
If word gets out, he can't keep doing business in Gyeonggang.

811
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,280
And then?

812
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,950
He asked for the shares to be returned whenever he pays you back.

813
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,430
What did you say?

814
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,990
What's good for us then?

815
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:21,010
If he just pays back the principal, we can't even get the interest!

816
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:24,130
President Cha, this is such a losing deal!

817
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,830
And so?

818
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:28,150
I said okay.

819
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,040
Have you gone insane?

820
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,510
My goodness.

821
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,280
You did so well.

822
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:39,180
- President Cha! 
 - It'll take more than an eternity for you to get on her level.

823
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,720
Have you ever heard a gambler clear his debt?

824
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,450
Okay, then. What about a gambler getting more debt?

825
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:49,850
That's it, all right? That's exactly it.

826
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:01,290
It contains about three large ones.

827
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:04,070
So go and get Joongbu in your hands.

828
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,990
Oh my!

829
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,000
You said you'll give me my shares, right?

830
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
How many shares will you give me?

831
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,160
Don't you trust me?

832
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:24,450
Do you trust me, President Cha?

833
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,610
Okay.

834
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:32,900
What is it that you want?

835
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:36,850
If I reach 50% distribution in Gyeonggang region after obtaining Joongbu,

836
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,680
give me 30% of the shares.

837
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,830
Whoa! Has this girl gone crazy?

838
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:44,330
Did you really hurt your head or something?

839
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:47,940
What if you fail?

840
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:51,750
I'll have to spend the rest of my life as your servant then.

841
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,130
I'll need to think about this.

842
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,840
What do you mean by a mole?

843
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:14,370
We call them informants, but regular people call them a mole.

844
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:18,990
Are you saying Cheol Woong really did such dangerous work?

845
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:22,420
Who exactly ordered my son to do such a thing?

846
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,240
Not sure.

847
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,720
For now, it's reported that he volunteered after getting an early discharge.

848
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,680
Things changed a lot nowadays

849
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,230
so we don't even force it, not that it's possible.

850
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,960
But how did he get found out?

851
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,360
The protesting students uncovered Cheol Woong's suspicious activities

852
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,520
and must have questioned him at their school.

853
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,550
But...

854
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:47,790
Cheol Woong had a good friend.

855
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,070
Was Lee Doo Hak his name?

856
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:55,100
I heard he barged in alone against the students and saved Cheol Woong.

857
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:59,470
Cheol Woong can't be a student activist anymore.

858
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:04,150
If he just quietly studies for the bar exam, there won't be any problems.

859
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,470
Quietly.

860
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,380

861
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,540
Good job, Doo Hak.

862
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,920
The sales are consistent and

863
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,770
most of all, it's great without any small troubles.

864
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,540
Thank you, Hyungnim.

865
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,140
The shareholders have many complaints.

866
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,070
You'll need to work harder, Young Pil.

867
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,040
- I'm sorry, Hyungnim. 
 - Also...

868
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:41,350
do you still order and eat soup and rice at the hotel's coffee shop?

869
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:43,920
- Sorry? 
 - Just open a soup and rice place somewhere.

870
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,720
Should I open one up for you?

871
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,850
Let's give some more thought to our lives, Young Pil.

872
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,390
Hyungnim.

873
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,450
What do you think of my taking and managing Young Pil's hotel and nightclub?

874
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:59,650
Hey, you son of a b*tch! Do you really want to die?

875
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:03,280
- Hey, Young Pil, that's not what I meant— 
 - Shut up!

876
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,100
- I'll really rip your mouth— 
 - You rude b*stard.

877
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,110
Get out, you punk.

878
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,770
Get out.

879
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:20,390
Gosh, seriously.

880
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,140
You, too.

881
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,810
You shouldn't say such things.

882
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:27,030
If you take over Young Pil's turf, what will his family live on?

883
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:30,430
Hyungnim... that's not what I meant.

884
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,370
I was going to entrust my hotel and nightclub to Young Pil.

885
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:35,150
What did you say?

886
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:41,850
Since my turf's system is stable,Young Pil wouldn't find it hard to manage.

887
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:46,400
If I take over Young Pil's turf and improve it, I thought it'd stabilize both sides.

888
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,910
Wait, then were you saying you wanted to switch turfs with him?

889
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:55,860
- Yes, that's right. 
 - My goodness, that a**hole needs to listen to the end.

890
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,830
We're one family, aren't we, Hyungnim?

891
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:00,880
Aigoo.

892
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:03,760

893
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,620
Cheol Woong!

894
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,510
Jung Shin.

895
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:12,160
Congratulations, Sir.

896
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,860
- Thank you. 
 - Great job.

897
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,890
Cheol Woong!

898
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:20,620
Mother!

899
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:29,930
I wish for nothing more in this life.

900
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:32,640
Don't cry now. It's a good day.

901
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,050
I'm getting emotional.

902
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:38,270
Your father...

903
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:41,520
should have seen this sight.

904
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,400
I'll go see father soon at his grave.

905
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,230
It's been too long since I went.

906
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:48,970
You should.

907
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:52,920
Thankfully... the Ahjussi here is...

908
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,200
taking  good care of your father's grave.

909
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:00,380
I'm always thankful to you, Ahjussi.

910
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,720
Not at all, it's a matter of course.

911
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,930
I'm so proud of you.

912
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:09,240
I'm really proud.

913
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,330
You're...

914
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:14,790
making the Choi family great again.

915
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:17,860
Well, this is all thanks to you, Ahjussi.

916
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:20,610
What did I ever do to help?

917
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,490
Wait, why are you crying, Ahjumma?

918
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,520
Y-You...

919
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,390
You went through a lot.

920
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:40,020
Why don't you both spend a night at our house today?

921
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,250
Let me pour you a drink.

922
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,950
Oh, oh...

923
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:48,180
No, not at all! We need to hurry back.

924
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,480
We have farming work piled up.

925
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,410
Don't even mention it. This man is farming

926
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:56,890
on a strip of land in Seoul.

927
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:58,330
Gosh.

928
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:01,230
I can afford to stay a night.

929
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:03,230
This woman, seriously.

930
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:05,240
You have tons of work to do!

931
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:09,900
Aigoo, you're the same as ever, Ahjussi.

932
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,510
Cheol Woong, don't mind us.

933
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:15,190
- I'll be going ahead, okay? 
 - Yes.

934
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:21,510
- In that case, I'll come and visit you soon. 
 - Sure.

935
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:24,350
We're proud of you.

936
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:26,910
Please take care.

937
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:36,330
Why? Are you expecting someone?

938
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:37,770
What?

939
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,110
It's nothing at all.

940
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,420
Congratulations. For him to pass the bar so soon...

941
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,770
Who does he take after to be smart? Is it the mom or dad?

942
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:04,070
We'll need to say it's the mom.

943
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:05,880
All right.

944
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,640
While we're on the topic, Oppa...

945
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,110
I have a request.

946
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:13,010
Sure, a request from you. What is it?

947
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:16,540
Cheol Woong wants to be a prosecutor.

948
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:18,760
Please help him.

949
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,430
His bar exam score was in the top ranking.

950
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:26,160
However, according to the Minister of Justice's wife, who comes to our store,

951
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,740
it's impossible to be a judge or prosecutor with a history of student activism.

952
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,400
That's right.

953
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,160
Cheol Woong will need to be an attorney. I can't help with that, either.

954
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:41,250
It's obvious there will be more controversy if we say he was an informant of a government agency.

955
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:45,180
Isn't that more the reason they should let him be a prosecutor?

956
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,430
He shut his mouth and worked for the country.

957
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:51,730
It's not that easy. When I looked at his records,

958
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:54,790
he never provided any solid info on the student activists.

959
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,380
He made it through by walking the tightrope.

960
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:00,230
He isn't black nor white but gray.

961
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:05,700
He wishes to become a prosecutor.

962
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,570
And my wish is the same.

963
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:14,000
If he had cooperated, we could have pushed for him to be an elite prosecutor.

964
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,680
But the world isn't easy.

965
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,900
Although he is smart like his mother,

966
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:22,500
his stubborn way of life, protecting his cheap conscience, is like his father.

967
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:32,270

968
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:35,450
That's true.

969
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:39,640
He takes after his father.

970
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:43,920
Cheol Woong is...

971
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,850
just like his biological father

972
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,030
so he has ambitions.

973
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:54,700
He desires to have power.

974
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,050
Oh.

975
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:05,120
You need to at least say hi if you're here.

976
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,860
How can you just leave?

977
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:08,740
Good job.

978
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,720
Go let out some stress.

979
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,250
What's this?

980
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:19,950
Oh my.

981
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:23,990
Lee Doo Hak grew so lavish after becoming Kwang Tak gang's No. 2, right?

982
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:25,690
How cool.

983
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:28,330
Anyway...

984
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:32,420
I've completed your order at this point, right?

985
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,510
Don't be arrogant.

986
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:40,070
You finally got the qualifications to repay me. This is just the start.

987
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:43,790
That's right. It's the beginning.

988
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,460
By the way,

989
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:48,960
I'm trying to start something else, too.

990
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,360
I'm going to...

991
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,660
make Jung Shin my woman.

992
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:00,680
Of course.

993
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,150
He is also a foolish father,

994
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:07,570
who still doesn't recognize his son,

995
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:10,770
who is right in front of his eyes.

996
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,630
Please...

997
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:17,570
help Cheol Woong become a prosecutor...

998
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,190
as his father.

999
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:29,160
Don't try to put up a front.

1000
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,660
I know full well you didn't get over Jung Shin yet.

1001
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:37,880
If you want, Hyung, let's compete again as we did in high school.

1002
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,290
It'll be a fair play.

1003
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,920
Okay?

1004
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:44,810
Why, you little sh*t!

1005
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:50,130

1006
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:56,890
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

1007
01:07:56,890 --> 01:08:03,450
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

1008
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:10,500
♫  Above the rough sky, my heart floats away  ♫

1009
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,320
♫  Only your name  ♫

1010
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,270

1011
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:17,890
 Have you no other sound reasons?

1012
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:20,340
 Hyung Doo Hak is okay, but not me?

1013
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:21,760
 I'm not afraid.

1014
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,700
 Why? Because I did it to live like a human being!

1015
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,820
 Just hit me like you always did.

1016
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,690
 President Cha! You're the best, President Cha.

1017
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,280
 I'm not your puppet anymore.

1018
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,740
 I'm a prosecutor of South Korea, Choi Cheol Woong.

1019
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:39,380
 I don't understand why my boss is showing you this act of grace.

1020
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,780
 Jung Shin has...

1021
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:42,820
 Jung Shin has been kidnapped, I said.

1022
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:47,100
 If you help me, I think there might be a way.

1023
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:52,000
♫  The times I confronted  ♫
