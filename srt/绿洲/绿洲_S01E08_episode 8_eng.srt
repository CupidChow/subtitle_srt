1
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,830

2
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,620

3
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,370

4
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,850
How...

5
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,780
Hyungnim!

6
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,270
Go, go!

7
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,950
What's the pass code for the safe?

8
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,240
You b*stard!

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,680
Young Pil.

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,270
You free me from these ropes first before we talk.

11
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,130
Why are you doing this to me?

12
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,860
Hyungnim, why do this to me?

13
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,930
What did I do?

14
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,430
You didn't mention redevelopment projects.

15
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,900
I sold drugs to provide you with capital, and got thrown  over a cliff.

16
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,500
Is this how brothers show their insides to each other?

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,040
What b*stard told you that?

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,230
I was going to tell you about the redevelopment projects later in due time!

19
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,310
What is the reason why you need to tell your successor later?

20
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,460
That is... Gosh.

21
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,210
The answer is...

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,250
so you can gobble it all up by yourself.

23
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,890
What is the pass code?

24
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,970
I give you exactly three chances.

25
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,570
Pass code.

26
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,400
All right.

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,900
It's the day you die, you motherf***ing b*stard.

28
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,540
Happy?

29
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,080
You punk.

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,100
Grab him.

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,510
You b*stard! Let go of me!

32
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,620
I will ask you just one more time.

33
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,490
What is the pass code?

34
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,540
Okay, okay!

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,190
It's 7777, you b*stard!

36
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,700
F***!

37
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,820
You're so full of luck.

38
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,060
All right. Since we have our history,

39
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,720
I'll at least let you live.

40
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,860
Hyungnim, Hyungnim!

41
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,460
Money!

42
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,470
Where's my money?

43
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,370
Where is the money?

44
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,030
You stupid b*stard!

45
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,070
Who puts their cash in a safe these days?

46
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,680
You put it in the bank, you b*stard!

47
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,210
I know you don't like banks, Hyungnim.

48
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,920
Where is the cash?

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,730
I mean it, you b*stard. I put it in the bank.

50
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,650
Next is your wrist.

51
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,330
Young Pil!

52
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,420
Even though we ambushed him, he fought back so much.

53
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,680
We had a bit of trouble.

54
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,070
Great job.

55
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,710
Hyungnim.

56
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,160
Doo Hak, your favorite one, is here.

57
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,680
I will ask you just one last time.

58
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,790
Where is the cash?

59
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,160
Hyungnim doesn't have any cash, you b*stard.

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,390
I told him to play it safe and use the bank.

61
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,280
This scoundrel.

62
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,110
Where is the cash?

63
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,610
You son of a b*tch!

64
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,440
Hyungnim!

65
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,110
 Am I a dog? Am I a dog?

66
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,660
 I am the boss, no?

67
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,280
 We can't do it yet.

68
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,760
 We need to let it sit for a bit.

69
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,090
 - What? 
 - What are you doing?

70
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,670
 Sit down.

71
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,060
 All right.

72
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,060
 Do I need to sit if you tell me to?

73
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,680
 Wow, if this had gone a bit longer, you would have hit me.

74
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,990
 Hey, what do you think? It looks so real, right?

75
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,520
 Wh-What the...

76
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,190
 What's going on?

77
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,020
 Doo Hak is saying that we can't just do it now.

78
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,750
Doo Hak... also shares your thoughts.

79
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,290
 We are planning on taking over the redevelopment projects.

80
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,570
 Gosh, darn it!

81
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,190
 Why did you ignore me when I said it before?

82
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,640
 If Doo Hak steps in himself, he would lose respect in this field.

83
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,410
 Doo Hak has nothing to say, even if his juniors later overthrow him.

84
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,690
 Taking over the redevelopment projects would be difficult too.

85
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,710
 So what I'm saying is

86
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,160
 let's borrow someone else's knife.

87
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,070
 Yes, the strategy of having another's knife kill someone.

88
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,340
 "The strategy of having another's knife kill someone," wow.

89
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,460
 What does that mean?

90
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,000
 It means we need a substitute to act in our place, like a stuntman.

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,600
 - Yes. 
 - Also, one more thing.

92
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,080
 You'll have to suffer a bit.

93
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,610
 Yes, that's right.

94
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,720
 Wh-What is that?

95
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,650
 You don't need to know. Have a shot.

96
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,550
 - What is it that I have to suffer? 
 - I'll tell you later.

97
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,840
Hey!

98
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,400
Darn it!

99
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,510
That snake!

100
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,890
Young Pil!

101
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,860
That hurts, you scum!

102
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,350
Come here! Come here!

103
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,820
Wait, wait!

104
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,030
Young Pil.

105
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,300
You're really done for.

106
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,980
You won't get to eat rice soup you love so much. What to do?

107
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,310
You son of a b*tch!

108
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,470
All right. Everyone, stop moving.

109
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,860
You should have come sooner! What took you so long?

110
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,680
Aigoo, the timing seemed perfect.

111
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,480
Why are you being like that?

112
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,480
Hyung!

113
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,200
Hyung.

114
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,700
- Hyungnim! 
 - Hyungnim!

115
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,910
- Doo Hak! 
 - Hyungnim.

116
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,800
Darn it.

117
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,760
Are you okay, Hyung?

118
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,760
 Hyung, are you sure you didn't lose your mind?

119
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,750
 Are you in your right mind?

120
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,190
 Yes.

121
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,430
 I mean, those thugs aren't stupid.

122
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,470
 I'm a prosecutor. Would a thug listen to a prosecutor?

123
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,520
 You must make him listen to you.

124
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,760
 So you want me to incite Yoo Young Pil to overthrow Yeom Kwang Tak,

125
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,700
 and you will take over that spot

126
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,730
 and become the real boss.

127
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,330
 And you get to arrest a major thug and become a star prosecutor.

128
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,790
 Gosh.

129
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,370
 Did you make me a prosecutor to have me do things like this?

130
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,330
 Did you think I did it as I like you so much I want you to succeed?

131
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,410
 Okay.

132
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,720
 Lee Doo Hak isn't someone to act as someone else's underling.

133
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,210
 Hyung, do it.

134
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,350
 A name everyone recognizes and respects,

135
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,850
 the boss of a national gang,

136
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,590
 the worst of the worst,

137
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,230
 you become that, Hyung.

138
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,710
 But with this,

139
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,180
 I will pay off all my debts to you.

140
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:01,540
 Isn't that too cheap for my screwed life of going to jail and becoming a murderer?

141
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,220
 Come on.

142
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,420
 Becoming boss of a national gang seems a sufficient payment.

143
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,650
 All right.

144
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,140
 If results are good, we'll call it even.

145
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,550
 It's not greed.

146
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,330
 My feelings for Jung Shin aren't greed.

147
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,050
 If that really was greed,

148
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,310
 then I would have already put you in jail.

149
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,490
 Is that so?

150
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,670
 Gosh, I guess I should watch out.

151
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,210
 If things go well, the day you slap

152
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,010
 a silver bracelet on me just might come, Prosecutor Choi.

153
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,820
 But...

154
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,230
 let's first take care of this business well.

155
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,930
 Gosh, this jerk.

156
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,290
 You scared me!

157
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,620
 Also, there's a favor to ask of you.

158
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,860
 Oh, Hyungnims.

159
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,510
 That wasn't all.

160
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,120
 During the demolition process,

161
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,130
 too many people were injured

162
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,560
 and the media got involved so we need a scapegoat.

163
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,130
 That's what the higher-ups want as well.

164
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,230
 Lee Doo Hak.

165
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,370
 Let's frame him as the lead behind the demolition violence

166
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,070
 and send him to prison.

167
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,300
 - "Doo Hak"? 
 - Why?

168
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,150
 Can't you since he's your right-hand man?

169
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,250
 O-Oh, no. I will do as you say.

170
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,950
 I was thinking of getting rid of him sooner or later.

171
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,190
 It seems we are on the same wavelength, CEO.

172
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,600
 Thank you.

173
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,190
 Geez!

174
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,760
 Wow...

175
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,490
 It seems we'll be screwed if we keep waiting.

176
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,810

177
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,630
 I wonder why Hyungnim never brought me to a place like this.

178
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,880
 Hey.

179
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,330
 You look like you'll shoot lasers from your eyes.

180
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,700
 I put some guys on him to act as his bodyguards.

181
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,200
 Are you sure you aren't trying to overthrow him?

182
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,390
 I am thinking of it.

183
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,190
 Son of a b*tch.

184
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,980
 I feel bad for Hyungnim, who took a b*stard like you in, you scheming scum.

185
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,180
 You are also in a pitiful state.

186
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,380
 That's funny.

187
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,490
 Someday, you will die at my hands.

188
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,420
 Hey, Young Pil.

189
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,370
 Instead of just dealing with tenants,

190
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,990
 why don't you do the construction yourself?

191
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,470
 "The construction"?

192
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,580
 Firstly, we get 70% of the shares, and you get 30%.

193
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,550
 We're giving you 10% more shares than your capital

194
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:55,280
 because you'll be taking care of laundering the funds and the taxes.

195
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,580
 I heard the metropolitan area redevelopment rights would bring astronomical profits.

196
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,240
 But Hyungnim didn't tell you this, right?

197
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:07,170
 Also, I heard you'll import drugs in large quantities from Incheon.

198
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,420
 Hyungnim funded that, right?

199
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,170
 It's quite obvious.

200
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,790
 Use you as his drug dealer for seed capital for the redevelopment,

201
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,830
 then leak your info to the police to arrest you.

202
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,570
 From Hyungnim's viewpoint, it kills two birds with one stone.

203
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,710
 So what do you think?

204
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,780
 You're also in a pitiful state, right?

205
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,930
 So what, you b*stard?

206
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,360
 He would use then throw you away when you went through hard times with him.

207
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,650
 How about me as an outsider?

208
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,190
 I'm sure he said he would kick me out

209
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,630
 and bring you back in.

210
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,330
 Isn't that right?

211
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,940
 Young Pil.

212
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,620
 Let's overthrow Hyungnim together, and let's take over the redevelopment projects.

213
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,150

214
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,790

215
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,900
Please wrap up the situation.

216
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,490
Yes.

217
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,400
What is this? What's going on?

218
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,900

219
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,650
Hyung Doo Hak staged a coup d'etat (revolt) and finally became a national gang boss.

220
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,190
This is the historical scene of that moment.

221
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,120
What about Doo Hak? Where is Doo Hak?

222
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,550
He got hurt.

223
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,580

224
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,530
Are you okay?

225
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,630
I guess I'm in trouble again.

226
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,480
What is this?

227
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,330
It's all right; you can stop.

228
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,190
Don't do this.

229
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,120
You'll get blood on you.

230
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,780
It's okay.

231
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,590
Thugs often get beat up and stabbed like this.

232
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,720
You bad thug rascal!

233
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,750
Let's really break up now.

234
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,820
Watching you getting hurt, bleeding, and beating up others,

235
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,000
this is where I stop

236
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,740
watching you do that.

237
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,020
I won't forget the feelings you gave me.

238
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,820
Don't get hurt

239
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,290
and be healthy.

240
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:59,450
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

241
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:06,620
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

242
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:13,960
♫  Above the rough sky, my heart floats away  ♫

243
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:21,050
♫  Only your name is engraved like this  ♫

244
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,460
Hey! Did something happen to you?

245
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,510
♫  Where did it all go wrong?  ♫

246
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,580
Hey, Oh Jung Shin! What happened?

247
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,800
I told him.

248
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,080
Told him what?

249
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,060
That I want to break up.

250
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,320
That we should never see each other again.

251
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,120
♫  It's such a useless thing to say  ♫

252
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
What?

253
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,600
♫  It's already over  ♫

254
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,090
♫  But I can't hide it  ♫

255
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:04,780
♫  My longing for you erupts  ♫

256
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:11,950
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

257
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:17,710
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

258
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,370
Hyungnim, I brought it.

259
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,660
♫  Above the rough sky  ♫

260
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,650
Are you all right?

261
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,650
♫  My heart floats away  ♫

262
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,590
♫  Only your name  ♫

263
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,700
I don't know anymore, either.

264
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,530
-  I got hit here and here! It's not my fault!  
 - Shut up!

265
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,560
Hey, Yoo Young Pil.

266
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,300
You caused some big trouble this time.

267
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,750
Regardless of whether you're out in society or in jail,

268
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,360
you really need to watch your back.

269
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,060
Do you dare laugh?

270
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,820
Just call the head prosecutor handling the case.

271
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,710
Not an attorney?

272
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,080
Yes. I'm asking you to call Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong.

273
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,230
Don't worry. You'll meet him soon.

274
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,220
Gosh, I shouldn't be receiving this kind of treatment.

275
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,560
- Call him right now! 
 - Did this b*stard go insane?

276
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,460
Where do you think this is to yell at me?

277
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,940
What are you doing?

278
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,580
What's this?

279
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,730
"The Supreme Prosecutor's Office."

280
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,990
"The one holding this document has cooperated with the investigation by the prosecution."

281
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,980
It's an amnesty document.

282
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,260
The one that Admiral Yi Sun-sin got.

283
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,450
What kind of nonsense is that?

284
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:46,990
I was helping out in their operation to catch Yeom Kwang Tak.

285
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,700
That's a certificate written by the prosecution.

286
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,190
Look at the bottom.

287
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:57,060
There's the fingerprint of Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong and the Prosecutor Officer's seal on it!

288
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,350
Okay. There's the seal of the Prosecutor Officer on it.

289
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,690
And I know the Prosecutor General,

290
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,660
but who is the Prosecutor's Officer?

291
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,420
You're so dumb.

292
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,510
Don't you know who is the top boss of prosecutors?

293
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,120
I don't. I don't know it. Hey, look at your friend.

294
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,460
Yes, look at him.

295
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,960
- I don't know because I'm dumb. 
 - Hey, hey!

296
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,860
You're making a mistake right now.

297
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,280
Do you know who I am?

298
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,180
I don't.

299
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,530
These are confiscated goods from Yeom Kwang Tak's house.

300
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,360

301
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,940
What's this?

302
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,150

303
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,110
Hello, Hyungnim!

304
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,850
- Is he inside? 
 - He's inside.

305
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,180
Did you ask to see me due to this case?

306
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,690
What else would it be?

307
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,910
You would have known that our company was involved.

308
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,330
I didn't know.

309
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:31,370
If I had known, the Deputy Chief wouldn't have given me permission.

310
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,900
To be honest, we need Yeom Kwang Tak.

311
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,980
Clean it up before the press starts buzzing.

312
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,160
Set it up so it was about Yoo Young Pil trying to get revenge.

313
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,460
At your request, I had set it all up so Lee Doo Hak would get arrested

314
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,550
as the main culprit for the demolition violence.

315
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,190
Excuse me?

316
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,130
What do you mean by that?

317
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:04,700
But I didn't know that you would get involved in a gang fight.

318
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,080
I... didn't know that was the case.

319
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,110
What kind of relationship do you have with Lee Doo Hak?

320
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,940
What is your relationship with him that you asked me to tail him

321
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,660
then help him become a national gang boss?

322
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:29,390
By chance, are you hugely indebted to him or something?

323
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,180
There is no such thing.

324
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,740
I told you a while back.

325
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:42,690
It would have been impossible for you to reach this point without my boss.

326
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,540
But he is currently very disappointed in you.

327
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:57,070
You don't like sour things so I tried to pick only the sweet ones.

328
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,330
Here it is, Hyungnim.

329
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:11,260
Young Pil isn't courageous enough to try something like this by himself.

330
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,280
There is surely someone else behind this.

331
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,750
You must find that betrayer, Doo Hak. You got that?

332
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,330
Hyungnim, does the apple taste okay?

333
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,290
The apple's not the problem here! Sh*t!

334
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,910
I'm telling you to find out who's behind all this!

335
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,590
The police are investigating it right now so it will be revealed soon enough.

336
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,610
The police! Hey, you idiot, when did we ever trust the police?

337
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,190
I'm telling you to find out who it is first!

338
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,530
What are you doing right now?

339
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,130
This is a waste of food.

340
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:59,500
Fine. Eat up then. Eat it all.

341
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,960
Hyungnim.

342
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,180
I actually found who was behind it already.

343
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,150
What?

344
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,050
Who is it? Who's the weasel?

345
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,930
It's me.

346
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,730
I planned all this.

347
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,270
You...

348
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,060
You son of a b*tch.

349
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,540
You should retire,

350
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,520
instead of trying to send your brother to prison by making him a scapegoat.

351
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,490
 Lee Doo Hak.

352
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:49,850
 Let's frame him as the lead behind the demolition violence and send him to prison.

353
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,530
 I will do as you say.

354
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:55,160
 I was thinking of getting rid of him sooner or later.

355
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,890
I get it.

356
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,420
So leave.

357
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,620
Leave me alone for a bit.

358
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:26,130

359
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,710
Did you come to visit Hyungnim?

360
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,290
How is he?

361
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,020
I don't think you need to go inside.

362
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,040
What do you mean?

363
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,340
His surgery went well, but he retired.

364
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,320
He won't be able to act as your hunting dog anymore.

365
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,050
Really?

366
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,860
Well, what a shame.

367
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,370
No.

368
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:57,660
You gained an even smarter hunting dog.

369
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,980
I had drawn up all this.

370
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,990
Please set up a meeting for me.

371
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,790
I want to get permission to be loyal to my master.

372
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,700
How do you do? My name is Lee Doo Hak.

373
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,150
You want to die, right?

374
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,430
I want to live.

375
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,660
Yet you would mess with my business?

376
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,880
I don't know about your business, Sir. I just...

377
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,780
I just... made the first move so I could survive.

378
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,590
You don't know my business, you say?

379
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,580
I know it involves clearing out the evictees.

380
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,320
Besides that, I don't know anything else.

381
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,080
You are not a hunting dog.

382
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,960
A hunting dog needs to die if the master says so.

383
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,860
You are just a rabid dog who bit its master.

384
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,660
Hyungnim Gwang Tak was not my master but a sworn brother to me.

385
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,420
I never bite my master.

386
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,530
If you would become my master,

387
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:28,130
then I will die if you tell me to die.

388
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,560
Really?

389
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,950
All right. I'll allow it.

390
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,270
Die.

391
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,110
It's punishment for killing my hunting dog.

392
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,060
You just said it yourself.

393
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,150
Words are easy.

394
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,870
Why? Can't you do it?

395
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,350
Instead of killing yourself, just live as a rabid dog.

396
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,680
This f***er is truly a mad dog, right?

397
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,530
Drink.

398
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,450
How did you know the gun was empty?

399
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:45,010
If you intended to have me killed, you could have easily ordered someone to do it.

400
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,450
I thought you wouldn't come in person.

401
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,940
You're a bright one for a gangster.

402
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,480
How are you related to Choi Cheol Woong?

403
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,650
We grew up as brothers since we were—

404
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,960
Does Choi Cheol Woong owe his life to you or something?

405
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,640
Even if you grew up like brothers, a prosecutor wouldn't help a gangster's coup d'etat.

406
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,190
What's the relationship between you and him exactly?

407
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:20,380
Did you serve jail time in his place?

408
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,420
Tell me the truth.

409
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,410
I saved that fellow's life.

410
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,950
When Choi Cheol Woong was having a hard time working as a spy,

411
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,490
I helped him a lot.

412
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,190
Is that really all?

413
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,790
Yes.

414
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,840
I told him to repay me for what he owed me back then.

415
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,820
I apologize.

416
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,210
Lee Doo Hak.

417
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,590
Yes.

418
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,000
You're my hunting dog starting today.

419
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,080
One who doesn't know his master's face, whom he didn't meet today.

420
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,080
One who bites and dies when told to do so.

421
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,420
I'll keep that in mind.

422
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,630
Team Captain Oh will give you instructions from now on.

423
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,430
Hyungnim!

424
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,380
Aigoo, Hyungnim!

425
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,760
Aigoo, your wound must have opened again.

426
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,300
I really almost died.

427
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,770
He's a clever, daring one.

428
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:45,490
That punk seems to have realized the core of our business before he got rid of his boss.

429
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,960
Otherwise, he wouldn't ask to see me as well.

430
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,540
If it doesn't sit well with you, I'll get rid of him.

431
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,890
We don't have time to find a replacement.

432
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,390
Just watch him well.

433
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,110
I understand.

434
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,760
Gosh, Hyungnim!

435
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,810
Shouldn't you go to the hospital first?

436
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,850
Don't you need to get it stitched again at the hospital?

437
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,320
You got in another fight?

438
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,510
You called me over to show me this?

439
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,740
I saw it so you're done, right?

440
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,740
I'm leaving.

441
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,190
Jung Shin...

442
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:11,650
If I quit being a gangster... will you live with me?

443
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,880
I went out so I could quit being a gangster.

444
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,390
I thought about it.

445
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:31,390
When I was really at my lowest, you held on to my hand.

446
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,300
When I went to agricultural high school, when I got locked up in jail,

447
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:42,000
and also... when you came to my house last time.

448
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,300
Every time,

449
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:51,390
I considered it my fate, which couldn't be helped.

450
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,390
So I stepped away from you on purpose.

451
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:58,190
However... I won't do that anymore.

452
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,950
Please don't give up on me, Jung Shin.

453
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,360
I'll quit being a gangster and try to live with a proper job.

454
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,880
I don't think I can live without you.

455
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,690
I love you, Jung Shin.

456
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,370
How do you think I felt?

457
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,700
How do you think I felt when I decided to leave you?

458
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,910
You idiot!

459
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,220

00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,440
No, I'm telling you all to go. Take your leave!

474
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,350
Oh, you weren't telling us to come, but go?

475
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,990
He was telling us to leave.

476

00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,110
That's Moon-dong and Shinhwa-dong over there.

491
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:34,830
slums that get flooded whenever it rains.

492
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:38,800
About 463 hectares (1144 acres) will be redeveloped.

493
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,380
Myeongdang-dong can't even compare.

494
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,880
The original plan was to create housing for regular folks.

495
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,190
But that's not really profitable.

496
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,810
Since we need capital for the Olympics as well,

497
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,310
we changed the plans to create a luxurious apartment complex.

498
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:55,730
The natives will fight back hard, right?

499
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,920
They can only fight back so hard.

500
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,290
The higher-ups intend to pull through, regardless what happens in the process.

501
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:06,070
Our elder is known for his initiative, you know?

502
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,830
Are there still many areas left?

503
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,020
Of course, there is.

504
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:16,500
How much profit do you expect to gain from development?

505
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,900
The government will take at least one trillion won ($765 million).

506
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,180
You can say the land is making money.

507
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,990
However, that's not the only place.

508
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,100
Are you okay?

509
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,290
Oh my, she's dying of happiness.

510
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,930
The map is missing a few details.

511
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:05,360
That's Moon-dong and Shinhwa-dong is right next to it.

512
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,420
Aigoo, there are too many slums.

513
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,710
What about over here?

514
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,790
Why are you eating ramen again?

515
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,900
I'm sure there's rice in the rice cooker.

516
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,130
Why do you come home later and later?

517
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:28,380
Oh my. Am I working at a company? It's not nine-to-five for me.

518
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,320
You're the one who told me to go help.

519
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,420
What about Cheol Woong? Does he at least stop by home?

520
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:44,790
She said he rents a place near his work since there's too much work.

521
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:54,190
By the way, I really think Cheol Woong's mother is going to start a new family.

522
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,480
Don't say things so thoughtlessly.

523
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,000
What if he's really her relative?

524
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,220
Aigoo, you think I was born yesterday?

525
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,260
She said he was her distant cousin,

526
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,480
but what kind of relatives freaking hold hands so affectionately?

527
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,710
She's the daughter-in-law of a noble family, and she also has Cheol Woong.

528
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,930
She isn't someone who'd thoughtlessly remarry.

529
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:17,110
My goodness. You're really stubborn.

530
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:22,150
Even the scarecrow in the fields would have more common sense than you.

531
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:25,230
He helped her with that house, that store called Salon or something,

532
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,280
and even looked into real estate for her.

533
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,150
Why would he do that when she's not even his real sister?

534
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,860
He was ridiculously handsome too!

535
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,960
Quit it and just take this away!

536
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,280
I'm also a woman who works and makes money.

537
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,270
You take it away.

538
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,470
What did you—

539
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,850
What got into her?

540
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:57,060
Careful, careful.

541
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:01,640
Where did you get so drunk?

542
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,970
What?

543
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,560
Are you really leaving the gang?

544
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,860
Yes.

545
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:29,440
Let's quit being third-rate gangsters.

546
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,710
What if Kwang Tak and Young Pil come at us for revenge?

547
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,790
What will you do then?

548
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,880
They couldn't even dream of doing that. Don't worry.

549
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,090
How could you, without even discussing it with us? Isn't this too much?

550
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:44,110
If we started together, we need to see the end together.

551
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:47,130
If the boss just up and leaves, then is it all over?

552
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,920
He's right! I'm really disappointed, Hyungnim.

553
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,840
If I had discussed it, would you have let me go?

554
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,370
Hey, you! What about us then?

555
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:57,980
Are you telling us to go on our way? Well?

556
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,870
I-I-I knew he would be like this! He has no loyalty!

557
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:05,150
Aigoo, he finally got some big money.

558
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,360
So he doesn't want to share, isn't it? So you—

559
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,990
You, Sirs, go on your way.

560
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:13,620
Hyungnim! Let us all go, too! Aigoo.

561
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,860
Let's go. Hyungnim, let's go!

562
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,090
- Gosh, come out. 
 - One second, please!

563
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,650
I think he means we need to leave the illegal business

564
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,690
since we need to do legal construction business.

565
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,590
Am I right?

566
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:30,910
Poong Ho, your crew will probably have lots of work in this construction business.

567
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:37,530
Let's start doing legal real estate development, instead of illegal real estate fraud.

568
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:41,050
I knew it, Man!

569
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,660
-  Family!  
 - Yes, family.

570
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:49,280
Gosh, you're really the boss! I'm sure things will work out!

571
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:53,270
You'll also need to be by my side, too.

572
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,840
Sure.

573
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,260
Hyungnim Gil Su and Seon Woo, you have two options.

574
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,880
You can go with construction or stay in the gang.

575
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,400
Whichever choice you make, I'll give you your shares.

576
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,400
Gosh. I know it'll look cool if I quit the fighting life

577
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,790
and go to work every day in a suit and tie.

578
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,150
But I have no education. Isn't that true, Hyungnim?

579
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:26,610
Seon Woo, there are security and guard jobs in big companies so don't worry about that.

580
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:32,370
What's more important is getting rid of your gangster habits.

581
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,990
- "Gangster habits"? 
 - How do I lose them?

582
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:38,870
Was I a gangster since I was an infant?

583
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:42,490
If only my environment was okay,

584
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,650
I could have... I...

585
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,020
- Okay. Then we're all going together. 
 - Yes.

586
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,840
- I can't go. 
 - What?

587
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:53,440
If we all go, who will do the demolition, which is mandatory?

588
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,430
Also, you can't do construction work without dirtying your hands.

589
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,240
Demolition service is a type of service, as it says.

590
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,810
Other people can do it.

591
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:04,950
Seon Woo and I can't lose our gangster habits.

592
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:08,120
It's right for us to stay behind.

593
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,780
- Wait— 
 - Hurry up and come out, you punk!

594
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,470
Wait, I-I think I can lose it, though.

595
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,850
Well, then see you later.

596
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,450
Wait, Seon Woo—

597
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,640
That a**hole acting all cool.

598
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,060
Darn.

599
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,920
Hyungnim, we really can't lose our gangster habits?

600
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,620
Seon Woo...

601
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:39,030
when you clean your house, you need to wipe the kitchen and the floor, right?

602
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,570
- Yes. 
 - What do you wipe with?

603
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:45,090
I wipe the kitchen with a dish towel and the floor with rags.

604
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,380
Exactly.

605
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,020
Doo Hak and Hyung Joo will be the kitchen towels.

606
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:54,190
You and I will be rags.

607
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:56,530
"Rags"? I'm a rag, you said?

608
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,850
It's not a bad thing, Man.

609
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,410
Gosh, I don't want to be a rag.

610
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,950
It's just that our roles are a little different.

611
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,590
Both of them get your house spic and span anyway.

612
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:14,900
Still, you never ask me first and always go—

613
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,650
I just didn't want to part ways with you, Man.

614
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:24,350
Let's just do what we're good at.

615
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:28,390
Still, we're presidents, you punk.

616
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,910
Do you want the hotel or the nightclub?

617
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:33,880
You choose first, Hyungnim.

618
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,820
You punk.

619
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,070
You choose first, Bro.

620
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,820
- Really? 
 - For real.

621
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,510
I want the hotel then.

622
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,040
I-I wanted the hotel—

623
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,810
Why did you ask me then?

624
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,200
Hey, hey!

625
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,880
Could you let me do the hotel instead?

626
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,900
Come on, wait a second!

627
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,900
Cheol Woong likes Doo Hak's woman?

628
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,860
Why didn't you tell me about this?

629
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,250
I meant to tell you.

630
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,900
But...

631
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:09,540
Lee Doo Hak has more than just a woman problem with Prosecutor Choi.

632
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:13,060
He's also involved with Deputy Director Hwang.

633
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,440
You seem to be rushing too much. Is it for Jung Shin?

634
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,230
I can't marry her as a gangster.

635
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:27,570
You made the right decision. When will it be?

636
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:31,020
Well, after our construction business settles.

637
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,310
I see your reason to rush.

638
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,920
However, you know you need to be more careful at those times, right?

639
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:44,150
Is Lee Doo Hak running the construction company?

640
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,960
He's a mere gangster. Should he be entrusted with such an important task?

641
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,500
There were a lot of incidents, and it happened suddenly.

642
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,200
So Deputy Director Hwang didn't have any other options, either.

643
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,940
I'm going to introduce Cheol Woong to Deputy Director Hwang soon.

644
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:11,370
That means we'll become one family.

645
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:22,790
Among family members, there mustn't be any secrets.

646
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,850
Do you understand?

647
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,760
Before we become one family,

648
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:39,540
there's one more fact you must know, Madam.

649
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,370
Welcome.

650
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,730
I'm a bit late, am I not?

651
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,110
Cheol Woong, he's the one I told you about.

652
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,620
Nice to meet you, Prosecutor Choi.

653
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,540
 A young man who is willing to devote himself to serving his country

654
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,340
 shouldn't lose his spirit.

655
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,520
 I'll see you next time.

656
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:31,490
After we parted ways when I was a cadet, we finally got to meet after ages.

657
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:36,940
Aigoo. Am I doing a good job with the interview?

658
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:41,100
Have you been looking after me due to my mom?

659
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:47,960
When I was taken to the army, I met a man whom I thought

660
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,190
could be the devil if he ever existed.

661
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,930
According to that man,

662
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:58,190
someone helped me become a prosecutor.

663
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:01,070
And were you the one, Deputy Director?

664
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,780
You worked with...

665
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,310
Coordinator Oh Man Ok for a long time, right?

666
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:17,010
Since I was a company commander so it's been a long time.

667
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,860
In that case...

668
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:23,130
you must have been with him

669
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,800
when he worked for NSA as well.

670
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,920
He should be here by now.

671
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:54,830
Prosecutor Choi, my heart was heavy whenever I saw you.

672
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,680
I feel it's too late for this now,

673
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:05,130
but for things I've done to you in the past, I want to sincerely apologize.

674
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:10,970
Your forced draft and working as a spy are unrelated to Deputy Director.

675
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:17,560
He actually found out you're Madam's son, only after you passed the bar exam.

676
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,400
Although I didn't want to do any of those things to you,

677
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,140
please forgive me.

678
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,980
 Deputy Director doesn't know anything.

679
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,040
 I was... the one who ordered everything.

680
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,970
 I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

681
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:52,230
 I'll make it up to you two, atone for my actions,

682
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:54,940
 and promise my loyalty for the rest of my life.

683
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,380
 Stand up.

684
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,300
 I'll see to it,

685
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,390
 how you'll make it up and show your loyalty.

686
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,770
I wanted to die.

687
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:19,430
I had written my will even.

688
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:24,900
Nonetheless, I endured, believing...

689
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,390
I'll get my revenge one day.

690
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,780
Thank you, Cheol Woong.

691
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,510
Thank you so much for surviving it.

692
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:38,960
If not for you, I couldn't have been able to live, either.

693
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,040
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Choi.

694
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,150
It also pains me, but when you're doing government work,

695
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:48,190
sometimes the wrong person gets sacrificed for no reason.

696
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,050
I apologize to you on behalf of this country.

697
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:53,880
I'm really sorry.

698
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,790
Was I sacrificed for no reason?

699
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:07,480
Mom, I can't... accept this marriage.

700
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,020
Cheol Woong...

701
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:15,030
Those people... aren't humans.

702
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:21,600
They're not humans, but monsters!

703
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:27,330
Is it those monsters or me?

704
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,400
You make your choice, Mother.

705
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,150
Gosh, it's freezing.

706
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,160
Sorry? Change the movie's title?

707
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,260
Yes. Change it.

708
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:15,840
What on Earth is wrong with the title, "The Fearsome Baseball Team"?

709
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,330
Most people have already read the comic version!

710
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:21,980
The word "fearsome" might stir up fear in our society.

711
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,150
That's the Performance Ethics Committee's stand.

712
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,980
Take out "fearsome."

713
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,050
Wait, Manager.

714
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:32,450
Does that mean "My Daughter Saved from the Pit" pushes this society into a pit and

715
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:35,360
"Killing Fields" (1984 war movie) stirs up society as a slaughter field?

716
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,620
Our committee didn't exist back then.

717
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,800
If you'll do this, just blatantly censor like you did before.

718
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,600
What do you mean by censor? It's called "review"!

719
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,320
We're only judging according to social ethics!

720
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,180
If you don't change the title, you may not show it!

721
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,990
Wait...

722
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,430
Oh, my goodness! It's such a comedy.

723
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:07,230
If we just say "Baseball Team" without "Fearsome," it sounds weird.

724
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,840
Exactly.

725
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,540
Anyhow, we'll need to replace it with something else.

726
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,360
The Scary Baseball Team?

727
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,020
The Invincible Baseball Team?

728
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:20,740
The Ghost-busting Baseball Team!

729
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,360
Are they made up of marines?

730
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,430
Oh!

731
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:30,110
Since Lee Jang-ho made it, why don't we put his name in it?

732
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,120
Oh, yes!

733
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,620
"Lee Jang Ho's Baseball Team" (1986 movie)?

734
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,270
Yes.

735
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,420
Make sure to ask Director Lee as well.

736
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,300
- I got it. 
 - Aigoo.

737
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:47,610
By the way, the film business is becoming boring for me.

738
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:51,890
The new film law allows anyone to make and import movies.

739
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:54,600
Moreover, TVs and videos are there too.

740
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,200
It feels like the good days are over.

741
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,350
Seriously, even the production costs keep rising.

742
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:05,280
But if we make a good movie, the disorderly film studios will be gone on their own.

743
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,340
We need a selling movie, not a good movie.

744
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:17,250
Don't forget that your mom's a businesswoman, okay?

745
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,860
You're here?

746
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,950
Y-Yes.

747
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,450
Who is it?

748
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,920
He's my boyfriend.

749
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,720
You had a boyfriend?

750
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,770
Oh, my goodness, he's tall and handsome.

751
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,300
Your name is?

752
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,570
My name is Lee Doo Hak.

753
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,350
Nice to meet you.

754
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:53,080
How can you not even tell your mom that you have a boyfriend?

755
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,230
Well, I'm telling you now.

756
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:58,130
I'm Jung Shin's mother, her mom.

757
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,670
And the name is Cha Geum Ok.

758
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:02,280
My! I'm so glad to meet you.

759
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,720
Y-Yes, well, nice to meet you.

760
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,450
Yes. Oh, how great.

761
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,480
Let's go eat together.

762
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,170
I know a good beef restaurant.

763
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:12,870
My goodness, Mother!

764
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:14,950
We already have plans.

765
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,950
Oh my. Plans for what?

766
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:20,510
Are you two eating with someone else?

767
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:23,070
You've got someone more important than your mom?

768
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:26,160
Aigoo, seriously, how upsetting.

769
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,010
Who is it?

770
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,080
Tell me. Who is it?

771
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,930
My mother in the nursing home.

772
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,250
Yes, then you need to go.

773
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,660
- All right. Director Go. 
 - Yes.

774
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,170
- Let's have cold noodles before we go back. 
 - Yes.

775
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:45,230
All right then. I'll see you again.

776
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,960
Yes, please take care.

777
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,090
Nice to meet you.

778
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,770
"Mom"?

779
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,720
Darling... 
 ♫  You're a fool  ♫

780
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,430
♫  If you can't speak after holding onto him  ♫

781
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:14,420
Oh my, Mother.

782
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:19,310
♫  You're a fool  ♫

783
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:21,130
Say, "Ah."

784
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:24,680
Does it taste good? 
 ♫  If you can't say you love him after holding onto him  ♫

785
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,500
Hey, Jung Shin, you have some, too.

786
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,440
♫  He'll just walk away  ♫

787
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,660
Is it all right?

788
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,060
It's so delicious.

789
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,480
- Hey, look at all this. 
 - Oh, let me wipe it.

790
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,830
I should be the one grilling them.

791
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:42,770
♫  On each and every street without a trace  ♫

792
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:48,720
♫  It's only people who can't say it  ♫

793
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,420
Thank you for everything today.

794
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,740
I'm very sorry for visiting her too late.

795
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:00,160
Not at all, thank you for coming with me.

796
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,040
Hurry and go rest up inside.

797
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,620
Okay.

798
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:10,910
Hey, Jung Shin.

799
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:19,350

800
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,330
It must have been...

801
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:32,740
so hard to live like a grownup... all this time.

802
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:37,230
I also...

803
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:40,820
lived too immaturely

804
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,350
so I'm sorry about that too.

805
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,870
♫  Slowly, trying not to lose you  ♫

806
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,180
From now on...

807
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,750
I won't make you cry anymore.

808
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,030
♫  Why are you?  ♫

809
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:01,730
Only now?

810
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:12,060
♫  You, who used to hug me so tightly, flee away tonight  ♫

811
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:15,970
♫  I want to feel love in your arms  ♫

812
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:24,620
♫  You know me better than I... I... I do  ♫

813
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:30,500
♫  Love me better, love me like you do  ♫

814
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:35,490
♫  Remember them, all of our moments  ♫

815
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:38,240
♫  They explode without warning, why?  ♫

816
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,860
♫  You know me better than I  ♫

817
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,930
♫  I can't fall asleep  ♫

818
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:47,990

819
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:49,870
 Land around the major apartment complex is the most valuable.

820
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:51,770
 In addition to operating our development company,

821
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:53,960
 we need to also buy out the lands near the redevelopment site.

822
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,100
 It's proceeding smoothly, as Madam said.

823
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,560
 You should still come. I'll send you an invitation.

824
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:02,220
 He's a childhood friend. It's awkward, you know?

825
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,710
 Hey! What's with you?

826
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:05,910
 Cheol Woong, let me give you a hug.

827
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:07,880
 He said he'll destroy Cheol Woong.

828
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,400
 What is Cheol Woong's weakness?

829
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,170
 You really can't be doing that!

830
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,100
 Lee Doo Hak! Where are you going?

831
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:15,770
 I need to check on something.

832
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:19,480
 Cheol Woong, your biological father...

833
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,160
♫  Even when I hug you deeply  ♫
