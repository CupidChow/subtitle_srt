1
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,900

2
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,830

3
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,560

4
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,930
Aunt, Uncle! You'd better not forget your promise.

5
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,960
Of course! Don't worry.

6
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,920
That's right. We moved our office, Jung Shin. Okay?

7
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,950
Stop by when you come to Seoul.

8
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,270
I will treat you to Chinese food, your favorite.

9
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,420

10
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,670
Honey.

11
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,780
Isn't everything working out too well for us these days?

12
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,620
I'm a bit scared that we might become chaebol (family-owned business group).

13
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,240
Don't get scared!

14
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,620
Don't you remember what that fortune teller at Miari (red-light district) said?

15
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,900
Around this time, there will be a big change in our lives.

16
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,780
Oh, goodness!

17
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,390

18
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,100

19
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,230
Hey, Ms. Oh!

20
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,880
Give me some alcohol, Yang Ja.

21
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,630
Did you fight again with your aunt?

22
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,470
Should I introduce you to some rich old man so you could keep your theater?

23
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,070
Don't you know a rich young man?

24
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,270
Would young men look at you? They would look at me.

25
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,350
Yes, right!

26
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,920
You said one of your aunts owns a theater in Gwangju, right?

27
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,460
Yes, my mom's cousin.

28
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,630
What's her name?

29
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,680
Aunt Geum Ok. Cha Geum Ok.

30
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,820
I heard my aunt is the only woman in the movie promotion industry in our country.

31
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,670
Even my mom and dad can't do anything in front of her.

32
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,100
 What's the deal with this little girl?

33
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,510
 Who are you, Ahjumma?

34
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,570
 If you don't want to get hurt, stay out of this.

35
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:10,280
 Are you the daughter of Namhae Theater's Mr. Oh?

36
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,150
But how do you know my aunt?

37
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,130
The Commander,

38
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,060
I mean, the Deputy Director was worried a lot

39
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,580
if you had any issues while moving.

40
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,290
I see.

41
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,930
But what do you mean by "Deputy Director"?

42
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,950
I heard he was leaving the military. Did he already move somewhere else?

43
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, yes. He went to Namsan.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,200
If it's Namsan,

45
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,340
then isn't that a major promotion?

46
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,080
We've already prepared a place for you to stay in Seoul.

47
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,000
If you have anything else you need, let me know.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,630
No, thank you so much.

49
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,660
Do you... have something you're worried about?

50
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,100
No.

51
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,570
I left a message for my son in Seoul, and I was wondering if he would come.

52
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,630
Wouldn't he come since his mother is moving to Seoul?

53
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,210
He would, right?

54
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,370
How is it? Do you like it?

55
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,910
Yes.

56
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,360
Thanks to you, I could get such a nice house for less than market price.

57
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,330
Thank you so much.

58
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,820
I guess Cheol Woong hasn't come yet?

59
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,160
He said he would stay at his own place for the time being.

60
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,530
His college is a bit far from here.

61
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,720
I was going to properly introduce him to you, Oppa.

62
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,930
I'm sure I'll get to meet him soon.

63
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,500
But more importantly, shouldn't you also get a job, Yeo Jin?

64
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,280
It would be a shame to waste your degree from a prestigious university.

65
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,770
That was such a long time ago.

66
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:12,050
I happen to have a job I want to recommend to you. Do you want to hear about it?

67
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,990
Hey, you, wake up! I said, "Wake up!"

68
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,120
What are you doing on a morning like this? In front of the sacred theater!

69
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,600
You must have taken an early morning train.

70
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,730
To pay the balance already?

71
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,030
O-Oh... well, not really...

72
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,790
Ma'am, how about a daytime drink...

73
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,080
I mean... how about having a hangover drink with me?

74
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,800
This is... a cognac that I worked hard to obtain.

75
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,950
Do you think there will be a pub that opens in the morning?

76
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,390
There's no need to go far.

77
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,890
Are you telling me to buy Namhae Theater?

78
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,170
Yes.

79
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,200
I owe the bank 70 million won ($192,000 in 80's), and there are other debts.

80
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,450
Please buy the theater with those debts included.

81
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,810
If I pay off your debt, are you saying you will sell the theater for cheap?

82
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,270
Yes.

83
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,000
Why?

84
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,780
Although I couldn't keep my promise, you trusted me.

85
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,940
Also,

86
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,620
I feel if I said I would buy the theater back later,

87
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,890
you're someone who'd return it to me.

88
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,580
This young girl talks like all she ate was conniving snakes for food.

89
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,920
I don't do business that comes at a loss for me.

90
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,690
In "The Godfather," Vito Corleone says this line,

91
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,470
"I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse."

92
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,400
Honestly, the theater is just a sweetener. I'm the real asset.

93
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,040
I will sell myself to you, Ma'am.

94
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,920
Oh, you're a tough cookie, aren't you? What are you worth?

95
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,100
I know you are unsatisfied with being an entertainment promoter just in Jeolla-do.

96
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,530
You should become a promoter who dominates the entire country.

97
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,440
I will help you with that.

98
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,650
Hey,

99
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,730
it does seem like you watched a lot of movies.

100
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,030
Since you made your offer like in the movies,

101
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,650
I will respond to you very realistically.

102
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,570
Get lost. Thanks for the drink.

103
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,140
W-Wait...

104
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,400
Ma'am!

105
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,230
Ma'am!

106
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,300
I refused an offer that I couldn't refuse. So have you more to say to me?

107
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,590
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,950
About what?

109
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,420
I was arrogant.

110
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,920
You can make the offer. I will do whatever it is.

111
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,060
Oh, really?

112
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,070
Then for me,

113
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,870
I will make you an offer that you can refuse. Okay?

114
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:22,600
But... you should hear my offer on your knees.

115
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,760
Here?

116
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,060
You can refuse.

117
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,650
Please tell me.

118
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,930
First, I will pay off your debt and take over your theater,

119
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,190
when the right time comes.

120
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,970
Second, you will work under me

121
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,890
as a maid.

122
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,940
I said you can refuse.

123
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,610
I'll do it!

124
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:51,750
♪  Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!  ♪

125
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,460
♪  Like the flowers in December's winter solstice, look at me!  ♪

126
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,660
M-Mom...

127
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,080
Come out.

128
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,860
I heard you weren't at the boarding home the past few days.

129
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,790
And you didn't visit me when I moved to Seoul either.

130
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,390
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,010
If you've done that much, it's enough. You even got dragged into military service.

132
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,580
Stop with the protests and study for the bar exam.

133
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,970
You say the same thing that Hyung Doo Hak told me.

134
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,760
Have you met Doo Hak?

135
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes.

136
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,030
How is he doing?

137
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,100
I'm not sure.

138
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,710
He just seems changed as a person.

139
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,050
Don't meet Doo Hak again.

140
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,670
Nothing good will come from being connected with him.

141
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,600
Aren't we already connected?

142
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,570
Really inextricably (totally), at that?

143
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,310
Cheol Woong.

144
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,820
Please go home now. I will come visit soon.

145
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:26,710
Don't talk like an idiot. You are not connected to Doo Hak in any way!

146
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,190
He is a criminal convicted of murder, but you're....

147
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,700
you're a college student with a bright future, got that?

148
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,270
Why are you being like that?

149
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,110
Mom.

150
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:41,480
The Heavens and the Earth know it, as well as you and I.

151
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,740
Do you really want to see your mom die?

152
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,930
Cheol Woong.

153
00:12:53,930 --> 00:13:00,500
Whom do you think I'm living for?

154
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,950
I mean, why are we still here like this?

155
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,450
Aigoo, do you think it's that easy to find a sucker?

156
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,830
The timing is important.

157
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,630
If we take longer, we must give up on this!

158
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,090
Just wait a bit longer.

159
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,280
Aigoo, this is almost a done deal...

160
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,020
So you should have found a sucker before we got to this point, Hyungnim!

161
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,160
Gosh, look at what we're doing. This is doomed!

162
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,460
Oh, Hyungnim.

163
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,310
Here.

164
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,760
Who is this?

165
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,060
Well, it's a villain,

166
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,160
a bad guy.

167
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,040
Whether he's a villain or an angel,

168
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,670
does he have money?

169
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,700
He's got a lot, yes.

170
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,430
The greedier the guy, the easier they fall for our trap.

171
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,460

172
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,020

173
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,510

174
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,400
I really like the building,

175
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,850
but this is too expensive, especially since we have to pay it all upfront.

176
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,230
How about you lower the price a bit?

177
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,040
Is this expensive?

178
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,780
I'm selling this in a rush at an unbelievable price

179
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,400
of 50% of its value since I'm going to America!

180
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,040
But does it make any sense that you want me to lower the price?

181
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,940
Aren't you just trying to rip me off?

182
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,460
Oh, my gosh!

183
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,500
Boss,

184
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,370
- this business arrangement, cancel, please. 
 - "Cancel"?

185
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,610
- Ma'am! 
 - What does cancel mean?

186
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,920
Wait.

187
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,150
Give them just a little time to think. Wait.

188
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,250
- Just a moment. 
 - What the heck are you doing?

189
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,970
What does "Cancel, please" mean?

190
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,600
- "Cancel, please"? 
 - I don't know, either.

191
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,020
Oh, yes.

192
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,700
Here.

193
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,890
Gosh, okay. Fine! Let's sign the contract.

194
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:10,270
Aigoo, Ma'am! You've made the right choice!

195
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,220
You're going to become rich!

196
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,770
But...

197
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:23,320
I'm short on a little bit of cash even after getting all the loans I can get.

198
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,600
So is it okay for us to pay for part of it with this instead?

199
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,680
The evaluated price of this is at least 120 million won ($330,000 in 1980's),

200
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,420
and you can get at least ₩50 million after paying off the included ₩70 million bank debt,

201
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,130
but I'll value it as ₩30 million and give it to you.

202
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,050
Wh-What is this?

203
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,010
It's Namhae Theater in Yeosu.

204
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,490
The business is profitable,

205
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,030
and it's the top theater in Yeosu!

206
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,070
Why don't you believe me? Ask anyone in Yeosu!

207
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,600
For this price, you would be getting this for almost nothing.

208
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,950
We're pretty much giving it away to you.

209
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,110
Well...

210
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,900
we don't usually take property for payment...

211
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,320
But since you're in a rush, you should take their offer.

212
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,530
I'll make sure to get it liquidated quickly for you.

213
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,390
Then you must take responsibility if anything happens!

214
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:26,320
Oh, of course! All right, let's sign the contract.

215
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,670
Yes. Honey, the money.

216
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,560
I'll count the cash, okay?

217
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,880
Gosh, there's no need for that.

218
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,190
Here.

219
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,730
And here.

220
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,890
- The bag was a bit small... 
 - It was a bit small.

221
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,290
Yes, yes, yes.

222
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,070
Okay.

223
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,530
All right, that's it!

224
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,200
Oh, my gosh!

225
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,380
- Here, take it! 
 - How long has it been?

226
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,590

227
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,940
What should we do with this?

228
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,410
I accepted it as I thought they might suspect us, but that woman was lying.

229
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,510
And ₩100 million for this theater? It likely isn't even worth ₩20-30 million.

230
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,620
Hyungnim, something like that is a headache!

231
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,720
If you try to liquidate that, it takes a long time; your identity will be exposed.

232
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,700
Just give it to me.

233
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,270
Yes!

234
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,430
G-Give it to him for finding the sucker.

235
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,510
Yes, that sounds like a great idea.

236
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,120
Typically, a new recruit gets no share,

237
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,150
but since we earned quite a good profit this time, be generous.

238
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,080
All right. Aigoo...

239
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,980
Here. That's fine with you, right?

240
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,270
- I'm happy with this. 
 - Okay, okay.

241
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,850
Then we all go our separate ways, okay?

242
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,440
I'll call you guys when I get more business later

243
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,790
so all watch yourselves, okay?

244
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,510
You also stay well, okay?

245
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,060
All right, time to go.

246
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,450
We should hurry out! Hurry! Hurry!

247
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,640
What is he planning to do with that?

248
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,890
Stop chatting and messing around! Hurry!

249
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,560
We went the wrong direction.

250
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,590
Let's go.

251
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,510
- Oh, my! 
 - Hyungnim Poong Ho.

252
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,620
It's been a while.

253
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,020
Wh-What brings you guys here?

254
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,190
The rumors are all over

255
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,520
of how you took advantage of someone really well.

256
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,920
Who said such nonsense?

257
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,900
Noonim, you told me yesterday in the motel

258
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,740
that something good might happen soon and we should run away together!

259
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,520
Hey! That's because you kept nagging me for money yesterday!

260
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,760
Gosh! Seriously!

261
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,260
Geez, your trap (mouth)! Why would you tell that gigolo?

262
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,680
Go, go, go.

263
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,760
Hey, let go!

264
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,090
No, you can't! You can't! You can't!

265
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,050
Geez!

266
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,250
Oh, okay, okay.

267
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,960
Let's split the money among ourselves.

268
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,550
How about 7 to 3?

269
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,750
We'll take 7, and you guys take 3.

270
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,480
- How about it? 
 - That's funny.

271
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,310
W-Well then,

272
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,810
how about 5 to 5?

273
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,450
Okay, then we'll be cool about it, and do 7 to 3.

274
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,520
We'll take 3; how about it?

275
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,360
Hyungnim, just go somewhere and have pork belly and soju.

276
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,490
- And piss off. 
 - Aigoo, seriously...

277
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,760
There was one more guy.

278
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,470
Hey. Come over here.

279
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,620
- Me? 
 - Punk...

280
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,610
Punk...

281
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,710
You're one of them, right?

282
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,280
Not anymore.

283
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,750
We decided to go our own way. Isn't that right?

284
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,280
Give me what you got, too.

285
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,000
What do you mean?

286
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,310
Geez, this is tiring.

287
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,890
This guy's got nothing.

288
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,450
Is this it?

289
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,930
Hyungnim, isn't he part of your family?

290
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,030
What do you mean by part of my family?

291
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,510
H-He's just a probationary employee.

292
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,740
I'll see you again next time.

293
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,060
Wait.

294
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,480
Is this guy crazy?

295
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,700
I don't care about the money, but you should give me that.

296
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,930
It has a proper owner.

297
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,800
Hey, Brat.

298
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,380
The owner you're speaking of... is me.

299
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,840
It's me. Ass–

300
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,610
Right there!

301
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,540
I told you there's a separate owner for this.

302
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,830
I'm leaving. Bye.

303
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,220
Where are you going by yourself?

304
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,050
- We should go together. 
 - Hey, hey, hey!

305
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,390
Oh, my, the money.

306
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,850
You b*stards eat 2-3 times

307
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,410
more than what others eat,

308
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,830
yet you got beaten up by one guy?

309
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,710
Get in pushup position.

310
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,800
Positions!

311
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,360
Enough.

312
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,800
No, Hyungnim. These guys need to be disciplined the military way.

313
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,930

314
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,540
Okay.

315
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,260
I mean, they were in and out of jail from their youth

316
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,400
so none of them went to military service.

317
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,510
So why are you disciplining them in military style?

318
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,400
Get up.

319
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,220

320
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,980
Get out, you b*stards.

321
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,800
Did you tell them to do it?

322
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,210
Excuse me?

323
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,890
Oh, yes.

324
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,630
I heard that Go Poong Ho finished a job.

325
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,990
I couldn't tell you in advance since you were away.

326
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,700
Do you first do a job then report to me after?

327
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,910
Right. The action leader should have quick judgment like that, right?

328
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,520
You did well.

329
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,000
Th-Thank you.

330
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,910
But the results weren't good.

331
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,010
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

332
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,120
No, it's all right.

333
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,520
Which one would you like? Pick one.

334
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,940
Excuse me?

335
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,040
What are you doing not choosing one?

336
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,200
I'm sorry, Hyungnim. I'll make sure nothing like this ever happens again.

337
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,670
Yes, right, a**hole. Come here.

338
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,270
Put your head here, you a**hole.

339
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,010
This one's for the bad result, Man.

340
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,340
Got it?

341
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,970
And is Go Poong Ho your friend?

342
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,980
He's also a hyung to me, you rude b*stard.

343
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,110
This b*stard... You...

344
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,900
Bring Poong Ho to me in three days.

345
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,190
Also, bring that b*stard who beat our guys.

346
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,200
Got it?

347
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,640
Yes, Hyungnim.

348
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,750
Get out, you fool.

349
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,820
Oh, gosh, I'm dying.

350
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,050
Are we still not there yet?

351
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,650
We're almost there.

352
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,170
Gosh, more stairs! Really?

353
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,140
I'm exhausted.

354
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,150
You should have gotten a room where it's a bit flatter!

355
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,700
If you didn't have money, you should have said something.

356
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,590
If you did, I would have lent you some money. Aigoo!

357
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,980
How can I borrow money from you when we're not even family?

358
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,130
Aigoo. Do you have rice?

359
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,600
I just usually eat ramen.

360
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,290
And on weekends, I eat food that the church charity organization provides.

361
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,910
Sometimes, I eat while working manually.

362
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,620
Gosh, that's why I said we should buy some rice before we came!

363
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,760
Yes, Hyungnim!

364
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,590
More importantly, Kwang Tak and his guys must be so spiteful right now.

365
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:25,470
I know! Once he flips out, he doesn't stop at anything.

366
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,310
Gosh, and that No. 2 guy. Geez, he's just...

367
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,470
And that sucker would have found out by now they were fooled.

368
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,460
- Come on, Ahjussi. Take a look at this. 
 - Geez, come on!

369
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,270
It has my name, Oh Tae Ja, written on it!

370
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,510
Your wife definitely said you were going to America and–

371
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,190
What are you guys talking about?

372
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,050
My wife died long ago!

373
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,260
She died?

374
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,140
- Why did she die? 
 - No way!

375
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,480
There's no way!

376
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,950
No! Ahjussi, yours is fake, right?

377
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,660
Ahjussi, yours is fake, right?

378
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,500
It's exactly the same!

379
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,880
Give me a break.

380
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,460
Yours is fake.

381
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,470
This one is the real one.

382
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,850
It seems you guys must have been defrauded. Come to your senses,

383
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,970
and hurry over to the police station!

384
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,420
Oh, no...

385
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,460
What police station?

386
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,500
Oh, no! There's no way this is true!

387
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,720
- Gosh! Honey! 
 - Oh, Honey!

388
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,120
What do we do now? Since we're going to be chased by Kwang Tak and the police...

389
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,760
What now?

390
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,890
Hey, now is not the time to be yawning!

391
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:32,270
If you beat up Kwang Tak's guys like that, you should take responsibility for the consequences!

392
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:38,060
Gosh, then just give the money to them. That would take care of it.

393
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,250
With what clues will the police catch us anyway?

394
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:44,500
So just give them the money, and you won't have any problems.

395
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,350
Gosh, b-but still...

396
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,380
You said we should all go our separate ways.

397
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,680
That was just Mr. Go saying stuff.

398
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,720
You said I don't get any shares as I'm a newbie.

399
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,870
- Aigoo. 
 - Seriously!

400
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,600
Everyone, return to your homes.

401
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,100
I must do manual labor early in the morning so I'll rest.

402
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,710
Hey, fine! Okay, okay. I was wrong.

403
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,610
From now, let's be a family.

404
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,340
Yes, all right, a family!

405
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,540
Yes, now on, we can give him a share in the profits!

406
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,370
Will you really accept me as your family?

407
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,890
 Of course!

408
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,490
And you all will become my family?

409
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,710
 - Oh, of course! 
 - Don't even mention it!

410
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,610
No, no. You will become our boss from now on!

411
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,730
Boss!

412
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,780
Now we are a family!

413
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,320
 A family!

414
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,590
Hurry up and leave.

415
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,370
Okay, we'll be on our way.

416
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,390
Let's go.

417
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,360
Go inside!

418
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,240
Family!

419
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,550
Go on your way.

420
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,860
Now we are a family!

421
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,430
Oh, Young Tenant.

422
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,730
Is today a special day?

423
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,290
You have family inside.

424
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,210
Go ahead inside.

425
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,870
Yes.

426
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,330
Oppa!

427
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,020
Why didn't you come home or call us?

428
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,280
Do you know how worried Mom was?

429
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,640
Stop talking and let's just eat.

430
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,250
Do you know how much Mom cried after you called her?

431
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,140
This girl...

432
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,650
Hey, Girl, who do you think you are that you're eating the drumstick?

433
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,400
Gosh, all I ate today was one bowl of noodles!

434
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,050
I'm so starving my belly button will stick to my back.

435
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,700
Mom, you should eat, too.

436
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,580
Gosh, it hasn't been that long since you came out of prison,

437
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,260
but seeing how handsome you look,

438
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,130
you're like a Seoul person.

439
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,370
Really?

440
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:15,050
Oh, right. Oppa, I ended up working at a factory in Seoul.

441
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:19,120
Unnie Gil Ja says it's Bangil Industrial Company in Guro-dong,

442
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,090
where they make zippers and razors.

443
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,430
Then what about school?

444
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,860
Oppa, you also know, right?

445
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,540
I wasn't on your level, but I was at least in the top five of my class.

446
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:34,600
But these girls, who are worse at studying, all go to high school,

447
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,900
but Father kept telling me to quit school and work at a factory.

448
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,980
I was so angry!

449
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,950
Shut your mouth.

450
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,830
Do you know why I said I would go to the factory without a fuss?

451
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,220
So I can return to school by earning my own money!

452
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,420
You just watch.

453
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,650
I will go all the way to college.

454
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,770
Stop rambling (talking) and just eat.

455
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,020
Stuff yourself. Okay?

456
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,800
♪ Red light, green light. One, two, three! ♪

457
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,960
You resented your father a lot, right?

458
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,040
I resented him a lot, too.

459
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:22,410
I thought how heartless your father was, not visiting his son in prison once.

460
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:25,270
If you're going to mention Father, just stop.

461
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,580
When you turned 20 and transferred to Gwangju,

462
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,810
that was the day before Chuseok (Harvest Day, Thanksgiving).

463
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:38,910
But out of the blue, your father said he'll go to a cousin's house in Gwangyang to offer ancestral rites.

464
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,650
I didn't want to bother preparing food for the ancestral rites so I said to go ahead.

465
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,280
Mom, just hurry inside and go to bed.

466
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,400
Don't you want to hear it?

467
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,250
Yes.

468
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,560
Still, listen.

469
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:06,160
But after telling me he would return around Chuseok evening,

470
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,600
he didn't return even the day after Chuseok.

471
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,900
I wondered if something happened so I called his cousin in Gwangyang.

472
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,330
He said, "What do you mean?"

473
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,200
He said your father never came.

474
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,540
I was so scared.

475
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:27,610
I couldn't sleep at all and couldn't even eat anything.

476
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:32,140
Over two days after Chuseok passed, your father

477
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,180
 walked into the house at night.

478
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,280
 Aigoo, Doo Hak's father!

479
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,990
 Doo Hak's father! Doo Hak's father!

480
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,550
 What happened!

481
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,640
 Where did you go that you're only returning now?

482
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,830
 I thought I would die from being worried about you!

483
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:52,470
 Gosh, just make me some food.

484
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,140

485
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,010
 Your father doesn't have any relatives in Gwangju.

486
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,350
 So why would he have gone all the way there?

487
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,790
He went to where you were.

488
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:29,670
I checked when Jung Ok and I went to visit you the following month.

489
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,630
At that time, your father left money for your detention fund.

490
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:43,040
 So your father put in all the money he had for his return bus and food.

491
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:48,940
 He walked all the way from Gwangju to Yeosu for two days straight.

492
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,720
Don't hate your father too much.

493
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,560
I told you to head on inside and go to bed!

494
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,430
Doo Hak...

495
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,170
Doo Hak!

496
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,000
♫  Oh, oh, our South Korea  ♫

497
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,790
Hey! 
 ♫  Oh, oh, our South Korea  ♫

498
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:19,340
♫  Oh, oh, our nation  ♫

499
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,250
♫  Oh, oh, I'll love it forever  ♫

500
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,890
Hey!

501
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,360
Wake up!

502
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,520
Go wash your face!

503
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,380
♫  Oh, oh, our South Korea  ♫

504
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,730
Unnie (older sister, female's friend).

505
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,210
Give me an energy pill.

506
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,920
- Just one, please! 
 - Gosh, this girl...

507
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,380
Please!

508
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,630
You've already asked me for so many!

509
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,670
I'm so sleepy that I'm going crazy.

510
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:02,770
What if I can't complete the workload at this rate?

511
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,530
Please...

512
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,270
I won't be responsible even if you collapse from dizziness.

513
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,110
Okay.

514
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,540
Thank you for your hard work.

515
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,420
Come out to our evening class if you have time.

516
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,270
Gil Ja! Hello!

517
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,000
Oh, yes.

518
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,830
Please take a yulmoo (Job's Tears) tea.

519
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,250
Oh, it's all right.

520
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,910
Come on, I won't ask you to come out to night class so please take one.

521
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,050
I told you I'm fine.

522
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,980
Please give it to us.

523
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,990
Yes.

524
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,000
Hurry up!

525
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,720
You're Jung Ok, right?

526
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,280
Yes.

527
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,960
Many people have passed the GED (General Educational Development).

528
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,870
If you study a bit, you'll surely pass on your first try.

529
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,720
Oh, okay.

530
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,190
But there's something I'd like to ask.

531
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,700
Are you a communist?

532
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,350
S-Sorry?

533
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,420
I heard from Unnie Gil Ja that people who go to night school or labor unions

534
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,490
are all communist.

535
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,150
You're here?

536
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,030
We need to...

537
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,380
draw the bigger picture today.

538
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,320
Well,

539
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,100
the thing is...

540
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,550
I'm not yet...

541
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,300
Get off.

542
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,710
I'll give you one week.

543
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,890
If you don't locate the leadership hideout by then,

544
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,790
your family will receive your death notice.

545
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,210
Do you know what this is?

546
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,110
This is the hard-earned tax money of the people.

547
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,700
So...

548
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,170
let's show some patriotism.

549
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,580
This a**hole doesn't understand the situation.

550
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,140
Hey, how dare you protest and sell your country over to the commies,

551
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,440
when you come from a family of independence activists?

552
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,400
Throw him into boot camp and make an example of him.

553
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,950
Hurry on.

554
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,800
Hey!

555
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,740
Come on! Stop stalling!

556
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,870
Get up there!

557
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,990
 Hello?

558
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,030
- Mom. 
 -  Cheol Woong!

559
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,830
 Is this Cheol Woong? It's really you, Cheol Woong?

560
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,690
Yes, Mom.

561
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,570
Cheol Woong! Where are you?

562
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,600
Did you really join the military on your own?

563
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,150
Don't be like this, Mom. It just turned out that way. I'm doing well.

564
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,340
 Cheol Woong. Y-You don't need to join the military.

565
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,010
 Where are you? I'll go to you.

566
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,600
M-Mom, I don't have time.

567
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,910
The military has changed. They have good food, and they let me sleep well.

568
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:25,240
They don't give any more beatings, Mom, so don't worry about me and—

569
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,010
Mom?

570
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,190
Mom...

571
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,180
You really...

572
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,970
miss your mother, right?

573
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,210
I can send you on leave as early as tomorrow, and I can shorten your military service, too.

574
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,790
Do you want to try...

575
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,260
loving your country?

576
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,610
I...

577
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,170
already love this country.

578
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,840
You know very well that's not what my question means.

579
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,140
I don't really know

580
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,580
what you mean.

581
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,070
Don't you know?

582
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,470
It's simply what I said, "Loving your country."

583
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:33,610
How do you love your country? It's catching spies and commies.

584
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:41,010
If you find and report commies, we arrest those a**holes and boost national security.

585
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,490
Are you...

586
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,590
asking me to be a mole?

587
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,170
What do you mean, "mole"?

588
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,700
That's what

589
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,540
we call a patriot,

590
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,740
loving your country.

591
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,680
This is the front line.

592
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,640
It's a very dangerous place.

593
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,550
No one will know

594
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,080
even if you disappear.

595
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,390
Choi Cheol Woong.

596
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,750
I'm giving you an  opportunity right now.

597
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:22,200
Don't you need to continue your patriotic family lineage?

598
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,280
I don't want to.

599
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,750
Write it.

600
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,680
Hey, put him through one more run.

601
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,590
I'll write it! I will!

602
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,020
I'll write it...

603
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,060
- Hey, Hyung! 
 - What happened!

604
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,060
- What's this? What the heck? 
 - How?

605
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:26,700
- What happened? 
 - You didn't get hurt? Are you okay?

606
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,690
♪  The life running  ♪

607
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,720
Right now is the time to make our stand.

608
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,490
Yes, right now is the time.

609
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,380
I said we couldn't. Everyone got arrested.

610
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,230
When will it be if not now?

611
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,730
Hyung! Why did you come back here? It's dangerous!

612
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:46,120
- You're here? 
 - I'm sorry for making you all suffer.

613
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,980
We worried so much due to the cops.

614
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,560
- Please take a seat. 
 - Thank you.

615
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,310
Let's sit.

616
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,710
By the way, what brings you here?

617
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,920
I need to at least see your faces before I go.

618
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,440
Are you okay?

619
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,630
Have some of this, too. Where are you headed?

620
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,680
 You know him, right?

621
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,270
 I know you do!

622
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,340
 You!

623
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,050
 You sons of bitches!

624
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:30,790
"After confirming each other's feelings, Ju Seok gets Black Glove in the taxi."

625
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:33,680
"Ju Seok and Jun Il transport the luggage from the handcart to the taxi."

626
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,720
"The three start to get hopeful."

627
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,690
"And the screen fades out."

628
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,790
The scenario ends here.

629
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,900
It's a little dark, right?

630
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,860
Who's the director again?

631
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,100
It's Bae Chang Ho's debut ("People in a Slum"). Kim Bo Yeon, Ahn Sung Ki, and Kim Hee Ra are the main cast.

632
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,340
I see. It's not bad.

633
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,380
By the way, I'm curious about one thing, Boss.

634
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,550
It'd be faster for you to read the scenario yourself. Why always tell me to read it to you?

635
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,930
Didn't you know?

636
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,980
I don't know how to read.

637
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,310
What?

638
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,120
You really don't know how to read?

639
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,370
How did you read the ledgers all this time then?

640
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,970
When did I ever read them?

641
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,870
I just memorize them when my bookkeeper reads it to me.

642
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,540
Wow, how do you memorize this?

643
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:32,740
The landlord is head over heels for his wife in Japan so he doesn't really stay in Korea.

644
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,080
It's perfect for us to use!

645
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,600
A total of 200 million won ($600,000 in 1980's) for the production cost?

646
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,700
That's correct, President Cha.

647
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,560
The work has some level of completion, but it's about the poverty in cities.

648
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,840
So there will be some censorship and correction.

649
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,690
It'll also be rated R, no underage viewers.

650
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:02,230
So will it make money or not?

651
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,360
If I were you,

652
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,100
I wouldn't invest in it.

653
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,500
In that case,

654
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,110
I'll need to invest in it.

655
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,970
Sorry? Why?

656
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:22,470
Because the arrogant smarties are the ones who are always wrong.

657
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,960
Hand him a postdated check for 30 million won.

658
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,320
Dated in a month, okay?

659
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,830
Thank you. Thank you, President Cha.

660
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:35,420
Everyone else was reluctant to invest. You're...

661
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,980
like an army of support by my side.

662
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,430
I'm not trying to help you.

663
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,080
It's because I smell money here.

664
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,330
Sorry?

665
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:49,710
You smell money?

666
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,210
Oh...

667
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:56,140
This building is quite good.

668
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:00,050
Since there's info on developments nearby, we just need to put it up for 300 million won.

669
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:04,610
And people will flock like herd dogs.

670
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,380
Wow, she must be an actress.

671
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:12,260
She's really pretty. But who is she?

672
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,150
Boss, do you know her?

673
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,070
Let's leave if you're done looking around.

674
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:22,820
Just come for a second. It's because she's really pretty; come and look.

675
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,180
Hurry. How are you so young and not interested in women?

676
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,970
Go take a look.

677
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,630
For the movie...

678
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,380
Was I right? Isn't she pretty?

679
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:56,150
She's not pretty at all.

680
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,800
Let's quickly go, I said!

681
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,430
He took his sweet time looking.

682
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,690
Guess our boss has high standards.

683
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,450

684
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,780
You can start living here from now.

685
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,220
Wait—

686
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,870
What's this place for?

687
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:54,960
Oh my. You're really as dense as a rock.

688
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,040
Can't you tell from just looking?

689
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,190
It's Namdo Film Studio's Seoul Branch.

690
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,300
Gosh.

691
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,650
There was a dimwit whom I fired about two weeks ago.

692
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:10,300
So starting today, you're the employee and the branch manager at the same time.

693
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:16,090
Why? You're so out of it since you got promoted too fast, aren't you?

694
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:21,430
Sweetie, buy what you need with this.

695
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,420
Boss!

696
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,560
Boss!

697
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:41,970
Wait... you need to tell me what I need to do.

698
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,880
Oh my. Look at this girl.

699
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,580
How can you be asking me when you also ran a theater before?

700
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:54,790
Also, I don't even know how to read, and you're a college dropout.

701
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,450
Who would teach whom?

702
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:05,970

703
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,130
Aigoo, whatever.

704
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:35,470

705
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,300
Oh Jung Shin, you're the crazy wench.

706
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,710
How can you make a living when you can't assess people?

707
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:46,370
Gosh. What are my eyes good for?

708
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,540
Hello?

709
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,520
 Hello.

710
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,820
President Cha?

711
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,240
♫  I want to hold your hand  ♫

712
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,590
You need to speak if you called!

713
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:17,710
What the heck?

714
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:22,610
♫  Forever Love, the only one  ♫

715
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:27,390
♫  I want to like that you're mine, hate me or nice  ♫

716
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,080
Gosh! 
 ♫  Let me in  ♫

717
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,330
♫  Your beautiful life  ♫

718
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:37,930
♫  Come over here, back in your love, in my life  ♫

719
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:39,230
Again?

720
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:43,730
♫  Let me go, in my life  ♫

721
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,360
Hello.

722
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,300
♫  Let me go  ♫

723
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,510
Hello?

724
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:51,760
♫  In your life  ♫

725
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,450
What the heck is this, seriously?

726
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,230
Hey, you! You'd better stop prank calling!

727
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,850
You're an elementary school student, right?

728
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,440
I guess you don't know what a nasty temper I've got.

729
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,030
If you waste another call, I'll chase you to the end of the universe and

730
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:10,010
break your fingers so you can't dial ever again. You got that?

731
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,500
You little...

732
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,680
We're almost done now.

733
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,380
Hyung! Hey, run away!

734
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,640
- The detectives are coming in. Hurry! 
 - Gosh...

735
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:39,560
Hey! Get them all!

736
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,780
Hey!

737
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,120
Stay still!

738
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,500
Hyung, you go first.

739
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,310
Hyung, are you okay? Can you move?

740
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:15,360
- I'm okay. You guys go ahead. 
 - Hurry up and go.

741
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,920
I'm okay so leave me and go!

742
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,220
Stay still!

743
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,960
Get that a**hole!

744
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,290
Get him!

745
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,620
It's okay.

746
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,960
Sorry?

747
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,440
He's one of us.

748
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:07,350
Sir. Take care.

749
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,860
What's this?

750
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,480
Did you follow me?

751
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,040
Follow you, my a*s.

752
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:23,620
I said you're one of us. And families protect each other.

753
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:29,180
Gosh, those fellows aren't part of the leadership.

754
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,740
It's just a regular club!

755
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,650
- Okay? 
 - Okay, I see.

756
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:39,440
However... one of them might know the information I want.

757
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,770
So I'm just raking them all in.

758
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:47,660
Choi Cheol Woong, I don't need hundreds of small fish.

759
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,480
I just need one big fish.

760
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,100
Wouldn't that also save you some face (respect) as well?

761
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:59,670
I'm sick of showing you this photo.

762
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,950
Let's love your country for once!

763
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:06,580
"Love my country"?

764
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,920
Okay.

765
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,420
Please let me love my country. Okay?

766
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:17,900
Just send me back to the army instead and stand guard by the barbed wires!

767
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,400
Have you gone crazy?

768
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,260
Do you want to die?

769
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,590
You talk too much.

770
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:36,090
If you go back to the army,

771
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:39,050
you can die without anyone knowing.

772
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:43,890
No one will ever know how you died or why you died.

773
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:46,860
That is called death under suspicious circumstances.

774
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,710
You seem to have gotten a little gutsy now that you socialized a bit.

775
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:54,520
How about it? Shall I send you back to the army?

776
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,990
I'm telling you this since you're family.

777
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,740
Always be grateful, you punk.

778
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,580
The place does have a guard,

779
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:15,490
but he only knows the building manager and he doesn't know what the landlord looks like!

780
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:18,640
What? Wow, the heavens are helping!

781
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,300
Wow, isn't this such a good deal?

782
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,370
How much do you think we can get for this?

783
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:28,010
Still, we always need to be careful.

784
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:32,720
Even if you think the fire is out, piss on it just to make sure it's out.

785
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:36,460
You just watch out for gigolos.

786
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,120
Gosh, seriously.

787
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,410
- Jang Deuk, get the certificate of registration. 
 - Yes?

788
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,670
Okay!

789
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,920
- What's that? 
 - What—

790
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,640
Why do you live so high up? What?

791
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,020
Come out.

792
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,360
Let's have a drink.

793
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,550
Who's that punk?

794
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:02,550
He's my friend.

795
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,150
Gosh, I almost peed myself thinking he was a cop!

796
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:07,070
- Seriously. 
 - Aigoo.

797
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,630
Oh my...

798
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,230
Come on, seriously.

799
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:15,910
Let's really just have one more shot.

800
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,880
Hurry up and go to sleep inside, you punk. Also,

801
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,060
if you come over for a drink one more time, you're dead.

802
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:27,160
If so... just kill me now, please.

803
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:31,020
Who beat you up so badly that your ankle is like that?

804
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,960
Oh, this? It's from loving my country.

805
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,860
Are you fighting for Independence or something?

806
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,490
We're here.

807
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,020
Choi Cheol Woong.

808
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:58,080
Oh, you survived somehow, right?

809
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,940
Shall we have a word separately?

810
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,870
Who the heck are you guys? If you have something to say, speak here.

811
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:06,790
I'm Cheol Woong's Sunbae (Senior). Don't worry and wait inside.

812
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:08,550
It'll only take a moment.

813
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,860
I told you to talk here.

814
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,730
O-Okay, okay.

815
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:24,210
Th-These are... my closest sunbaes.

816
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:28,980
Hyung... you go ahead and rest inside.

817
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,330
I'll be right in.

818
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:32,600
I'm going to leave, you punk.

819
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,910
O-Okay.

820
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:40,300
Okay then. Take care.

821
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,910
Hey, Cheol Woong!

822
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,700
Choi Cheol Woong!

823
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:26,170
Oh, excuse me. Where's the movie club?

824
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,060
♪  Do you know that our fatherland is calling us? ♪ (Song of Korean Independence Army)

828

829
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,870
Cheol Woong...

830
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,590
let's be honest here.

831
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:01,360
How many times do I need to tell you?

832
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,220
I'm really not it.

833
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,690
I'm telling you, I'm not a mole.

834
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,190
Then who's the detective who let you go?

835
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,430
And who's the one who talked to you?

836
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:13,120
That's why I'm saying...

837
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,430
let me talk to the female student who saw it at the dorm.

838
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,240
How is she sure it was me when it was so dark at night?

839
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,280
You were limping, they said!

840
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,880
- Who else could it be? 
 - Others who were unhurt all got arrested.

841
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,070
But only you didn't get caught, even with your injury!

842
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,620
- Does this make sense? 
 - Answer her!

843
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,090
Hyung...

844
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:35,960
I ran toward the east gate, not the outback.

845
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,210
And I didn't even limp.

846
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:41,200
I was too nervous and running so I didn't even know it hurt.

847
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,270
I only realized it hurt after I escaped to safety!

848
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:48,350
Yes. That's why I drank alcohol!

849
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,900
Don't you all have  an experience like that? No?

850
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,470
- Gosh, seriously. 
 - Cheol Woong.

851
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:04,440
We all know you didn't want to...

852
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:08,310
become a spy.

853
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,890
You were drafted by force and exempt from service,

854
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:13,730
with sudden early discharge.

855
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:19,930
I can guess what those b*stards did to you.

856
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:23,870
Since countless classmates were treated like that and even died.

857
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:26,760
So let it all go and confess now.

858
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:30,120
We're not trying to harm you right now.

859
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:35,780
We need to let the world know how evil those b*stards get in order to trample democracy!

860
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,600
Cheol Woong, I beg of you.

861
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,690
Let's blow the whistle.

862
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,120
Hyung!

863
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,030
♪  Are you going to cower in fear at our enemy's strength?  ♪

864
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:52,740

00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,710
♪  Where the sword of justice  ♪

866
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:58,240
You said the talk would only take a little time, but it must have taken all night.

867
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,210
Where is Cheol Woong?

868
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,990
We had a short talk last night, and I sent him back home.

869
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:05,260
Gosh, come on now.

870
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:08,080
I slept alone in Cheol Woong's room until this morning.

871
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,080
Then he must have gone to another drinking buddy.

872
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,340
Hey, wait a minute.

873
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:19,050
Do even educated college students lie?

874
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:23,410
Cheol Woong is here, isn't he?

875
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,680
He said he wasn't!

876
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,550
Oh, you're quite the tough guy.

877
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:30,260
Please go back. They're marines from UDT (Underwater Demolition Teams).

878
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,820
Oh my. How scary.

879
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:36,410
I'll count to ten. If Cheol Woong doesn't come out by then,

880
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:39,520
I'll be the seeker. Okay?

881
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,380
Seven...

882
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,380
Eight...

883
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,810
Are you all done hiding?

884
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,970
Nine!

885
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,990
Ten.

886
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:01,260
I'll look for him now, okay?

887
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,180
If you come up here...

888
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,260
we can't help it, either.

889
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,240
Sh*t!

890
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,710
Seriously!

891
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,930
Hyung, it's the cops.

892
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,740
 Cheol Woong!

893
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,670
Choi Cheol Woong, are you here?

894
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:35,060
It's hard for me to find you if you hide too well!

895
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:44,950
I wasn't...

896
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:48,400
going to go this far on students,

897
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:54,090
but the seeker needs to find everyone for it to end. Right?

898
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:56,380
Okay.

899
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,130
This little—

900
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,610
- Come here! 
 - F**k!

901
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:12,850
- Get him! 
 - Stop it!

902
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,640
Come out.

903
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,770
I found you.

904
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:28,910
Leave.

905
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:39,950
Hey, you punk! I almost died.

906
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,480
Let's go.

907
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:46,160
Choi Cheol Woong!

908
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:51,100
- Gosh... 
 - You've got a great friend.

909
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,510
However...

910
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:55,650
let's not live in shame.

911
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,620
That's right.

912
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,230
We can't live shamefully.

913
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:12,800
We can't lead embarrassing lives.

914
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:18,300
But you know, even in the worst situation, I did my best not to be shameful.

915
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:23,340
If I were really a mole,

916
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:27,210
Hyung and all of you, too,

917
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:28,680
you guys wouldn't be here now.

918
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,240
Get it?

919
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:38,250
Hey, let's go. All right?

920
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,660
Let's go.

921
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:53,080
Why didn't you tell them honestly?

922
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:58,110
That whistle-blowing thing, you know?

923
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:59,690
Right.

924
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:03,460
You need to have a whistle to blow it,

925
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:05,940
but not a conscience.

926
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,730
Right?

927
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:15,290
By the way, why did you come in, even getting beat up like that?

928
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,330
Were you worried harm might happen to me?

929
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,770
Of course.

930
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:23,060
I don't care about you getting injured or dying,

931
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:28,310
but where would I get the payment for the debt you owe me?

932
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:34,040
You... can't die even if you do die until you repay me, you punk.

933
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:39,090
I'm in for some deep trouble, right?

934
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:41,310
But at least one thing is resolved.

935
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:45,220
You can't do the spy work anymore.

936
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:49,280
What would be your use after all this ruckus?

937
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,560
Is that so?

938
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,210
Oh my.

939
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:01,430
Choi Cheol Woong is one lucky guy. How fortunate.

940
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,320
Crazy punk.

941
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:23,740
Hyung.

942
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,700
I...

943
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,370
really didn't sell out any of my friends

944
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:33,510
whom I did demonstrations with.

945
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:40,010
Even when those b*stards... beat me and threatened me so badly,

946
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:44,750
but how...

947
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:48,650
How can they do this to me?

948
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:58,110
Hey, get on.

949
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:01,700
Get on my back, you a**hole!

950
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,000
Aigoo, sh*t.

951
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,630
You're so freaking heavy.

952
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,210
Hyung...

953
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:28,310
don't you want to go down to Yeosu once?

954
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:35,100
Let's go down, watch a movie, see my dad...

955
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,440
and also your dad.

956
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:41,550
- And meet Jung Shin too. 
 - Cut it out.

957
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:43,220
Why?

958
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:46,190
You actually want to go, don't you?

959
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:49,780
- You also miss Jung Shin, right? 
 - Gosh, go there if you want, you punk!

960
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:53,490
- Hey, this can't do. Get off now. Get off! 
 - W-Wait.

961
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:55,200
Just up to there.

962
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:01,460
In that case, shut your trap and be quiet on the way, okay?

963
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:12,990

964
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:16,980
♫  I want to hold your hand  ♫

965
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:20,800
♫  I want it to be like a birthday  ♫

966
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,390
♫  No matter you will be here, Forever Love, the only one  ♫

967

968
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:33,190
♫  I want to look at your mind, hate me or nice  ♫

969
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:36,950
♫  Let me in your beautiful life  ♫

970
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:41,050
♫  Come over here, back in your love, in my life  ♫

971
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:44,220

972
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:47,240
 I introduce to you the CEO of Paris Salon, Kang Yeo Jin.

973
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,390
 Wow, whom do we have here? Long time no see.

974
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:54,090
 - We will become part of your family. 
 - What did you say? "Family"?

975
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:57,910
-  Who is he? 
 - He's someone who helps out with my business.

976
01:08:57,910 --> 01:09:01,140
 If I succeed in this deal, will you give me some shares?

977
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,000
 But you still shouldn't go out with him.

978
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,900
 What kind of bullsh*t is that?

979
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:07,750
 He's your hyung and friend, but you let him live as a thug?

980
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:12,240
 By the way, I'm trying to start something else, too.

981
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,680
 Lee Doo Hak? Why are you here?

982
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,980
♫  Let me go  ♫
