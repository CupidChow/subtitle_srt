1
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,630

2
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,110
Well then.

3
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,030
Shall we talk about business?

4
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,230
Tell me whatever it is that you want.

5
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,490
Our government and I will help in whatever way we can.

6
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,580
I am already over 70 years old.

7
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,540
I want to start a business in my home country.

8
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,820
That would not be difficult.

9
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,840
Many foreign nationals are running large businesses in South Korea.

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,950
What kind of business do you want to do?

11
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,870
The business of buying and selling companies.

12
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,530
Also, we will bring some seed money with us,

13
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,010
but help me to get loans in South Korea.

14
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,430
- I don't know if I can go that far– 
 - Oh, there are conditions to that, of course.

15
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,010
First, I will help connect you to the Kremlin.

16
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,040
And secondly, we will make sure to give you

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,780
30% of all profits we earn, Deputy Director.

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,230
I will report this to my superior and make sure it happens.

19
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,000
Sounds good.

20
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:08,430

21
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,440

22
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,900
Great work.

23
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,440
Well... what did I do?

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,770
You did everything, Deputy Director.

25
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,030
It was your idea to take the rice wine.

26
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,980
Thanks to you, everything worked out well.

27
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,350
It's not necessarily that you did anything spectacular.

28
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,370
It feels good just to have you reliably by my side.

29
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,140
I will...

30
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,100
work to become a more reliable person.

31
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,730
If we can establish diplomatic relations with the U.S.S.R,

32
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,150
it will be recorded as a historical event.

33
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,180
Also, we will be compensated handsomely for making it happen.

34
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,270
While you are here, work hard to learn and grow your strength.

35
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,800
Okay.

36
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,390
I heard they are sending Ha Yeon first.

37
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,630
Why didn't he say anything to us?

38
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,540
Maybe he plans to keep making use of you here.

39
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,490
Hey, Sengyo (“fresh dead fish”). That look in your eyes right now

40
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,590
isn't one you should have toward the person who saved your life.

41
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,010
If he doesn't send me to South Korea this time as well,

42
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,420
I will smash everything and set it on fire.

43
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,620
Why would you drink my alcohol without permission?

44
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,520
Aigoo, please start sharing a bit.

45
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,930
Are you going to take all your money with you in your coffin?

46
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,490
You b*stard!

47
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,920
I'm leaving, Sengyo!

48
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,930
Pour me a drink.

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,370
I heard you say that you will smash everything

50
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,630
and set fire to this place if I don't send you to South Korea.

51
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,150
I said it for you to hear.

52
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,700
Do you know how much money it cost me to save you when you were dying

53
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,390
from a gunshot wound, and to smuggle you in by boat?

54
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,190
Pachinko Market, Honbiki House,

55
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,930
sports gambling house,

56
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,210
protecting foreign national merchants, and transporting money...

57
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,500
My entire body is battered and cut up from fighting the Yakuza.

58
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,660
I think with all I went through, shouldn't I instead receive compensation?

59
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,930
Gosh, you're so scary; I can't keep you around any longer.

60
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,750

61
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,240

62
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,460
How do you feel being reborn?

63
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,480

64
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,630
 Go to Seoul tomorrow

65
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,990
 and go find Raccoon in Myeongdong.

66
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,310
 He will give you operating funds.

67
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,490
You can take 10% of that as your compensation.

68
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,230
 Shouldn't I now start a business in South Korea?

69
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,060
And you will be my manager there.

70
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,040

71
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,300
Here is the current information on the companies the old man mentioned.

72
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,110
These are opinions of reliable economics research professors

73
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,980
and famous business analysts.

74
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,770
What about an analysis of the state of politics?

75
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,860
- It's in the back of that. 
 - How much did it cost?

76
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,040
In total, it was around 100 million won ($184,000 in 1989).

77
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,790
You bought me a newspaper worth 100 million won.

78
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,340
Mr. Lee, we don't need to see superficial, prettied-up companies.

79
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,200
We need a business analysis of the internal state of companies.

80
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,810
Then... whom do we need to contact?

81
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,580
We need NSA files on businesses.

82
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,650
I can directly ask them for that.

83
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,080
The list of weak businesses analyzed by the Financial Supervisory Service,

84
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,610
obtain it no matter what it takes.

85
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,460
- Really? 
 - Yes.

86
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,820
Chae Dong Pal says he contacted the Kremlin's chief foreign affairs adviser.

87
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,350
Great job!

88
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,800
You did really well.

89
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,500
But there are personal requirements he's stated, and he will demand huge loans.

90
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,170
That's something we can work out in detail.

91
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,990
We just overcame a major obstacle.

92
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,890
Great job!

93
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,580
You will get a medal of honor and promotion.

94
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,920
Now, your world will unfold before your eyes!

95
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,630

96
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,270
Nice!

97
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,980
"Young Generation"! Movies for the youth!

98
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,910
And Ham Yang Ja's Young Music!

99
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,750
CEO Oh, you don't have to be wary of anyone now.

100
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,030
Let's just move forward without taking a step back!

101
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,540
Oh my. I never said I'll work with you.

102
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,940
Hey, why are you being like that?

103
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,820
While I am the music director here, I'll take care of the accounting and security.

104
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,310
I'll do all of it!

105
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,700
Hey, you need to reduce your labor costs anyway.

106
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,630
All right. You can do all of it.

107
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,040
All right, congratulations on opening Oh Jung Shin's Young Generation.

108
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,250
What, Choi Cheol Woong? How did you find out?

109
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,770
Me? Don't you know I gather all the information in our country?

110
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,510
If that is really true, that's civilian surveillance.

111
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,680
My informant is right here.

112
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,090
What?

113
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,280
This girl, seriously!

114
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,230
Good job. I'm glad you came.

115
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,750
 Cheers!

116
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,260
- Congrats! 
 - Thanks.

117
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,600
But... you said you're quite high up in position.

118
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,340
And you brought fried chicken as an opening gift?

119
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,260
Talk about being simple...

120
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,220
This is quite nice for a government employee.

121
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,030
Thanks for the food.

122
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,400
All right.

123
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,910
Here!

124
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,160
This is your real gift.

125
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
What?

126
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,660
- Hong Kong movies? 
 - After "A Better Tomorrow," (by John Woo)

127
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,310
Hong Kong noir films are selling really well in our country.

128
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,670
These films haven't been imported yet.

129
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,940
They are also successful movies in Hong Kong.

130
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,310
Does your company also delve (dig) into such business, Cheol Woong?

131
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,790
Our work involves understanding the culture

132
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,140
so I asked a Hong Kong branch for a favor.

133
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,280
All for CEO Oh Jung Shin?

134
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,330
Hey, it's way more cost-effective than Hollywood movies.

135
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,290
Try it. I will connect you to them first before anyone else.

136
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,470
I mean, thanks for providing me with good information,

137
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,600
but you know my company lacks finances for this.

138
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,140
My company is focusing more on planning for now.

139
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,980
- Here. 
 - Hey, do you know how valuable this is?

140
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,730
Just get some loans from a financial institution!

141
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,930
Hey!

142
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,470
My company just started. Do you think they'd give me a loan?

143
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,760
You have me. I'm capable of at least that much.

144
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,500
Set up a good foundation while you have the opportunity.

145
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,840
You need good capital in order to do good planning.

146
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,470
Oh, my gosh! Cheol Woong, you're so cool!

147
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,940
Hey, what are you doing? Just accept it while you can.

148
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,970
- I mean, well... 
 - So will you accept my gift or not?

149
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,020
I mean, well, if I accept it...

150
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,900
what must I do for you?

151
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,130
Don't push me away. That's all I need.

152
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,340
So you're going to accept it, right?

153
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,290
All right! For the success of the Young Generation!

154
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,320
Cheers!

155
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,230
What are you doing? Hurry and raise your glass!

156
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,760
 Cheers!

157
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,170
In any case, thanks a lot, Cheol Woong.

158
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,970
I've always been mean to you.

159
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,330
So you do know you've been mean to me!

160
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,720
So treat me better from now on.

161
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,970
All right. I really want to be nice to you,

162
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,090
but you always keep crossing the line like this!

163
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,280
Geez!

164
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,460
- Come here and get ready to get hit! 
 - That hurts! That really hurts!

165
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,530
 - Does he know? 
 - Hey!

166
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,190
 Who cares? What does that have to do with you?

167
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,410
 - Oh, oh... A mouse, a mouse... 
 - What is it?

168
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,650
 Just joking.

169
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,560
 What are you doing?

170
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,910
 Oh, hey!

171
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,270
How could I not hit you?

172
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,670
Gosh, seriously!

173
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,480
I'm going.

174
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,310
Hey, Jung Shin. I will be promoted soon.

175
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,440
Buy me food when I get my promotion!

176
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,850

177
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,020
 Yes, two intestines!

178
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,400

179
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,210
Hey!

180
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,880
When will you take our order?

181
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,750
I will be right there!

182
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,100
All right, what can I get for you?

183
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Our intestines and ribs are good.

184
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,610
- R-Ribs, please. 
 - Ribs for two?

185
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,630
Hey, Seon Woo, ribs for two!

186
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,800
Yes.

187
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,590
Hey, I bought this.

188
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,120
Yes, this is Hotel Rice Soup!

189
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,000
Who gave you permission to do business here?

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,300
Just a moment.

191
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,010
Gosh, which b*stard said that with no fear?

192
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,130

193
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,820
From now on, this restaurant

194
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,930
will come under my management, and I'll need to collect payment for it.

195
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:02,110
♫  My dear love  ♫

196

♫  Wherever you are, please be safe  ♫

197

♫  In the dark night, to be left in eternity  ♫

198
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,020
I missed you all.

199
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,080
Hyungnim?

200
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,940
Doo Hak...

201
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,380
Doo Hak...

202
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,850
♫  My dear love  ♫

203
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,440
♫  I will be right here  ♫

204
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,050

205
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,310

206
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,930
Gosh, Heaven really helped you out.

207
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,590
Heaven did...

208
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,710
So what will you do now?

209
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,420
Hyungnim.

210
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,560
- Are you going to get revenge? 
 - Don't say such nonsense.

211
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,300
He barely managed to survive.

212
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,910
Doo Hak. I'm happy with you just being alive.

213
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,620
Don't even think of getting revenge.

214
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,690
You know very well that we can't handle those people.

215
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,840
It's like trying to crack a boulder with an egg.

216
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,170
Just forget it all, and let's live at ease.

217
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,830
I want to live at ease, but in my current situation, how could I?

218
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,650
I'm already thought to be dead.

219
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,760
If they find out I'm alive, they will try to kill me again.

220
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,400
If I want to live at ease, I need to put everything back in its original place.

221
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,390
"Original place"?

222
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,830
Where my father, my mother, and Jung Ok were with me,

223
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,280
and where Jung Shin was next to me.

224
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Hey, is that even possible?

225
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,130
- Your father already passed away– 
 - I will try my best to get there.

226
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,970
That is revenge!

227
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,190
We can't handle those guys.

228
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,440
All right.

229
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,540
Right now, I am the egg.

230
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:16,160
If I try to smash a boulder with an egg, that would be stupid. But...

231
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,380
wouldn't things be different if I became the boulder?

232
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,640
Not only that, I can see them, but they can't see me.

233
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,210
You are nothing but a thug.

234
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,180
How can you become a boulder?

235
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,600
In a gangster's way.

236
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,170
Please help me.

237
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:45,130

00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,560
Yes, that is right.

241
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,260
I want to enter South Korea to do some business.

242
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,830
I was wondering if there were any businesses I could take over.

243
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,240
Excuse me?

244
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,840
There isn't anything I can do for you...

245
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,340
Sunbaenim!

246
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,050
 Hyeong Joo. Hyung, please obtain information for me on weak businesses in our country.

247
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,460
 The one who saved me and sent me here wants to know.

248
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,670
 - Okay.

 Okay.

Is there an unnie you're looking for?

264
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,620
Rotary and Wolf.

265
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,040
Excuse me?

266
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,260
Gosh, the guys who act as bouncers for this place.

267
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,820
Rotary and Wolf.

268
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,000
They're not bouncers but Managing Directors.

269
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,860
 Hyung Gil Su, please gather all the guys who are split up.

270
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,130
 Okay.

271
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,860
Oh, over there.

272
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,950
You're here?

273
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,110
Hey!

274
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,820
Hey?

275
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,630
Oh, Hyungnim!

276
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,380
Hyungnim Gil Su?

Hey, have you been well?

280
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,770
Will you really be okay?

281
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,750
It's not okay.

282
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,570
Yes, I'm afraid something might happen.

283
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,080
Let's turn the car around.

284
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,760
I'm turning the car around. I will really turn it around!

285
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,730
It's not okay.

286
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,660
It's actually easy.

287
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,560
Is it easy?

288
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,700
Just think about why we fought.

289
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,860
Then it becomes easy.

290
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,240

Gosh, this b*stard.

I'm not a ghost. Take a seat.

 - Come here!

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,220
You snake!

301
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,950
Lee Doo Hak! Come here.

302
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,660
Let go, let go!

303
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,410
Come here, you b*stard! Come here!

304
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,860
 Let go of me! Let go!

305
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,380

306
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,030
Aigoo, Hyungnim.

307
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,930
Have you been doing well?

308
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,960
Oh, perfect.

309
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,100
You traitorous b*stard.

310
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,090
It's nice to see you here today.

311
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,550
Let's both die here today!

312
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,230
- Hyungnim. 
 - "Hyungnim"?

313
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,720
D*mn you, you b*stard!

314
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,310
You just wait a bit.

315
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:20,710
I'll see you after I introduce him to the king of the underworld.

316
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,630
You f***ing b*stard!

317
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,680
You!

318
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,340
Whenever I think of you, I even wake up at night from sleeping!

319
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,430
I'm sorry...

320
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,960
You!

321
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,540
Die!

322
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,830
You guys should stop.

323
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,980
Hey!

324
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Don't stop me!

325
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,500
D*mn it, I'm bleeding.

326
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,260
I won't explain in detail

327
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,540
how I came to be here. It's a long story.

328
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,040
Do you know how upset I was when I heard you were dead?

329
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,300
Thanks for being alive.

330
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,050
Now I can chew you up and kill you myself.

331
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,040
Shut your mouth before I rip it apart.

332
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,260
I'll be the one to cleanly skin your flesh from your bones.

333
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,540
So just wait.

334
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,340
Hyungnim, that was all this snake's doing!

335
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,980
Shut it!

336
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,550
Hey.

337
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,910
It's 200 million won in cash,

338
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,530
and 300 million won in checks.

339
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,500
Each briefcase with 500 million won.

340
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,050
Let's not argue about our good or bad past.

341
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,900
In the end, it's not because we hate anyone, but due to our greed, isn't it?

342
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,500
A bit of hatred for someone does come into play.

343
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,670
Young Pil, you have a reputation for being a drug dealer

344
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,270
and the state of your leg would make it hard for you

345
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,810
to go back to being the boss of a gang, Hyungnim.

346
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:16,180
So how about doing business with me?

347
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,120
If you open up gambling houses with this ₩500 million, you can likely open ten places.

348
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,150
The profits will be split at 5:5.

349
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,140
Any houses that you make after that will be split 6:4.

350
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,520
So... call?

351
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,570
Or fold?

352
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,840
 Call.

353
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:52,480
Then are we now business partners?

354
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,830
Yes. That's right.

355
00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:00,390
Then all of us... together like this?

356
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,900
Yes. Here.

357
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:15,780
Then before we become business partners,

358
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:20,590
let me beat up this f***ing b*stard with just a hundred blows!

359
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,190
Actually, just ten punches.

360
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,440
Doo Hak...

361
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,870
Please hold Hyungnim back.

362
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,920
In the past, he used to do boxing!

363
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,640
I'll die even if it's just ten punches!

364
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,770
- After what you've done to me... 
 - I'm sorry!

365
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,770
- Doo Hak, seriously! 
 - You still have nine more punches!

366
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,090
You deserve to die! You traitor!

367
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,840
At this rate, one of our business partners will die.

368
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,160
You b*stard!

369
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,070
It's all right. Young Pil is strong.

370
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,480
It's past 13.

371
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,820
That was 15 punches!

372
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,610
One more!

373
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,800
Die, die, die!

374
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,190
Hey, Doo Hak...

375
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,640
Please stop him!

376
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,800
I'll really die!

377
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,700
Young Pil was just like that.

378
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,060
- That's what I'm saying! 
 - Doo Hak.

379
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,050
This is the state of politics analysis report you asked for.

380
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,770
After the three parties merged, the terrain became complicated.

381
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,700
It was such an unexpected event that even the people are dumbfounded.

382
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,360
Great work.

383
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,960
From now on, keep using all your connections through your school

384
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,230
and keep ties with them.

385
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,620
Don't worry about the money.

386
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,560
Don't worry. If I buy them drinks and give them an envelope, they take it so naturally.

387
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,180
Among my alumni, they know me as a Chairman Kim, who was very successful in the U.S.

388
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,780
Thanks a lot! Thanks to you, I even got the title of chairman.

389
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,940
You actually graduated from Seoul National University?

390
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,850
 Seoul National University!

391
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,110
I dropped out.

392
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:46,040
Regardless, I am friends with someone who went to Seoul National University!

393
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,280
Wow, it's such an honor!

394
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,080
Hey, we are all ex-con grads from elementary school (slang for prison).

395
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,990
That's true.

396
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,260
You're right.

397
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,390
Hyung, make sure to manage the house well.

398
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,490
That is our source of strength.

399
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,220
Gosh, you know I am like a Seoul National University grad in that field.

400
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,730
Don't you worry.

401
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,620
Oh, right. What about Seon Woo?

402
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,140
I got a phone call from him earlier.

403
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,300
He was staking out undercover the past few days, but the guy didn't show up.

404
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,550
But... when are you going to meet Jung Shin?

405
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,780
Hey, yes.

406
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,000
She should have been the first person you met.

407
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,260
I should meet her,

408
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,320
when I'm ready.

409
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,340
Let's have a shot together.

410
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,330

411
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,570
They're waiting for you.

412
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,980
You made it.

413
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,150
Mother, didn't you say you had something to talk to me about?

414
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,960
That's right. Let's first say hello.

415
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,300
I'm sure you already know President Geum Yeon Hee.

416
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,490
This is her father, Chairman Geum Man Cheol

417
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,570
of Changsung Group, the twentieth richest man in the country.

418
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,730
Aigoo, it's nice to meet you, Prosecutor.

419
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,710
I really wanted to meet you.

420
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,600
It's nice to meet you, Chairman.

421
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,460
We meet again.

422
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,810
Thanks to you, I donated bail money to the country and got out.

423
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,100
How could you be so inflexible?

424
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,470
She even voluntarily went in for questioning.

425
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,080
- Apologize to her right now. 
 - What do you mean, apologize?

426
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,360
He just followed the protocol.

427
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,670
That's right.

428
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,110
You had such a strong spirit.

429
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,370
Are you being sarcastic?

430
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,540
Do you think I came to see someone I want to be sarcastic with?

431
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,280
Even if it's not for an apology,

432
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,210
I came to be treated to a meal since I was in quite a bind due to you.

433
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,940
You can buy it for me, right?

434
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,090
Please take a seat.

435
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,980
I sometimes go golfing with Chairman Geum.

436
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,700
After I heard what happened to President Geum Yeon Hee, I was shocked.

437
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,670
So I invited them to a meal.

438
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,600
It's an honor to meet you.

439
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,880
Please eat.

440
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,940
Although the elders are here, I feel I should say this to you.

441
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,290
Please forgive me.

442
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,400
Go ahead.

443
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,690
Last time, since Prosecutor Choi had me confined,

444
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,900
this time, I want to confine him.

445
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:29,000
Prosecutor Choi. How about you go out with me?

446
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,930
 Cheol Woong must think they met in a natural coincidence.

447
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,840
 Otherwise, he will respond negatively so be careful.

448
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,760
 Of course.

449
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,730
Hey, Child. Your elders are present.

450
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,710
You're joking.

451
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,230
President Geum, you have a knack for toying with people.

452
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,530
I'm not joking.

453
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,450
Is it not a joke?

454
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,010
I see...

455
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,470
I'll give you my answer.

456
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,260
I'm seeing someone already.

457
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,340
- Cheol Woong. 
 -  You would have known with a bit of research on me.

458
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:21,650
My father told me that reading people is the first step to gaining intel.

459
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:28,540
That means if you can't read people, you don't deserve to work in intel.

460
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,630
I will be on my way.

461
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,010
Cheol Woong.

462
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,930
 Please have some tea.

463
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,410
What are you doing? Greet the bank president.

464
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,940
Hello, my name is Oh Jung Shin.

465
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,990
Oh, yes. It's nice to meet you.

466
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,670
- But what brings you here? 
 - Bank President.

467
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,010
Do you like movies?

468
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,810
Oh, movies? Of course.

469
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,390
Yes, I like them a lot.

470
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,860
Oh, really?

471
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,470
She is a CEO of a film studio that I can vouch for.

472
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,600
Can I ask you to provide her with a loan?

473
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,680
Oh, of course.

474
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,140
I'll provide you a loan in excellent condition.

475
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,120
Yes. Thank you.

476
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,450
I look forward to working with you.

477
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,430
Thank you so much, Cheol Woong.

478
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,230
Gosh, finally, you're brightening up.

479
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,210
How nice now you're smiling!

480
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,090
You should relax a bit and live, Jung Shin.

481
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,440
But until the profits and the movie score come out, I can't relax.

482
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,910
Still, it's a good day for various reasons

483
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,400
so shouldn't you buy me a drink?

484
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,770
I should. Let's go somewhere nice.

485
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,560
Really?

486
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,700
Gosh, gosh. This really makes me so angry!

487
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,030
Here. Drink some water.

488
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,250
I mean, even if they love money that much,

489
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,190
people shouldn't be like this!

490
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,480
Does it make any sense that they ask for twice the amount we agreed on?

491
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,040
Even though I've worked in real estate my entire life,

492
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,630
yet this is the first time I'm seeing someone so evil!

493
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,230
Did they ask for double the money?

494
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,500
Yes, that's right!

495
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,020
It appears people are clamoring to buy it like a pack of dogs.

496
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,450
Wouldn't it be good to still buy it at that price?

497
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,920
Seeing how everyone clamors to buy it,

498
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,640
is it only a matter of time before it rises three or four times its value?

499
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,200
The thing about that is

500
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,350
if we buy it at the original price, we could profit in three or four years,

501
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,280
but if we buy it at double that price,

502
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,320
we wouldn't profit much even after 3-4 years.

503
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,900
Besides, if the government changes to a different administration,

504
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,280
we don't know what might happen then.

505
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,330
Real estate is fickle like that.

506
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,260
Gosh, seriously.

507
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,010
Goodness.

508
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,420
Then what should we do?

509
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,550
What do you mean "what should we do"?

510
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,630
We don't even have money to pay them the doubled price.

511
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:22,720
We should just think that land wasn't meant to be ours.

512
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,170
Gosh, we should have just given them the down payment right away.

513
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,040
All because we pushed back the date so we could get more interest...

514
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,080
Since it's so aggravating, let's close early today

515
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,840
and go somewhere for some cold draft beer.

516
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,070
- Mother. 
 - Oh my! Oh, Jung Shin!

517
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,200
Cheol Woong! Aigoo!

518
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,100
Oh, have you been well?

519
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,840
What brings you guys here?

520
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,510
A good thing happened to me so I came to treat you to tasty food.

521
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,900
Aigoo, it just so happens I wasn't in a good mood today.

522
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,790
I was going to close early today and go home.

523
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,600
I'm glad you came!  So glad you're here!

524
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,900
Just wait a bit.

525
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,800
I will hurry back out with my bag.

526
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,320
Hold on just a bit!

527
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,160
Just wait here a bit.

528
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,720
Was this the nice place you talked about?

529
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,100
Why? Don't you like it?

530
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,030
You haven't seen her in a while, either, right?

531
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,060
 That's true.

532
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,820
 I like it.

533
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,310
I thought it would be just us.

534
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,360
Here. Have a bite of this.

535
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,510
- Aigoo, it's okay, Mother. You should eat. 
 - Say, "Ah."

536
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,950
Come on, my arm's about to fall off!

537
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,520
Delicious, right?

538
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,110
Mother, me, too.

539
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,530
Sure, sure. All right.

540
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,860
Say, "Ah."

541
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,700
Aigoo, aigoo.

542
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,470
Gosh.

543
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,470
It's so delicious.

544
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:00,360
Geez, are they the only ones with mouths? Mine counts as a pie hole?

545
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,670
Oh my.

546
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,350
Do you not have hands or eyes?

547
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,300
You can help yourself all you want.

548
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,370
Right... with this...

549
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,500
Oh my. It's so nice to see a good-looking man and woman sitting next to each other.

550
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,270
You two are old enough and look so great together.

551
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,290
It'd be great if you could just live together.

552
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,540
- Should we? 
 - Aigoo.

553
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,010
My goodness, seriously. They'll choke on their food. Why are you saying that stuff?

554
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,910
 My, are you okay?

555
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,080
 - Aigoo. 
 - Mother, please!

556
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,670
 Cheers!

557
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,890
Oh, we're here, right?

558
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,930
Go inside and rest up. You look tired.

559
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,770
Why?

560
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,140
What's wrong?

561
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,100
Is there something on my face?

562
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,260
Nothing.

563
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,950
Even when I know your feelings... I get help from you like this.

564
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,890
I think I'm a terrible girl for doing this to you.

565
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,430
If you're that sorry, you can date me.

566
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,700
Strangely, no matter how pretty or rich they are,

567
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,930
I couldn't be satisfied unless it's you.

568
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,370
Just now, I went back to our Yeosu days in my dream.

569
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,860
Say, do you remember when we jumped

570
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,870
into the ocean at summer's end and had a water fight?

571
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,970
Of course, I remember.

572
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,520
 The water was so cold

573
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,130
 so we came out as soon as we went in,

574
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,520
 screaming that it's cold.

575
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,500
 But then...

576
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,730
 you dragged me back into that cold water.

577
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:35,940
♫  Somebody please tell me now; what am I supposed to do?  ♫

578
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,230
Honestly, I was also chilled to the bone.

579
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:44,050
But since I was with Doo Hak and you, I got the courage from somewhere

580
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,340
and felt I could endure that cold ocean water.

581
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:52,320
♫  Most beautiful, most cheer is full  ♫

582
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,480
♫  Darling, it's all in your mind  ♫

583
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,290
You're that kind of person to me.

584
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,380
♫  I'll really come back  ♫

585
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,800
Like a precious memory.

586
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,230
♫  They're hauling me back, a lot of men  ♫

587
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:09,290
A friend helps me endure each and every tiresome day, no matter how tough,

588
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,280
like today.

589
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,390
♫  And doubt for the rhythm  ♫

590
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,920
I don't want to... lose that precious memory, Cheol Woong.

591
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,540
♫  The sentiment to reason, the sadness, the dark  ♫

592
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,270
Jung Shin...

593
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,840
Thank you for dropping me off.

594
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,810
I'll go now.

595
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,920
♫  From the darkness whoever you are; is there somebody?  ♫

596
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,140
♫  Please save me now. I don't know what you're doing  ♫

597
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:43,120
♫  Out of the darkness, where we don't have to trust it  ♫

598
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,430
♫  Nobody knows  ♫

599
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:51,280
♫  Nobody knows the pain  ♫

600
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:58,220
♫  That I have  ♫

601
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,460
♫  How can you?  ♫

602
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,340
Mother...

603
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,750
You're coming home now?

604
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,860
Please stop it now.

605
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,600
You should be the one to stop now.

606
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,230
Jung Shin won't be of any help to you.

607
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,350
Mother, please.

608
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,050
What about how my life has been?

609
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,720
I did anything if it was for you.

610
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,590
I did in the past, and I'll be the same in the future. But you...

611
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,660
can't even give up this much for your mom?

612
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,990
She was even engaged to Doo Hak. Doesn't that even bother you?

613
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,600
Why should I be bothered?

614
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,620
Did I kill Hyung Doo Hak or something?

615
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:53,480
Doo Hak's mother told me to marry Jung Shin, saying we look great together.

616
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,240
Did you meet Doo Hak's mother?

617
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,900
Yes!

618
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,380
I visited her with Jung Shin, and we had dinner together.

619
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,040
Even when you knew... how much I hate you meeting that woman?

620
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,300
Mom... you know what Ahjussi and Ahjumma did for our family.

621
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,230
Why do you hate her so much?

622
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,560
Hyung Doo Hak even served a prison sentence in my place—

623
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,860
Talk to me.

624
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,270
Stay here and talk to me, Mom!

625
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,800
Let go! Let go!

626
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,480
You're not even my son anymore.

627
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,300
- Cut it out! 
 - Let go!

628
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,710
Your mother gave birth to you and raised you.

629
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,900
So she must have a deeper level of affection for you

630
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,090
than me, who got to meet you a lot later.

631
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:48,130
I told you I respect your opinion,

632
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,880
but you must understand your mother.

633
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,510
 That woman...

634
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,800
 really did anything

635
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,400
 if it was for you and...

636
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,310
 she will be the same in the future.

637
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,690
If you and I were drowning and only one of us could be saved,

638
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:12,650
your mother... won't hesitate for even a moment and throw the rescue tube to you.

639
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,950
Father, but that's not the point of this matter.

640
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,900
Unless you can convince her first,

641
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,200
you'll have to put aside your feelings for Jung Shin.

642
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,980
Father...

643
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,870
There are many things you need to do in the future.

644
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,370
Great things, on top of that.

645
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,430
Don't take too long with this.

646
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,340
Chairman Geum of Changsung called me earlier.

647
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,660
I heard there was an awkward situation.

648
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,880
So he'll come to visit me next time.

649
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:20,780
A chaebol chairman's daughter asked Cheol Woong out.

650
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,870
It's Changsung we're talking about.

651
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,780
It's not a small or medium corporation. It's Changsung.

652
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,930
But then he said–

653
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:32,230
He said he likes someone else since he's head over heels for Jung Shin.

654
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,370
How insulted and furious must those two have felt?

655
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,380
He asked me to tell you he'll visit you tomorrow.

656
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,800
For what business?

657
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,810
I don't know about that.

658
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,740
But he didn't seem too angry.

659
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:54,440
 Madam, I heard you're interested in real estate.

660
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,790
Do you want to do business with me?

661
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,740
How could I dare to do business with someone like you?

662
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,900
I'm running only a mom-and-pop store-level business for retirement.

663
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,300
Exactly.

664
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,900
I'm telling you to expand to a big supermarket level.

665
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,740
Do you have a good business item in hand?

666
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:20,050
You're aware of Housing Site Development at Sooseo District, one of the First New Towns, right?

667
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,510
Yes.

668
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,490
But I thought the government was supplying that region to the non-homeowners.

669
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,790
Yes, that's true.

670
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,670
However, people in the Ministry of Economy, Seoul Regional Tax Office,

671
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,870
a news agency, and even the military,

672
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:36,010
who have the power created a union

673
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,980
to lobby so their families can also receive

674
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,940
the special presale rights.

675
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,230
Even so, will the Ministry of Works or Seoul City accept their requests?

676
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,600
I'm Geum Man Cheol, am I not?

677
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:55,160
Am I not the one who came this far by erasing the word "impossible" in my dictionary?

678
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,270
I already met with those special unions.

679
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,340
It was agreed that I'll secure 11.5 hectares (28 acres) of the Sooseo District's

680
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,210
housing sites and give it to them as a special supply.

681
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,760
Will that be possible?

682
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,070
It's possible.

683
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,990
But the problem is purchasing the land.

684
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,320
My company can't buy them in our name.

685
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,040
We need to buy them under a borrowed name.

686
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,580
Will you be able to do that for me?

687
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,190
If... special presales happen...

688
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,870
how much will the gross profit be?

689
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:32,930
It'll be at least... 100 billion won.

690
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,600
Here's the map.

691
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,990
All right. Take a look here. It's this side.

692
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,960
It's this side,

693
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,110
at 11.5 hectares.

694
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,780
It's a golden egg.

695
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,900
Sorry?

696
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,870
Do you want to postpone the purchase of the west coast reclamation property?

697
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,040
Yes.

698
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,610
I thought about it a little bit.

699
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,230
But I think that will take a little too long.

700
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:24,230
Filling in the ocean will take more than a couple of years, right?

701
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,690
It's a little far from Seoul and

702
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,220
I think it'll take forever to recover the principal.

703
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:34,980
But I have already... given my word to many people.

704
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:38,090
It's not like you wrote a contract.

705
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,630
Could it be you... received a different proposal?

706
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:49,380
Not at all. I'm just saying let's take our time. I'm sorry, Team Captain Oh.

707
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:59,520
Why? Is something wrong?

708
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,390
It's nothing.

709
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:05,150
I understand.

710
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,550

711
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,450
After all the work I put in for preparation... Is she mocking me?

712
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:26,640

713
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,520
Is this Chairman Joo of Kyeongsung Hotel?

714
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,200
I'm Team Captain Oh, who oversees corporations at Namsan.

715
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:06,040

716
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,830
 He went around and collected bribes from every pachinko (gambling) place.

717
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:12,850
 I confirmed it personally with the business owners.

718
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,300
 He probably got more than a billion won in bribes already.

719
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,970
Fire him right away and arrest him for investigation.

720
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:32,140
Must you go that far? He went through much trouble working for me a long time.

721
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,830
That's why he can't be forgiven.

722
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:38,200
Because he disgraced your reputation.

723
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,630
 Since you seem to dislike Team Captain Oh,

724
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,910
 I even left him out of my trip intentionally.

725
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:48,960
Also, he seems to be serving your mom well.

726
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,990
I think you're being too harsh.

727
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:55,490
That's only a part of Team Captain Oh's social politics, isn't it?

728
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,360
Why don't you realize that, Deputy Director?

729
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,670
- Is it due to your grudge from the past? 
 - Deputy Director!

730
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,800
He apologized and sought your forgiveness.

731
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,040
I'll make sure to give him a strict warning.

732
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,710
Please look the other way for your father this time,

733
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,690
I ask of you.

734
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:24,220

735
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,650
 Although you asked for his forgiveness,

736
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,820
 Cheol Woong probably can't forget

737
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,830
 that easily because he still has the trauma.

738
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,010
 I'm sorry, but I'll need you to understand.

739
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,910
 It probably can't be helped but be uncomfortable

740
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:53,230
 for you both to see each other while Prosecutor Choi is here.

741
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,780
 Why don't you take a break

742
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,890
  and stay at a branch abroad temporarily?

743
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,370
- Deputy Director... 
 - I have no other intentions.

744
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:05,130
I can just call you over again.

745
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:12,470
Can't you just please send me to a regional office then?

746
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:17,110
My father is ill so I don't know when he may pass.

747
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:21,290
Okay, then think about it and tell me where you want to go.

748
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,880
(TN: Gambling Hall)

749
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,700
Nice!

750
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,190
Gosh.

751
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,390
- Fifty! 
 -  "Fifty"?

752
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:39,090
- No way! 
 - Gosh.

753
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,770
Be careful around here.

754
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,560
- Wolf! 
 - Oh!

755
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,350
You're here, Hyungnim?

756
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:49,130
Oh, you're here?

757
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,530
Yes, I'm here, Hyungnim.

758
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,530
Wow, it's not even the weekend today.

759
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:55,960
Looks like you'll get some money in today.

760
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,540
Since when did gamblers care about day, night, weekend and weekday?

761
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,490
Nowadays, more people come on weekdays, saying it's too crowded on weekends.

762
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,610
That's 100.

763
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:06,380
Oh, okay.

764
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,450
Aigoo.

765
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,120
Thanks for the work, Hyungnim.

766
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,540
Gil Su, how is Young Pil's place doing?

767
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,460
It's more or less the same as this place.

768
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,840
But you're still the one who makes more.

769
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,660
That wretched b*stard might be stealing money here and there.

770
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,700
Make sure to keep him in check. He's the lowest of the lows, all right?

771
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,680
I'm double-and-triple-checking him.

772
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,500
All right then.

773
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,600
- I'll be going, Hyungnim. 
 - Okay, take care.

774
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,850
Right, Gil Su!

775
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,470
Tell Doo Hak to visit sometime

776
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,780
for soju and intestine soup.

777
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,450
- I'll tell him that, Hyungnim. 
 - Yes, take care.

778
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,830
- This is for the tip. 
 - Gosh, that thug. Take it!

779
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,110
Hello.

780
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,050
Hyungnims!

781
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,270
He came in an hour ago.

782
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,630
Hyungnim. It's this room.

783
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,520
Hey, Lee Yong Deuk.

784
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,870
Yong Deuk!

785
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,340
Get yourself together.

786
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,810
This punk is drugged to the brains.

787
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,540
Hey!

788
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,000
Are you awake?

789
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:40,830
- Who are you? 
 - Can't you tell at first glance?

790
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,550
It's the Grim Reaper.

791
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,810
I see...

792
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,600
I didn't do anything wrong, though.

793
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,610
Why did you go in and out of prison that much if you never did anything wrong?

794
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:55,900
You killed a person four years ago, by a hit-and-run, didn't you?

795
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,900
Who ordered the hit-and-run?

796
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,190
I didn't kill anyone.

797
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,020
I don't know.

798
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,570
- Come clean, you b*stard. 
 - I really don't know.

799
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,030
I really don't know anything.

800
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:11,540
You b*stard, do you want to get buried in the mountains?

801
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,520
Listen carefully, Lee Yong Deuk.

802
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,040
I can kill you at any given moment.

803
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,090
Kill me.

804
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,480
No.

805
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:31,170
You'll die soon even if I don't kill you. But... if you come clean about everything,

806
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,850
I'll give you money to buy drugs you love.

807
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,330
Please give it to me.

808
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,170
You have to talk first.

809
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:46,790
I know you won't give me anything even after I talk!

810
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,430
You b*stard!

811
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:50,310
Sh*t.

812
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,720
Thank you.

813
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,950
Th-Thank you.

814
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:59,130
Drug prices rose lately so you'll only last a few days with that.

815
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,560
I have one more bundle here.

816
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:05,610
Tell the truth.

817
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,330
Who ordered the hit-and-run?

818
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,930
Y-You see...

819
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:18,960
Well, you see...

820
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:32,680
That's enough. You've had enough.

821
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:38,380
Just let me drink in peace today!

822
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:41,710
It's because I'm sorry.

823
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,340
I feel sorry for my father.

824
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,260

825
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,990

826
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:26,640
Hello, this is Rich Real Estate.

827
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,540
 Are you President Go Poong Ho?

828
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,800
Yes, it is.

829
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,850
There's a decent property.

830
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:37,080
Do you want to pluck some eyeballs with me?

831
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:42,720
What bullshit are you spewing?I don't know anything like that!

832
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,330
Oh, come on. I called, knowing everything.

833
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:48,930
 Who are you, Rascal?

834
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,690
I'm going to pluck your eyeballs out.

835
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,880
Why don't you come and try?

836
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,040
Where the heck are you? What?

837
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,780
Public phone?

838
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:00,900
This little...

839
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:04,360
You're dead now.

840
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,790
Aigoo, d*mn!

841
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:23,240
Are you the one who wants his eyeballs plucked?

842
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,710
Let's talk after I finish this ramen.

843
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,680
How can you eat ramen right now, you a**hole?

844
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,240
I'll pluck your eyeballs out.

845
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:34,990
Oh my gosh!

846
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:36,820
Who is this?

847
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,590
A-Am I looking at a ghost?

848
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,940
Are there ghosts who eat ramen?

849
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,540
- Doo Hak! 
 - Hyungnim!

850
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,130
Oh, shoot! Doo Hak!

851
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,530
My goodness!

852
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:50,600
Oh, gosh! Doo Hak, you were alive!

853
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,680
- You're in good health, right? 
 - Of course, I am.

854
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,470
Hold on. Let me get a look at you.

855
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,160
Gosh, you became handsome.

856
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,400
- My goodness, seriously. 
 - You look good!

857
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,900
What? So you're telling me to identify all of Choi Cheol Woong's real estate?

858
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,220
- Yes. 
 - What are you planning?

859
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,620
Will you really pluck his eyeballs out?

860
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,920
Don't you even dare.

861
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,320
You've got to look before you leap.

862
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,330
I know, too.

863
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:19,080
Just identify them for now.

864
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,990
Then I'll need to gather the team again.

865
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:28,960
All right. Let's go. You should go and greet your mother.

866
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,690
Your mother is going to die of shock!

867
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:34,220
My goodness.

868
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,240
I still have things to take care of.

869
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,500
Please keep it a secret for now.

870
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,590
But she is still your mom.

871
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,160
I'm sure you can keep it a secret.

872
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,100
But my mother couldn't hide the fact that I'm alive.

873
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:53,650
I have to remain... a dead person to those people.

874
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:57,940
My goodness, this is really f***ed up.

875
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,760
My, what a nice car.

876
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,400
What's that?

877
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,480
Oh, shoot.

878
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,950
Okay. Sure, yes—

879
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,300
Oh my, Madam! What brings you all the way here?

880
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,780
I told you not to meet my Cheol Woong, didn't I?

881
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,920
I think I also paid you the price.

882
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,320
Wait, Madam, that's not it.

883
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,590
Th-They came to me and asked to eat.

884
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:49,580
Even if they come, you should avoid them.

885
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,530
This is the last warning.

886
00:54:54,290 --> 00:55:00,780
If you meet Cheol Woong again, you'd better be prepared to lose everything.

887
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:07,790
You know I'm capable of doing that, right?

888
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,250
My goodness. Are you okay?

889
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,200
You're coming now?

890
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,830
That woman is Choi Cheol Woong's mother, right?

891
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:48,210
Her son gets his wicked personality from his mother, doesn't he?

892
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,850
He doesn't!

893
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:52,080
Cheol Woong isn't wicked.

894
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,600
What do you mean, he isn't wicked?

895
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,130
Choi Cheol Woong, who harasses Doo Hak, and

896
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:01,180
his mother, who harasses you, have the same feathers.

897
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:04,550
Since he knows all of this, Doo Hak is going to—

898
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:08,920
S-Sorry?

899
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,570
I mean... I'm sure the pain-relieving patch is here somewhere.

900
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,680
Hello, this is Young Generation Film Studio.

901
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,330
Oh, yes. That's right. We have a long wait-list.

902
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,890
- "City on Fire" (1987 movie)? 
 - Just a moment.

903
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:25,760
Yes, Donald Chow (Chow Yun-fat) is the main actor.

904
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,960
Yes, hello?

905
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,740
Yes, yes. This is the Young Generation.

906
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,530
Yes, Donald Chow is the main actor.

907
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:31,820
That's set for next week.

908
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,310
All right. Thank you.

909
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:34,990
Sorry to make you wait.

910
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:36,670
I'm glad you're here! Come over here. Hurry, hurry.

911
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:37,590
Yes, yes, yes.

912
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,730
Where do I put them?

913
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,100
Oh, yes. That's correct.

914
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,930
Yes, I'm checking right now—

915
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,880
- Hey, can you answer this? 
 - Wh-What do I say?

916
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,540
Say it's the Young Generation! Hurry.

917
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,760
Yes, this is the Young Generation Film Studio.

918
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,720

 I found him.

960
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:12,500
 The hit-and-run driver?

961
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,510
 No. The one who hired him to kill my father.

962
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:16,590
 It seems a report from a businessman in Busan.

963
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,490
 Shall I inform them?

964
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:21,730
 The murder case that changed my life in Yeosu...

965
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:23,500
 Did you all agree to join in the revenge?

966
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,450
 But stop it. Things won't return to how they were anyway.

967
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:27,650
 Are you worried about Cheol Woong?

968
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:32,270
 Everyone has a Pandora's Box in his heart that no one should open.

969
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:35,800
 You killed a crucial witness to that, via the closest person to you.

970
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,220
 Stop speaking nonsense!

971
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,420
 I guess this is it, right?

972
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,860
 - I'm— 
 - Don't be like that.

973
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,420
 - Auntie! 
 - Why are you so surprised?

974
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:44,060
 I thought you had cut ties with me.

975
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,210
 Oh Man Ok? That b*stard carries a gun around.

976
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:48,030
 My, look whom I have here.

977
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:51,120
 I wonder how it feels to die by your own gun.

978
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:56,500
