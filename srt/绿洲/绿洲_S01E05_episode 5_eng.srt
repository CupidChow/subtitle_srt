1
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,870

2
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,900

3
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,800
Aigoo, it seems that our Doo Hak is hungry.

4
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,600
Okay, okay. Shall I give you some milk?

5
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,300
I'm going out to the elder's fields to pull out some weeds.

6
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,350
Plant all the seeds and head home first, okay?

7
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,040
Gosh, are you telling me to do the entire barley field by myself?

8
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,290
While I'm also caring for the baby?

9
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,870
That's too much!

10
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,180
We're not slaves from the Joseon era!

11
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,270
What, will he set up a commemorative monument for you?

12
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,660
Gosh! What do you know?

13
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,140
What don't I know?

14
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,030
How could someone who knows talk like that?

15
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,360
I know we should be grateful, and I am.

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,480
I'm saying this because you're too excessive!

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,710
You do all of their farming for them.

18
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,300
Not only that, but you offer all our crops to them as well!

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,940
Even other former slaves don't do that!

20
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,140
I say, why are you the only one who acts like that, as if you're a fool?

21
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,600
I should do this since nobody else does!

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,130
Those others don't even know to be grateful!

23
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,600
Even if the world has changed, people should still do what is right.

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,870
Aigoo, since you're so good at doing what is right,

25
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,620
we won't need Confucius or Mencius.

26
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,490
- Gosh, that wife of mine... 
 - Hurry up and leave.

27
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,550
Whether I croak or not, just go and do what is right.

28
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,860
It appears I'm pregnant with another child.

29
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,950
I haven't had my period for the past three months.

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,990
I'll finish planting the seeds here after I return

31
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,870
so go home and rest.

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,790
Aigoo, Doo Hak...

33
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,590
Although I said I'm pregnant with your younger sibling,

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,040
your father is so indifferent like that.

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,340
You must never become like your father, okay?

36
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,150
Mom.

37
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,010
Hey, come on! Go a bit slower!

38
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,020
At this rate, I might die first like this!

39
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,550
Oh, gosh!

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,820
Stop...

41
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,010
Aigoo, stop...

42
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,410
We should rush him to a big hospital in Gwangju.

43
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,380
Could you call an ambulance?

44
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,560
- Yes, I will call them. 
 - No, it's all right.

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,750
- Father. 
 - Father...

46
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:28,520
Accompany the doctor home... and tell Doo Hak's father to come in.

47
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,870
Elder...

48
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,600
I'm not just telling you to hand the baby over as an adopted heir.

49
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,910
Only if your second child is a son...

50
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,610
My son's wife can't bear children.

51
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:01,440
Since I committed many sins, I don't care much about receiving food for my ancestral memorial services,

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,470
but I would be ashamed to meet my ancestors.

53
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,930
It's my request to you...

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,610
Elder, still... how could you take in someone of such a lowly bloodline?

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,550
Young Shik.

56
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,800
Hyungnim.

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,760
- I beg you. 
 - Aigoo.

58
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,750
But on one condition.

59
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,410
If we do this, that child will be my own,

60
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,630
the child that I gave birth to.

61
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,090
I understand.

62
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:59,330
We will take this... to the grave.

63
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,210
Elder...

64
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,440
Thank you.

65
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,860
Why are you crying?

66
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,750
It's because I'm so sad!

67
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:32,850
How does it make sense they will steal our child who isn't even born yet as their adopted heir?

68
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,740
That's only if it's a son.

69
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,260
Also, why call it "steal"?

70
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,250
This is our receiving grace!

71
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,930
Gosh! They say they will take away our child so how the heck is this grace?

72
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,200
Think about it.

73
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,950
In this famine when it's hard to feed just one mouth,

74
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,720
shouldn't we be grateful they are reducing one less mouth for us to feed?

75
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,080
Also, if our child grows up well in such a prestigious family,

76
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,810
wouldn't that be good to see?

77
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,230
Will our child even know whom we are?

78
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,460
Gosh, what does it matter whether he knows or not?

79
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,720
We would know, and Heaven and Earth would know.

80
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,320
A child is only yours when you give birth and hold him.

81
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,220
He will think of those who raised him as his parents.

82
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,900
It's no use to us, even if he becomes a judge or prosecutor.

83
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:30,280
If our child... is a son... then just consider he's a blessed child.

84
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,760
 Why do you think I got married so quickly

85
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,480
 after we broke up, Oppa?

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,710
We have another headache of a case in the Guro Industrial Complex.

87
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,230
I'll take care of it like last time.

88
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,510
Instead of getting in the way, just follow your hyungnim.

89
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,270
Or stay in the car.

90
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,970

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,770

92
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,490
Hello.

93
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,030
- Doo Hak. Young Pil. 
 - Yes, Hyungnim.

94
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,110
This guy is the problem.

95
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,360
After leaving a good university and getting employed under cover,

96
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,030
he gathers naive workers together and brings down the companies.

97
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,420
This rat is definitely in this factory.

98
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,140
We have to catch him, okay?

99
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,290
 Oppa, I ended up working at a factory in Seoul.

100
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,760
 It's Bangil Industrial Company in Guro-dong,

101
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,140
 where they make zippers and razors.

102
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,360
Then the police can just arrest him, can't they?

103
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,340
This is a place where the company shut down first as soon as the labor union was formed.

104
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,660
We don't have any justification for arresting the workers.

105
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,760
But we need to catch this rat in order to quiet them down.

106
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,890
You understand, right?

107
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,870
I understand.

108
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,160
You guys understood, right?

109
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,190
Yes, Hyungnim.

110
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,590
I told you to follow me.

111
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,520
Go catch him!

112
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,260
You b*stard!

113
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,510
Hey, you b*stard!

114
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,910
What are you doing?

115
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,250
Hyungnim, are you okay?

116
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,010
Hyungnim!

117
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,630
Let's go without a fuss.

118
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,220
Oppa!

119
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,640
Oppa! Please don't do this!

120
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,330
Stop it!

121
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,110
Moon Dong Soo!

122
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,130
I told you to move over there!

123
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,950
Sh*t!

124
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,790
Really stop this!

125
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,500

126
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,330
Darn.

127
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,930

128
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,600
Teacher, Teacher!

129
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,920
- Jung Ok, Jung Ok! 
 - Let go of me!

130
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,450
Take me in, too!

131
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,080
Arrest me, too!

132
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,530
- Stay still. 
 - Let go!

133
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,200
Hey!

134
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,270
Let's go.

135
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,530
Watch your family members.

136
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,220
And give this to Boss Yeom.

137
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,100
It was hard getting you out.

138
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,930
So just go home and stay there quietly.

139
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,810
I'm so grateful that I don't know what to do,

140
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,580
enjoying benefits of having a gangster oppa.

141
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,140
- Hey! 
 - Oppa, do you even know what you're doing?

142
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,410
You are acting like the dogs

143
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,240
of inhumane, evil CEO b*stards!

144
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,890
- Where are you going? 
 - Let go.

145
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,560
I will be with my guys.

146
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,040
Your guys,

147
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,990
who attend night school and go on protests?

148
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,560
Are they more important than your family?

149
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,570
They are also my family and comrades!

150
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,020
"Comrades"?

151
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,620
You became a full commie now, have you?

152
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,730
If you go to the police station right now, you may go straight to prison!

153
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,610
If I have to, then I will!

154
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,870
Only people who actually committed a crime are scared of prison.

155
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,320
I'm not scared.

156
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,700
Why?

157
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,920
Because I did this so we can live like human beings!

158
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,580
You!

159
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,770
Why do you live like this, Oppa?

160
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,810
Oppa, you weren't like this before.

161
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,190
Aren't you ashamed to look at the sky?

162
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,750
I haven't looked at the sky for a long time.

163
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,680
Also, the sky doesn't look at someone like me.

164
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,100
Doo Hak.

165
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,780
Doo Hak!

166
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,990
Oh my... Oh my! Oh my!

167
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,480
Jung Ok...

168
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,070
Go inside. Nothing good will come of Mom and Dad finding out.

169
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,810
What do you mean, nothing good will come of us knowing?

170
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,900
Mom, make sure Jung Ok doesn't leave and stays home.

171
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,630
Ensure she doesn't go to work either.

172
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,470
- Her work? 
 - The factory will close for now

173
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,390
so just feed her well and let her get some sleep.

174
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,250
Did you cause trouble?

175
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,490
If anyone caused trouble, it was Oppa!

176
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,150
The son whom Mom and Dad bragged about

177
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,990
is now a strikebreaker gangster!

178
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,920
Wh-What is she talking about?

179
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,970
Mom,

180
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,930
don't send Jung Ok to that factory anymore.

181
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,530
Just have her study and go to college!

182
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,000
I will pay for her tuition.

183
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,760
I came to give you this.

184
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,260
Take...

185
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,280
Take this back with you.

186
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,920
I told you to take this back with you!

187
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,840
Gosh, why are you doing this when he was just thinking of his parents?

188
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,000
You... What have you been doing these days?

189
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,820
You heard from Jung Ok just now.

190
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,080
I am a gangster.

191
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,220
You b*stard!

192
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,330
Doo Hak's father! Doo Hak's father!

193
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,360
Why?

194
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,700
Just hit me like you always did.

195
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,230
This is all because of you, Father.

196
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,280
Doo Hak. Doo Hak...

197
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,730
Still, you shouldn't live like this.

198
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,480
Wh-What do you mean, a gangster?

199
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,160
You're such a good person!

200
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,800
Mom, you don't know anything!

201
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,890
Wh-What don't I know?

202
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,000
What could an ex-convict,

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,570
who has nothing and lacks education, do for a living?

204
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,320
What, should I go down to my hometown and farm?

205
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,300
Do we even have land to farm in the first place?

206
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,780
Father, why don't you say something?

207
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,260
Father, all went according to your will.

208
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,560
You said not to study so I stopped studying!

209
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,510
You told me to go to prison so I went to prison!

210
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,700
After doing as you said,

211
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,700
all I could do was become a gangster.

212
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,990
If you say not to do this as well,

213
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,590
then should I just die?

214
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,740
Please say something!

215
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,050
Doo Hak...

216
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,780
Doo Hak...

217
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,440
I am most likely...

218
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,590
not your son, Father.

219
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,800

220
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,530
This is the Supreme Prosecutor's office.

221
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,240
Trainees, please follow me.

222
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,260
I told you it's Choi Cheol Woong.

223
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,250
He was the mole.

224
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,210
Let's go up.

225
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,280
Congratulations.

226
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,260
It's been a while.

227
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,790
How are you here?

228
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,840
What do you mean, "how"?

229
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,180
We are part of the same workplace family.

230
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,670
Here.

231
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,430

232
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,500
I was dispatched here by the National Security Agency.

233
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,990
I believe you will

234
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,020
provide me with much assistance as before.

235
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,430
Then let's have some soju together soon.

236
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,860
Don't fool yourself.

237
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,800
I'm... I'm not your puppet anymore. I'm...

238
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,040
a prosecutor of South Korea, Choi Cheol Woong.

239
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are you being like this?

240
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,300
You're not one yet.

241
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,730
If you bother me one more time,

242
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,320
I will...

243
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,850
chew you up, down to your bones!

244
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,140
Do you want to become a prosecutor?

245
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,910
But too bad.

246
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,010
In our National Security files,

247
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,100
we have our future prosecutor's records.

248
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,240
We let you be discharged from the military early so you could work for the government,

249
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,390
but you did nothing to cooperate.

250
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,110
But still, attorneys make

251
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,760
much, much more money.

252
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
You threaten me right now, right?

253
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,840
Of course not.

254
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,250
I am just letting you know reality.

255
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,610
Your grades are important, but your leanings are also important.

256
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,930
Well, that doesn't mean there is no solution.

257
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,910
These prosecutors lack information

258
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,700
about the National Student Union (leading protests).

259
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,350
It's because we held that information tightly and hid it from them.

260
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,190
So I came today to give you that file,

261
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,360
but since you already know the contents,

262
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,390
if you do the briefing in my place,

263
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:49,280
no one will be suspicious of your leanings.

264
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,910
So–

265
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,260
Gosh.

266
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,340
Are you telling me to sell out my friends again?

267
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,540
That's what you mean, right?

268
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,210
You can't say that's selling anyone out.

269
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,100
If you present it or I do, there's no difference.

270
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,360
However, if you step up in my place,

271
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,970
you can just do the work you want to do.

272
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,210

273
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,580
Then...

274
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,460
you can just do the briefing yourself.

275
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,380
Why in the world are you doing this to me then?

276
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:47,740
I also don't really know, you unfaithful mole b*stard.

277
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,640
Listen carefully.

278
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,600
This is your last test and opportunity.

279
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,150
Instead of living in the middle gray area like a bat, make your colors clear.

280
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,100
Either become our family or our foe.

281
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,830
If it were up to me,

282
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,990
I wouldn't want to use you again.

283
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,820
I don't understand why my boss is showing you this act of grace.

284
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,040
When you get to meet him one day,

285
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,720
you will have to bow down to him countlessly.

286
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,440
I will wait for you before the large conference room.

287
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,920
If you don't come in the next five minutes,

288
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,750
I will take it you chose not to be family.

289
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,700
Apart from places where Star Entertainment and Han River Film Distributor already distribute,

290
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,040
theaters using ticket revenue sharing rates have come into our hands, the Central Distributor.

291
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,360
But won't this come at a loss for us?

292
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,820
There are theaters where we are losing profit.

293
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,660
But when you consider the big picture,

294
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,130
it definitely won't be a loss for us since there are so many theaters.

295
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,300
Gosh, Girl.

296
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,710
You're quite ambitious.

297
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:55,150
But as you've expanded our business scale so much,

298
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,350
I'm running low on ammunition.

299
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,360
If you rush, you can get indigestion

300
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,540
so slow down a bit, okay?

301
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,840
I know it's difficult for you, Boss.

302
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,570
Still, please endure it a bit longer.

303
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,860
Hey.

304
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,640
Gosh. I'm so jealous.

305
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,450
Director Go.

306
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,550
If you did as much as Jung Shin does, what wouldn't I do for you?

307
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,400
What is this?

308
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,680
The Certificate of Registration for Namhae Theater.

309
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,250
Excuse me?

310
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,740

311
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,640
Boss!

312
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,100
Gosh, your aunt had sold it

313
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,970
so it was really hard to get it back.

314
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,810
Thank you so much!

315
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,190
Our boss is the best!

316
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,900
Gosh, seriously! I'm so jealous.

317
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,800
Gosh, seriously. That's gross.

318
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,750

319
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,250
Thank you so much, Boss!

320
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,430
 I'll call you!

321
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,450
 All right, shall we go?

322
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,570
Oh, yes. Here you go.

323
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,240
I'm sorry we keep being indebted to you.

324
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,220
What do you mean by debt? It's investment.

325
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,740
I'm happy to see your business expand.

326
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,610
- You should check it. 
 - Thank you, Mr. Kim.

327
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,970
Thank you also for the Namhae Theater.

328
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,690
My girl was falling over with joy!

329
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,050
I'm glad that she was happy.

330
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,040
The National Student Union core is

331
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,380
the Three Min Protest Committee.

332
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,270
"Three Min Protest Committee"?

333
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,430
The Three Min Protest Committee

334
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:49,100
is the real key driving force and at the forefront of National Student Union.

335
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,810
They are headed in a much more radical direction,

336
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,830
and in the future...

337
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:00,740
there is a possibility they will engage in sudden violent protests.

338
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,580
As such, rather than target National Student Union's leadership,

339
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,350
more importantly, Three Min Protest Committee's leaders:

340
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,160
Kwon Dong Hwi,

341
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,830
Choi Sang Won,

342
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,300
- and Park Deuk Yeon... 
 -  Choi Cheol Woong!

343
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,500
 Let's not live in shame.

344
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,600
 If I were really a mole,

345
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,450
 Hyung and all of you, too,

346
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,690
 you guys wouldn't be here now.

347
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,790

348
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,410

349
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,920
Where is he going in the middle of the presentation?

350
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,600
What is he doing?

351
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,360
I'm sorry.

352
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,850
Don't be nervous.

353
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,390
A young man who is willing to devote himself to serving his country

354
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,150
shouldn't lose his spirit.

355
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,210
I'll see you next time.

356
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,650
They say it's hard to wash clean the red color of commies.

357
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,620
I don't know how your younger sister got involved.

358
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,000
Well,

359
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,360
I heard this from my friend, whose younger sister worked at a textile factory,

360
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,260
but there aren't really any commies.

361
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,080
Supposedly, most of the workers rebel

362
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,450
because factory bosses mistreat them so badly.

363
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,070
So...

364
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:07,990
your younger sister is most likely a similar case, not a commie.

365
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,080
Don't worry about it too much, Hyungnim!

366
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,210
What do you know to be chatty?

367
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,700
You didn't even graduate middle school!

368
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,600
Why are you suddenly bringing up my education?

369
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,810
Did I not graduate middle school since I didn't want to?

370
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:24,940
I told you we couldn't afford monthly payments so I let my younger siblings go instead of me.

371
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,480
Then why didn't you take the GED in prison?

372
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,360
You didn't have to pay monthly payments for it there.

373
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,950
It wasn't a good studying environment!

374
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,160
To study, I need other studious people around me.

375
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,860
But people around me were frauds, thieves,

376
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,190
and gigolos; how could I study, you b*stard?

377
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,800
Geez, punk!

378
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,000
Then did Doo Hak pass the GED on top, by studying with students?

379
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,380
Aigoo, say things that make sense!

380
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,580
Gosh, stop hitting me!

381
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,190
Geez.

382
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,630
Oh, he's here.

383
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,220
You're here?

384
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,400
Come on. How did it go?

385
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,210
I feel Young Pil is finally starting to make his move.

386
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,320
- "Young Pil"? 
 - He's quite late.

387
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,610
When do you think that will be?

388
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,720
After Young Pil completed that Guro Industrial Complex job with you,

389
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,780
he met with Director Park of Yeonhap Liquors.

390
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,690
It appears Director Park is making fake transaction documents to falsely accuse you.

391
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,550
I think it will occur in less than a week.

392
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,590
That's good.

393
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,420
Starting today, keep on guard, protecting Doo Hak.

394
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,310
You don't know when Young Pil might attack.

395
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,060
- Yes, Hyungnim. 
 - Got it.

396
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,540
I said I'd buy you a nice dinner, yet you just had to call me here for lunch.

397
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,970
What is this?

398
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,500
Geez.

399
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,730
I'm sorry. I was a bit hungry.

400
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,010
So how's "love"?

401
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,300
What?

402
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,230
I asked how's business.

403
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,090
Hey, Choi Cheol Woong.

404
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,520
What do you really want to say to me?

405
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,760
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

406
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,030
Yes.

407
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,500
How did you know?

408
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,460
Do you read people's minds?

409
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,300
Do you know when I feel happiest in the morning?

410
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,100
The morning I wake dreaming about you.

411
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,180
When I wake up, I do feel a bit empty,

412
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,540
but I do feel

413
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,430
quite happy.

414
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,580
I'm sorry. This is a bit abrupt, right?

415
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,790
You're also having a hard time, aren't you?

416
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,390
I also had a time when I really struggled.

417
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:04,810
Seeing you now, I think I was just like you back then.

418
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:10,030
Now I think about it, Doo Hak was in a similar situation as you when I last saw him.

419
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,690
But I said only mean things to him.

420
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,100
You can't handle me.

421
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,720
I will make you suffer even more.

422
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,180
Let's just see each other comfortably as friends.

423
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,770
I'll be going.

424
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,290
Is that the only reason?

425
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,450

426
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,600
Apart from the reason for not being able to handle you,

427
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,000
have you no other sound reasons?

428
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,030
Hyung Doo Hak is okay,

429
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,950
but not me?

430
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:55,150
I'll set up another date so treat me to drinks next time.

431
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,080
She didn't eat at all...

432
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,660
This is the principal and the interest.

433
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,020
I put in a bit more than required.

434
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,090
Oh, you didn't need to do that.

435
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,210
Thanks to you, we succeeded

436
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,040
so I wouldn't be human if I acted like nothing happened.

437
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,430
I'm Cha Geum Ok.

438
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,340
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

439
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,100
But...

440
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,600
when will you introduce me to the CEO, who resides in Japan?

441
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:37,050
I really need to greet him sometime.

442
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,100
It so happens he will come to South Korea soon.

443
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,200
I'll make sure to inform him.

444
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,080
What happened? Weren't you meeting Cheol Woong today?

445
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:54,280
Oh my. Hey, what's up? Is something wrong?

446
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,040
It's just because I'm ugly and so mean.

447
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,470
Hey, who the f*** said that? Who is it?

448
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,430
I'll dice his mouth up.

449
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,080
Yang Ja...

450
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,910
If you had to choose between a guy who has an abnormal job and

451
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,160
one who has a normal job, whom would you choose?

452
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,050
It's the normal one, of course.

453
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,810
Right?

454
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,200
But what if you keep worrying about the abnormal one?

455
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,080
You're also abnormal,

456
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,200
a nutcase (fool).

457
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,040
Right?

458
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,050
Did you meet Cheol Woong?

459
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:37,750
But who is the abnormal one?

460
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,020
Who is it?

461
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,230
There is one, a very unfortunate guy.

462
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,540
Hey, listen carefully.

463
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,970
The normal one is your destiny, and

464
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:55,090
the abnormal one is your ill fate. However,

465
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,490
people tend to always confuse the ill fate

466
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,050
as their destiny and regret later.

467
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:06,740
Though I don't know who it is, please restrain yourself. Okay?

468
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,510
Just don't do it.

469
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,220
Hey.

470
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,110
You need music when you're drinking.

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,200
 I wish I could take the GED every month.

480
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,220
 So you can feast every time after coming in first place in the country?

481
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,110
 No.

482
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,160

494
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,610
My, my. Your singing is great.

495
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,870
Ms. Oh?

496
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,470
Who are you guys?

497
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,720
Who the f***  sent you punks?

498
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,130

499
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,700
Yes!

500
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,300
Yes, speaking.

501
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,550
 Auntie, we're in serious trouble here.

502
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,080
Jung Shin has...

503
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,600
Jung Shin has been kidnapped, I said.

504
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,640
What do you mean?

505
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,240
Some thug-looking a**holes took Jung Shin.

506
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,570
Okay. I'll be right there so wait for me.

507
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,740
Director Go, quickly get the car ready.

508
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,250
We must go to the Seoul office.

509
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,740
- What? 
 - Is something wrong?

510
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,450
I got a little problem at the office.

511
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,670
So let's eat together next time.

512
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,830
Yes, it's me.

513
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:24,410
I think something happened at Jung Shin's office.

514
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,700
- What's this? What happened here? 
 - Auntie...

515
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:35,530
Gosh, President Cha, let's call the police first.

516
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:40,030
Auntie, Jung Shin doesn't have any debts or men problems.

517
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,660
Auntie, is there anything you know?

518
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,210
What's the meaning of this?

519
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,040
Gosh, I can't think straight.

520
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,820
Stay quiet a second, Girl.

521
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,260
P-President Kim?

522
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,390
I followed you because I'm worried.

523
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,300
What happened here, exactly?

524
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,380
A-Apparently, some unknown assailants barged in

525
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,810
and kidnapped our branch manager away!

526
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,220
Is there anyone you suspect?

527
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,390
They'll call us.

528
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,120
Hello.

529
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,110
 Yes, President Cha.

530
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,710
This is Mr. Byun from Star Entertainment.

531
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,600
I just got a call earlier.

532
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,120
My men said they made a mistake.

533
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,990
They said they are about to lose their jobs

534
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,190
so they won't leave Ms. Oh alone.

535
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,710
Oh, I see.

536
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:09,600
I guessed it was you, President Byun.

537
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,390
I knew it! That b*stard.

538
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,070
However...

539
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:18,980
I thought you were a businessman, but now I see you're just an old bully.

540
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,530
Stop stalling like a coward and tell me straight.

541
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,350
So what the heck do you want?

542
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,420
Aigoo.

543
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,770
I love how you're way too straightforward, President Cha.

544
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,100
Forget it.

545
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,470
The theaters I used to distribute to...

546
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,480
Put them back to how they used to be and withdraw.

547
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,120
"Withdraw"?

548
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,290
Are you telling me to withdraw from my bank account?

549
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,880
Bank—

550
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,470
Hey, hold her down properly!

551
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,280
Hey, now, President Cha!

552
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,110
I'm not joking. Okay?

553
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,020
 My men aren't educated

554
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,320
 so they don't know manners.

555
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,860
 I'm barely restraining them, but they can give you only two days, evidently.

556
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,980
If you don't bring

557
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,810
cancellation contracts for the Gyeonggang theaters...

558
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:21,040
I don't think... you'll ever see Ms. Oh again.

559
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,270
That's such a great idea.

560
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,770
I get you to do my dirty work for me.

561
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,880
 Do as you wish.

562
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,750
I do like Ms. Oh a lot.

563
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,760
But I am also quite... scared of that girl.

564
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,850
Honestly, she is indeed my right hand but not my daughter.

565
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,500
I get a little anxious, thinking what I will do if she

566
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,610
betrays and devours me, you see.

567
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,470
This is great.

568
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,760
I really mean this, President Byun.

569
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,330
I'll also seal my mouth shut.

570
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,670
So please get rid of her for me.

571
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:06,110
Just cement her in a drum can and throw it down a reservoir.

572
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,770
Thanks for your work.

573
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,170
Hello? Hello.

574
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,190
President Cha!

575
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,250
Hey, you, Cha Geum Ok!

576
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,270
That crazy bitch!

577
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,880
Darn it!

578
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,890
Oh, gosh!

579
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,160
Y-You're dead now.

580
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,380
Aigoo! What a fool!

581
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,800
Hey...

582
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,470
Ms. Oh.

583
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:40,690
Cha Geum Ok just... asked me to have you killed.

584
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,020
- Have you gone crazy? 
 - What?

585
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,450
Oh. There.

586
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:49,390
You're dead now, President Sh*t (same sound as Byun).

587
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,370
Sh*t? Why, you little—

588
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,240
You little!

589
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,620
Oh, this is crazy.

590
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:59,420
Hey... wrap up... wrap it up here and

591
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,630
g-get her in the car.

592
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,090
Fast... fast and wrap it up!

593
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,300
- You rotten b*stard! 
 - Whoa!

594
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,310
You crazy b*tch! You're dead, sh*t.

595
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,420
What?

596
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,130
Auntie, are you trying to kill Jung Shin right now?

597
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,370
If she lives or dies, that's her fate.

598
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:19,170
Also, people don't die that easily.

599
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,690
I'll call the police myself.

600
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,610
A-Auntie!

601
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,740
If we give in to them, we'll all die.

602
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,690
A desperate person is bound to negotiate.

603
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,570
So wait.

604
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,720
- Was she kidnapped? 
 - What do you want to do?

605
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,990
While we don't know when Young Pil will attack, we can't scatter our men around.

606
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,880
It's dangerous.

607
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,730
We don't even know whose men President Byun is using.

608
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:51,050
Send out all our men and locate Jung Shin first.

609
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,400
Doo Hak...

610
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,350
Don't worry.

611
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,720
Fifty million won in liquor and 30 million in beer,

612
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,820
I made it so he embezzled ₩80 million total ($165,000 in 1980's).

613
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,900
- What about the method? 
 - I charged the regular price

614
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,650
and laundered the difference in cash for him.

615
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,500
By the way, are we just throwing him around a bit

616
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,550
or getting rid of him for good?

617
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,170
Get rid of him.

618
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,530
Identify Doo Hak's location and

619
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,080
gather the guys.

620
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,780
 Yes, Hyungnim!

621
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,970

622
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,740
There are no clues about President Byun's location.

623
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,050
Let's have Gil Su's group keep looking and have Seon Woo's group retreat.

624
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,240
- Let them both be. 
 - Hey, you.

625
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,290
What if Young Pil strikes right now?

626
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,850
You think he'll let you live?

627
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,870
 Mom...

628
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,850
 Mom!

629
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,000
Aigoo.

630
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,860
Why?

631
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,340
 The chamber pot is full.

632
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,400
Wait a minute.

633
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:07,410
Aigoo, what's all this for?

634
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,820
It's not like this is a prison.

635
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,420
What about Dad?

636
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,960
I don't know. He must have gone to smoke after dinner.

637
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,060
Give me the pot.

638
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,860
Oh my! O-Oh my!

639
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,700
 You little wench! Stop right there!

640
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,970
Hello.

641
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,200
Yes, Mother.

642
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,010
What?

643
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,760
Your sister ran away from your mom's house.

644
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,560
What in the world?

645
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,910
Are you sure?

646
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,050
Are there really only four men?

647
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,080
Yes, there are four.

648
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,720
W-Wait, th-there are three.

649
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,510
Got it.

650
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,160
Get these guys armed and ready to leave now.

651
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,260
- And call Director Park. 
 - Yes, Hyungnim.

652
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,300
It's over for you, you a**hole.

653
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,990

654
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,930
Oh! My goodness.

655
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,870
Has Jung Ok come here, by any chance?

656
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:32,830
I-I haven't seen her after that day, either.

657
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,640
If Jung Ok comes here,

658
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,310
tell her to use this for transportation.

659
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:39,780
I'll tell her, but I'm not in night school or a union.

660
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,090
So would she come to me?

661
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:45,330
If she gets caught by the police again, no one can help her.

662
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,170
So tell her to hurry to the Seongnam home.

663
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,630
I'm counting on you, Gil Ja.

664
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:11,150
What's that?

665
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,340
Go, go, go! Get him!

666
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,850
Whom have we here?

667
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,910
It's Doo Hak, one of our family.

668
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,930
Gosh, I wondered who the f*** almost got us in an accident.

669
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:44,010
Did you eat? Do you want to join us at our company dinner?

670
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,930
Move your car aside.

671
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:49,850
- If the police see, you'll get a ticket. 
 - "A ticket"?

672
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,850
I'll just get one then.

673
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,520
And get you while I'm at it,

674
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,140
away from my family, that is.

675
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:59,330
If Hyungnim finds out, it won't be fun for you, either.

676
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:04,940
No, he'll be very entertained.

677
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,230
Is it because I banned you from eating soup and rice at the hotel?

678
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,510
I apologize, but

679
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:14,980
eat soup and rice at the soup and rice place, you scum.

680
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,200
Gosh, this son of a b*tch...

681
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,940
Get out!

682
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:40,240
You—

683
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,000
Sh*t...

684
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,760
Now!

685
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,420
You're dead!

686
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,690
Hyungnim Doo Hak!

687
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:21,540
♫  Where did it all go wrong? I can't figure it out  ♫

688
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,410
♫  It's such a useless thing to say  ♫

689
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:36,330
♫  It's over already  ♫

690
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:51,350
♫  But I can't hide it, my longing for you erupts  ♫

691
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:58,430
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

692
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:05,900
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

693
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:13,170
♫  Above the rough sky, my heart floats away  ♫

694
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:19,410
♫  Only your name is engraved like this  ♫

695
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:20,990
Stand him up.

696
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,880
You called me a scum, right?

697
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,190
Is that what you think?

698
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:40,050
Then a great gangster will be killed by a scum today.

699
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:45,110
Don't ever meet another scum when you're in hell.

700
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:58,930
What's this?

701
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,280
This little b*stard, have you gone f***ing mad?

702
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:30,110
- Hey, hurry up and take him to the hospital. 
 - Yes.

703
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,340
Come.

704
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,170
Aigoo.

705
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,730
Come here, you stupid b*stard.

706
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,150
You f***ing...

707
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,350
What? Are you saying I came late?

708
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:51,250
You said your life must be at stake for it to be dramatic!

709
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,900
 Doo Hak, if we get ambushed, we'll all die.

710
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,080
 We must tell at least Seon Woo's group to return.

711
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,070
 Hey, Lee Doo Hak!

712
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:04,790
 Hyung. Let's change our plan.

713
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,280
 I'll take care of Young Pil.

714
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,530
 What? By yourself?

715
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,600
 Are you trying to get yourself killed?

716
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,420
 I'll take 2-3 men with me and go to Jung Ok right now.

717
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,580
 Young Pil's gang is focused on me.

718
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,610
 When will we ever get a better chance?

719
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:28,880
 Let's lure them in to ambush us, instead of waiting in ignorance?

720
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,490
 And I'll go to Hyungnim Gwang Tak.

721
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,100
 That's right.

722
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,180
 That's better than an all-out battle.

723
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:39,860
 Our guys won't be harmed, and we'll appeal to Hyungnim Gwang Tak's sympathy.

724
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,800
 What if it goes wrong?

725
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,750
 If you come late, that's on you.

726
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,240
 You crazy b*stard.

727
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,320
 Must you go this far?

728
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,220
 My life must be at stake for it to be dramatic.

729
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:53,730
What about the men who went to find Jung Shin? Nothing yet?

730
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:55,540
She's nowhere to be found.

731
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,550
What is that woman to you, exactly?

732
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,610
Why do you need to go this far?

733
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,380
Investing in the film studio's shares and Namhae Theater ownership.

734
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:07,400
Moreover, you're going all in finding that woman, aren't you?

735
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,540
I don't know, either.

736
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,610
I guess I must feel empty.

737
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:12,930
What a load of  bullsh*t.

738
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,420
If you feel empty, eat soup and rice like Young Pil.

739
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,070
Should I?

740
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,820
Then that a**hole must have felt empty, too.

741
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,210
Aigoo. Seriously.

742
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,340

743
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,310
Is this true?

744
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:44,730
How could I dare to lie in front of you?

745
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,390
I really didn't do it out of a personal grudge.

746
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:48,190
I swear, Hyungnim.

747
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:53,450
Even so, you try to kill him off for pocketing some money?

748
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,140
No, that's not all.

749
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:59,320
There was also a rumor the b*stard would take you out while building up his force.

750
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,530
That's why he bought his men favors with the pocketed money.

751
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:04,600
You know, don't you?

752
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:09,810
Lately, the men are more obedient to his orders than yours, Hyungnim.

753
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,830
Also, I was only going to break a leg or two.

754
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,130
Doo Hak, that a**hole...

755
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:26,150
That double-faced, bloody traitor.

756
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,930
Hyungnim!

757
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,230

758
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:41,810
I never heard...

759
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:47,970
Guan Yu and Zhang Fei stole money and backstabbed Liu Bei ("Romance of the Three Kingdoms").

760
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,460
Is this "Oath of the Peach Garden"?

761
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,790
I also never heard Liu Bei suspected his own brothers.

762
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,810
I'll bet my neck this ledger was fabricated.

763
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:03,330
Hey, you guys bet your necks, too.

764
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:06,040
This b*stard is asking to be killed.

765
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:08,720
We have a witness here.

766
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,540
Hey, Director Park.

767
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,620
Are you saying you laundered money for me?

768
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,560
Hyungnim, it's all over already.

769
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,090
Please admit it now.

770
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,910
Hyung.

771
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,600
Please come in!

772
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,190
My, my. Long time no see.

773
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:38,230
- What's this? 
 - Aren't they your partners? And

774
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:41,620
they're also the best counterfeit artists in Korea.

775
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:44,950
Hey, Young Pil, you know them as well, right?

776
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,590
All right, so what do you need us to examine?

777
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:51,000
It's a ledger of liquor transactions for the past two years.

778
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,810
They say there's proof I stole ₩80 million won in here.

779
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,350
So please confirm it.

780
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:59,300
Oh, my, 80 million won?

781
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,420
Hey, did you take kickbacks?

782
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:05,660
Aigoo. If you pocketed kickbacks, you need some sense beaten into you.

783
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:10,640
- Or if you framed someone, you need to be beaten to death. 
 - Yes.

784
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,450
Eyes, nose, and mouth for an eye, limbs for a  tooth,

785
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:17,350
this field's laws are quite strict.

786
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:20,710
Hey, how dare you come here?

787
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,060
Get lost right now.

788
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,980
Oh my. How scary.

789
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,560
Hey...

790
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,200
- should we leave? 
 - No.

791
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,410
Examine it.

792
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,500
Hyungnim, this is our family problem.

793
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,000
They're also my family. Continue.

794
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,490
- Soo Gong, take a good look, okay? 
 - Yes.

795
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,280
Take a seat and start.

796
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:59,920
This is just way too shabby.

797
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,950
They mismatched the papers' ages so the colors are way too different.

798
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:10,420
Also, they knifed some numbers out here. Even amateurs don't work like this!

799
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:15,700
This is why such work must be entrusted to pros like me.

800
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,770
- What do you mean? There's no way. 
 - Hey...

801
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:23,120
- Come closer and tell me more in detail. 
 - Oh, okay.

802
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,140
All right.

803
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,470
I'm so sorry, Chairman!

804
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,160
I was j-just

805
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,500
- ordered by Hyung Young Pil— 
 - You f***ing a**hole, cut the bullsh*t!

806
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,720
Hyungnim, one second—

807
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,050
A gangster, right?

808
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:47,240
A gangster fights it out one on one.

809
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,320
This is why they say...

810
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,870
that you're a scum, you piece of sh*t!

811
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:03,900
From now on, if I ever see you again, you'll get an after-death execution.

812
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,910
Do you understand?

813
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,710
- Get him out. 
 - Yes.

814
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:10,520
H-Hyungnim...

815
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,210
Come this way.

816
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,460
Let go!

817
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,470
Gosh, seriously!

818
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,810
Stop worrying if people are looking for her or not!

819
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:42,690
Things happen when doing business!

820
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:46,250
What a talkative woman you are! I'm hanging up!

821
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,950
Gosh! Seriously.

822
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:54,290
Hyungnim... it's almost time now.

823
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:56,450
She thinks I can't do it?

824
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,600
Gosh! Ouch!

825
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,470
Let me prove her wrong then.

826
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:03,220
Who does she think I am?

827
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,030
Thank you, Hyungnims.

828
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,350
And you, too, Noonim.

829
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,190
Gosh, what are you saying?

830
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,600
You're our boss, aren't you?

831
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,300
If the boss dies,

832
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,010
- we're all going down, too. 
 - He's right.

833
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,100
Wait, anyhow, you were really close this time.

834
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,530
Wait, let me—

835
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:27,440
So the thing is... the ledger seemed extremely real.

836
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,760
It must have been done by someone better than I am.

837
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,340
- What? 
 - After seeing that thing,

838
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,270
I had cold sweat running down my back.

839
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:39,330
- Aigoo. 
 - It's only because that guy called Director Park,

840
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:40,950
who gave in at the last second.

841
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,930
You were this close to death!

842
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:46,850
I thought I would die of a heart attack on the spot there.

843
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:53,440
Hey, we did this as we trust you, but we almost got thrashed ourselves!

844
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,330
Doo Hak...

845
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:59,210
We don't have several lives.

846
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:00,930
Let's not step on the gas (rush) too much, okay?

847
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:03,150
You're the one who said it.

848
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:06,150
You don't want to see any of us going down.

849
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,800
I'm sorry. I just felt rushed.

850
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,390
It's fine if you know it.

851
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:14,140
All right. Let's not interfere with Boss' business and

852
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:17,060
- let's leave now. Okay? 
 - Yes.

853
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,740
- We're... 
 -  Family!

854
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:23,790
Family!

855
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:25,450
We're going, okay? Be careful.

856
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:27,450
- Okay. 
 - My, long time no see!

857
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,000
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

858
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,230
Hey, we looked through all gangs in Seoul with all men we have,

859
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:38,280
but as she's still not found, they must be a rural gang.

860
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,330
It's not like we're a nationwide gang so it's out of our hands.

861
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:43,490
I asked a detective I know to look into this.

862
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:46,970
But President Byun doesn't even have any record. He's clean.

863
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:51,940
A person like him went into hiding?

864
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,880
And time isn't on our side.

865
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,150
If he intends to hide forever, even the police or the prosecution

866
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:58,920
couldn't find him that quickly.

867
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,460
That's the case, right?

868
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:04,180
However... when you watch movies, right?

869
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:07,320
Places like the CIA in the U.S.,

870
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:12,240
they just find the person in mere tens of minutes.

871
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,200
That's only in the movies, you punk.

872
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,820
They're all lies... lies.

873
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,060
Lies. Aigoo.

874
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,670
- Hey, Seon Woo. 
 - Yes.

875
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,780
- Get the car ready. 
 - Where are you going?

876
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,850
If we don't have the power, we borrow it.

877
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:27,990
H-How can you be telling me this now?

878
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:31,770
There's no time so just tell me if you can find her or not.

879
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:36,400
Hyung... I'm not a prosecutor yet, okay?

880
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,330
Just tell the police—

881
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,430
You should have called the police.

882
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:43,730
We must find her no matter what. There's no time.

883
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,900

884
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,180
By the way...

885
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:52,660
you said you don't like Jung Shin anymore,

886
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:56,170
but did you look after her all this time?

887
01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:01,190
That's because I do business with Jung Shin's boss.

888
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,740
I also found this out by chance, too.

889
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,340
If you help me, I think there might be a way.

890
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,190
What are you saying?

891
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:17,460
The one who tried to use you as a spy back then...

892
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,870
- from National Security Planning Agency. 
 - Sh*t!

893
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,300
How could you say that to me right now?

894
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,670
Don't you... know who they are to me?

895
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:30,630
The debt you owe me...

896
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,840
I'll count half of it as paid.

897
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,210
I need you to step up.

898
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,330
There's no other way.

899
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:41,610

900
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:45,460
♫  I want to hold your hand  ♫

901
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:48,950
♫  I want it to be like a birthday  ♫

902
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:57,010
♫  No matter you will be here, Forever Love, the only one  ♫

903
01:01:57,010 --> 01:02:01,510
♫  I want to look at your mind, hate me or nice  ♫

904
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:05,200
♫  Let me in your beautiful life  ♫

905
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,070
♫  Come over here  ♫

906
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,900

907
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:14,470
 Is it true that Choi Cheol Woong is really Choi Young Shik's son?

908
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:15,840
 What do you mean by that?

909
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,030
 I will set up my own independent company.

910
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:20,300
I knew that one day, she would try to eat me up.

911
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,040
 Don't ever pull this kind of joke again.

912
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,820
 No, I'm going to keep doing it.

913
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,780
 I'm going to keep competing with you

914
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,920
 and make Jung Shin my woman.

915
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,550
 He's a murderer, a killer!

916
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:32,200
 Hey! I'm not dating a murderer.

917
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,680
 Do you... pity me that much?

918
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,950
 Just quit everything and come to me instead.

919
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:40,190
 I'm saying I'll be by your side.

920
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:43,870
♫  In my life  ♫
