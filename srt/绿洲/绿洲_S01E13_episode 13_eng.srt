1
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,590

2
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:56,900

3
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,970
Where did my keys go?

4
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,250
Jung Shin.

5
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,680
Jung Shin!

6
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,840
I don't think I drank that much today.

7
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:52,240
♫  Somebody please tell me now; what am I supposed to do?  ♫

8
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,280
Who are you?

9
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,280
I said, "Who are you?"

10
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,650
It's me.

11
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:15,080
♫  Most beautiful, most cheer is full, Darling, it's all in your mind  ♫

12
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,390
♫  I'll really come back. They're hauling me back, a lot of men  ♫

13
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,800
I must really miss him.

14
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,850
This can't be real.

15
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:35,490
♫  For the rhythm, having you lost in your mind  ♫

16
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:44,910
♫  The sentiment to reason, the sadness, the dark and touch me  ♫

17
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,600
♫  Kill me softly  ♫

18
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,570
♫  Is there somebody?  ♫

19
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,790
♫  I don't want to breathe in  ♫

20
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:06,190
♫  But nobody knows, nobody knows  ♫

21
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,120
♫  Kill me softly  ♫

22
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,480
♫  Please do, somebody. Please save me now. I don't know what you're doing  ♫

23
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,080
No way.

24
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,040
♫  Out of the darkness, where we don't have to trust it  ♫

25
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,940
Are you really Doo Hak?

26
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,890
♫  Breathe in, nobody knows  ♫

27
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,400
Oh, Doo Hak.

28
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,570
♫  That I have  ♫

29
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,730
♫  How can you?  ♫

30
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,210
You should have called me!

31
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,320
Then I would have gone to Japan!

32
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,090
I wanted to,

33
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,620
but if Cheol Woong had found out about me, I could never return.

34
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,130
You think Cheol Woong would try to kill you?

35
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,120
Cheol Woong gave you the keys to open your handcuffs to escape at your father's burial.

36
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,840
That was a deal he made with you.

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,910
He probably thought I could never come back after I fled by boat.

38
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,660
I would be as good as dead.

39
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,290
Doo Hak, Cheol Woong isn't that terrible.

40
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,230
I'm not taking his side right now.

41
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,080
I've seen how you two lived.

42
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,180
You guys were so close everyone thought you were brothers.

43
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,020
I found him.

44
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,790
You found whom?

45
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,920
The one who killed my father.

46
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,750
What? The hit-and-run driver?

47
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,260
No.

48
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,470
The one who hired him to kill my father.

49
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,960
Are you telling me it wasn't an accident?

50
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,470
Who was it? Who hired him?

51
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,530
Someone who was close to me like a brother.

52
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,670
 That man hired me to do it.

53
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,960
 His name...

54
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,500
 I don't know his name.

55
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,130
 Take a look.

56
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,990
 Was it this guy?

57
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,020
 What about him?

58
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,460
 He wore sunglasses so I couldn't see him clearly.

59
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,790
 Look closer, you b*stard.

60
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,530
 That's him.

61
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,590
 It's that guy!

62
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,550
 He said a drunk man will come onto the road.

63
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,190
 He said he'd get me out quickly if it looked like an accident.

64
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,340
Who was the one who hired him to do this?

65
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,560
No way.

66
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,320
That entire family plotted together to do this.

67
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,840
Don't think that way, Doo Hak. There's no way.

68
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,470
He's more than capable of it.

69
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,670
Doo Hak, you must be mistaken.

70
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,370
I wish that was the case.

71
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,600
You said it yourself. And I know as I've seen it.

72
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,390
Your father cared about Cheol Woong more than he did for you.

73
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,430
But you think Cheol Woong wouldn't know to be grateful?

74
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,230
I know how you feel about Cheol Woong.

75
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,050
But this isn't it. This is really not true, Doo Hak.

76
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,570
All right. How about we try meeting Cheol Woong right now?

77
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,430
If he sees that you're alive, he will be so happy!

78
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,180
Also, we can ask him about this case.

79
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,520
Perhaps he can reinvestigate it and reveal what really happened.

80
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,650
- Doo Hak. 
 - Would that b*stard reveal the truth?

81
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,220
That bastard, who is so used to hiding the truth?

82
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,130
What do you mean?

83
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,290
What truth would Cheol Woong cover up?

84
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,190
You don't know Cheol Woong at all.

85
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:46,530
The murder case that changed my life in Yeosu...

86
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,500
You asked me every time you visited me in prison if I really killed someone.

87
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,750
That's right. I lied to you.

88
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,040
I didn't kill anyone, but I became a murderer,

89
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,910
and...

90
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,390
Then that murder...

91
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,330
Are you saying Cheol Woong was the murderer?

92
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,970
 Is Doo Hak really the culprit?

93
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,760
 Are you saying you think someone else is the real culprit?

94
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,900
 And you're saying it's me?

95
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,560
 That's what it is, right?

96
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,000
 I can really do anything if it's for you.

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,720
 I can even kill a person.

98
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,920
 Let's just say I killed Young Tak. Okay?

99
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,350
 Even if I was the one who killed him...

100
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,720
 that was all for you.

101
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,160
Cheol Woong begged me crying,

102
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,630
 - Hyung!  
 - to save him...

103
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,420
 Please save me.

104
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,360
He begged my father with his mother.

105
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,320
 Please save me just this once!

106
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,360
 - Please save me this once! 
 - Ahjussi!

107
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,720
The only people who know this

108
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,890
 are me, Cheol Woong, my dead father,

109
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,600
 and Cheol Woong's mother.

110
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,530
Now do you see?

111
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,160
He's more than capable of killing my father and me.

112
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,180
Yes. We also heard.

113
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,320
When?

114
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,600
He told us while drinking after we heard the confession from Lee Yong Deuk.

115
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,890
Gosh. We were quite shocked as well.

116
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,430
You know he'd never lie.

117
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,260
Choi Cheol Woong, that b*stard is so evil!

118
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,920
How could he do that to Hyung-nim Doo Hak, who went to prison for him?

119
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,120
Then for some unknown reason, Doo Hak's father blackmailed Cheol Woong or

120
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,050
Cheol Woong's family with the fact that Doo Hak took the blame for the murder?

121
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:39,240
And that's why he was murdered, and all that happened to Doo Hak?

122
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,520
That's the only conclusion we can come to.

123
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,420
So did you all agree to join in the revenge?

124
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,890
Let's say that's true.

125
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,670
Only Cheol Woong and his family know the truth. Would they ever admit it?

126
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,950
Also, who would listen to a junkie (addict)?

127
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,220
Not only that, they have powerful allies behind them.

128
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,260
Please try to stop him and don't help him.

129
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,970
This basically kills Doo Hak a second time when he barely managed to survive.

130
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:20,460
We tried. But he wants everything to go back to where they belong.

131
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,730
If it doesn't, he will die.

132
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,580
Even if he lives, he can't live in peace.

133
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,260
Nobody can persuade him

134
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,600
except for you, Jung Shin.

135
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,810
You're here?

136
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,510
Oh, Boss! It's been a long time.

137
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,010
Aigoo, what are you doing reading? It's so not like you.

138
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,560
- Gosh. 
 - What book is it?

139
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,090
"Musoyu"? (to own nothing)

140
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,260
Aigoo, what a sight.

141
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,930
Ma Cheong Ja will live a life of giving up possessions?

142
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,190
Oh, that's not it.

143
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,610
Whether it's your mind or finances,

144
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,240
aren't you supposed to empty it before you fill it again?

145
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,410
Right now, I'm in a state of lacking possessions.

146
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,650
Why? Because I'm broke.

147
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,160
If I fill up on money, then I'll be somebody again.

148
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,080
Why don't you just enter a Buddhist temple, hold a cane,

149
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,950
and pray to Buddha?

150
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,430
Aigoo, our elders.

151
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,830
- Hello. 
 - Oh, hey, Guys.

152
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,070
Gosh, I get the sense this will be a big one.

153
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,400
You're sharp.

154
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,410
Gosh, how rich is she that we are assessing her assets?

155
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,700
That's what I'm saying.

156
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,280
Is that ahjumma Lee Byung Chul (owned Samsung) or Chung Ju Young (of Hyundai)?

157
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,950
Who is she?

158
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,760
She's not a normal businessperson.

159
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,920
She might have lots of money through backhanded means.

160
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,280
Gosh, who is it? Hurry and tell me.

161
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,590
The wife of Namsan's (slang for NSA) leader.

162
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,620
Hyungnim!

163
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,250
Are you crazy right now?

164
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,800
Hyungnim, have you lost your mind after taking a break for too long?

165
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,000
- Hurry and go to the hospital. 
 - Forget it!

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,490
I'd rather be a nobody and have nothing.

167
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,340
You've gone absolutely crazy!

168
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,050
Hey, hey, hey! The more dangerous the job, the greater profit margin.

169
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,590
Also, she has great ambitions in real estate.

170
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,870
Hey, hey. How much longer can we really keep this up?

171
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,730
Think of it as our final job before retirement,

172
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,020
and prepare for our future retirement.

173
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,560
Also, if we steal the money the powerful have acquired through corruption,

174
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,570
the people would love that, too.

175
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,270
Look at Robin Hood.

176
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,800
If we are successful, we can donate some money to the poor.

177
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,900
Let's be a Hwalbindang! (rebels against corrupt government)

178
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,390
Whether it's Robin Hood or Hwalbindang,

179
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,040
they're just thieves if you think about it!

180
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,120
That's what I mean!

181
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,430
No matter how I see it, this isn't what would have come out of your head.

182
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,090
Hyungnim, there's someone behind this, right?

183
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,450
There's nothing like that!

184
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,130
If there is someone behind this, I can say Love is behind it.

185
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,200
Gosh.

186
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,550
The final love of my life.

187
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,060
What's wrong with you?

188
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,470
So are you in or not?

189
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,510
How many people have you called your final love?

190
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,450
Mi Sook, Young... not Young Ja...

191
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,420
Wow, this is amazing.

192
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,620
This is a whole new level compared to a cabaret.

193
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,790
In my eyes, every single one of these looks like a pile of cash.

194
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,800
How much money would you have to spend to set up a place like this?

195
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,130
Y-Yes, I know.

196
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,340
If we pull the wool over her eyes (deceive),

197
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,730
we could make at least 5 big bills (bill is ₩100 million).

198
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,430
Five big bills?

199
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,050
It's not difficult.

200
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,870
You just have to lend us your name for doing business.

201
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,970
The business funds will actually be provided by the developer.

202
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,190
Just our names?

203
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,390
What kind of business is it?

204
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,020
Just know that it's real estate development.

205
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,230
After the job is done and everyone is paid,

206
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,120
we were promised to each receive one big bill.

207
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,590
"One hundred million won"? One hundred million won for lending our name?

208
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,930
This seems like a large-scale business.

209
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:35,830
Instead of being like that, how about you include us in this?

210
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,980
That would be difficult. I'm not even included.

211
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,330
Gosh, you're too much.

212
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,540

213
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,180
Next time, you need to pay me more for high-risk.

214
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,270
Wow, does she have so many buildings?

215
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,980
Hey!

216
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,350
Gosh.

217
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,390
What's this?

218
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,560
I mean, is this all real?

219
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,700
How many is this?

220
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,210
Aigoo.

221
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,050
I heard you have a good eye for ancient art, Deputy Chief.

222
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,560
Gosh, I don't know about having a good eye.

223
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,920
It's just...

224
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,440
Back when I was active as a prosecutor, I had to catch tomb robbers

225
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,200
so I had no choice but to study it.

226
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,330
It's just a few tidbits of common sense

227
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,050
I learned by being around it.

228
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,910
While doing business,

229
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,650
sometimes debtors would give me antiques instead of money for their debts.

230
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,790
Could you look at it for me?

231
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,440
This is...

232
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,610
I mean, I accepted it,

233
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,410
but it's not Goryeo porcelain pottery and appears a chamber pot.

234
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,060
Wait, this is...

235
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,550
Isn't this moon pottery?

236
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,600
"Moon pottery"? Is it valuable?

237
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,680
Of course, it's valuable!

238
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,450
Although it hasn't been designated as a national treasure,

239
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,540
in the field of ancient art,

240
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,760
it's a pottery considered to be a treasure.

241
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,870
Oh, is that so?

242
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:31,920
I guess this pottery has finally found its owner.

243
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,600
- Excuse me? 
 - Gosh, how sad is it

244
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,700
that someone like me who thought it was a chamber pot has it?

245
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,500
For both people and objects,

246
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,390
it's only valuable when one recognizes its value and possesses it.

247
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,800
Do you mean it?

248
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,090
I have quite a few ancient art items.

249
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,670
If you take a look from time to time, I would be grateful.

250
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,070
Gosh, no, it would be an honor!

251
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,010
Oh, right.

252
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,480
- Let's have a drink. 
 - Sure.

253
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:19,950
(Gambling Hall)

254
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,700
It increased by 20% from last time.

255
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,020
You'll be a chaebol at this rate.

256
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,140
You would become the chaebol, Chairman Yoo Young Pil.

257
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,280
You keep expanding the number of businesses.

258
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,990
Hey, with the regulatory insurance money and the maintenance fees,

259
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,100
there are more than a few areas that require money.

260
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,380
If the manager doesn't change, I could just pay him the down payment and monthly wages,

261
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,100
but they keep changing so I must pay them more down payment.

262
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,260
Most professional baseball team managers likely have it easier than me.

263
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,400
Aigoo, you should stop whining.

264
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,050
Well, yes.

265
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,060
Honestly, it's better than selling drugs.

266
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,870
Most things can be taken care of with money,

267
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,400
and the penalties are much less severe.

268
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,500
- What about what I asked you for? 
 - Oh Man Ok?

269
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Even after he got demoted to Busan, he's still bringing in a lot of money.

270
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,300
There are no hotels with a casino that he doesn't visit, big or small.

271
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,810
This b*stard is worse than a corrupt loan shark.

272
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,470
At least loan sharks give you money before they beat you.

273
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,160
This guy just takes your money without even investing 10 won!

274
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,560
Did you find any of his weaknesses?

275
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,090
Gosh, it was so scary to do a background check on him.

276
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,290
That b*stard carries a gun around.

277
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,850
Until we lower his defenses, we can't do anything with him.

278
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,050
Then we will need to lower his defenses.

279
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,780
He didn't reveal his real name, but it seems a report from a businessman in Busan.

280
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,010
What about our office in Busan?

281
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,070
It appears they don't know about it yet.

282
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,980
Shall I inform them?

283
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,840
Forget it.

284
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,190
There's also an anonymous letter.

285
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,850
And I gave a report to Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

286
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:24,030
A dog abandoned by its master isn't fed by its master

287
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,700
so shouldn't it find its own way to survive?

288
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,200
I suppose so.

289
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,620
But if an abandoned dog bites a passerby,

290
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,950
the owner will get in sh*t for it.

291
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,840
Making threats and taking bribes using one's position, that's not minor.

292
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,710
If you get fired, you can't collect pension.

293
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,520
Are you telling me to quit voluntarily?

294
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,270
I heard your father is gravely ill.

295
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:54,080
You should use this time to care for your father and be a good, dutiful son.

296
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,780
If you make up your mind, I'll ask Deputy Chief Prosecutor to grant you leniency.

297
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,430
I'll give you three days.

298
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,310
Choi Cheol Woong.

299
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,110
I apologized to you, and I served you well as a young master.

300
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,090
Why isn't that good enough for you?

301
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,430
Do you think you're my superior just because I serve you as one?

302
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,920
Hey.

303
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,760
Oh Man Ok.

304
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,120
You're still so immature.

305
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,750
I treated you well only because you're my superior's son.

306
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,050
If not for that, even if you were higher than a prosecutor,

307
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,050
I would have put a dog leash on you.

308
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,990
You'd better not mess with me.

309
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,630
Things wouldn't go your way anyway.

310
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,280
I guess you count on Deputy Director.

311
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,200
Could you still say that after being indicted?

312
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,400
Hey! You little snitch.

313
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,740
Your fate cannot escape me from the moment

314
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,480
I had you wrapped around my finger. You can't defeat me.

315
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,450
You know why?

316
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:22,970
Have you ever held someone's head underwater until he stopped breathing?

317
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,530
Have you ever shot a hole in a man's heart?

318
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,220
I do those things for my country.

319
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,820
I didn't come all the way here by memorizing law books!

320
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,220
So? What?

321
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,680
So what?

322
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,480
Are you threatening me?

323
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,290
Threaten you?

324
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,050
I guess there's more I can threaten you with.

325
00:22:52,850 --> 00:23:00,370
For example, you killed a man, but your friend was sent to prison in your place...

326
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,630
Say another word.

327
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:08,110
And you killed a crucial witness to that,

328
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,190
via the closest person to you.

329
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,640
Actually,

330
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,550
there is a bit more to it than that.

331
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,490
But you'd be hurt to found out,

332
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,710
very hurt.

333
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,780
Everyone has

334
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,930
a Pandora's Box in his heart that no one should open,

335
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,420
deep down in his heart.

336
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,800
Me, you, Deputy Director, and even Madam, too.

337
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,920
If you really want to get rid of me, I'll open your Pandora's box for you.

338
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,970
It'll chew and swallow all of us up.

339
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:02,140
It's too lonesome for me to go alone.

340
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,880
So, Prosecutor Choi...

341
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,790
Let us just stay in our own territory,

342
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,350
acknowledge each other and get along.

343
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,500
You know that stress is bad for you, right?

344
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,070
Team Captain.

345
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,890
When did you arrive?

346
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,320
How have you been?

347
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,580
I had something to discuss with Special Aide Choi.

348
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,470
Oh, really?

349
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,800
Why don't you have a drink before you go?

350
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,210
No, no thanks. I'm fine.

351
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,180
I was going to meet with you anyway.

352
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,830
By chance, are you available tomorrow?

353
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,430
Did something happen?

354
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:18,650
Mom, by chance, are you involved in something with Oh Man Ok?

355
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,280
Okay.

356
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,090
Setting you up with Geum Yeon Hee,

357
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,930
that involved Team Captain Oh.

358
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,350
I told him to set it up.

359
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,790
Don't hate me too much. I did it all for you.

360
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,110
No, not that. By chance...

361
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,680
What?

362
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,420
Why?

363
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,860
Nothing.

364
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,700

365
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,530

366
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,540
What are you all doing?

367
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,970
I've thought a lot about it.

368
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,760
The fact you went to prison in place of Cheol Woong

369
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,460
and your father's death being connected to Cheol Woong,

370
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,520
I didn't confirm it, but I believe you.

371
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,390
But stop it.

372
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,650
Why?

373
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,440
Things won't return to how they were anyway.

374
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,290
Your father can't come back to life,

375
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,440
and you can't get your time in prison back.

376
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,970
More than anything, I can't lose you again.

377
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,680
You also think this is trying to break a boulder with an egg?

378
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,590
Totally impossible?

379
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,340
Even if you think you can do it 100%, don't do it!

380
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,890
What will get back to its place in the end?

381
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,220
If Cheol Woong and his family die or go to jail, is that back to its original place?

382
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,950
Are you worried about Cheol Woong? Is that it?

383
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,290
What?

384
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,800
I get it.

385
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,620
I'm well aware Cheol Woong liked you a lot and helped you a lot.

386
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,930
Lee Doo Hak. Seriously, you're...

387
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,960
Fine. Let's say you took revenge.

388
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,260
How about the blood on your hands due to doing all that?

389
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,440
And how would I bear to watch all that?

390
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,470
When you were covered in blood a long time ago,

391
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,590
do you recall what I said to you?

392
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,680
Don't you remember the promise you made me?

393
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,270
 Let's really break up now.

394
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,560
 Watching you getting hurt, bleeding,

395
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,190
 and beating up others,

396
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,710
 this is where I stop

397
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,970
 watching you do that.

398
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,130
 Please don't give up on me, Jung Shin.

399
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,630
 I'll quit being a gangster and

400
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,670
 try to live with a proper job.

401
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,110
 I don't think I can live without you.

402
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,410
You say you want to get back to your original place?

403
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,370
That was your rightful place then,

404
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,510
when you said you loved me,

405
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,770
when you said you could give up on it for me.

406
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,680

407
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:17,520

408
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:25,890

409
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,510
I don't think Jung Shin is wrong.

410
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,290
She isn't wrong,

411
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,270
neither Jung Shin nor I.

412
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,580
Those b*stards are the wrong ones.

413
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,560
So what will you do?

414
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,640

415
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,750
I was loyal with all my heart.

416
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:03,050
Although, I know Prosecutor Choi holds an old grudge against me.

417
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:07,980
But especially due to that, I served you three sincerely.

418
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,010
You did.

419
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:15,010
I'm always grateful to you, Team Captain Oh. It's just that...

420
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,410
I don't think Cheol Woong

421
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:22,350
can forget the past entanglement with you.

422
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,220
So...

423
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,590
he's trying to kick me out of my position.

424
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,680
I saw your picture, Team Captain Oh.

425
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,970
I think you did wrong.

426
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:46,990
You were demoted over that, yet to repeat doing the same thing is...

427
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,440
How about you, Madam?

428
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,170
Pardon? What do you mean?

429
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,380
Not only Prosecutor Choi, but

430
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,710
you also started excluding me at some point.

431
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,340
Do you mean giving up the west coast property?

432
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,260
I thought I explained it to you back then.

433
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,110
No, you didn't explain it.

434
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:16,370
It was due to the business Chairman Geum Man Cheol offered.

435
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,490
Well, I understand.

436
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,610
You probably didn't want to share it since it's quite big.

437
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,850
It's just human instinct.

438
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,120
As such, I also wanted to see you due to that same instinct,

439
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,100
which strives to survive.

440
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,100
I also didn't want this day to ever come, but...

441
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:52,160
The letter was written to "Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong of Criminal Investigation Team 2 at The Prosecution."

442
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,490

443
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:11,800

444
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,700
 Thinking how shocked you'd be by this letter,

445
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,010
 my heart feels it's tearing apart.

446
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:28,030
 However, thinking how all wrong must be corrected,

447
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:32,000
 I write you this letter with deep sorrow.

448
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,970
 Let me get straight to the point first.

449
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,640
 Although your parents are

450
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,270
 Young Master Choi Young Shik and Madam Kang Yeo Jin,

451
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,260
 your birth father is me, Lee Joong Ho,

452
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,960
 and your birth mother is also

453
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,830
 Doo Hak's mother, Heo Gui Rye.

454
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,930
I apologize for startling you.

455
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:16,000
How dare you blackmail me with such nonsense of a fabricated letter?

456
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,820
I found it in the dead Lee Joong Ho's pocket.

457
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,720
If anyone was to blackmail you, he'd have done it.

458
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,750
And that's why I had to dirty my own hands.

459
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,950
Stop speaking nonsense!

460
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,790
You think Deputy Director

461
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,960
will let you be for doing something like this?

462
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,040
That's only a copy.

463
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:53,350
I think you're the one Deputy Director will punish, not me.

464
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,150
The world has become such a better place.

465
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:01,150
I don't know if you saw it on the news,

466
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,000
but there's such a thing called

467
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,400
DNA testing, which is very accurate.

468
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,450
I had hairs of Deputy Director and Prosecutor Choi compared.

469
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,050
Take a look.

470
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,780
Those two...

471
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,840
were not

472
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,050
related by blood.

473
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,360
I was really shocked.

474
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,330
I had gone to Yeosu and your hometown to investigate before,

475
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:37,050
but you had already filled every possible hole fully.

476
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,320
What do you want?

477
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,560
Fortunately, I still have loyalty to Deputy Director.

478
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,980
Give me back my position beside Deputy Director.

479
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,510
- Is that all? 
 - Of course not.

480
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,660
That position was mine to start.

481
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,460
Give me 30% of your profit from business with Chairman Geum.

482
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,600
What did you say?

483
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,520
Don't you get more than enough from the business?

484
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:10,650
If Deputy Director finds out about this, all will go up in smoke.

485
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,890
Instead...

486
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:19,000
I'll serve you three with all my loyalty.

487
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:26,220
Additionally, these things will never see the light of day.

488
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,240
Now then, please let me know.

489
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,190
It's a deal.

490
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,470
If I keep the promise, bring me both the letter and test result,

491
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,940
in their entirety.

492
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,620
No question about that.

493
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,510
Madam.

494
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,800
I'm happy only when I'm next to you and Deputy Director.

495
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,450
As long as you have me near you, I'll never betray you or Deputy Director.

496
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,870
Do you still not understand that?

497
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,590
However...

498
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,910
I was also quite surprised at first.

499
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,260
How could you have schemed all of this?

500
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,900
How could you lie about all this without a flinch?

501
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,420
But thinking about it after some time,

502
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,410
I had very high respect for you.

503
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:49,690
You dared attempt this scam against the most dangerous man in Korea.

504
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,800
Isn't it so amazing?

505
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,680
I'm on your side.

506
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
If you keep me by your side, your life...

507
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,200
will surely be a happy ending.

508
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,870
I'll promise you that.

509
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,080
I read your report about Team Captain Oh.

510
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,230
For him to cause the same trouble again...

511
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,220
My goodness.

512
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,450
I guess this is it, right?

513
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,890
- I'm— 
 - Don't be like that.

514
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:37,330
Everyone makes such mistakes in life, no?

515
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:42,700
A civil servant only gets paid so much, and his father is severely ill.

516
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,130
He must have needed the money.

517
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:52,140
Considering what Team Captain Oh has done for you and our family so far,

518
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,430
it'd be too harsh of a consequence.

519
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,370
Don't you think so?

520
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:01,640
Perhaps, did you speak to Team Captain Oh separately?

521
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,420
No, I didn't.

522
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,410
I only saw Cheol Woong having a meeting with Team Captain Oh.

523
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,230
Father.

524
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:20,120
I also think it's too harsh to get rid of Team Captain Oh like this.

525
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,370
I think you should reprimand him so it won't ever happen again.

526
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,810
Really?

527
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,430
I actually didn't feel good about it, either.

528
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:34,330
Then we'll wrap it up with a strict warning, as you said.

529
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,910
All right, let's we three have another toast.

530
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:03,930
Long time no see, Special Aide Choi. Thank you for having me back.

531
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,720
If you need money, just ask!

532
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,500
Instead of doing such dirty work.

533
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,720
I'm sorry for what happened. It'll never happen again.

534
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,250
Take it.

535
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,870
It's fine.

536
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,050
Take it!

537
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,560
I know your father got surgery.

538
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,590
I would give it to you for your retirement anyway.

539
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,700
What did you say? H-Hey, is that true?

540
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,060
Wait, he got his job back in Seoul?

541
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,400
Why you little... Did you really report him?

542
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,870
I even included a picture and definitely sent it!

543
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,170
I really can't understand it, either.

544
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:10,760
Doesn't this mean we can't get this b*stard?

545
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,040
I guess so.

546
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,210
We didn't think this through.

547
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,950
We believed in justice when we were just thugs.

548
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:30,660
My goodness, this place is plastered with Chow Yun-fat and Leslie Cheung.

549
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,080
I told her to add my favorite, Joey Wong (Taiwanese actress).

550
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,300
But Joey Wong doesn't like you.

551
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,240
I know.

552
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,070
That's what he was saying so...

553
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,660
Auntie!

554
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,750
Why are you so surprised? Am I not allowed to be here?

555
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,460
Hey, President Oh! Long time no see.

556
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,350
I thought you had cut ties with me.

557
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,470
My, my. Even if we cut ties,

558
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,840
can't I still be a guest, at least?

559
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,260
Hey, you brat, did you cut ties with me, too?

560
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,260
You need to treat your auntie to a glass of juice, at least.

561
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,810
What brings you here?

562
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:12,000
My goodness. Why are you so impatient?

563
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Let me just have a sip before we talk.

564
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,290
I heard Hong Kong movies are quite the money, right?

565
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,150
It's not just "quite the money."

566
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:26,210
It's as sweet as honey.

567
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:29,490
Copyright income on videos is great, too.

568
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:35,590
You didn't come to try and get a hand on our business, did you?

569
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,750
My, keep that trap of yours shut for once.

570
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,400
Before I dice it up, all right?

571
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,260
Are you getting by a little now?

572
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,180
We only just got started.

573
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,110
On top of that, all of this was started on loan.

574
00:41:55,110 --> 00:42:00,030
I stopped by that film academy place on the way here.

575
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:05,180
I heard you claimed a few scripts written by directors from that place.

576
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,820
Was it "Marriage Story" or something?

577
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,650
That seemed quite bold and entertaining.

578
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:15,600
It seemed to be a new type of food, but it seemed delicious.

579
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,280
I read it to her.

580
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,010
So are you going to invest in it?

581
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,790
No. I'm saying you had the foresight and made the right decision,

582
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,970
to keep an interest in the academy.

583
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,620
You came to compliment me for that? At this point?

584
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,970
I was still called Oh Jung Shin's adopted mother.

585
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,760
Do you think I came to compliment you only?

586
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,500
I have a prize for you as well.

587
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,180
- What are you doing? 
 - Yes.

588
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:45,960
All right! Here is the prize for our dear President Oh Jung Shin.

589
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,450
What is that?

590
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,150
They're shares of Namdo Film Studio.

591
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,440
Sorry?

592
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,940
I thought there were no shares left in my name.

593
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,090
I know. So the thing is...

594
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:04,170
We're giving all of our shares to you, the branch manager,

595
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,950
including the theater, everything, 100%!

596
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,590
Hey, hey, look at this.

597
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,690
What the heck is going on here?

598
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:17,450
Auntie, are you really going to hand over everything to Jung Shin?

599
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:21,110

600
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,770
What are you scheming?

601
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,910
"Scheming"?

602
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,380
I guess I am scheming something.

603
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:37,040
I'm going to retire and enjoy the rest of my days, living off you.

604
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,300
I'll go out for some cold noodles.

605
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,840
Take a good look and have them stamped, all right?

606
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,340
Gosh, like this again...

607
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:55,090
When you were kicked out last time, it wasn't President Cha's will.

608
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,420
There was pressure from the outside, I tell you.

609
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,040
She was really heartbroken.

610
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,040
You'll find out everything later.

611
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,010
What are you doing in there? Get over here!

612
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,130
Yes, yes! I'll be right there!

613
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,220
All right? I'm going.

614
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:16,410
Jung Shin, what the heck does this mean?

615
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,390
"Pressure from outside"?

616
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,330

617
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:28,960
My, oh, my. Look who's here.

618
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,140
My, I was so frustrated because I couldn't reach you.

619
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,790
You were alive?

620
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,460
President Cha looked for you all over.

621
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:40,070
She says you can give up on revenge, but always repay a favor.

622
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,000
I came with someone.

623
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,540
I told you there's someone I serve, right?

624
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,370
One who does business in Japan.

625
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:49,310
Oh, I remember now.

626
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,290
Please come in.

627
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,400
My name is Lee Hyeong Guk.

628
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,860
What?

629
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,220
Y-You're the...

630
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,860
Wait, aren't you the one J-Jung Shin was going to...

631
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,140
Yes.

632
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,180
I'm the young man who was going to marry her.

633
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,570
Wow.

634
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:20,390
That woman was threatening me so much, talking about tax audits and everything.

635
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:22,770
They say to avoid showers.

636
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:28,290
I was fuming inside, but it couldn't be helped.

637
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,250
I see.

638
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,260
Still, she was hanging in there somehow.

639
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,080
Don't worry too much.

640
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,990
She's a smart girl so she will overcome it.

641
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,420
How are you doing, President Cha?

642
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,910
Aigoo, don't even get me started.

643
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,980
If I show directly distributed movies, they cause a scene.

644
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:50,950
Gosh, last time somebody almost set the theater on fire.

645
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:54,290
Although we only got a small burn in the corner,

646
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,010
sprinklers went off in some of the theaters.

647
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:02,710
And the domestic movies I invested in aren't doing well.

648
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:07,710
Would you like to sell your theater and company to me?

649
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,680
I'll give you a good price.

650
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,160
What?

651
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,200
Even though I received your help,

652
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,140
a young man shouldn't brag about having money.

653
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:27,610
No matter how hard it gets, my life has been embodied in this company.

654
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,720
Take your leave now.

655
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,540
Shouldn't you make sure your life blooms and gets properly inherited?

656
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:41,070
Couldn't you pass it on to President Oh Jung Shin?

657
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,790
Oh my.

658
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,310
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

659
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,080
Aigoo, thank you, Madam.

660
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:02,840
The names you lent me were quite the big names.

661
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,010
I can invest in the business now, too, right?

662
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:09,080
How much do you plan to invest?

663
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,300
Could I put in about five billion won ($9 million in 1990)?

664
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,920
Will you be able to prepare it in time?

665
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,850
My stocks, bonds, and some loans will be enough.

666
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,120
That's great then.

667
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,010
I need a lot of cash for meeting people, anyway.

668
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:30,180
On top of that, you're my insurance, right?

669
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,680
You've got a great policy.

670
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,250
One, two, three, four,

671
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:41,320
five, six, and seven. Wow...

672
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,420
Power sure is a great thing, right?

673
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,800
This madam had three buildings in Gangnam alone.

674
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,420
And they were all five stories or taller.

675
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:54,020
Also, she even owns a parking lot in Apgujeong.

676
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,780
She bought out Paris Salon; she started with rent.

677
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:00,450
And she even owns her home.

678
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,810
So how much do you think you have there?

679
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:07,150
The real estate alone should be at least 10 billion won.

680
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,850
She's saved quite a lot, right?

681
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:13,360
What's the use of having money? She's trash as a person.

682
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,960

683
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,400
I'll slap the sh*t out of her!

684
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,630
Did something happen?

685
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:23,860
No, it's nothing.

686
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:27,670
Anyhow, it doesn't seem a small amount of money.

687
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:32,320
Would there be a property we can use to pluck her eyeballs out at once?

688
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,920
All of the 10 billion won?

689
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,330
Yes. All of it, at once.

690
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,790
It won't be easy with just any property.

691
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:44,890
Wouldn't you at least need a golf range or a hotel?

692
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:49,620
Hey, wh-what if this backfires, and we all croak?

693
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:53,200
Just consider it your last gig in Korea.

694
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,300
If we do this right, I'll get the money laundered and send you abroad.

695
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,380
That's a great idea.

696
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,330
- I'm off. 
 - H-Hey, wait a second.

697
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:05,180
By the way, according to Ma Cheong Ja,

698
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,350
the Madam is apparently getting into

699
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:12,400
a big real estate investment lately.

700
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,580
- Real estate? 
 - Yes.

701
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,570
She is doing things with some powerful ladies.

702
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:24,310
Tell her to find out about it for sure.

703
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,360
I'm not sure.

704
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,660
Certain organizations, the press, and military made a union

705
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:39,260
to request a special presale but, as you know, the Ministry of Works already

706
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,770
announced we can't accept their requests repeatedly.

707
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,800
Chief Choi, the Blue House is also already in on this.

708
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,630
You'll be given the word quite soon.

709
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:48,930
Is that true?

710
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:52,100
We're only saying we'll grant special presale to

711
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,410
those who are working hard for the country.

712
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:56,710
Isn't it a great boost to morale and a good deed?

713
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:58,330
What about Seoul city?

714
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:01,890
Seoul city will also change its stance soon.

715
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:06,680
Also, I had a box of ripe apples loaded in your car.

716
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,770
 Please enjoy.

717
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,770
 Aigoo, I don't know...

718
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:13,630
Yes.

719
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,810
Hello, Chairman.

720
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:18,770
Aigoo, Madam, you're here.

721
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:20,480
Chief Choi, please say hi.

722
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,510
She is the wife of Deputy Director Hwang of the NSA.

723
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:27,810
Aigoo! I apologize for not recognizing you!

724
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,600
Do you have anything for me?

725
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,490
I'll get you...

726
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,430
the ownership of  a construction company.

727
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,260
Which one?

728
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,880
Changsung Constructions.

729
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,400
Changsung Constructions, the twentieth richest company?

730
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,720
Yes, instead give me a bonus.

731
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,070
It's a deal. Go ahead!

732
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,030
Thank you.

733
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,860
Hello?

734
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,510
My, look whom I have here.

735
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:41,010
I thought you were in America.

736
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,070
When did you return?

737
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:45,450
It's been a little over a year.

738
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:49,510
It was scary to step foot outside the house since I couldn't speak English.

739
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:52,830
I couldn't buy anything unless it was from a Korean store.

740
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:55,410
Life just wasn't the same.

741
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:58,900
So I left behind my family against their wishes

742
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,510
and just came back.

743
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:04,730
Oh... Does that mean you're back in Mugyo-dong?

744
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,420
And rebuilt your gang?

745
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,680
Gosh, what are you saying? Look at this.

746
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,120
My daily life relies on this.

747
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,960
Life is difficult for me.

748
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:16,950
Then?

749
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:22,310
Well, lately I'm working in the gaming industry.

750
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,860
- "Gaming"? 
 - Oh, yes.

751
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:28,920
I guess I didn't live too badly.

752
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,230
I got to invest and get some shares in my guys' pachinko places and casinos.

753
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:39,040
So I'm getting by with a few bucks coming from there.

754
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,390
By the way, this is legal.

755
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,740
It seems you got an upgrade, President Yeom.

756
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,710
- Congratulations. 
 - Aigoo, you flatter me.

757
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:56,720
By the way, I heard your company also takes care of this sort of business.

758
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,380
Please take good care of me.

759
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,200
As a matter of fact, I clearly told my guys.

760
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,110
I said to let you take over a good gaming house after you retire,

761
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:13,450
not to mention pay for the current monthly health maintenance fee.

762
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:17,590
Even if they're empty words, they make me feel important so I'm happy.

763
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:22,520
What are you saying? I'm a man of my word.

764
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:27,310
I received a solid promise, Team Captain.

765
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:33,440
By the way, where is the business located?

766
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,380
I'd like to go see it in person.

767
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:41,810
Absolutely! Of course, you should pay a visit.

768
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:44,880
- Here, please have a glass. 
 - No, thank you.

769
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,050
All right. I'll personally escort you to the business myself.

770
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:52,060
We can discuss business once we get there.

771
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,010
Hey, tell the girls to get in here!

772
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,580
Hey!

773
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:00,360
♪ Upon that green meadow ♪

774
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,940

775
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,380

777
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,620
Team Captain, I love you!

778
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,170
How embarrassing, gosh.

779
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,440
Thank you, thank you.

780
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,590
Oppa, you should sing a song, too.

781
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,710
Oppa, just have one glass.

782
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,160
- Forget it. 
 - Just one!

783
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,280
- Forget it. 
 - Why not?

784
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,750
Team Captain!

785
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:36,510
Here, please have a glass.

786
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,430
- I don't drink. 
 - Of course not.

787
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:43,330
This is water, just water.

788
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:47,470
Here.

789
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:52,290
Here's to our loyalty. Cheers!

790
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,180
Thank you.

791
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,920
Yes!

792
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,780
Water...

793
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,000
Are you awake now?

794
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,350
Who the heck are you?

795
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,830
We're the ones who run the gaming places.

796
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,110
You said you wanted a look.

797
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,940
This is where we do business.

798
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,400
You sh*tty thugs.

799
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,040
Where's Yeom Kwang Tak?

800
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,100
Hyungnim Kwang Tak went to cure his hangover.

801
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,930
Did you wait long?

802
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,350
Gosh, it's cold.

803
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:54,560
There's nothing like fish cake and soju when it's cold out.

804
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:04,440
Man, a fish cake date is perfect for late night.

805
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,310
About Doo Hak's father...

806
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,510
Did you kill him since you feared he'd expose that

807
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,690
Doo Hak went to jail in your place?

808
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,090
Don't you know who I am?

809
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,740
Of course, I do.

810
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:31,420
You're a government employee.

811
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,490
One who tortures!

812
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,320
One who pockets money!

813
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,490
One who murders!

814
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:41,980
Am I wrong?

815
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,150
What do you want from me?

816
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,160
If you're honest, I'll let you go alive.

817
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,780
Or else you're a dead man.

818
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:00,380
You know Lee Joong Ho from Sungnam, right?

819
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,540
The one you ordered Lee Yong Deuk to run over with a truck.

820
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:07,430
- I don't know. 
 - You little...

821
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,200
Bring him.

822
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,260
- Bring him. 
 - Yes, Hyungnim.

823
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,610
Take a look.

824
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:30,760
Is this the b*stard?

825
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:39,450
Yes, yes. It's this creep.

826
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:42,560
This b*stard gave me the order. This one.

827
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:47,400
What's this bullsh*t?

828
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,590
Who are you?

829
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,340
You made me do it

830
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,270
for 30 million won ($62,000 in 1985).

831
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,500
I never did anything like that.

832
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:03,720
Lee Yong Deuk recognizes you, but Man Ok doesn't recognize his comrade.

833
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,590
Take him back.

834
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,980
Come here, Punk.

835
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,170
Hurry and spill it.

836
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,600
This, again?

837
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,250
I'm right, though.

838
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:23,970
Doo Hak carried your murder charge and went to prison in your place.

839
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,960
I know.

840
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:32,200
You and one of your parents likely begged Doo Hak's father,

841
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,420
since he was their servant.

842
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,720
Don't you think you're taking this too far?

843
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,520
I told you that's not true.

844
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,820
What can I do?

845
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,960
What can I do to make you believe me?

846
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,070
Should I split open my stomach and show you my guts?

847
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,090
Hurry up and spill it.

848
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:01,370
If you have a brain, use it to think.

849
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:04,200
You'll kill me if I don't tell?

850
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,700
You'll kill me even if I do, you son of a b*tch.

851
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,780
Even if I—

852
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,420
Doo Hak and

853
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,200
Doo Hak's father won't speak because they're dead,

854
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,380
but you... you really shouldn't do this.

855
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,230
No.

856
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:32,450
No, it's really not like that.

857
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,260
Jung Shin, let's stop talking about this

858
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:38,340
and discuss something else.

859
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,970
If...

860
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,560
Doo Hak was alive,

861
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,800
if his father was still alive, would you say the same thing?

862
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:01,880
This b*stard was alive this whole time?

863
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,820
Hey–

864
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,190
I wondered who you could be.

865
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:17,910
Lee Doo Hak, you're still alive.

866
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:20,810
You've lost your touch.

867
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:30,390
I wonder how it feels to die by your own gun.

868
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,330
Yes.

869
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,250
I can say the same.

870
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,910
I can say it's not true.

871
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:45,040
Even if I die and meet those two, I can say it's not true!

872
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,630
Oh Man Ok, you committed too many sins

873
01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:00,200
so you can't be convicted within the law's boundaries.

874
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:09,140

875
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:15,970
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

876
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:22,460
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

877
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:32,530
♫  Above the rough sky, my heart floats away  ♫

878
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,830

879
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:38,570
-  We need to break apart what's tightly clumped together. 
 - Bingo.

880
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,400
 Oh Man Ok threatened me in this very spot.

881
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,880
 Within the slush fund ledger, there is a notebook.

882
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,660
 Mom, were you responsible about Ahjussi Joong Ho?

883
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,690
 Mom, I'm Doo Hak. Your son...

884
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:51,220
 I really hoped it wasn't you.

885
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,310

886
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:55,960
 Hey, Man, we're trying to pluck NSA Deputy Director's wife's eyeballs here!

887
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,380
 Will you send the documents?

888
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,270
 We'll first send the copy and get him back in Seoul.

889
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:04,920
 The lads who kept a watch around CEO Oh's house told me an interesting story a few days ago.

890
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,380
 A certain man appeared around CEO Oh's house.

891
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:11,940
♫  Only your name is engraved like this  ♫
