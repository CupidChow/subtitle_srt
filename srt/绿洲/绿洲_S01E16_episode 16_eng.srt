1
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,640

2
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,680

3
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,340

4
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,860
 The two of you are not father and son.

5
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,230
 Of course.

6
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,040
 He is also a foolish father,

7
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,330
 who still doesn't recognize his son,

8
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,150
 who is right in front of his eyes.

9
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,740
 The pajamas will likely fit me, even if I don't try them.

10
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,360
 They're my son's pajamas.

11
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,780

12
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,600
The customers are all gone.

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,780
Let's go home now.

14
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,620
It's been a while. Shall we do it one more time?

15
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,860

16
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,980
 Before your late husband died, did he love you a lot?

17
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,360
Why are you suddenly bringing up the past?

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,250
Well,

19
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,130
he wasn't that affectionate.

20
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:25,000
It was arranged so suddenly by our parents; I didn't get to feel much emotion toward it.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,700
The only man whom I've felt such emotion for was you.

22
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,090
Why? Because I was powerful?

23
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,370
It's not like you were powerful from your birth.

24
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,350
You were... so unsophisticated and poor.

25
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,360
Yes, I was.

26
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,310
The other girls in college didn't even look at me.

27
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,440
All of that seemed charming to me.

28
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,200
That's when I knew.

29
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,220
Love is not when a person is particularly lovely,

30
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,810
but when my heart gazes at a person, full of love.

31
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,870
You are like that as well.

32
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,570
Although I'm flawed and lacking,

33
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,550
your heart views me as precious and pretty.

34
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,700
I'm always grateful.

35
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,550
That is the same for me as well.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,500
But you seem a bit strange today.

37
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,000
You seem a bit wistful and sentimental.

38
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,360
I have one thing to ask of you.

39
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,330
What is it?

40
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,370
Everyone has...

41
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,880
at least one secret they can't tell even to those closest to them,

42
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,760
a secret that becomes poison to the one who finds out.

43
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,550
Do you have something like that?

44
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,480
No.

45
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,150
That's a relief.

46
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,300
Even if you ever happen to get such a secret,

47
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,580
if it's something that would hurt you or me,

48
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,040
I hope you keep it buried without telling anyone.

49
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,690
We went through a lot to reunite.

50
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,530
I don't ever want to let it go.

51
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,920
That'll never happen.

52
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,960
You were my first

53
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,610
and my last love.

54
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,080
Thank you.

55
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,260
 Also...

56
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,550
 there's one more thing I must tell you.

57
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,020
 Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong

58
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,020
 isn't your biological son.

59
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,790
 For my family,

60
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,820
 please be loyal to the end...

61
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,780
 Deputy Director—

62
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,510
Gosh, this a**hole is one crazy b*stard!

63
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,310
Hey! Shouldn't we report this guy to the police?

64
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,450
Don't spout foolish nonsense.

65
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,420
Hwang Choong Sung can cover that up without batting an eye.

66
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,250
The crucial thing right now is Doo Hak's safety!

67
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,270
He'll find a wiretap on Oh Man Ok.

68
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,820
This is top secret.

69
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,930
Make sure to keep your subordinates quiet.

70
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,300
There was a wiretap device on his body.

71
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,650
It was made in Japan, and it could transmit low-frequency waves to 200 meters.

72
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,190
Recording?

73
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,310
 I heard Lee Doo Hak is back in Korea

74
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,340
 and is looking for Lee Yong Deuk.

75
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,920
 - What? 
 - I think he's suspecting

76
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,640
 an instigated murder.

77
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,470
Deputy Director!

78
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,550
Is it true that Team Captain Oh died?

79
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,350
That's right.

80
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,880
It appears that it has to do with Lee Doo Hak.

81
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,630
Put him on the wanted list.

82
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,520
Use all the resources and manpower we've got;

83
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,970
partner with the prosecution and police to catch him.

84
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,730
If he resists, you can kill him.

85
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,960
All that you confiscate, bring it to me at once.

86
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,820
Also, suppress all press releases related to our company immediately.

87
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,230
Move as quickly as possible.

88
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,200
- "Kill him"? 
 - What are you doing? Get to it!

89
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,120
 The NSA says Lee Doo Hak was recruited in Japan by Jochongnyeon (Pro-North Korean league in Japan),

90
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,460
 changed his identity to Lee Hyeong Guk, a foreign national from Japan,

91
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,930
 and infiltrated South Korea for espionage.

92
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,710
 He was deeply involved in this case.

93
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,690
 Also, since Lee Doo Hak knows the geography of our country...

94
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,180
Sh*t! A North Korean spy?

95
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,810
Gosh, these sons of b*tches!

96
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,830
I don't think you'll be safe here.

97
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,180
We're caught in a corner.

98
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,320
Who is it?

99
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,310
 It's me, Jung Shin.

100
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,690
Hi, Jung Shin...

101
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,550
Doo Hak, here.

102
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,660
Did you see the news?

103
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,450
Yes.

104
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,050
The city is full of police who are doing blind inspections!

105
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,590
Why are they doing this to you?

106
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,130
How could they call you a spy?

107
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,620
It's also dangerous for you so I'll tell you later.

108
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,180
Is this it?

109
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,280
It will be dangerous right now

110
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,730
so don't stay together but hide.

111
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,380
I will take Doo Hak.

112
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,360
Where are you going?

113
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,470
Wouldn't it be better not to know, just in case something happens?

114
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,100
 Yes.

115
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,470
What is the reason you're going this far?

116
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,290
I killed him.

117
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,650
He was working with Lee Doo Hak.

118
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,240
He even threatened your mother with the death of Lee Doo Hak's father.

119
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,570
So...

120
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,230
I killed him in order to protect our family.

121
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,070
However, a wiretap device was found on Team Captain Oh's body.

122
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,270
Lee Doo Hak was recording it.

123
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,850
I mean it.

124
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,190
I never knew I'd be betrayed by a subordinate I trusted.

125
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,830
Still, I don't think it's right to kill Lee Doo Hak.

126
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,800
Then tell me if you have a better way to protect our household, our family.

127
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,270
Don't worry.

128
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,630
Your father will take care of everything.

129
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,060
Nothing will happen to our household.

130
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,500
I knew you would come.

131
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,860
Recently, things have become a bit noisy.

132
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,420
It appears so.

133
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,190
Didn't I warn you already, Chairman?

134
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,600
But still, a spy?

135
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,650
Then are we getting arrested, too?

136
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,050
Of course not.

137
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,810
Chairman, you were just used by him.

138
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,930
All you need is to get investigated in the process.

139
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,570
And once we take care of Lee Doo Hak, our business will proceed as planned.

140
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,590
Is this the work of the young prosecutor, or—

141
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,640
What do you mean, "work"? In this day and age.

142
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,450
Then are you saying he's really a spy?

143
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,490
That makes no sense!

144
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,090
That's not important.

145
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,420
If it's what you've decided, then that's that.

146
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,880
I will cut ties with him.

147
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,020
What's important is our business.

148
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,580
You are wise.

149
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,850
Then I will leave with that in mind.

150
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,000
- Boat? 
 - Yes.

151
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,160
You know the boat captain that I asked to smuggle you out last time?

152
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,750
Stay on that boat for the time being.

153
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,520
You could just leave as well.

154
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,900
I can't do that. I don't want to leave again.

155
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,360
I can just visit where you are, Doo Hak.

156
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,550
They are likely watching all escape routes by boat.

157
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,690
Also, that captain would have seen the news.

158
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,170
No matter how much money you give him, would he help a spy?

159
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,340
Then what do we do?

160
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:49,260
Nobody would hide a spy, unless he were a spy himself.

161
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,130
Hwang Choong Sung, that evil b*stard!

162
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,340
How could he frame someone as a spy?

163
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,780
I should turn myself in.

164
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,340
What?

165
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,490
 [Office for Lease: 150 pyeong (5300 sq ft)

166
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,470
Prosecutor Kim Sung Yeob.

167
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,340
Here.

168
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,510
Homeless man?

169
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,150
You live alone after your divorce, right?

170
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,780
Aigoo, I live simply since I'm alone.

171
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,520
Sit down.

172
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,500

173
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,210
You will remarry soon.

174
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,930
Suddenly?

175
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,890
Will you introduce me to someone to marry?

176
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:38,250
Aigoo, who would marry me when my wife ran away from me?

177
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,500
Great things are coming your way.

178
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,620
Then you could get your ex-wife back.

179
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,930
"Great things"?

180
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,630
With that slush fund ledger you gave me?

181
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,050
Is that even trustworthy?

182
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,400
What would make you believe me?

183
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,230
If he's trying to kill me due to that slush fund ledger,

184
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,350
would you believe me?

185
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,940
Listen.

186
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,730
You're saying the NSA Director who could cause a flying bird to dive into the water

187
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,070
would try to kill a homeless man?

188
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,340

189
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,180
You...

190
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,180
"Lee Doo Hak"?

191
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,900
That spy that Hwang Choong Sung fabricated is me.

192
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,730
Now will you believe me?

193
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,800
Gosh, this is...

194
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,040
If I just catch the spy,

195
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,250
I would become a daebak hit as a prosecutor.

196
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,990
That could be the case.

197
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,560
What's the reason I need to help a mouse trapped in a corner?

198
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,180
Since that mouse sometimes bites the nose of the cat.

199
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,980
The article is ready for release, right?

200
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,030
Well, yes. It's almost ready.

201
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,270
After some editing,

202
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,140
this report will turn the world on its head in a week's time.

203
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,830
No.

204
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,820
- Publish the article quickly tomorrow. 
 - Excuse me?

205
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,350
Gosh, I think that would be difficult.

206
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,000
I mean, the printer is closed–

207
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,360
Do you prefer to have a hard time or close your business?

208
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,800
It's better to have a hard time.

209
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,700
So I'm telling you to go to your office right now.

210
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,200
 Then what about me? What do I need to do?

211
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,880
 First, we need to deal a blow to them.

212
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,850
 "Sisabakgyeok," which reported on the alleged corruption

213
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,130
 in the Suseo preferential housing sale,

214
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,470
 even revealed that there was a tape recording of collusion

215
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,110
 at a gathering of some individuals involved in the corruption.

216
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,660
 Reporter Min Taek Gi will deliver this news.

217
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,730
 This is a famous social club in Gangnam where high-ranking social figures often visit.

218
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,610
 In a secret room here, Chairman Geum of Changsung Group,

219
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,130
 the Director of the Ministry of Works, and the salon owner, Ms. Kang,

220
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,950
 reportedly discussed preferential sales of Suseo housing sites.

221
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,890
 Let's listen to their conversation.

222
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,550
 I don't know.

223
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,670
  I'm also requesting a special sale

224
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,380
  by forming an association with certain organizations and media companies.

225
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,500
Hello?

226
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,560
Is the person in the news really you?

227
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,300

228
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,710
Were you also unaware of this?

229
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,190
I asked if you didn't know about this!

230
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,010
I heard she was investing a bit into Chairman Geum's business.

231
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,450
But I didn't even imagine it had to do with Suseo preferential housing sales.

232
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,390
Still, you should have told me!

233
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,330
It seemed something Mother was keeping from you.

234
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,500
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,980
They dare go against me?

236
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,880
How dare they take our family lightly?

237
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,620
Send the press team to do a search and seizure of Sisabakgyeok!

238
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,280
And... investigate everyone who's connected to Lee Doo Hak!

239
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,200
Move, move.

240
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,690
Please move.

241
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,570
All right.

242
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,300
Yes. Understood.

243
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,510

244
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,600
I have a warrant for a search and seizure.

245
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,120
Please cooperate with us.

246
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,300
Do whatever you want.

247
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,500
Let's start.

248
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,000
Wow! When did you become the publisher of a news magazine?

249
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,680
I told you.

250
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,940
I will protect Doo Hak myself.

251
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,200
Hey, Jung Shin. Hyung Doo Hak could really die like this.

252
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,830
Look at that. His opponent is the governmental powers.

253
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,610
What if you get hurt, too?

254
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,200
Cheol Woong.

255
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,380
There's one thing I learned from watching a lot of good movies.

256
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,170
People get more severely drunk from power than alcohol.

257
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,240
But those who have a knife

258
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,660
wield their knife, holding it upside down when they are drunk.

259
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,490
Instead of holding the knife handle,

260
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,790
they hold it by the blade and wield it,

261
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,940
even though they are bleeding profusely from their hand.

262
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,300
People without knives win not because they are strong.

263
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,180
So don't be so cocky.

264
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,670
You know this since you're smart.

265
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,710
Hey, Jung Shin, don't be like this.

266
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,960
There's a limit to how far I can protect you.

267
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,230
It's okay.

268
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,140
I won't die from getting struck a bit by that knife handle.

269
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,660
Also, I really don't know where Doo Hak is.

270
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,280
He didn't tell me, either.

271
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,340
I ended up in charge of the investigation.

272
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,240
- Congratulations. 
 -  What do you mean, congratulations?

273
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,870
 It's thanks to your hard work, Homeless Man.

274
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,730
Also, should I also connect the NSA slush fund files?

275
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,020
You can't release all of that at once.

276
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,570
He will deny or minimize the charges, and there will be external pressure too.

277
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,400
And I may be arrested as well.

278
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,520
We need some time for now.

279
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,350
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,470
I really didn't know it was an illegal preferential sale.

281
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,830
Was what I did not enough for you?

282
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,560
I wasn't being greedy for my sake.

283
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,280
I know that your dreams are big.

284
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,680
You need to enter the next presidential elections, and

285
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,990
you also have plans for after that.

286
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,560
Later on, Cheol Woong will follow in your footsteps.

287
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,720
That's why... to store up as much wealth...

288
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,770
If I did anything wrong, I'll receive the punishment.

289
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,960
I will hand myself over to the prosecution

290
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,680
so you aren't affected negatively in any way.

291
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,360
Please take care of Cheol Woong, Honey.

292
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:10,490
Cheol Woong is really our son, right?

293
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,820
I will protect our family so don't worry.

294
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,420
Honey.

295
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:28,340
When all of this is taken care of, I would like to dance with you again.

296
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:34,010
Next time, I will practice so I can dance even better.

297
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,560
I love you, Yeo Jin.

298
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,830
Even the Blue House? How much did you give them?

299
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,340
About 150.

300
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,630
Then you must have given some to the ruling party, too.

301
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,530
What about the opposing party?

302
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,770
I gave to them as well.

303
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,050
Did you really lobby (solicit) the opposing party?

304
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,250
Yes.

305
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,510
It was less than the ruling party, but yes.

306
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,970
Deputy Director, I can survive this, right?

307
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,280
I'm not doing this to save you, Chairman.

308
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:26,840
But if I die, you know no one else could survive.

309
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,910
That also includes your wife.

310
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,710
I'm sorry.

311
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,540
Even if you retain your life, you should be ready to give up an arm or so.

312
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,290
 It's me.

313
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,050
 They paid both the ruling and opposing parties.

314
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,810
 Please tell His Excellency

315
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,840
that both parties should stop making it bigger and do a deal.

316
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,610
 Also, they must agree to a joint strategy

317
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:01,340
and wrap things by punishing assemblymen linked with Chairman Geum.

318
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,160
 Of course, some would have to be sacrificed.

319
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,190
And a public apology should be issued.

320
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,390
All right.

321
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,740
All right!

322
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,050
Let's start again.

323
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,080
Gosh, I'm hungry.

324
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,150
Well, please order me a bowl of beef bone broth soup.

325
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,040
Gosh, it's so good.

326
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,310
Please eat up.

327
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,250
I only did what my superiors told me to do.

328
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,460
I mean it.

329
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,100
We already have the recording of you three.

330
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,280
I was just visiting Chairman Geum, who frequents my establishment.

331
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,180
 And I merely invested in his business since he recommended it as a good opportunity.

332
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,260
If I knew it was illegal,

333
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,310
as a wife of a government official,

334
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,610
would I do something to cause harm to my husband?

335
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,050
Excuse me? What do you mean let go of the case?

336
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,940
I'm just getting started!

337
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,390
Another team will handle it.

338
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,510
Just ignore it and come off the case.

339
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,060
Seriously, why are you doing this to me?

340
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,960
You told me to do my work properly at one point!

341
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,240
Only if this was a normal case!

342
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,170
 I mean, I'm not Superman.

343
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,790
The higher-ups are pressuring me. What could I do?

344
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,890
Please have some self-respect!

345
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,490
How will you face your juniors later?

346
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,870
Gosh, seriously!

347
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,800
D*mn it.

348
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,390
Then shouldn't we release the slush fund ledger?

349
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,230
If we release an article now, they will bury that as well.

350
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,250
Then what do you want to do?

351
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,070
Isn't that ledger the reason he's framing you as a spy?

352
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,210
There is a different reason.

353
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,740
What is that?

354
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,640
What is it?

355
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,920
I asked what it was!

356
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,400
By chance...

357
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,670
do you have the evidence as well?

358
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,230
Please give me a little time.

359
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,500
This... How does this make any sense?

360
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,700
Just a few underlings were put in jail, with a public apology!

361
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,670
They think of the public as dogs and pigs!

362
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,710
No wonder our country is in such a mess!

363
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,900
D*mn it! I should just shave my head and go into the mountains (monk).

364
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,510
Jung Shin–

365
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,210
Who are you?

366
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,920
It's my guest.

367
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,360
CEO Shin, I'm sorry, but could you leave us?

368
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,180
Oh, okay.

369
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,960
What is this?

370
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,560
The reason he's framing me as a spy.

371
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,520
- What? 
 - This is...

372
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,770
my last bomb. If I set this off,

373
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,300
I can bring down Hwang Choong Sung and Choi Cheol Woong in one blow.

374
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,320
 Does anyone else besides you know this fact?

375
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,300
 You're the first one I told, Deputy Director.

376
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:24,000
 For my family, please be loyal to the end...

377
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,350
Doo Ha, Doo Hak...

378
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,740
Hwang Choong Sung will go to jail,

379
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,300
and Choi Cheol Woong will also fall.

380
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,170
So what are you hesitating for?

381
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,960
Perhaps...

382
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,040
I may be punished for setting up the slush fund and fleeing by boat.

383
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,400
What can we do? You are being framed as a spy.

384
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,860
There isn't any other way.

385
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,290
I'm thinking of making one final offer.

386
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,830
With whom?

387
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,610
With Hwang Choong Sung?

388
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,820
Would he take our offer? No!

389
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,740
He will try to kill you as soon as he sees you!

390
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,990
Jung Shin.

391
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,200
Will you go with me?

392
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,040
Do you want to die?

393
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,790
I'll make this short, Ma'am.

394
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,780
This is Deputy Director and Cheol Woong's lives,

395
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,790
also your life as well.

396
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,250
What?

397
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,610
 Deputy Director...

398
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,830
 For my family,

399
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,460
 please be loyal to the end...

400
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,190
No way...

401
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,620
Where did you fabricate something like this?

402
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,040
You dare threaten me!

403
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,100
Then why else is he trying to frame me as a spy and kill me?

404
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,620
You...

405
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,410
- You! 
 - I will make this short.

406
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,300
Please tell the Deputy Director.

407
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,980
Clear my name of being a spy, and let me, Jung Shin, and my family

408
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,330
go to a foreign country and live quietly abroad.

409
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,900
- What? 
 - Whether Cheol Woong is ostracized by society or not

410
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,020
is now up to you, Ms. Kang.

411
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,580
I'll give you 24 hours.

412
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:46,990
If you try to lure me in with lies and do something,

413
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,160
that recording will be released to the public instantly.

414
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,560
- Lee Doo Hak, this b*stard! 
 - Honey!

415
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,850
Do you think I'll lose to that thug b*stard?

416
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,300
I, Hwang Choong Sung?

417
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,470
Don't worry. That b*stard will be caught soon.

418
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,740
I will kill him.

419
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,190
I will kill him myself with my own hands!

420
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,200
But if that tape is released publicly–

421
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,410
Who'd believe that thug b*stard?

422
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,500
Also, all the media outlets are censored right now.

423
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,990
Still, if something goes wrong,

424
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,920
you are also at risk due to my investigation.

425
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,530
Nothing will go wrong.

426
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,420
I cannot bend down for that guy.

427
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:31,490
So... don't ever bring that up again.

428
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,480
Honey.

429
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,250
Honey...

430
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,410
I'm sorry

431
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,490
and thank you.

432
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,750
Yes.

433
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,140
Don't worry and just trust me.

434
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,510
Now, you're all I have.

435
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,850

436
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,370
Mom.

437
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,040
You should go inside and get some sleep.

438
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,430
Please?

439
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,190
You're going to collapse like this!

440
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,940
Jung Ok.

441
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,320
I must have committed some great sin in my past life.

442
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,110
If it wasn't for that, this couldn't happen to me.

443
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,860
Mom...

444
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,440
This can't be happening to me.

445
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,310
Ms. Kang.

446
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,500
Doo Hak's mother...

447
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,710
Cheol Woong...

448
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,790
Please save my dear Cheol Woong.

449
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,990
Excuse me?

450
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,110
So for my Doo Hak and Cheol Woong to both live,

451
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,800
Doo Hak can't ever release the tape recording he has.

452
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,400
Is that what you're saying?

453
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,050
That's right.

454
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,410
But what is that tape recording?

455
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,100
I can't tell you that.

456
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,090
If you find out what that is,

457
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,920
you would also be in danger, Doo Hak's mother.

458
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,600
What is it that it's so scary?

459
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,190
In any case, if people find out what that is,

460
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,440
Doo Hak will die,

461
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,770
and Cheol Woong will also die.

462
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,850
Please...

463
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,390
please dissuade him from doing so!

464
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,100
If they could just live, I should hold him back.

465
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,210
I should hold him back with my life on the line!

466
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,000
Cheol Woong.

467
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,670
What brings you here, Ahjumma?

468
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,940
I came because I was worried.

469
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,560
I see.

470
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,220
They say Doo Hak is a spy, but I have no idea what they mean.

471
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,320
I can't go to sleep since my heart pounds so hard.

472
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,500
First, take a seat.

473
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,340
What did you call me here for?

474
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,650
Just wait a bit.

475
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,050
Doo Hak!

476
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,860
- Doo Hak. 
 - Mom, what are you doing here?

477
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,680
What in the world is going on?

478
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,100
Are you all right?

479
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,330
You're not hurt anywhere?

480
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,800
- I'm fine. 
 - What's the meaning of this?

481
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,640
You said you were coming alone!

482
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,260
I called him to try and find the best solution together.

483
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,700
Why? You think I'd do something to harm him?

484
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,600
So did you get an answer from him?

485
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,230
What answer?

486
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,630
What is he talking about?

487
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,630
I asked your father for a favor.

488
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:48,400
To send Doo Hak and Jung Shin... and their families safely abroad

489
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,200
- and settle that as an exchange. 
 - Mother!

490
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,910
We must save Doo Hak, too.

491
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,720
Who gave you permission?

492
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,160
You don't want Doo Hak to die, either.

493
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,980
I didn't know you cared about me so much.

494
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,530
And Father? Does he permit this?

495
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,860
He needs some time.

496
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,920
Doo Hak, I'll convince him for sure

497
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,650
so give me some more time.

498
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,160
That's enough, Mom.

499
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,340
This has nothing to do with you.

500
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,190
You know what the tape holds.

501
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,200
If your father falls, you and me, we all go down.

502
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,560
- You just stay put. 
 - Sh*t!

503
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,060
No need to say more.

504
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,460
Hand over the tape and turn yourself in.

505
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,270
That's your only way to live.

506
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,660
Turn myself in?

507
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,140
On top of framing me for your murder,

508
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,990
you want to frame me for your dad's murder too?

509
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,840
You little...

510
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,530
Doo Hak! Cheol Woong! You two mustn't fight like this!

511
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,760
You absolutely must not!

512
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,430
Madam, we can't keep it a secret any longer, Madam!

513
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,980
Y-You two are brothers.

514
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,840
You're both...

515
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,800
brothers whom I...

516
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,440
gave birth to.

517
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,700
Mom, what are...

518
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,470
Mom, what are you talking about?

519
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:20,460
Mother, what you said when you were drunk last time...

520
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,790
Ahjumma, what are you saying?

521
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,640
Why would I be your son?

522
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,900
Mother, say something.

523
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,460
Madam... tell them.

524
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,040
You need to tell them now.

525
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,450
You said we must save both of them!

526
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,600
Everything is my fault.

527
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,300
- Cheol Woong... 
 - She's right.

528
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,110
I adopted you.

529
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:05,600
But... I raised you as if you were my own.

530
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,600
So... let's save your hyung.

531
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,300
Let them live abroad.

532
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,010
Doo Hak,

533
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:20,370
let's burn that tape for the sake... of your younger brother.

534
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:24,740
Cheol Woong is your brother by blood,

535
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,460
but also Deputy Director's "son."

536
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:33,280
We need Deputy Director for Cheol Woong to live out his dream.

537
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,120
Do as Madam Kang says.

538
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:43,480
I... I can't live if you die,

539
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,510
nor can I live if Cheol Woong dies.

540
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,250
Please...

541
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,230
Don't say something so absurd.

542
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,890
Just to get that tape...

543
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,070
Mother, gosh...

544
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,870
Why would you make up something like that?

545
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,420
We didn't make this up.

546
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,690
Deputy Director knows as well

547
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,300
that you're not his biological son.

548
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,970
Then...

549
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,700
is Hyung my biological brother?

550
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,950
Cheol Woong...

551
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,420
Why did you do it?

552
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,770
It wasn't enough to fool me my entire life.

553
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,950
And you tell me Deputy Director is my birth father.

554
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:50,610
Why did you do it? Why? Why?

555
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,570
It was for you.

556
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:56,100
- Everything was for you. 
 - "It was for you."

557
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,340
"It was for you." That's enough!

558
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,250
I'm sick and tired of that, Mom!

559
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,110
You should have told us sooner!

560
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,950
Why?

561
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,970
I... I didn't think it would come to this.

562
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:20,280
This is all because of your stupid mom.

563
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,270
Everything is my fault!

564
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,060
I'm sorry!

565
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,450
I'm really sorry...

566
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,610
Cheol Woong,

567
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,460
let's stop now.

568
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,970
What do you want me to do?

569
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:57,180
Does the fact we're biological brothers change anything?

570
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,240
It does.

571
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:11,870
My entire life... suddenly feels a lot more unfair.

572
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:18,020
It would have felt less unfair if you were just a rich bloke.

573
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,540
But it's more unfair because you're my brother, you b*stard!

574
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,470
Stop!

575
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,850
Both of you, stop. Okay?

576
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,560
Let's leave for now, Doo Hak.

577
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,140
Let's go.

578
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,080
- Who says you could move? 
 - Hey, Choi Cheol Woong, are you insane?

579
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,850
Cheol Woong, don't! Don't!

580
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,550
He's your biological brother, Cheol Woong.

581
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,660
Cheol Woong, you can't.

582
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,210
Leave the tape behind.

583
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:51,230
Then I'll convince Deputy Director to send you abroad.

584
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,950
I can't do that.

585
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,410
It's my lifeline.

586
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,530
Just go. Just hurry and go!

587
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,520
Don't you hear me?

588
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,810
Choi Cheol Woong, have you gone insane?

589
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,120
Cheol Woong...

590
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,430
Move, Jung Shin.

591
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,800
If you will kill Doo Hak, shoot me first.

592
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,430
Cheol Woong,

593
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,370
what kind of man are you?

594
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,420
Did you even know Hwang Choong Sung killed our father?

595
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,370
What?

596
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,930
Wh-What are you talking about?

597
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,480
Who killed whose father?

598
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,340
That's a lie.

599
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,450
That's all a blatant lie!

600
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,380
She's right.

601
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,080
Ahjussi Joong Oh was killed by Oh Man Ok.

602
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:52,930
Oh Man Ok ordered someone to kill our father and set it up as a hit-and-run.

603
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,560
Is...

604
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,700
Is this true?

605
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,750
But did you know?

606
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:05,840
The one who ordered Oh Man Ok to do that was Deputy Director Hwang.

607
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,880
- The reason was– 
 - Stop! Enough!

608
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,350
Cheol Woong, that's all a blatant lie!

609
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,980
Mom, you stay out of this!

610
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,550
Tell me.

611
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:22,800
She feared her lie would be exposed about you being Deputy Director Hwang's son.

612
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,960
That woman you believed to be your mother orchestrated it!

613
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,060
No!

614
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,370
No!

615
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,230
No!

616
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,270
No...

617
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,780
No...

618
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,770
Enter!

619
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,420
It's all over.

620
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,850
Hand over the tape and surrender.

621
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,610
You did well, Honey.

622
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:55,500
You're all really... wicked until the end.

623
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,270
This is the only way we can all survive.

624
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,990
Hurry and convince him to surrender.

625
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,020
No need for him to surrender! Just shoot him.

626
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,350
- Honey... 
 - Hurry up and shoot him!

627
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,440
Then this will all end.

628
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,080
Don't worry about the aftermath.

629
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,500
- I'll take responsibility. 
 - Honey...

630
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,630
You're not my son if you don't shoot now!

631
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,740
Father...

632
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,810
No! No, Cheol Woong.

633
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,270
I beg you, please don't.

634
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,790
He's your hyung. Cheol Woong...

635
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,480
Cheol Woong. Cheol Woong!

636
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,970
Pull the trigger!

637
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,390
"Son"?

638
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,950
Am I your son, Deputy Director?

639
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,930
Is that why you committed murder because of me?

640
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,090
Choi Cheol Woong.

641
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,320
Team Captain Oh... and Ahjussi Joong Oh...

642
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,800
I mean... my biological father!

643
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,530
Is that why you killed them?

644
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,230
Finish him.

645
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:23,870
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

646
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,030
You crazy... Choi Cheol Woong!

647
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,810
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

648
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:32,500
No!

649
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:39,510
♫  Above the rough sky, my heart floats away  ♫

650
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:46,240
♫  Only your name is engraved like this  ♫

651
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,990
Doo Hak!

652
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,770
Doo Hak.

653
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,040
Doo Hak!

654
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,830
Doo Hak...

655
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,450
Doo Hak wouldn't have been shot if you had come just a bit earlier!

656
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,050
I'm sorry. I was gathering the guys.

657
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:27,100
This hyung is always a bit late.

658
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,410
Jung Shin, did you call him?

659
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,100
How could I trust Cheol Woong's mom?

660
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,540
I prepared for this just in case.

661
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,820
It's all over now.

662
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,280
It's all over, Doo Hak.

663
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,090
Hyung!

664
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,170
Watch out!

665
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,210
- Hyungnim. 
 - Hyungnim!

666
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,100
Hyungnim!

667
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,960
Drop your guns!

668
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,340
Put down your weapons!

669
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,170
Move it!

670
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:33,320
 What? Mobilize the police force this instant?

671
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,270
 Do you think that makes sense?

672
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,060
 If you don't mobilize,

673
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,690
 all the witnesses and evidence will disappear.

674
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:46,270
 Yes, come in.

675
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,640
 Jjajangmyeon delivery.

676
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,920
 What the heck?

677
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,500
 I never ordered jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles).

678
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:57,610
 Someone ordered it, and it's all paid for.

679
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,510

680
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,480
 Enjoy the food.

681
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:12,000

682
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,030
Let go!

683
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:45,630
- Come here! 
 - I didn't do anything!

684
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,120
My baby, Doo Hak...

685
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,980
You're okay, right?

686
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,690
Yes...

687
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,360
You can live.

688
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,770
You can live, Doo Hak. You can live.

689
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,340
Just hang in there, okay?

690
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,100
- Jung Shin. 
 - Yes?

691
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:13,420
I'm going to... live with you, no matter what.

692
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,050
Okay. Let's live together.

693
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:19,420
So you can't close your eyes, okay?

694
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,110
I won't close my eyes

695
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,720
since you'll disappear.

696
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,960
Don't worry.

697
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,590
I won't leave your side.

698
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,850
I'll be right here.

699
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,140
So, Jung Shin...

700
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,910
let's... live down in Yeosu.

701
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:44,790
Sure, let's do that.

702
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,790
We'll have babies...

703
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,610
and watch movies...

704
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,900
Sure.

705
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,450
Hey, Cheol Woong.

706
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:59,610
Yes, Hyung. Go ahead.

707
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,130
You'll come with us, right?

708
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,080
Of course.

709
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,510
Let's go to Yeosu.

710
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,840
Cheol Woong.

711
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,040
Hyung, I'm sorry.

712
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,100
I'm sorry for everything.

713
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,200
I'll turn myself in for every crime I committed against you,

714
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,630
and I'll accept all punishment.

715
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,790
So stop lying here and get up. Okay?

716
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,890
Get up!

717
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,390
No, don't do that.

718
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,130
It's all in the past.

719
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,400
Jung Shin.

720
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,780
Yes.

721
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,640
Cheol Woong.

722
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,100
Mom.

723
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,040
Yes. Yes...

724
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,210
Let's go live down in Yeosu.

725
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,480
No! No! Wake up, Doo Hak!

726
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,720
Wake up!

727
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,480
Someone call the doctor! Hurry!

728
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,660
Put him on my back!

729
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,230

730
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:09,130

731
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:17,000
Deputy Director, my name is Kim Sung Yeob, Prosecutor of Special Investigations.

732
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,030
You're now...

733
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,590
Please...

734
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,000
Please wait outside for a moment so I may change my clothes.

735
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:58,800

736
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,450
May we come in now?

737
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,390
(TN: Hospital Regulations)

738
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,310
 Why did you do it, Mom?

739
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:31,810
Yes.

740
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:34,610
It's true I lied about...

741
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,860
everything.

742
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,550
You know how

743
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,440
I said I can do

744
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:48,800
anything if it's for you?

745
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,560
That's the truth.

746
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:58,110
Regardless of who birthed you,

747
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:03,570
you're... my baby.

748
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:07,770
You're my son.

749
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:11,140
- Mom. 
 -  So, my son,

750
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:14,010
come back.

751
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,490
Okay.

752
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:17,900
I'll go back, Mom.

753
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,780
But... it will take some time.

754
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,520
That's okay.

755
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,130
I'll wait for you however long it takes.

756
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,060
Okay.

757
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,120
Cheol Woong.

758
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,560
Yes, Mom.

759
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:44,550
Can you tell me you love me... just this once?

760
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:48,050
I love you, Mom.

761
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,960
Thank you.

762
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:56,800
I love you, too, my son.

763
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,080

764
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:34,350

765
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,050
Honey...

766
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,150
Cheol Woong said he loves me.

767
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:47,000
Cheol Woong...

768
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:51,540
is our son.

769
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,740
When Cheol Woong comes back...

770
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,990

771
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:03,880
I'll do everything for him.

772
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:09,110

773
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:11,110

774
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,730
You must return to your room now.

775
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,740
Please come with us.

776
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,040

777
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,200
Oh my gosh.

778
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,470
How in the world?

779
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:46,170
I lived in ignorance since coming here.

780
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,590
Living in ignorance is better.

781
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:50,310
Oh, gosh.

782
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:53,090
What should we do about our poor ahjussi?

783
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:56,170
I feel so sorry for Doo Hak, too.

784
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:02,080
Thinking back, these past years were like a dream.

785
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:06,330
Only if I didn't come to Yeosu from Goheung to get married...

786
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:11,880
After having Doo Hak, if I had Jung Ok instead of Cheol Woong...

787
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,370
No...

788
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:17,070
if I had just held on to Cheol Woong,

789
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,850
this all could never happen.

790
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,690
I feel sorry for Doo Hak's father.

791
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,730
I feel sorry for Doo Hak.

792
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:32,600
I feel sorry for Cheol Woong.

793
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,330
I feel sorry for you too.

794
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,600
Right.

795
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,360
I feel sorry for myself, too.

796
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:50,130
By the way, what will you do now?

797
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:53,390
Will you continue to live in Seoul?

798
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:54,930
That's one of my worries.

799
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:58,440
Actually, why don't you just come back here?

800
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,690
There are vacant houses near my home.

801
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,740
We also have usable farmland.

802
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,920
I'll look into everything for you.

803
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,910
Will you?

804
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:14,720
I guess I'm sick and tired of Seoul.

805
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,770
There's nowhere to call home.

806
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,670
Exactly.

807
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,100
Oh my.

808
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,140
Let me go buy some sweet potatoes.

809
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:36,030
♪ I will go ♪

810
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:40,340
♪ I will leave ♪

811
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:50,340
♪ Holding my young son's hand ♪

812
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,370

813
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:04,020
Brace yourselves, all right? Let's go.

814
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,580
How many do you give?

815
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,400

816
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:13,940
What is it?

817
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:17,580
I'm Doo Hak's mother.

818
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:23,580
The movie is almost over so could you wait just a bit?

819
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:27,520
While enjoying these?

820
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,560
Thank you, Ma'am.

821
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:38,590
As a matter of fact,

822
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:42,360
I was a bit hungry coming all this way.

823
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,540
Let's have some before we go in.

824
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,260
Let's eat before we go in.

825
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,840
Enjoy them.

826
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,930
Enjoy.

827
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,060
Enjoy.

828
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,500
Enjoy.

829
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:34,100
Let's watch this properly.

830
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:39,350
Every bone in my body aches so I can't help slouching.

831
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:41,800
I guess...

832
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,920
what would you two know when you've never been shot?

833
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:52,240
Anyway, this place changed so much.

834
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,060
Right.

835
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,830
Movies are best when you watch them by sneaking in through the backdoor.

836
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:01,600
After I handed it to my aunt, she sealed that door.

837
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:07,000
And it's most thrilling when you watch while avoiding the schoolmaster.

838
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,590
That's right.

839
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:10,650
Times have changed.

840
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:14,230
The people are the same.

841
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:17,040
We've come back here.

842
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,910
It doesn't even take half a day here from Seoul.

843
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:25,110
We really took a long way back, right?

844
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,560
Do you all want to go back?

845
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,100
- Yes. 
 - No.

846
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,180
You two are brothers. Try to get along.

847
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,040
I don't want to.

848
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,700
- Me, neither. 
 - Why not?

849
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,890
See?

850
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:40,330
He always acts like he lets me win, but he doesn't.

851
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,300
Look at how much trouble you caused. Hey...

852
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,300
I won't clean up after you anymore.

853
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,680
Clean up after me?

854
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,650
Whom should I hit first?

855
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:53,630
Cheol Woong first.

856
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,960
Forget it.
