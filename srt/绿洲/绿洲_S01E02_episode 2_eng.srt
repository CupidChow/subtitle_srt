1
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,160

2
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:59,140

3
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,500
As such, the prosecution is indicting Choi Cheol Woong the

4
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,220
fine for assault ₩100,000 (75 USD, $425 in 1975).

5
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,310
For Lee Doo Hak...

6
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,590

7
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,850
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,420
Didn't I tell you that I will watch a movie today?

9
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,190
I forgot.

10
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,840
I feel you're slacking off (lazing) these days.

11
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,020
Do you want me to hit you with my nunchucks?

12
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,280
One of them came, but didn't the other?

13
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,090
I should just beat up these guys!

14
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,290
Of course, he'll come. Just wait a bit.

15
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,250
Oh, that scared me!

16
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,260
Gosh, that took me by surprise.

17
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,790
Gosh, seriously!

18
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,350
 First, I'll meet you.

19
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,420
 But with whom?

20
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,310
 I don't know. Let's wait and see for that.

21
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,130
 How can I pick when I've only seen you a couple times?

22
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,770
 How long will you wait and see?

23
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,990
 For about a year?

24
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,150
 Until then, we can meet as friends. Happy?

25
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,080
He really became gutsy (bold), hasn't he?

26
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,400
Would he dare stand up Oh Jung Shin?

27
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,150
Do you think he forgot?

28
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,790
"He forgot"?

29
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,700
You guys are just the same!

30
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,280
What are you guys, brothers?

31
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
Let's just go inside by ourselves.

32
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,440
W-Wait, let's not do that.

33
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,860
How about we wait for him a bit longer?

34
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,020
I'm dating you! I'm not dating Cheol Woong!

35
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,780
Cheol Woong doesn't know that yet...

36
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,260
I will tell him today.

37
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,260
It's time for the movie to start. Let's go inside.

38
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,220
W-Wait.

39
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,370
Gosh, I don't think we should.

40
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,560
Let's look around for Cheol Woong a bit more.

41
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,890
You just wait here.

42
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,770
I'll be right back after circling the block.

43
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,010
Hey!

44
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,900

45
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,860
Look! It's Choi Cheol Woong.

46
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,900
 Come see our new and latest products!

47
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,410
 Please come!

48
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,270
What? Look at this b*stard.

49
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,590
Where did you hide your money?

50
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,950
The money...

51
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,300
It's my family's bank so try going to the bank, you b*stard.

52
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,720
Gosh, look at this crazy b*stard.

53
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,090
Just see how he talks to a hyung.

54
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,930
You haven't had enough, you b*stard.

55
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,760
Cheol Woong!

56
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,070
- Are you okay? 
 - Oh my!

57
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,210
Go away.

58
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,260
I told you to go away!

59
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,800
Just leave me alone!

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,340
Hey, Choi Cheol Woong.

61
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,630
Is she your girlfriend?

62
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,330
She's so scary, much scarier than you.

63
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,500
What are you guys, thugs?

64
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,230
Piss off (get lost) before I report you guys!

65
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,700
Oh my! Oh my!

66
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,930
Let's go, Choi Cheol Woong, please!

67
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,110
Let's quickly go.

68
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,540
Hey.

69
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,580
Let go of me!

70
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,510
You f***ing pieces of trash!

71
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,970
This rude b*tch!

72
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,730
You f***ing son of a b*tch!

73
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,490
No, Cheol Woong! No!

74
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,190
Let's just report them! You can't do this!

75
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,170
Put that away!

76
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,340
Someone, save us!

77
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,790
Someone, save us!

78
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,810
I thought educated guys wouldn't use weapons.

79
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,800
Stay still!

80
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,350
I might have to start wearing a steel plate underneath my shirt.

81
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,110
You try wielding a knife at me again.

82
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,880
I'll crush you then.

83
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,810
Let's go.

84
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,550
Let's go!

85
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,660
Are you okay?

86
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,590
Are you okay? Oh, no...

87
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,240
You...

88
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,590
That f***ing son of a b*tch!

89
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,060
I'll kill him with my own hands!

90
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,890
No, Cheol Woong! It's okay.

91
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,880
- Don't fight him. Let's just report him. 
 - No.

92
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,950
I will pay him back ten, no, a hundred times for this!

93
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,360
No, Cheol Woong. Doo Hak will be here soon.

94
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,540
Let's just go to him.

95
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,280
Why?

96
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,970
Are you saying I should tell on them to Hyung?

97
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,190
Why are you being like that when we're friends?

98
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,100
"Friends"?

99
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,900
"Friends"?

100
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,950
I'm back.

101
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,710
Hey, you don't stop by Cheol Woong's school after you finish school, right?

102
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,570
Oh, I went a few times, but Cheol Woong said I didn't have to come anymore.

103
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,720
 Cheol Woong.

104
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,740
 Cheol Woong!

105
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,640
 Let's at least go to the pharmacy to treat your wounds.

106
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,740
 Didn't you say we should stay friends for a year?

107
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,990
 You said it,

108
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,480
 that you can't pick since you only saw us a couple times.

109
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,190
 My feelings just turned out like that.

110
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,810
 I understand.

111
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,760
 So quickly go home.

112
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,760
 Cheol Woong. Doo Hak is waiting for us–

113
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,460
 I don't want to see the two of you today!

114
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,800
 That's how I feel!

115
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,120
 Cheol Woong!

116
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,610
 Cheol Woong.

117
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,330
 It's me.

118
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,090
I heard you got hurt. Did you get in a fight?

119
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,040
Am I someone who would go around getting beaten up?

120
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,220
I got a bit hurt after tripping.

121
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,260
Did you get hurt badly?

122
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,430
Let me see your wound.

123
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,400
I'm fine so just go.

124
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,910
What are you talking about?

125
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:48,260
Come on, let me see it!

126
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,390
I told you I'm fine!

127
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,570
Who messed you up like this?

128
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,480
What do you mean someone hit me?

129
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,350
I told you I just tripped!

130
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,210
Just go away!

131
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,230
Mom.

132
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,240
Why are you here?

133
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,900
I was worried about the boy.

134
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,460
Whom did he fight with?

135
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,750
He says he just tripped.

136
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,520
Do you actually believe that?

137
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,270
Cheol Woong is too proud to admit it, even if he did get hit.

138
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,800
I told you to just leave, didn't I?

139
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,900
Cheol Woong, it's me.

140
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,160
Hyung just left a moment ago.

141
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,050
It's not about that.

142
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,260
I just heard you got hurt a little bit.

143
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,770
I bought this at the market last time.

144
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,190
It's made in the U.S.!

145
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,630
It's really good for bruises or sprains.

146
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,470
I tried using it before

147
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,440
 and the next day, it didn't hurt at all anymore!

148
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,980
What are you doing here?

149
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,330
Oh, it's not like that, Ma'am... Oh, no...

150
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,930
 I just heard Cheol Woong was a bit hurt

151
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,440
 so I brought him good ointment.

152
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,510
We have first aid medication at our home, too.

153
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,840
Also,

154
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,300
even if we neighbors are comfortable with each other,

155
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,860
isn't it too rude of you to enter our place at this late hour

156
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,260
without permission?

157
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,620
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,960
Doo Hak, you, too.

159
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,680
Don't come here when it's late.

160
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,300
Okay.

161
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,930
Let's go.

162
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,220
Just get going.

163
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,330
Aigoo! I have no affection for her whatsoever!

164
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,750
She's so young, yet she thinks she's the wife of a lord!

165
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,930
But who beat up Cheol Woong like that?

166
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,260
When he was hanging out with you, things like that never happened.

167
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,100
Gosh, when your father said he'd send you to agricultural high school,

168
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,270
I should have done everything to stop him!

169
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:28,150
Are you upset that I went to an agricultural high school, or that Cheol Woong was beaten up?

170
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,480
I'm upset about both.

171
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,000
Both.

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,970
Gosh.

173
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,780
I'm sure I told you not to come.

174
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,900
I didn't come to go with you.

175
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,240
Jung Shin said she really needed to see you tonight.

176
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,800
She says she has something to tell you,

177
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,340
where we ate grilled clams.

178
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,810
What about you, Hyung?

179
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,140
I'll come later.

180
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,210
I'm ashamed of myself, Oppa.

181
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,210
He's quite an amazing man.

182
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:26,140
But would he reject our nomination and run independently?

183
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,320
I know it's like hitting your head against a brick wall.

184
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,900
I'll do whatever I can to make him reconsider.

185
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,080
We don't even have money so how could he run independent of a party?

186
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,740
He kicked aside a feast table for him. How do you stop him?

187
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,190
Madam Kang, you're going through a lot after marrying a lofty-minded man.

188
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,960
Okay. You can go now.

189
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,920
And take this with you.

190
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,590
- No, how could I? 
 - Just take it.

191
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,970
This is probably the money you gathered from your emergency funds.

192
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,700
Use it to provide for your household.

193
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,800
No, I–

194
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,260
I'm sorry, Oppa.

195
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,130
What's the likelihood Choi Young Shik will be elected?

196
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,750
Well...

197
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,320
I also spoke to Korea Central Intelligence Agency.

198
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,360
- What did they say? 
 - It's likely he will receive more than 30% of the votes.

199
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,520
 So he may come out on top, winning the election.

200
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,090
 Really?

201
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,410
 He's got quite a following in the region as a familiar face,

202
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,080
 and he has afterglow of his father being an independence movement leader.

203
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,770
Have you looked into his weaknesses?

204
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,540
His history is clean with both his business and women.

205
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:12,630
If you had not done something about it in advance,

206
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,140
it would have been quite the headache, Commander.

207
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,800
I am Ki Young Tak.

208
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,420
Do you want to get expelled and go to prison?

209
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,040
I'm sorry!

210
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,590
I won't ever bully these guys again.

211
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,190
I mean it, I swear!

212
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,130
What?

213
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,200
That's not what you need to do.

214
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,790
You know him, right?

215
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,880
Oh, yes.

216
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,570
He always goes everywhere with the guy he calls Hyung.

217
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,480
Choi Cheol Woong.

218
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,800
Yes.

219
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,160
Well, all you have to do is get beat up by Choi Cheol Woong a bit.

220
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,240
If you bleed, even better.

221
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,880
Excuse me?

222
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,930
Seriously.

223
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,730
Yes, yes.

224
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,990
Don't you love me?

225
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,650
Gosh, this b*stard.

226
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,500
How could you turn your back on me?

227
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,320
Gosh, this b*stard, seriously!

228
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,640
He's so weak!

229
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,740
I'll go to throw up.

230
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,060
What's this?

231
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,840
Jung Shin isn't coming.

232
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,920
Also, I heard what this b*stard did.

233
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,750
Did I ever tell you to do this, Hyung?

234
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:24,310
I was going to beat him up even without your help, Hyung.

235
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,730
What? Do you think I would lose?

236
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,350
Do you think that I would lose to someone like him?

237
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,640
Hurry up and ask for his forgiveness.

238
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,850
And say that you won't ever bother him again.

239
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,160
Are you joking?

240
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,880
You're a man, yet you bring another; can't you beat me on your own?

241
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,490
You idiot.

242
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,120
Hey, Ki Young Tak. What did you say, you b*stard?

243
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,840
Forget it.

244
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,910
You should stay out of this, Hyung.

245
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,770
Cheol Woong. You should stop.

246
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,450
I already beat him up enough.

247
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,600
I told you to move aside.

248
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,740
What are you going to do?

249
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,700
I can get over me getting hit,

250
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,300
but this b*stard...

251
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,480
This scum hit Jung Shin!

252
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:18,800
Even I can't forgive him so you shouldn't forgive him all the more!

253
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,780
Since you guys decided to go out,

254
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,800
isn't that right?

255
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,440
Did Jung Shin really get hit by this creep?

256
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,770
Hey, Ki Young Tak.

257
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,760
It's great not having your minions here.

258
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,280
I will fight you one-on-one, fair and square.

259
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,110
If you win, I'll give you money too.

260
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,650
But if you lose, you will die here.

261
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,640
You got that?

262
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,850
You talk too much.

263
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,780
- Hey. 
 - Let go of me!

264
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,260
You can't beat me, a**hole!

265
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,150
- Fight me. 
 - Get up, you b*stard.

266
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,220
Got it?

267
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,650
I told you to get up!

268
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,150
Don't come over here!

269
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,800
If you get involved, I won't hold back, even if you're my hyung.

270
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,440
The most disgusting people in this world are the ones

271
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,410
who rely on their connections to bail them out like you!

272
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,720
Don't ever act like you're all that in front of that girl.

273
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,450
Are we finished here?

274
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,610
I can go now, right?

275
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,970
Cheol Woong!

276
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,910
Get up and fight me again!

277
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,390
I told you to get up.

278
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,500
Ki Young Tak, wake up.

279
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,630
Young Tak!

280
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,730
Wh-What's this?

281
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,990
Is he dead?

282
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:14,350

283
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,580
Hey, Young Tak!

284
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,110
Ki Young Tak!

285
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,010
Gosh, darn it!

286
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,110
Doctor!

287
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,980
Yeosu Police Station received a call from a hospital.

288
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,750
Two students brought in an injured Ki Young Tak on their shoulders,

289
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,350
and he's currently in a coma.

290
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,010
He won't die, right?

291
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,720
Hyung, people don't die that easily, right?

292
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,660
He won't die.

293
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,250
He'll definitely live.

294
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,020
Cheol Woong.

295
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,430
Let's turn ourselves in.

296
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,770
Even if he were to survive, we should pay the consequence.

297
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,270
Hyung. I didn't do anything wrong.

298
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,890
This is self-defense.

299
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,160
Okay, so let's go to the police station and tell them.

300
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,780
I-I can't!

301
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,860
I won't go!

302
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,990
Also, is this my fault?

303
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,880
When did I ever tell you to bring that b*stard, Young Tak, to me?

304
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,670
You tricked me by lying to me.

305
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,710
You said Jung Shin wanted to see me.

306
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,610
Didn't you bring that rat, knowing full well

307
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,310
that I would do something to him if you brought him?

308
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,160
So all of this is your fault, Hyung.

309
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,560
Am I wrong?

310
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,190
I asked if I'm wrong!

311
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,950
You're right.

312
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,420
I guess this was all my fault.

313
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,540
It's all my fault.

314
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,750
No...

315
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,280
I must have lost it just then.

316
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,790
I'm the one who struck him with a rock.

317
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:15,640
All you did was try to help me, Hyung.

318
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,570
Right?

319
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,900
Hyung, I'm so scared.

320
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,400
If that b*stard dies,

321
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,340
I would become a murderer and go to prison.

322
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,800
Can my father become an assemblyman? Forget that! He'll face public shame.

323
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,330
And my mother, who sees me as her only hope, will collapse.

324
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,700
What should I do, Hyung?

325
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,600
What do I do?

326
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,560
Hyung.

327
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:56,230
Can't you please save me just this once?

328
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:01,790
Can't you tell them that you were the one who hit Young Tak with a rock instead of me?

329
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,810
Cheol Woong...

330
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,820
Hyung. Hyung, Hyung!

331
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,500
Please save me!

332
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,450
If you do this for me just this once, I will take responsibility for your life!

333
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:24,120
No, I will devote my life to becoming successful, and I'll give you all I have.

334
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,750
I know, Hyung, that you always gave up a lot for me.

335
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:33,630
But really, I'll let you live as the one on top instead of me.

336
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:39,270
Hyung... Please save me this once!

337
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,610
Hyung...

338
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,040
Why should I do that?

339
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:57,340
You're the one who did that; why do I have to take the blame?

340
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,390
Both my father

341
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:05,590
and I lived like your servants all our lives!

342
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:10,050
Why do I have to take the blame for something like this as well!

343
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:16,610
Is it fine for you to live and for me to die?

344
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:21,390
Is your life a human life, and mine a dog's or pig's life?

345
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,180
Hey.

346
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,310
What are you doing not going to bed?

347
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,530
Ahjussi, if something goes wrong with Cheol Woong,

348
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,910
I, my husband, and our entire family will die.

349
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,310
I'm begging you. Please save him...

350
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,910
You're my only hope, Ahjussi.

351
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,000
- The only one who can save our family– 
 - Ma'am!

352
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,260
I've never said no to anything you requested of me.

353
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,810
But...

354
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,600
But this... I don't think this is right.

355
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,750
How could I do that to Doo Hak just to save Cheol Woong?

356
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,020
Ahjussi!

357
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,960
Once my husband gets elected, he will make sure he gets out of prison in no time.

358
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,330
- I will make sure that happens! 
 - Darn it!

359
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,930
I will make sure to hire the best lawyer available.

360
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,700
Ahjussi...

361
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,150
If my husband loses the election, we will all die.

362
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,190
Only if he wins the election will we all live.

363
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:41,370
Please, I beg you! Save us!

364
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,670
Save us, Ahjussi!

365
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,830
Gosh, darn it...

366
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,010
Ahjussi, Ahjussi!

367
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,680
No, Ahjussi, please!

368
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,150
Save us, Ahjussi, please!

369
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,830
No, Ahjussi!

370
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,960
Let me go!

371
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,670
- No! 
 - Ahjussi, Ahjussi!

372
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,560
Ahjussi!

373
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,070
No, no! Ahjussi!

374
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,890
 Ahjussi!

375
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,990
I'm really sorry!

376
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,280
Just this once,

377
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,720
please save me just this once!

378
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,670
Please save me this once!

379
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,340
- Please save me this once! 
 - Ahjussi!

380
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,200
Ahjussi...

381
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,950
Gosh, darn it, you b*stard!

382
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,320
Why did you do this, you b*stard?

383
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,200
Why did you do that?

384
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,430
- Ahjussi! 
 - Please, just this once...

385
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,570
Please save me just this once.

386
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,100
Doo Hak...

387
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,760
Wait!

388
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,440
You must have made a mistake.

389
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,730
My son is surely not someone who would do that.

390
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,900
Please look into it again before you come.

391
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,950
We're going to question him when we get to the police station so just wait a bit.

392
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,920
What do you mean by "question him"?

393
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,190
You can ask all in this neighborhood,

394
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,750
if there is anyone as studious and upright as my Doo Hak!

395
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,400
If you keep doing this, I'll also take you in for obstruction of justice!

396
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,590
Go ahead! Go ahead and take me in!

397
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,510
Take me in, too!

398
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,730
You can't take my child!

399
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,920
You can't!

400
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,350
Doo Hak, hurry and tell them it's not you!

401
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,320
Tell them that you did nothing wrong!

402
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,620
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

403
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,210
Hey, Officer Kim and Officer Park! Why aren't you doing anything?

404
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,000

405
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,230
Doo Hak...

406
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,360
Doo Hak, what's going on?

407
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,740
Gosh, what's with this girl now?

408
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,030
It's not you, right?

409
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,090
You would never do something like that. Right?

410
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,550
Hey, Lee Doo Hak!

411
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,010
Look into my eyes and tell me.

412
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,180
You're not the type of guy who would do that. Right?

413
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,730
It's not you!

414
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,340
Please step aside.

415
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,870
Please wait!

416
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,600
Lee Doo Hak! Lee Doo Hak!

417
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,660
Doo Hak, Doo Hak.

418
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,760
Cheol Woong, Cheol Woong, you know it, right?

419
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,810
Doo Hak isn't someone who would do that.

420
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,980
Choi Cheol Woong, Lee Doo Hak!

421
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,740
Answer me!

422
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,410
Please, just a moment! Guys! Just a moment!

423
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,990
Doo Hak!

424
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,130
Doo Hak!

425
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,510
Doo Hak!

426
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,550
Doo Hak...

427
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:39,650
do not forgive your father...

428
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,520
Doo Hak! You can't take my child away!

429
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,470
You can't take my child away!

430
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,830
No, you can't! You can't take him!

431
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,940
You can't do this!

432
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,820
- Mom! 
 - Doo Hak.

433
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,720
- Mom! 
 - Doo Hak.

434
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,370
Doo Hak!

435
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,370
- Doo Hak! 
 - Mom! I'm sorry!

436
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,210
Doo Hak...

437
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,730
Those mean b*stards...

438
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,010
Take me with you!

439
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,770
You can't take my child away!

440
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,170
 What? His friend confessed to the crime?

441
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,130
Yes, his name is Lee Doo Hak.

442
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,880
He testified that when he saw Choi Cheol Woong get severely beaten up by Ki Young Tak,

443
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,740
he struck Ki Young Tak with a rock.

444
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,580
This won't do!

445
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,530
Lee Doo Hak is useless to me!

446
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,160
Keep delaying the court date until after the election.

447
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,810
We must make Choi Cheol Woong, son of Choi Young Shik, into a murder accomplice.

448
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,240
Understood.

449
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,300
  - Lee Jeong Nam, Lee Jeong Nam! 
 - Choi Young Shik, Choi Young Shik!

450
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,130
  - Lee Jeong Nam, Lee Jeong Nam! 
 - Choi Young Shik, Choi Young Shik!

451
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,810
I am Candidate 2, Kim Wang Geun!

452
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:40,920
I'm Candidate 3.

453
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,860
 Please. Thank you!

454
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,940
  - Lee Jeong Nam, Lee Jeong Nam! 
 - Choi Young Shik, Choi Young Shik!

455
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,450
Everyone!

456
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:51,760
Shouldn't we end the dictatorial regime this time

457
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,280
and move toward the democracy we long for, everyone?

458
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,790
Thank you!

459
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,280
Yes, thank you!

460
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,790
Choi Young Shik, the father of a murderer, should resign!

461
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:13,120
 Choi Young Shik, the father of a murderer, should resign!

462
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,480
Choi Young Shik, who raised a murderer, should go away!

463
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,120
Everyone! Yes, although there was an unfortunate accident,

464
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,850
- that has nothing to do with my son– 
 - Resign!

465
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,660
 Resign!

466
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,880
 Resign!

467
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,920
 Come to your senses!

468
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,830
 Resign!

469
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,490

470
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,990

471
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,660
So didn't you tell me that Cheol Woong was a material witness?

472
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,880
You said he didn't fight him!

473
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,140
Why did you lie? Why?

474
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,420
Supposedly, he did get into a fight.

475
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,660
But supposedly, Cheol Woong was getting beat up.

476
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:08,850
After seeing that, Doo Hak got angry and struck the guy with a rock.

477
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,110
No.

478
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,670
That's not true. The Doo Hak I know would never do that.

479
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,570
By chance, is our Cheol Woong responsible for this mess?

480
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,870
Honey!

481
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,520
Honey.

482
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,450
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

483
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,860
Tell me the truth!

484
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,470
Mr. Choi.

485
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:50,350
That day, Doo Hak told me everything.

486
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,500
He said he did it.

487
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,680
Is that true?

488
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,880
Yes...

489
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,920
It's the absolute truth.

490
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,940
Then what about the fight?

491
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,670
Who was the one who started the fight?

492
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,540
W-Well...

493
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,910
- about that... 
 - Hyungnim.

494
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,220
Please tell me.

495
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,360
It's true that Cheol Woong started it.

496
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:51,560
It is true that my son was involved.

497
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,260
Because of a loser like me,

498
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,340
you all have gone through a lot.

499
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,390
I don't know what to say.

500
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:07,340
Truly, I'm sorry.

501
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,390
No, you can't!

502
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,050
You must not resign from the election!

503
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,140
The murderer is Doo Hak, not Cheol Woong!

504
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,600
Also, even if you are not elected as first place,

505
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,370
you could still be elected in second place!

506
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,970
It's all over.

507
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,100
How could someone so false like me serve in office?

508
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,010
It's not over.

509
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,810
- We can't let it be over! 
 - Honey...

510
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,840
Do you know how much money we poured into this?

511
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:42,380
If we back out now, we will lose our lumber mill and farmland too!

512
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,850
Did you... secure even the farmland as collateral?

513
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,610
Yes!

514
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,730
I bet my life on your election.

515
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,710
If you resign here... we'll be going down as a family.

516
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,510
Why a public attorney?

517
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,340
Didn't Cheol Woong's father say he'll provide an expensive lawyer?

518
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,820
Doo Hak's father... refused.

519
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,420
As such, the prosecution is indicting Choi Cheol Woong the

520
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,860
fine for assault ₩100,000.

521
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,100
For Lee Doo Hak, for bodily injury resulting in death,

522
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,370
a maximum of five years

523
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,300
or a minimum sentence of three years imprisonment.

524
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,030
Aigoo...

525
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,500
My poor child...

526
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,500
How on Earth?

527
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,920
Attorney. Last defense, please.

528
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,240
Defendant, are you regretful?

529
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,300
Yes.

530
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,510
Your Honor, the defendant says he's regretful.

531
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,680
No way!

532
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,070
This can't be!

533
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,900
Aigoo...

534
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,770
This is the verdict.

535
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,900
Do you call yourself a father?

536
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,180
How could you still call yourself a father?

537
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,050
Why didn't you let us use a good lawyer?

538
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,590
For what?

539
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,170
You also know well what Mr. Choi's finances are like!

540
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,890
Also, if he committed a crime... he needs to be punished.

541
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:12,090
The dead child's parents probably have a stake in their hearts!

542
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,930
How could we be shameless to lighten his sentence?

543
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,940
Doo Hak!

544
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,040
- Please stand back.
 - Lee Doo Hak!

545
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,520
♫  I want to hold on your hand  ♫

546
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,550
♫  I want it to be like a birthday  ♫

547
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:48,280

557
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,840
It wasn't me.

558
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,130
♫  Let me go, in my life  ♫

559
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,120
Hey.

560
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,720
Hey, you.

561
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,470
Wake up.

562
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,530
He's about to die!

563
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,960
Call an ambulance, you punks!

564
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,960
What the heck are you doing?

565
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,720

566
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:22,070

567
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,390

568
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,680
Hey, Jung Shin.

569
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,170
Choi Cheol Woong?

570
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,860

571
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,120

572
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,820
Did you watch this movie?

573
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,340
Not yet.

574
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,110
What about this one?

575
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,940
I haven't watched...

576
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,630
that one yet, either.

577
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,230
Hey, don't you even have a girlfriend?

578
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,980
Not having watched stuff everyone else watched?

579
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,730
You're right.

580
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,940
Come to our theater.

581
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,500
Your noona (older "sister" of male) will let you in free at Projection.

582
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,730
Well, that sounds great, free movies.

583
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,640
By the way...

584
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,990
why didn't you let me know?

585
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,670
Oh, my dad's passing?

586
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,380
I didn't want to bother you to come down from Seoul.

587
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,390
It must have been hard on you.

588
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,970
I'm sorry.

589
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:50,810
A friend should have been by your side at such a time.

590
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,320
I'm okay.

591
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,050
My relatives are helping me out a lot, too.

592
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,650
Anyway, why are you going down when it's not even  vacation?

593
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,700
I'm going to Dad's memorial service.

594
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,600
Right. It was about this time of year.

595
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,080
Gosh, we're so in the same boat.

596
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,690
Never mind.

597
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,940
You're a college student, and I'm a business owner who quit school.

598
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,670
It will take you at least 20 years to become a business owner.

599
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,360
What about Hyung Doo Hak?

600
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,260
I haven't heard that name in a while.

601
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,940
I don't know.

602
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,230
I guess you can say he was gone with the wind?

603
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,900
What about you? You probably keep in touch with him.

604
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,180
I also didn't get to see him at all.

605
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,510
Why? Weren't you two like brothers?

606
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,870
He always refuses my visit.

607
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,950
Also, my situation is a little troubled.

608
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,770
What's wrong with your situation?

609
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,090
Aigoo, can they really catch spies like that?

610
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,550
Jung Shin...

611
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,740
seems we'll have to watch the movie next time.

612
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,480
Don't ever tell that you know me, okay?

613
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,930
Get that b*stard!

614
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,900
Hey, get that a**hole!

615
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,430
I see you got promoted. Are you going to Seoul?

616
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,290
Yes. I plan to transfer to the reserve force soon.

617
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,570
Why?

618
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:46,180
It's well known that the elder favors you a lot, Oppa.

619
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,330
I'm sick of wandering all my life, and the world has changed as well.

620
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,650
Sir keeps telling me to lead a different task.

621
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,400
What kind of...

622
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,220
Later.

623
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,820
I don't think I can visit too often once I go.

624
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,440
Hang in there. Contact me if you have any problems.

625
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,570
Okay.

626
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:26,340

627
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,650

628
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,960
Was your visit to Seoul all right, Boss?

629
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,850
Are we getting any customers?

630
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,530
As you see, we're selling out every day.

631
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,940
The audience is totally loving it!

632
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,930
Anyhow, just like "Raiders,"

633
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:01,940
if we just say the Hollywood punks made it, it's bound to be daebak (awesome)!

634
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,800
It's an African movie, you idiot.

635
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,130
By the way, the print is too worn out.

636
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,950
So I think we'll have to cut at least 10 minutes of it.

637
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:40,940
How much screen time do you think will remain when we cut it down then?

638
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,230
Since we'll cut out about 20 minutes of 109 minutes,

639
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:47,080
there should be almost 90 minutes left.

640
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,190
Will the audience understand the story then?

641
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,330
Don't cut out too much; just show it as it is.

642
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:55,110
I understand.

643
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,800
- Director Go! 
 - Oh my!

644
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,150
Are you back again?

645
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:04,220
I must get the print today, no matter what.

646
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,740
What's the deal with this little girl?

647
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,170
Who are you, Ahjumma?

648
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,440
If you don't want to get hurt, stay out of this.

649
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,820
How dare this little girl—

650
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,580
Move aside!

651
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,600
I'm sorry. Please come this way.

652
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,430
Okay!

653
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,780
- Without spending a penny, you'll get a lot of... 
 - H-Hey!

654
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,460
advertising tomorrow on the news about the theater!

655
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,630
What are you doing right now?

656
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,260
Is your nose not working?

657
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,070
Don't you smell something pungent?

658
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:32,630
Stop! Have you gone crazy?

659
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,190
Yes. I've gone crazy.

660
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,180
You won't listen to me when I talk sanely

661
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,120
so I must go insane. Am I wrong?

662
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,030
S-Stop! Put that match down right now!

663
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,940
Are you going to give it...

664
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,230
or not?

665
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,740
Darling.

666
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,120
The matches must be wet.

667
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,680

668
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,310
Use that.

669
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:56,630
It's guaranteed to light.

670
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,390
It's made in the U.S.A.

671
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,950
She's gone crazy, right?

672
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,380
Are you going to give it to me or not?

673
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,850
Are you the daughter of Namhae Theater's Mr. Oh?

674
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:13,530
I did hear your father passed away.

675
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:19,550
I felt really bad for not being able to attend the funeral as I was in Seoul back then.

676
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,100
- Director Go. 
 - Yes.

677
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,280
You attended, right?

678
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:28,620
Well, the thing is... I was also busy so...

679
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,890
Is that so?

680
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:37,920
Well, you are always busy with something, Director Go.

681
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:43,590
So the short story is you paid for half the sale price of "Bushman,"

682
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,960
and you were to pay the rest today,

683
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,440
but you will pay after showing it in Yeosu since your finances are in trouble?

684
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,850
That's what you're saying, right?

685
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,350
Yes.

686
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,450
- Director Go. 
 - Yes.

687
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,280
Did our distributing agency ever do that?

688
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,230
It never happened before and will never transpire in the future!

689
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:04,230
- Don't use fancy words. 
 - Okay.

690
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,890
How unfortunate, Agasshi (Young Lady).

691
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,960
He said it won't work.

692
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,040
Will you lend me that lighter again?

693
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,380
Oh my. Th-This wicked—

694
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,200
Director Go.

695
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
Yes.

696
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,430
As soon as we're done with the showing, give her the "Bushman" prints.

697
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,460
Sorry?

698
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,820
Give it to her.

699
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,830
O-Okay, Boss.

700
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:34,130
Boss, thank you so much.

701
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:35,470
Thank you so much, really!

702
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,580
I won't ever forget your favor.

703
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,670
Take your leave.

704
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,460
Thank you.

705
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,290
Wait, Boss. Why are you doing something you don't usually do?

706
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,340
Hey, you a**hole.

707
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,420
Discount her 20% as the print is worn out.

708
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,510
Discount 30% for not doing our human duty and skipping the funeral,

709
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,710
then we don't need the remaining balance.

710
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,000
Do you still think yourself human?

711
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,370
- This little... 
 - Oh my. It hurts.

712
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:08,660
- It hurts so much. 
 - Also...

713
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,520
two years ago, I'm sure

714
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:15,580
you wrote in the ledger ₩50,000 expense as condolence payment for Mr. Oh.

715
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,090
You embezzled that money, didn't you, you b*stard?

716
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,710
Boss.

717
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,980
Gosh, this little...

718
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,350
It hurts.

719
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,710

720
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,650
Boss...

721
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:51,670
Are you coming now?

722
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,560
Why are you sitting there, Uncle?

723
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,690
The chair was so nice and comfy

724
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:07,680
so I was just feeling it.

725
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:11,200
Having competence makes you a boss,

726
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,420
not just sitting in the boss' seat.

727
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,040
Honey, why would you say something like that?

728
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,970
Jung Shin works so hard to keep this theater alive.

729
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,810
So did it come alive?

730
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:26,740
I got the "Bushman" print so I can repay you a portion.

731
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,540
Please take your leave now.

732
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,750
"A portion"?

733
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,210
How much of a portion?

734
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:34,470
Are you even accounting right?

735
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:37,370
Your father alone took 50 million won ($38,000)!

736
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:40,000
I'll repay whatever it is, 50 million or 100 million!

737
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,340
So take your leave now.

738
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,950
How dare you raise your voice?

739
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,610
- What? 
 - Gosh.

740
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:50,900
You have nothing to say, even if I claim this theater as mine right now.

741
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,810
Gosh, Honey.

742
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:55,080
She said she will repay us.

743
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,940
It's not like we're loan sharks.

744
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,790
We can't do this to another family member.

745
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,160
You have no idea what that money means to me.

746
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,070
Since our father left all his inheritance to Oppa,

747
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,100
I had to work like a dog and an ox to

748
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,630
make that money, not spending a single won!

749
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:16,160
Is that why you're playing with interest like a dog and an ox?

750
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,060
What?

751
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,540
I have given you

752
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,560
more than the principal amount in interest already, Aunt.

753
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,180
It was secured as collateral anyway

754
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,010
so if I fail to repay you later,

755
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,740
you can take this theater.

756
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,960
But please take your leave now, I said!

757
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,590
You're finally showing your true colors!

758
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,010
All right.

759
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:40,620
If you don't repay me within this year,

760
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,410
- this theater is mine! 
 - Aigoo, let's go. Come on.

761
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,830
How dare she raise her voice when she owes us money?

762
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:48,260
What has this world come to that

763
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,470
scammers and debtors are so shameless?

764
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:54,570
Aigoo, Jung Shin, we're leaving now.

765
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,660
Aigoo.

766
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:18,190

767
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,530
What about Cheol Woong?

768
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:23,960
I waited at the station all this time, but I didn't see him yet.

769
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,420
What could be the matter?

770
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,150
He said he'll come down for sure, though.

771
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:32,500
What could have possibly happened?

772
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,070
The last bus comes one hour later.

773
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,180
So I'll go out to the station one more time and wait.

774
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,300
Okay.

775
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,750
The night air is cold.

776
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:43,170
So please go inside now.

777
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,160

778
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,280

779
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:21,140
 I heard your father passed away.

780
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,350
 And you left college.

781
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,490
 I heard everything from Jung Ok.

782
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,290
 I see.

783
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:33,880
 I mean, Father has been sick for a long time.

784
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,320
 So I've been preparing myself.

785
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,840
 I'm okay.

786
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,320
 I'm really okay.

787
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,040
 Jung Shin...

788
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:47,710
 please stop coming now.

789
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,770
 Is something wrong?

790
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,360
 I...

791
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,110
 don't have the confidence.

792
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,300
 Let's break up.

793
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,140
 Hey, what the heck are you saying?

794
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,140
 You can get back on your feet with no problem.

795
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,690
 You passed the GED and you can get into a college, Doo Hak.

796
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,080
 I've...

797
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:09,060
 been thinking hard for a long time.

798
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,320
 All this happened because of you.

799
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:15,590
 What do you mean?

800
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:19,890
 I wouldn't have competed with Cheol Woong if you had not shown up.

801
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,220
 More than...

802
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,030
 Cheol Woong,

803
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,490
 when I heard you got hit by Young Tak,

804
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:27,910
 I already

805
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:30,440
 wanted to kill that b*stard.

806
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,880
 It wasn't an accidental death by assault.

807
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,370
 I really wanted to kill him.

808
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:42,860
 Lee Doo Hak... are you filming a tear-jerker?

809
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:46,440
 Do you feel sorry for me that my father passed away and I quit school?

810
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,520
 So since you're a murderer whose future is doomed,

811
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,710
 will you step out of my life for me, although it breaks your heart?

812
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:53,440
 Is it something like that?

813
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,270
 Did I say I'll marry you or something?

814
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:04,020
 It makes me feel even more miserable if it was out of pity.

815
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,350
 You're really...

816
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,780
 Whatever you say doesn't matter to me,

817
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,680
 but what's certain is...

818
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:17,470
 that you're a worse prison than this place.

819
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:25,330
 Please let me go now.

820
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,390
 I mean it.

821
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,740
 Lee Doo Hak...

822
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,610
 Lee Doo Hak!

823
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:50,110

824
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:51,540

825
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,780
Down with dictatorship!

826
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,380
Fight for democracy!

827
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,840
Down with dictatorship!

828
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,300
Fight for democracy!

829
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,740
Down with dictatorship!

830
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:01,090
Fight for democracy!

831
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,120
- Down with dictatorship! 
 -  Down with dictatorship!

832
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,750
 Fight for democracy!

833
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:16,430
 Down with dictatorship! Fight for democracy!

834
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,230

835
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,710
Gosh, let me go—

836
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,580
He's the instigator.

837
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,440
Get that b*stard!

838
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,520
Who are you? What?

839
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,220
What are you scheming?

840
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,240
Take off the gas mask.

841
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,680
I don't know who you are,

842
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,740
but thank you anyway.

843
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:00,390
Hyung?

844
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,070
Hyung Doo Hak.

845
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:04,360
You.

846
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,310
What's the deal with you?

847
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:10,690
Do you want to get locked up that badly?

848
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,770
Didn't you say you'll take responsibility for my life?

849
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:18,670
You said you'll be successful in your life and repay me, you a**hole!

857
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,620
Where did the pure Lee Doo Hak go?

858
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:50,570
Don't you know our positions changed now?

859
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:53,530
Back then, my father owed your family a debt.

860
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,060
Now, you owe me a debt.

861
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,500
Isn't that right?

862
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,720
That's right.

863
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,910
Therefore, from now,

864
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:04,360
I'll have you work as my underling,

865
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,270
a very hardworking one.

866
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:08,550
Would there be any question about that?

867
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:10,680
Order me to do whatever you want, Master.

868
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,230
I'm not joking, you a**hole!

869
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,580
Hey.

870
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,310
Quit your protesting right away and

871
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:23,380
prepare for the bar exam.

872
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:26,330
If you put your mind to it, you can pass the bar exam.

873
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,900
Become a prosecutor.

874
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,230
"A prosecutor"?

875
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:35,320
By what I experienced in jail, prosecutors seem to be the most powerful.

876
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,780
Well, have you visited home yet?

877
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:44,420
Are your mom and dad doing well?

878
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,410
Jung Ok must be all grown up, too.

879
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:47,930
Where do you live now?

880
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:51,930
I didn't visit home; my mom and dad aren't doing well.

881
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:54,250
Jung Ok is grown up, and I live in Seoul.

882
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:55,470
Happy now?

883
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:00,330
Here's my address and contact info.

884
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,580
Your dad and mom...

885
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,840
probably miss you a lot, Hyung.

886
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,420
Oh, I also met Jung Shin.

887
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,300
She seemed to be suffering a lot.

888
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,380
She quit school and

889
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,820
from what I hear,

890
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:21,550
her aunt from Seoul is trying to take away the theater.

891
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,730
Don't even think of avoiding my contact.

892
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,550
Why would I avoid your contact, Hyung?

893
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,700
I'm pleased and glad to see you.

894
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,010
Pass the exam before graduation.

895
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:50,010
It's an order.

896
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,720
In that case...

897
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,830
what will you do in the meantime?

898
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:59,070
I must keep an eye on you.

899
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,800
Take care, Hyung!

900
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,820
 Also, what's the name of my mother's younger brother?

901
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,780
 What's the younger brother's name?

902
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,250
-  It's Soon Man. 
 - That's right.

903
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,530
Soon Man!

904
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:32,610
-  And also— 
 - After him...

905
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:33,540
That's right.

906
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,790
They found her. They did.

907
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:38,400
 They're both fine.

908
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,980
-  Also, what's the name? 
 - Sorry?

909
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:40,960
 The name of the girl...

910
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:46,200
Wait, are those punks coming or not?

911
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:57,570

912
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,780
I got my eyes on a good one.

913
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:13,470
Let's go and pluck fresh eyeballs (real estate scams).

914
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:14,640
Do we even have a target?

915
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,870
Wait, I think everyone is here.

916
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:19,670
Why don't you give details?

917
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:21,090
Wait a minute.

918
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:24,370
One more person will come, okay?

919
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,030
- It's a cop! 
 - What—

920
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,840
Gosh...

921
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,410
Hey, quickly come inside.

922
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:34,470
All right now. Gather around.

923
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:39,300
All right. Let me introduce the last member of our team.

924
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,930
Who's this baby?

925
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:49,720

926
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,590

927
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:57,890

928
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,550
How pretty.

929
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:06,290
How gorgeous.

930
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,400

931
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,780
Oh! Poop at home.

932
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,610
Did you bring it?

933
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,020
- Bring it in three days. 
 - Okay.

934
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,860

935
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,360

936
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,760

937
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:45,370

938
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,250

939
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:01,750
Hey!

940
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,230
- Why? 
 - Why aren't you doing your errand right?

941
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:05,540
I bought an apple just like you told me to.

942
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,780
Try taking a bite. You try it!

943
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:10,420
I told you to buy a Fuji apple, didn't I?

944
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,120
This is a Jonathan apple!

945
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,590
I mean, what's... what's the difference?

946
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,970
A-Aigoo, sh*t.

947
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:21,800
Gosh, I knew it. Noonim...

948
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,230
- Gosh, it's the same. 
 - This little...

949
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,460

950
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,250
The rice was cooked perfectly.

951
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,830

952
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:58,670
Well, it's not too bad.

953
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:01,490

954
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:03,310

955
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,470

956
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:14,710
- Are you happy now? 
 - Yes, l-let me see.

957
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:20,820
Aigoo, had you done this earlier, we wouldn't have had to raise our voices.

958
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:25,210
Aunt, you also stamp your seal here.

959
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:26,840

960
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,960
Gosh, why do we need a seal between us?

961
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,230
If you just repay the money, I'll give you the theater back right away.

962
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:42,090
She's right. There needs to be trust between an aunt and a niece.

963
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,240
That's true for other families.

964
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:48,420
Our family is exceptionally special.

965
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,940
Aren't we?

966
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:02,480

967
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:12,250
Aunt, Uncle!

968
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,220
You'd better not forget your promise.

969
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,240
Of course! Don't worry.

970
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,830
That's right.

971
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:21,220
We moved our office, Jung Shin. Okay?

972
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:25,490
Stop by when you come to Seoul. I will treat you to Chinese food, your favorite.

973
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:27,370

974
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:35,850
 From what I hear, her aunt from Seoul is trying to take away the theater.

975
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,180

976
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:09,660

977
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:13,440
♫  I want to hold on your hand  ♫

978
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,310
♫  I want it to be like a birthday  ♫

979
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:25,080
♫  No matter you will be here, Forever Love, the only one  ♫

980
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:29,700
♫  I want to look at your mind, hate me or nice  ♫

981
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:33,440
♫  Let me in your beautiful life  ♫

982
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:41,300
♫  Come over here, back in your love, in my life  ♫

983
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,980
♫  Let me go  ♫

984
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,050
♫  In my life  ♫

985
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:48,910

986
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:51,930
 You said one of your aunts owns a theater in Gwangju, right?

987
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:53,440
-  My mom's cousin. 
 - Get lost.

988
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,610
 Don't meet Doo Hak again. Nothing good will come from being connected with him.

989
01:07:56,610 --> 01:08:00,520
 I'm not sure. He just seems changed as a person.

990
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,730
 I don't care about the money, but you should give me that.

991
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:03,830
 It has a proper owner.

992
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,390
 Let's not live in shame.

993
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:06,950
 We can't live shamefully.

994
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:10,120
 Even in the worst situation, I did my best not to be shameful.

995
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,690
 What's this place for?

996
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:13,260
 Can't you tell from just looking?

997
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,510
 Hyung, don't you want to go down to Yeosu once?

998
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:17,140
 You also miss Jung Shin, right?

999
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:19,200
 Gosh, go there if you want, you punk!

1000
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:22,740
♫  No matter you will be here  ♫
