1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,320

2
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,190

3
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,430

4
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,130
 Come, come!

5
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,930

6
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,070
  Isn't she so cool?

7
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,570
  Let's watch from there.

8
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,190
  Lee Doo Hak!

9
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,630
 Hurry up and come out!

10
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,870

11
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,190
 Let me out!

12
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,930
 Who the heck is that?

13
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,990
 When I get out, you're dead!

14
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,360
Lee Doo Hak.

15
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,350
You have a visitor today.

16
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,770
 Tonight at 8 p.m. in prison building 8,

17
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,730
 there will be disinfection to get rid of fleas, silverfish (wingless insect) .

18
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,640

19
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,450
What are you doing?

20
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,380
Just eat and go. Go and wait for Cheol Woong.

21
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,760
Gosh, he's going to get indigestion like that.

22
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,370
- Add water and eat it. 
 - Yes, Father.

23
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,380
- Me, too! 
 - Hey, Girl!

24
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,920
Your school is nearby so you can eat slowly.

25
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,410
Eat a bit more!

26
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,060
Hey, here.

27
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,320
My son is so handsome.

28
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,460
Study well,

29
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,590
and if you ever get in a fight, don't lose!

30
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,180
Your mom will take care of everything!

31
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,100
Your son doesn't lose in studying or fighting!

32
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,090
Of course, my son!

33
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,130
Drink up!

34
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,540
 Cheol Woong, what are you doing not coming out?

35
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,470
 Doo Hak is waiting for you.

36
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,540
Hurry and go.

37
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,860
Your dad might get angry!

38
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,860
Since I have dinner plans today, I'll be a bit late.

39
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,880
Yes, don't drink too much.

40
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,220
Goodbye!

41
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,890
- Have a nice day! 
 - Have a nice day!

42
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,660
Yes, yes, yes.

43
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,780
- We'll be back. 
 - We'll be back.

44
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,950
- Yes. 
 - It's reassuring to see you two stick together like that.

45
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,800
It's nice to see! You guys look like brothers.

46
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,520
Oh.

47
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,460
What's the matter?

48
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,670
I am pretty much like brothers with Hyung (older brother or male friend).

49
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,680
- We'll be late. Let's hurry and go. 
 - Yes, let's go.

50
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,660
Have a nice day!

51
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,440
What made you come out to see the children off?

52
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:54,190
It's not that I came to see them off, but Kyeong Ja asked me for a bit of help,

53
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,180
just a few dishes like anchovy stir-fry.

54
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,190
Yes, I asked Doo Hak's mother for a bit of help since she's so good at cooking.

55
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,570
How are you so thoughtless still?

56
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,960
The farming work is very busy right now, and how could you call her for something so petty?

57
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,300
No, that's not true.

58
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,060
It's not busy at all!

59
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,980
Also, my family sent me some really nice anchovies so I said–

60
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,160
- Oh, no. 
 - I would do it.

61
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,320
I appreciate your intent, but it's an educational issue so please just go back.

62
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,420
Hurry up and come inside.

63
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,650
Wait!

64
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,770

65
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,130
Get on!

66
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,480
♫  Saying that you'll leave and not return  ♫

67
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,760

68
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,030
It's premiering today, a Saturday (school day in Korea),

69
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,090
in the city.

70
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,960
Supposedly, it's really fun.

71
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,010
What do you think?

72
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,670
Do you want to die?

73
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,450
Also, we're clearly minors; how could we get in?

74
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,650
Geez.

75
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,280
Why do you have so much fear?

76
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,730
We got seats!

77
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,950
Get up.

78
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,410
Get up, you b*stard.

79
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,100
How could second-year students sit down while their hyungnims are still standing?

80
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,230
But...

81
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,180
I don't think you're that old where I should give up my seat to you.

82
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,300
What did you just say, you b*stard?

83
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,760
What, you b*stard?

84
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,560
Did you really get left back a year (grade)?

85
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,700
If you can't believe it, go look up Lee Doo Hak's transcript at our school.

86
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,770
That's a later matter, you f***ing b*stard!

87
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,250
Darn it.

88
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,060
So embarrassing.

89
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,950
You b*stard!

90
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,790
One more punch!

91
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,130
I let down my guard.

92
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,000
Hurry up and hit me.

93
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,410
Hyung! At this rate, we'll be late for school.

94
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,200
Let's hurry and go.

95
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,920
Yes.

96
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,060
Are you happy?

97
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,040
Let's go.

98
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,990
Wait, we're late!

99
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,530
Hey, hey, hey!

100
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,650
Close the gate!

101
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,670
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

102
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,610
Wait!

103
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,330
Gosh!

104
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,080
Should we?

105
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,770
Let's hurry.

106
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,090
Got it?

107
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,470
Does it show?

108
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,990
You're getting better at it each time.

109
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,400
This b*stard!

110
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,420
Your butt has met the wrong owner

111
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,350
and is suffering like this every morning!

112
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,010
Oh, look at these b*stards.

113
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,250
Did the principal say you guys can be late since you do well in school?

114
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,800
You guys are worse, you b*stards!

115
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,260
Worse, I say!

116
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,930
Quickly get up!

117
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,490
Get in the push-up position!

118
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,170
You b*stard! Get in the proper position!

119
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,880
The results of the midterms came out.

120
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,690
Hey, you boneheads, congratulations.

121
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,520
Our class got last place among the second-year students.

122
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,730
Although it's a relief that Choi Cheol Woong placed first in the school

123
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,480
and Lee Doo Hak placed second,

124
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,140
we cannot erase the shame of being in the last place class.

125
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,520
What is a class?

126
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,990
 A community.

127
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,190
Everyone, together!

128
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,610
 Take responsibility.

129
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,820
- Everyone will run five laps around the field! 
 -  Come on!

130
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,790
You b*stards, do you know what kind of a world we live in? Hurry up and go outside!

131
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,780
Hurry up and go outside!

132
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,370
If she didn't like it, then she should just say so.

133
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,210
Education, what?

134
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,200
How much more educated could she possibly be?

135
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,910
That's why I told you not to go.

136
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,810
Why would you go and make trouble?

137
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,580
Also, it's true.

138
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,020
Since she graduated from college in Seoul,

139
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,400
what other woman in this area is as educated as her?

140
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,710
What did you say?

141
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,160
Whose side is this guy taking?

142
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,570
What I'm talking about is housework!

143
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,440
What's so good about graduating from college?

144
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,020
Does she know how to make rice or do laundry?

145
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,770
When it comes to doing housework, I'm pretty much a professor, a professor!

146
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,470
Okay. Then you can be a professor.

147
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,270
I told you thousands of times

148
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,360
that you should stay away from that house.

149
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,380
Geez!

150
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,630
Hey.

151
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,320
O-Over there.

152
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,590
G-Gosh...

153
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:39,630
 In front of the proud Taegeukgi (Korean flag),

154
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,350
 I firmly pledge to devote my body and heart...

155
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,720
Ahjussi (older male or uncle)!

156
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,820
- Ahjussi! 
 - Do you think he would hear if you call like that?

157
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,130
Ahjussi!

158
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,500
- Ahjussi! 
 - What time is it?

159
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,950
It's almost time for it to start!

160
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,940
I'm sure he'll come out.

161
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,180
What if we get caught like this?

162
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,660
What are you guys doing?

163
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,170
Us?

164
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,710
Is there anyone else here besides you two?

165
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,020

166
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,010
Then what about you?

167
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,980
It's clear what this is...

168
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,450
You guys are so naughty, loitering around the back door of the theater.

169
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,360
What? Gosh, this little girl.

170
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,030
Then what are you doing here?

171
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,400
This is my house. Why?

172
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,210
Yes, right (sarcasm).

173
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,310
Did this girl eat popped rice (slang for lying)?

174
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,020
Lies keep popping out of her mouth!

175
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,670
Get lost before I call someone!

176
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,830
So ridiculous.

177
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,360
We're here confidently, having been invited here.

178
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,840
So don't bother the oppas (female's "brother").

179
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,030
Just go over there and play.

180
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,300
Oh, are you here, Jung Shin?

181
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,050
- From the lumber mill? 
 - Yes.

182
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,610
Ahjussi!

183
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,870
Did you call these guys, Ahjussi?

184
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,850
Oh, well, i-it's a long story,

185
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,880
but if I were to explain concisely, I have a friend in the lumber mill, a friend, my friend.

186
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,270
That friend asked me to help these guys watch a movie–

187
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,590
Make them leave right now.

188
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,020
If you don't, then I'll tell my dad!

189
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,670
This girl is too much!

190
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,200
Then what?

191
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,970
Does your dad know you enter that backdoor and watch movies?

192
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,530
- Does he know? 
 - Hey!

193
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,010
Look at this guy!

194
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,700
Who cares? What does that have to do with you?

195
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,800
- Whoa, wow. 
 - They were the ones in the wrong!

196
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,970
Don't be like that.

197
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,870
 - I might not be able to come for a while. 
 - Why?

198
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,830
 I feel like something good will happen.

199
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,000
 What good thing?

200
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,070
I enjoyed the movie, thanks to you.

201
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,470
What are you saying? It's not like she showed you the movie.

202
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,760
If you watched a movie for free at my house, then basically, I showed it to you.

203
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,700
From now, don't you dare come anywhere near here.

204
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,290
- You got that? 
 - Don't you come anywhere near here.

205
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,100
That theater is your dad's, not yours.

206
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,440
Is it yours?

207
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,090
What did you say?

208
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,480
These guys look like freshly dug-up potatoes!

209
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,380
- What did you say? 
 - Potatoes don't like that.

210
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,400
Those guys need to die.

211
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,910
- Okay, all right! 
 - It's going to pop!

212
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,190
Gosh, that thing...

213
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,900
It's so loud.

214
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,730
Wait a sec.

215
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,950
You guys!

216
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,440
Hyung, it's those b*stards.

217
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,810
Look at these crazy b*stards.

218
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,480
- You got a girl to come with you 
 - What do we do?

219
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,750
- to the movie theater? 
 - It's them, right?

220
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,610
Hyung, run.

221
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,880
Run, run! Quickly!

222
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,400
Hurry, hurry!

223
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,760
Hyung, are you all right?

224
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,530
Gosh, this b*stard!

225
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,700
♫  Saying that you'll leave and not return  ♫

226
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,600
Run! Run!

227
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,360
♫  I heard those words in my immature days  ♫

228
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,800
- It hurts. 
 - Are you okay?

229
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,460
♫  My love who left Mansusan (mountain)  ♫

230
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,200
Oh, what do we do?

231
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,060
♫  If I could meet you now  ♫

232
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,790
♫  With my lips filled with joy and sorrow  ♫

233
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,540
♫  I could say everything to you  ♫

234
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:53,600
♫  I lived with the world behind me  ♫

235
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,450
Where did they go?

236
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,940
♫  I lived with the world behind me  ♫

237
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,100
What are you guys doing?

238
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,170
- Oh, oh... 
 - What is it?

239
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,390
A mouse, a mouse...

240
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,320
Just joking.

241
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,340
What are you doing?

242
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,810
Can't I even joke?

243
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,490
All right. Let's go this way.

244
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,510
Well...

245
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,820
This is all my father's lumber mill.

246
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,310
Shouldn't we stop by a pharmacy somewhere?

247
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,370
Her leg...

248
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,660

249
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,620
If I ever see you guys again, then I'll really kill you.

250
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,880
Accomplish: to achieve something.

251
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,930
Adventure: it means an incident or an excursion.

252
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,740
Adventure...

253
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,030
- What are you doing? 
 - Oh, my gosh!

254
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,460
When did you get here?

255
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,000
I just got here.

256
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,250
But why are you so surprised?

257
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,500
Oh, it's nothing.

258
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,830
I was studying vocabulary.

259
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,100
What are you doing? I told you I was studying vocabulary!

260
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,140
"To the girl whose name I don't know."

261
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,750
Gosh, is this studying English vocabulary?

262
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,040
"My name is Lee Doo Hak."

263
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,320
"I felt very sorry and bothered by what happened at the theater"

264
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,990
"so after some thought–"

265
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,150
Is this a love letter you're writing to that girl?

266
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,700
How is that a love letter?

267
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,520
Since she scraped her knee that day, I felt bad and sorry so I just wrote it.

268
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,600
I wasn't even thinking of sending it.

269
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,930
Then why is your face so red?

270
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,220
What?

271
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,250
Well, it's because the sun is hot!

272
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,750
Come on, I know you, Hyung.

273
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,400
Let's be honest with each other.

274
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,270
You probably feel the same as I do.

275
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,460
That girl's face keeps appearing before your eyes,

276
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,700
and you can hear your heart like a drum in your ears, right?

277
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,610
Hyung. Will you be able to beat me?

278
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,670
Who said I would fight with you?

279
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,210
I really don't care so you do what you want!

280
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,510
Gosh, don't play dirty with me.

281
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,260
If you like her, compete for her, fair and square!

282
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,840
Also,

283
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,440
most important are her feelings rather than ours, isn't that so?

284
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,660
She is not unknown to you.

285
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,380
Oh Jung Shin,

286
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,690
a second-year student at Yeosu High School for Girls.

287
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,840
She transferred there early this year.

288
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,920
Her father ran a theater in Seoul,

289
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,360
but he came here to recuperate as he wasn't feeling well,

290
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,600
and she came with him.

291
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:24,560
But do you know what is the craziest piece of info?

292
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,780
- It's not our first time meeting her. 
 - What?

293
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,210
You know...

294
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:36,370
The brass band leader last time from Jinnam Festival, right?

295
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,300
The girl who was twirling the baton,

296
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,670
that's her.

297
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,540
Are you serious?

298
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,540
I should have at least this much information if I want to start.

299
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,730
Don't you think so?

300
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,560
♪  We are the mighty men of South Korea  ♪

301
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,750
♪  We are imposing and brave  ♪

302

304
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,360
- Here, eat up! 
 - Thank you for the food.

305
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,860
Aigoo (shock, surprise), you're here.

306
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,170
Aigoo, everyone is gathered here together, I see.

307
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,330
Aigoo, don't get up. Sit down. Sit down.

308
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,170
Oh, you've come.

309
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,540
Oh, you are all here.

310
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,020
Well, everyone, enjoy yourselves while you're here.

311
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,200
Be careful...

312
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,760
Mr. Choi is a bit drunk.

313
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,720
Hey, Cheol Woong.

314
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,870
Yes, Father.

315
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,590
You need to live like your grandfather.

316
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,640
Do you understand?

317
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:03,050
- Yes. 
 - No matter what anyone says, white is white, and black is black (morals).

318
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,110
Why are you saying that to our child? Please wash up quickly and go to bed.

319
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,850
- Okay, okay. 
 - Aigoo, Hyungnim.

320
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,200
Aigoo, I'm sorry I'm always just causing you trouble.

321
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,590
Then have a safe trip home.

322
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,210
Gosh, Mr. Choi is doing it again.

323
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,830
Hurry inside and get some rest.

324
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,080
Okay, be on your way. I'll...

325
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,100
Oh, okay...

326
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,380
Good night.

327
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,340
Ahjussi, thank you for all your hard work.

328
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,810
Aigoo.

329
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:44,630
It appears your father is upset about a lot of things.

330
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,980
You should understand him, okay?

331
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,790
Okay.

332
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:56,880
When I look at you, Cheol Woong, you take after your grandfather.

333
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:03,810
You will become a great person just like your grandfather.

334
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,880
Well... If I could be like him in the slightest, I would be happy.

335
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,960
Aigoo, how you're also humble!

336
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,860
You are truly an adult, really.

337
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:26,460
♪  I will go; I will leave  ♪

338
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:33,130
♪  Holding my young son's hand  ♪

339
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:39,520
♪  To where we plant potatoes  ♪

340
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,610
Doo Hak.

341
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,800
Your father is in such a great mood today.

342
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,980
Why, Father?

343
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,890
While I was in town with Mr. Choi, I met your teacher,

344
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:57,090
and he said you entered high school with first place.

345
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,200
I heard you also swore the oath as the representative of the entering students.

346
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,850
How come you didn't say anything?

347
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,070
Oh, that... I thought they would tell you to come in and pay for a party.

348
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,160
Although I'm poor and can't afford a cow,

349
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,620
I would have slaughtered a pig for you if you had told me.

350
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,330
In any case,

351
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:24,160
he complimented me for raising you well because you're smart and polite.

352
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:30,410
So I had a nice drink of unrefined rice wine with your teacher.

353
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,770
But...

354
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,310
don't do that in the future.

355
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,570
Excuse me?

356
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,610
What good will come from you exceeding Cheol Woong?

357
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,310
Cheol Woong supposedly cried a lot because he wasn't in first.

358
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,210
It was only then that Mr. Choi told me laughing.

359
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,270
Doo Hak.

360
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,840
Haven't I told you many times before?

361
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,810
A person should know his place.

362
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,900
No matter how smart and talented you are,

363
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,810
if you don't know what's proper, you're no different from a cow or pig.

364
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,590
Whose field is this?

365
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:17,070
Whom have I to thank for learning to read and being able to feed and clothe our family?

366
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,630
That is all thanks to Cheol Woong's grandfather.

367
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:24,790
If you know that, you would be ashamed to even step on the shadow of their house.

368
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,860
So...

369
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,850
don't get first place.

370
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:37,550
I'm telling you not to beat him in whatever Cheol Woong does.

371
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,890
Do you understand what I'm saying?

372
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:51,780
I understand what you're saying, Father, but until when?

373
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,830
Forever.

374
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,660
You can promise me, right?

375
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,920
Yes, Father.

376
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:20,130
I saw this morning that your toe was sticking out of your shoe.

377
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,020
I don't know why that woman brought back such tattered shoes for you.

378
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,650
Can you see anything?

379
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,110
Not yet.

380
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,060
Darn it. Maybe she's not practicing today.

381
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:01,440
Gosh, I'm sure I heard they were practicing for the Alumni Field Day.

382
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,510
She will come out.

383
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,620
- Hey, why don't you come down for now? 
 - Wait, wait!

384
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,140
She's coming out! She's coming!

385
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,250
- Did you find her? 
 - No.

386
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,480
I don't see her yet.

387
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,200
Did she come out?

388
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,680
I asked you if she came out!

389
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,080
Gosh, seriously!

390
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,380
Hi.

391
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,420
Hey, come on.

392
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,280
How are you?

393
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,320
Give me a break.

394
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,260
I told you if I ever see you guys again–

395
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,850
You will kill us.

396
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,140
Right.

397
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,010
Bruce Lee?

398
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,200
You know that, too!

399
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,800
I've re-watched "The Big Boss," "Fist of Fury," "The Way of the Dragon," and "Enter the Dragon" so many times

400
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,430
that I'm quite good at twirling this.

401
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,700
All right. Who wants to die first?

402
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,890
Well, before we die, we have a wish.

403
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,600
H-Hey...

404
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,400
How about you die before your wish?

405
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,020
What?

406
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,430
Wow, did you want to die so badly that your brains got fried?

407
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:38,200
After all you put me through, do you want to date me?

408
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,060
These guys! I should just–

409
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,700
Please make your choice right here. Otherwise, you will have to kill us to leave.

410
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,610
Yes.

411
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,440
You guys are quite determined.

412
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,380
You. Aren't you afraid of me?

413
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,790
I am. But you're pretty.

414
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,330
Don't laugh!

415
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,460
I've put my life on the line for this!

416
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,180
All right.

417
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:24,090
Hyung. Isn't it a bit too much to say you put your life on the line?

418
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,360
Is it?

419
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,030
What about you?

420
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,210
What did you put on the line?

421
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,870
Me?

422
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,200
Oh, do you think I wouldn't put my life on the line?

423
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,130
Well...

424
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,670
Obviously, my life is on the line,

425
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,250
and if you don't go out with me, I will run around the neighborhood

426
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,860
yelling your name, Oh Jung Shin!

427
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,060
Put on your clothes! Put it on, put it on!

428
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,100
Okay, okay.

429
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,800
Gosh. These guys are weirdos!

430
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,820
You guys are the first I've seen putting your lives on the line.

431
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,750
Okay.

432
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:06,520
But let's say that I go out with one of you.

433
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:13,070
Whom should I choose, yo–

434
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,710
gurt?

435
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,940
 I'm telling you not to beat him in whatever Cheol Woong does.

436
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,140
You two.

437
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,760
What is your relationship with each other?

438
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,390
- Well, w-we're friends. 
 - He's my hyung.

439
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,070
What?

440
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,460
Oh, yes.

441
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,190
He's a hyung who's like a real hyung to me, but he was left back a grade.

442
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,110
His family and my family are really close.

443
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,510
- Hyung's family is– 
 - Gosh, maybe it's because I ate so fast, but my stomach hurts.

444
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,170
Cheol Woong, I'll go ahead. Come after you finish your conversation.

445
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,940
Sit down.

446
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,010
I told you my stomach hurts...

447
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:02,050
Don't run away and sit down.

448
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,970
Sit down.

449
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,430
Okay.

450
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,310
They say you even grant the wishes of dead people.

451
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,390
Then a-are you going to date us?

452
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,440
Oh, my. Wait!

453
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,430
First, I'll meet you.

454
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,370
But with whom?

455
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,300
I don't know. Let's wait and see for that.

456
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,070
How can I pick when I've only seen you a couple times?

457
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,390
How long will you wait and see?

458
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,900
For about a year?

459
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,050
Until then, we can meet as friends. Happy?

460
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,780
Can't you choose a bit more quickly?

461
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,080
One year is a bit...

462
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,120
What do you think of it, Hyung?

463
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,340
I'm fine even if it's late.

464
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:50,150
I'm fine with it, even if it takes longer.

465
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,590
Or I'm fine even if it gets delayed forever.

466
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,630
You'll grow old and die waiting like that.

467
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,870
All right!

468
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,630
Then I assume it's decided as I had suggested.

469
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,530
Get up.

470
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,360
And you, speak casually to me from now on. Got that?

471
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,230
Yes, Miss! I mean...

472
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,730
Well...

473
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,940
Okay, okay.

474
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,230
All right! Let's go, my friends.

475
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,130
Hey! Let's go!

476
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:39,440
♫  Saying that you'll leave and not return  ♫

477
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,710
♫  I heard those words in my immature days  ♫

478
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,410
♫  My love who left Mansusan  ♫

479
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,900
♫  If I could meet you now  ♫

480
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,860
♫  With my lips filled with joy and sorrow  ♫

481
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:13,130
♫  I could say everything to you  ♫

482
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:20,060
♫  I lived with the world behind me  ♫

483
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:26,770
♫  I lived with the world behind me  ♫

484
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,900
♫  How the heart grows cold once you turn your back  ♫

485
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:56,580

♫  I never knew what that meant  ♫

486
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,930
♫  As the tears rolled down  ♫

487
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,380
Here.

488
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,180
Oh, let's see.

489
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,800
Oh, it's hot!

490
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,760
- Isn't it hot? 
 - It's hot!

491
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,780
♫  With my lips filled with joy and sorrow  ♫

492
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,320
♫  I could say everything to you  ♫

493
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,760
Hey, hey! Your baton!

494
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,950

495
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:30,180
♫  I lived with the world behind me  ♫

496
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,990
♫  I lived with the world behind me  ♫

497
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,570
Lieutenant Colonel Hwang.

498
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,590
If there were only sunny days, all the trees will dry up.

499
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,480
Trees need snow and rain.

500
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,410
That's how trees grow big and sturdy.

501
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,430
Don't consider this as a demotion.

502
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,520
Let's bear through this.

503
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,080
Thank you for your kind words.

504
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,580
Thank you in advance, Division Commander.

505
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,650
First of all, go ahead and boost the morale of your troop.

506
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,000
I ask for your kind consideration going forward.

507
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Thank you, Sir.

508
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,290
That guy, does he think we're beggars?

509
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,750
Team Captain Oh, for your family's winter kimchi-making this year.

510
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,900
- No, thanks, Commander. 
 - Take it.

511
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,260
You're the only one who came with me.

512
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,930
Thank you, Sir.

513
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:29,690
What? Trees need snow and rain?

514
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,320
What the heck? Am I a tree?

515
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,680
He's just a senseless, sh*tty commander. How dare he disdain us of Security Command?

516
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,860
How could he, even in this day and age?

517
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,040
Team Captain Oh, look into that guy's background.

518
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,400
Not to worry, Sir.

519
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,510
I'll go through every speck of dust on him.

520
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:49,950
And did you start figuring out the tendencies and trends of local influencers?

521
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,490
Yes, Sir. I'm organizing them by election districts.

522
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,250
We must do well in the upcoming assemblymen election.

523
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,300
That's how we can regain position.

524
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,220
I understand, Sir.

525
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,290

526
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,070
 I have your exam results.

527
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,120
Is everyone ready to run around the field?

528
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,660
 Yes.

529
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,810
But there's been a significant change this time.

530
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,970
Lee Doo Hak and Choi Cheol Woong.

531
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:23,040
- Yes. 
 - Your ranking has switched.

532
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,890
Lee Doo Hak got number one in the entire grade this exam round.

533
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,000
You got a perfect score on everything. Everyone, applaud!

534
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,700
Cheol Woong.

535
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,680
Congratulations.

536
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,980
Oh, no.

537
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,730
I guessed a few. I just got lucky.

538
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:54,320
For this exam, did you study with all your might for Jung Shin?

539
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,380
You know I wouldn't do that!

540
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,490
I said I just got lucky!

541
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:02,970
Well, it does get boring if I don't have competition.

542
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,960
But still, I feel a bit uneasy about this.

543
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,890
Then let's discuss this.

544
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,130
Jung Shin must be waiting for us.

545
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,930
I don't feel too good today.

546
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,330
You go ahead alone.

547
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,490
- Hey, Cheol Woong– 
 - Doo Hak! Cheol Woong!

548
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,360
Hey!

549
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,790
Why did you come all the way here?

550
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,250
Hey, do you know how I did on my exams this time?

551
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,400
How did you do?

552
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,250
I jumped... eight rankings in my class!

553
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,010
Wow! So what number are you?

554
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:44,260
I'm seventeenth in my class and 190 in the entire grade.

555
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,140
It's my first time ranking within 200.

556
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,510
What the... Must I rank number one or two in my grade, too?

557
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,710
No!

558
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,300
You did great!

559
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,630
This is all... thanks to you, Lee Doo Hak.

560
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,630
So...

561
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,950
you guys have to go somewhere with me today.

562
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,320
Let's go.

563
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,590
Let's go!

564
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,030
What are you doing?

565
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,750
Let's hurry and go.

566
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,010

567
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,380
Wow, you ordered so much food, Mom!

568
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,970
Oh, Mom!

569
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,780
This is Choi Cheol Woong.

570
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,550
And this is Lee Doo Hak.

571
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,750
They're always ranking number one or two in the entire grade.

572
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,630
And this time, Doo Hak got number one, and Cheol Woong got number two.

573
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,970
Isn't that great?

574
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,480
Oh, really?

575
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,550
Gosh, thank you.

576
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,140
I heard you helped Jung Shin with her studies.

577
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,510
Gosh, no. Jung Shin studied really hard.

578
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,970
That's right. I studied hard.

579
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,120
Aigoo. Don't you think I know my Jung Shin?

580
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,310
If it weren't for you guys, she'd never rank within 200, even if Heaven and Earth came together.

581
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:11,090
I can do that without their help, you know.

582
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,710
Your father must be coming home from the hospital.

583
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,880
Long time no see, Oppa.

584
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,300
I was so surprised to hear from you.

585
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:36,040
I did think I might get to see you once at some point.

586
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,530
When I heard that you came to Yeosu,

587
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,740
I was a bit surprised.

588
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,510
Let's sit down.

589
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,050
Oppa, you look the same.

590
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,640
Speak for yourself.

591
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,500
Have you any children?

592
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,330
I have one son.

593
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,930
He must be around high school age?

594
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,810
Yes.

595
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,010
Good thing you didn't marry me.

596
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,990
If you had married me, you would have followed me to all the different military bases,

597
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,850
and you'd already be a country folk ahjumma (middle-aged woman).

598
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,740
I'm sorry.

599
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,950
If only it weren't for my father's opposition...

600
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,410
Oh, no.

601
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,970
He was able to see into the future.

602
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,980
I hope he's healthy.

603
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,740
He passed away.

604
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,140
He had a stroke after he dropped out of the campaign.

605
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,990
I see.

606
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,570
I'm sorry to hear that.

607
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,350
It's okay.

608
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:44,090
But what is this about? I'm sure you didn't want to meet just to greet me.

609
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,280
Actually... I have a favor to ask of you, Oppa.

610
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,950
You like Chinese food, I see.

611
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,540
- Come over sometime. 
 - Yes.

612
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,630
I'll buy you some again.

613
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,110
Yes. I-I'll come over often.

614
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:05,150
I heard your father runs a lumber mill.

615
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,830
Your family is quite famous in Yeosu.

616
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,070
Yes.

617
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,790
It must be because my grandfather Choi Byung Cheol was involved in the Independence Movement.

618
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,500
I heard.

619
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,030
He was a great man.

620
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,500
So what does your father do for a living?

621
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,590
Yes, well...

622
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,040
He's just a farmer.

623
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,710
It must be tough for him.

624
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:37,270
But since he has a scholastic son like you, he must be so proud.

625
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,150
Yes.

626
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:42,320
They say, "A dragon rises from a small stream" (rise from a humble start).

627
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,140
Of course.

628
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,410
Doo Hak's father used to be my family servant.

629
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:00,720
But my grandfather sent him to elementary school and got him to study.

630
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,030
As he left for Manchuria for the Independence Movement,

631
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,220
I heard he burned his slave contract.

632
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,660
Choi Cheol Woong, you, really!

633
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,340
What?

634
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,210
What I'm saying is...

635
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:17,460
Since you said, "A dragon rises from a small stream,"

636
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:22,660
I'm just saying Hyung Doo Hak comes from a difficult family.

637
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,750
Well...

638
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:29,370
I don't know about a dragon rising from a stream.

639
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,520
The fact that my family received much help from Cheol Woong's grandfather,

640
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,160
my father and I also know...

641
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,850
that he showed us a great favor, which we won't forget until we die.

642
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,170
That's right.

643
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,310
You're very thoughtful.

644
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:55,170

645
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,780
Do you mean that?

646
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,700
Yes. I mean it.

647
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,770
His views are completely opposite from our party,

648
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,140
as well as his late father's.

649
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:12,040
Isn't that how the image of the Gukhan Party would improve?

650
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,710
Someone from a family who led the Korean Independence Movement

651
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,980
and with opposing political views has also joined Gukhan Party.

652
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:22,270
It's also effective in cutting off funding support to the opposition from Southwestern Region.

653
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,290
I just assumed.

654
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:30,450
But if you make such a face, I get so embarrassed.

655
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,900
I ask you, Oppa.

656
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,600
Is this what we've become now?

657
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,650
But... did you get your husband to agree?

658
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,840
Of course.

659
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:05,220
If I help your husband, what do I get in return?

660
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,920
Are you okay?

661
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,040
Doo Hak.

662
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,540
Wipe with this.

663
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,910
And let's go to a pharmacy.

664
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,760
I'm okay.

665
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,620
Go home.

666
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,500
You're not okay.

667
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,080
I said to go home.

668
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,070
Doo Hak...

669
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:51,950
I don't want to see you! So go home!

670
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,900
Hyung...

671
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,770
I'm...

672
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,590
sorry.

673
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,160
And do you call yourself a friend?

674
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,080
Are you the only one with self-respect, and Doo Hak has none?

675
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,480
What a petty b*stard.

676
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,780
Geez, that girl. She's got quite a stinging slap.

677
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,260
Are you all right?

678
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,400
I'm really sorry.

679
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,040
I didn't mean to say it like that.

680
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,140
Hyung!

681
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,240
I said I was sorry.

682
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,270
Please let it go just once.

683
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,260
I deserve to die.

684
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:55,070
I wanted to rip my mouth open, too.

685
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,880
Let's not do this...

686
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,430
and just beat me up until you feel better.

687
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,970
Cheol Woong, you a**hole!

688
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,970
You b*stard! Disloyal traitor!

689
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:16,480
Worse than a dog!

690
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,610
Hit me!

691
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,060
I deserve to get beaten!

692
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,910
Stop it. It's fine.

693
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,660
What's fine?

694
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,790
I want to get beaten more.

695
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,700
I get how you feel.

696
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,670
So stop it.

697
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:45,070
Do you really know how I feel?

698
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,020
Yes.

699
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,730
Darn it!

700
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,030
Aigoo, my back...

701
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:23,160
Wow! It tastes like honey, not water!

702
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:27,250
Even though you came out of my womb,

703
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,490
it's so amazing whenever I see you.

704
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:30,950
What do you mean?

705
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,380
Your father barely learned to read,

706
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,620
and I might as well be blind with my eyes wide open.

707
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,780
Makes me wonder how I managed to give birth to someone like you.

708
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,810
And you even help out with farming.

709
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:45,710
I'm saying, how do you study on top of that?

710
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,780
Where you plant soybeans, you harvest soybeans, not red beans.

711
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:53,330
If your father gave you schooling, I'm sure you would have become a judge or prosecutor, Mom.

712
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:55,030
Right on.

713
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,980
If that had happened, I would never have met such a stuffy man like your father

714
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,730
but met a stylish man in Seoul.

715
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,320
Isn't that right?

716
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:06,120
Right!

717
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:10,350
Doo Hak.

718
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:13,540
Do you know when I feel the most satisfied?

719
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:17,330
When I awake from a light sleep

720
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:23,510
and see your back while studying at your desk. I feel most satisfied then!

721
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:27,950
Makes me think, "That guy is bound to become something great!"

722
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:32,220
Aren't you envious of Cheol Woong?

723
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,520
No.

724
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,760
Don't you worry. I've saved up tons already.

725
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,590
You'll be able to live rich and proud down the road.

726
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,270
Save up for what? I know you have no money.

727
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:48,750
Money isn't the only thing you save up.

728
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:52,460
At times, you also save and cherish people.

729
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,860
What do you mean by that?

730
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,930
There's something like that.

731
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:03,080
So go back in and either go to the library or study at home. Just go and study, right?

732
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,910
I'll do the rest by myself.

733
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:07,170
- But I'm okay! 
 - Hurry and go in!

734
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:10,480
Come on! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

735
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,240
Come and sit down for a minute.

736
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,840
You know, I think...

737
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,990
you've learned enough at this rate.

738
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,990
Why don't you just farm with me?

739
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:10,160
Pardon?

740
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,170
As for Jung Ok, she'd belong to another family once she's married off.

741
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,270
You're the only son I have.

742
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,510
What's going to happen to all this farm work?

743
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,850
And...

744
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:21,830
I just don't have the confidence to support you through college

745
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:25,490
by farming this small plot of land.

746
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,250
- So... 
 - Father.

747
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,750
You're saying this due to Cheol Woong, aren't you?

748
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,480
It's because I outdid Cheol Woong, right?

749
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,350
Why? Did Cheol Woong cry again?

750
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:38,060
Father, why can't I study?

751
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,840
Why can't I be number one in class?

752
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:45,010
Other parents praise their children when they rank number one!

753
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:49,160
Why do you try to stop me from studying and ranking on top?

754
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,370
Father,

755
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,650
if we received favor from Cheol Woong's grandfather,

756
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,560
we can repay them when I become successful later on.

757
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:01,410
We don't live in the feudal age or in the Joseon Dynasty!

758
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:04,280
Why must I live like a servant, too?

759
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,820
You punk (rebel)!

760
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,870
Are you trying to lecture your father?

761
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:11,810
If you become more learned, you'll try to swallow me up!

762
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:14,860
That's why I'm telling you to stop studying!

763
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:22,530
Father... Father!

764
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,500
I'll never say that again.

765
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,110
I must have lost my mind for a minute there.

766
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,710
Father...

767
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:35,190
I'll make sure I'll never become a nuisance to Mr. Choi's family and Cheol Woong.

768
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,710
I swear it! Please!

769
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,510
Father...

770
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:45,410
I really... I really want to study.

771
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:48,060
I don't even hope for college.

772
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,540
Please let me finish high school. Then...

773
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:54,380
I'll do as you say, Father.

774
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,170
And...

775
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:58,230
I will...

776
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,580
never...

777
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:04,870
I'll never upset Cheol Woong.

778
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,650
Father, please...

779
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:08,400
Please...

780
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:12,060
Then

781
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,270
transfer out of your school.

782
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,070
What brings you here at this hour, Honey?

783
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:55,590
Honey. I did it.

784
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,730
It's all done now.

785
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,850
What are you talking about?

786
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:02,380
You'll become an assemblyman now.

787
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,450
What?

788
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:06,890
You'll be nominated!

789
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:11,090
Wait, come see me, Honey.

790
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,220
What are you talking about? What nomination?

791
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,630
By chance, have you been in contact with Minyoung Party?

792
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:25,940
If you're bound to do it, you might as well hold on to a strong, thick rope of support.

793
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,110
What? Then...

794
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:29,910
By chance, Gukhan Party?

795
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,050
Are you out of your mind?

796
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:33,730
You've been nominated.

797
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,710
Why are you getting so angry when you've pretty much won the assemblyman seat?

798
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:39,690
Come on. Listen to you. I had my doubts about what you were saying.

799
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,410
What? "Gukhan Party"?

800
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:44,870
Are you telling me to become a dog to a dictator right now?

801
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:47,540
I'm not saying you should become their dog.

802
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:51,210
Don't you know you need to walk into a tiger's den if you want to catch a tiger?

803
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:54,030
If a critical figure joins the party and says what needs to be said,

804
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,260
how nice would that be?

805
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:59,510
No matter how much you try to get through to them from outside, it's no use.

806
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:02,520
Also, they're saying they'll be generous and accept you.

807
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,770
Why would you refuse that?

808
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,820
I just can't get through to you.

809
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:11,070
Yes, right. Why don't you do all those great things then?

810
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:15,640
Honey. This was so difficult to accomplish.

811
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,920
It's a chance we can elevate our family again.

812
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,120
You mean elevate your side of the family.

813
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,900
Our family has never faltered.

814
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,110
Honey...

815
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:31,500
I mean, how could you not know me at all after living with me for 20 years?

816
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,400
That's right!

817
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,670
All the money you worked so hard to make, you gave away to all kinds of people

818
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:39,660
and made some nobody an assemblyman!

819
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,180
You worry about the country so much!

820
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,450
Can't you get into politics yourself?

821
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:48,350
Instead of rotting away in this countryside, drinking rice wine with farmers!

822
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:54,450
This is my hometown, this countryside you speak of!

823
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:57,810
I have lived as your wife

824
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:00,860
and this family's daughter-in-law for 20 years.

825
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,590
I had no idea what a fool you are.

826
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:07,550
Do you know how much running around I did for you?

827
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,710
Do you even know what I went through?

828
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,170
Yet not even a word of thank you...

829
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,470
Pardon?

830
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,720
My goodness...

831
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,020
So something like that has happened...

832
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,980
He insists on throwing away a nice table that's all set up for him.

833
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,920
I feel like I'm going to die from a breakdown.

834
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,720
So that's why I'm saying this to you.

835
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,560
I think he might...

836
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,600
listen to you, Ahjussi.

837
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,870
Pardon?

838
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:45,020
Aigoo, I'm just a mere farming hand. I know nothing more than farming.

839
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,520
Besides...

840
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,990
once Mr. Choi makes up his mind,

841
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:50,990
he is as stubborn as hell.

842
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,440
The lumber mill... It looks good only on the outside. That...

843
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,110
pretty much belongs to the bank.

844
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,680
On top of that,

845
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:04,220
I think he'll find out I've been funding the opposition party.

846
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,890
And now, they're saying they'll give us the factory.

847
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:09,940
In this situation, if he turns down the nomination,

848
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:13,990
they probably will not leave this family alone.

849
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,000
Aigoo...

850
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:23,640
Your family and our family... have a special connection, you know.

851
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,050
With the cultivation of unique rice starting 1973,

852
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,170
the production of our crops has increased a lot.

853
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:38,080
However, to be independent in grain production...

854
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,760
Geez, what a b*stard...

855
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,120
Hey, a**hole!

856
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:55,300
Someday, you're going to croak (die).

857
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,700
 Was it Lee Doo Hak?

858
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,630
Without him, you're sh*t.

859
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,810
- How dare he! 
 - Wow!

860
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,470
That b*stard...

861
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,340
Welcome. Thank you for coming.

862
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,260
How come Young Shik isn't coming?

863
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:36,170
He'll be here soon.

864
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:38,050
You're sure he changed his mind, right?

865
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,050
Yes.

866
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:42,740
Mr. Choi will say he'll enter the election,

867
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,670
and they're the people who will work with him.

868
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:49,310
We need to use people who have worked on elections before.

869
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,920
By chance, he's not going to campaign for Minyoung Party, is he?

870
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,580
That party already has decided on a candidate.

871
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,340
I see.

872
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,770
- Come, welcome! 
 - Aigoo, hello, Sir!

873
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:04,450
Hello!

874
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:05,610
Thank you.

875
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:07,590
Aigoo, you came!

876
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:08,660
Aigoo...

877
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,550
- Aigoo... 
 - He'll be the new assemblyman.

878
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,800
Our new assemblyman.

879
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,370
I wanted to live a quiet life.

880
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:20,690
But this world just won't leave me alone.

881
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:23,730
So... I will...

882
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:25,800
Although I'm lacking...

883
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:30,530
I made up my mind to enter the assemblyman election, everyone!

884
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,820
 Choi Young Shik!

885
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,600
 - Choi Young Shik!  
 - Thank you!

886
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,830
 - Choi Young Shik!  
 - Yes!

887
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,400
 Choi Young Shik!

888
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,700
 Choi Young Shik!

889
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,910
 Everyone! Just as dripping water breaks the boulder,

890
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:52,120
although we are small in power, we'll gather our strengths

891
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:57,810
and end this dictatorial government!

892
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,320
 Choi Young Shik!

893
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,890
 Choi Young Shik!

894
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:06,620
 Choi Young Shik!

895
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:08,140
 Choi Young Shik!

896
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:10,350
 Choi Young Shik!

897
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:13,280
 Choi Young Shik!

898
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:19,460
You were correct in your assumption, Commander.

899
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,870
You were right in not recommending him from the start.

900
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:23,780
What did I tell you?

901
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,410
I told you he'd never campaign as a Gukhan Party candidate.

902
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:29,210
All right.

903
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:32,560
We'll have to chew him up one nibble at a time.

904
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:53,770
Lee Doo Hak, stop right there!

905
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,620
Why are you avoiding me?

906
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,870
I never did that.

907
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:02,480
But you never came to the library, and you never called me.

908
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,860
I was helping out with farming.

909
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,650
That's not it.

910
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:10,510
You're avoiding me since you're embarrassed your father was a servant.

911
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,400
Go.

912
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:23,960
Lee Doo Hak, you're really a loser, aren't you?

913
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,330
Is being a servant like being a traitor?

914
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:26,500
Did he sell out his country?

915
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,240
What's so embarrassing about that?

916
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,890
The future is more important, isn't it?

917
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:31,740
You can study hard like you are now.

918
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,560
When you're successful, who'd look down on you?

919
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,170
I transferred

920
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,840
to an agricultural high school.

921
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,750
Study hard...

922
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,120
and stay healthy, okay?

923
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,830
Are you saying you'll never see me again?

924
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:59,330
Can't we be friends if you go to Agricultural High now?

925
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:25,080
♫  I want to hold your hand  ♫

926
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,950
♫  I want it to be like a birthday  ♫

♫  Let me go  ♫

932
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,080
My heart is set.

933
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:03,930
- Wh-Why? 
 - Why you? And not Cheol Woong?

934
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,960
Don't ask me stupid questions like that going forward.

935
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,800
Just...

936
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,140
Just tell me you like me.

01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:37,390

940
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:39,740
Hey.

941
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:43,380
Are you the newbie transferred in last week?

942
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,800
And you beat up everyone in room 7, right?

943
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,650
Are you the lunatic they sent to solitary confinement?

944
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,160
What's your crime?

945
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,620
He's not answering me again.

946
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,330
Murder.

947
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:05,550
Whom... did you kill?

948
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,850
 Hey, Young Tak...

949
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:11,030
 Wake up!

950
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:13,170
 Young Tak!

951
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,390
Why did you throw it there?

952
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,650
Young Tak...

953
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:38,040
The dead guy's name was Ki Young Tak...

954
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,680
He was...

955
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,720
my one and only younger brother.

956
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,420
And...

957
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,320
he was the only one...

958
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,650
who used to visit me

959
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:51,470
and put money in my detention fund.

960
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:04,350
Do you know how much I waited for you to get here, you a**hole?

961
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:05,970
It wasn't me.

962
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:08,200
What do you mean it wasn't you?

963
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,230
Lee Doo Hak, you son of a b*tch!

964
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:14,250
It wasn't me...

965
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,050
 Cheol Woong!

966
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,710

967
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:58,520

974
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:34,020

975
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,380
 I'm dating you! I'm not dating Cheol Woong!

976
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:38,010
 Choi Cheol Woong. You know him, right?

977
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,880
 - Yes. 
 - Who messed you up like this?

978
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,540
 Just go away!

979
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,750
 This rude b*tch!

980
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,250
 You b*stard!

981
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:48,190
 Madam Kang, you're going through a lot after marrying a lofty-minded man.

982
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,300
 You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

983
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,610
 Hyung, Hyung! Please save me!

984
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,060
 Why should I do that?

985
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:56,310
 Doo Hak, hurry and tell them it's not you!

986
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,310
 All this happened because of you.

987
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:59,960
 Don't ever tell that you know me.

988
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,830
 Didn't you say you'll take responsibility for my life?

989
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:04,950
 You said you'll be successful in your life and repay me, you a**hole!

990
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:07,770
♫  I want to hold your hand  ♫

991
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:09,810
♫  I want it to be like a birthday  ♫
