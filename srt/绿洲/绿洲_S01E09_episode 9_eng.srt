1
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,960

2
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,860

3
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,850

4
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,810
I had to turn it over to my aunt,

5
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,520
but I managed to get it back a while ago.

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,350
I see.

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,660
 I enjoyed the movie, thanks to you.

8
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,120
 What are you talking about? It's not like she showed you the movie.

9
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,310
 If you watched a movie for free at my house, then basically, I showed it to you.

10
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,160
 From now, don't you dare come anywhere near here. You got that?

11
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,600
 That theater is your dad's, not yours.

12
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,140
 What did you say?

13
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,340
 These guys look like freshly dug-up potatoes!

14
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,180
Do I still look like a freshly dug-up potato?

15
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,750
No.

16
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,540
My potato has cooked perfectly.

17
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,550
I temporarily left the theater to Mr. Jeong, who used to operate the projector.

18
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,400
I see.

19
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,680
This was originally the spot where they used to sell popped rice.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,730
You're right. We used to always get scared by the noise.

21
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,230
 One of them came, but didn't the other?

22
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,950
 I should just beat up these guys!

23
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,080
 Of course, he'll come. Just wait a bit.

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,020
 Oh, that scared me!

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,200
- Boo! 
 - Oh!

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,230
Gosh, that scared me! I should have known.

27
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,900
♫  You know me better than I  ♫

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,880
♫  I can't fall asleep; I'm deep in thought  ♫

29
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,640
Do you want to go through the back door and watch a movie?

30
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,900
If we get caught by the schoolmaster, we'll get suspended.

31
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,980
When did you ever care about that?

32
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,770
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,380
When I was in school, I was a model student.

34
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,820
That is true.

35
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,120
You were the one who was bad at studying.

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,860
 I jumped... eight rankings in my class!

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,570
 Wow! So what number are you?

38
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,890
 I'm seventeenth in my class and 190 in the entire grade.

39
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,640
 It's my first time ranking within 200.

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,880
I keep telling you; it's not that I was bad. I chose not to study!

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,680
Okay, okay. You didn't study.

42
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,650
Gosh, this is so unfair!

43
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,160
Doo Hak.

44
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,270
Having watched movies all my life,

45
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,620
I think life is happier when movie-like events don't happen

46
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,610
and when we don't live like movie characters.

47
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,900
♫  Love me like you do  ♫

48
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,960
I would like for us to live peacefully.

49
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,570
Even if interesting things don't happen like in movies,

50
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,950
I would like us to live together peacefully for a long time.

51
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:26,050
♫  You know me better than I; don't leave me  ♫

52
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,920
Yes, let's do that

53
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,680
together peacefully, for a long time.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,950
♫  Don't leave me  ♫

55
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:45,900
♫  The wind blows quietly  ♫

56
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,680
Mok-dong stickers are all gone!

57
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,440
We even offered a bribe, yet there are still none!

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,940
I heard it, too.

59
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,480
Someone bought all the stickers that remained.

60
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,680
Supposedly, she seduced the redevelopment union leader and bought everything.

61
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,250
So ridiculous.

62
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,380
Why didn't I think of that?

63
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,310
By the way, Madam Kang,

64
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,120
I heard that someone saw you at a real estate agency nearby.

65
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,520
There is no way. They probably saw it wrong.

66
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,360
I really have no interest in that area.

67
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,560
Not only that, my son is a government employee.

68
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,190
I can't do anything that would hinder my son's future.

69
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,880
Are we any different?

70
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,660
We are all doing this under an alias.

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,290
Great work today.

72
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,980
It's not hard work since we're going by car.

73
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,750
Here is the contract.

74
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,700
Maybe it's because I got it done under my name,

75
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,920
but I feel like a rich person at heart.

76
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,020
It's not just in your heart, but now you've really become rich.

77
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,230
Excuse me?

78
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,980
Did you think I was joking?

79
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,080
I told you I would pay you for your labor.

80
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,250
I will give you 3%.

81
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,890
Aigoo, are you serious?

82
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,960
But...

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,490
if it's 3%...

84
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,690
If I earn 10 billion won,

85
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,290
I'll give you 300 million won.

86
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,360
But you must take this to your grave.

87
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,620
Of course, of course.

88
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,000
Well...

89
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,210
Please rest well, Ma'am.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,530
What do you mean, "Ma'am"?

91
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,630
Please hurry home and rest.

92
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,410
Hey, Doo Hak. About the development fund...

93
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,570
Even if you combine the money you gathered with Hyung Poong Ho

94
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,410
and your shares in the hotel and the nightclub,

95
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,190
that won't even be 20% of the needed funds.

96
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,030
Didn't they say they would connect us to a bank?

97
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,130
That would be best for us right now,

98
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,290
but it could someday become poison to us.

99
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,850
If they cut off the bank from us, we will have no way to survive.

100
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,040
Doo Hak, what did they tell you to become at Namsan?

101
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,890
 You're my hunting dog starting today.

102
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,920
Hunting dog.

103
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,390
"Hunting dog"? Our Hyungnim Doo Hak?

104
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,740
Instead of a hunting dog, how about you become a wolf,

105
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,220
rather than a hunting dog that an owner can

106
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,190
tie up with a leash, beat, and kill whenever he wants?

107
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,290
A wolf instead of a hunting dog?

108
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,170
If I could, of course, I should. But...

109
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,160
where do I get my development funds?

110
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,840
 Hyungnim.

111
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,500
 You've heard of the best and oldest in the fight club business, Chairman Goo Pan Shik.

112
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,650
 Of course, I know.

113
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,060
 He always laments how the fight club business has become corrupt.

114
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,650
 It is an honor to meet you in person like this, Chairman Goo.

115
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,470
That's right. He is the one person whom every gang respects.

116
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,950
 I wonder if we can turn every gang into a corporation

117
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,080
 or a union with him in the center.

118
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,150
 So get all gangs in the country to buy development company shares

119
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,780
and operate it with the gangs' money?

120
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,550
 We added some money to your account for you to use for expenses.

121
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,620
You would go from being a hunting dog to a wolf.

122
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,620
 Each month, ₩10 million will be deposited.

123
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,440
 The document is a business equity contract.

124
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,210
 All you have to do is stamp your seal.

125
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,300
From a hunting dog to a wolf, daebak (awesome).

126
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,690
Then we will...

127
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,430
Will we become the Wolf Gang?

128
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,570
But...

129
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,850
would he step up for us?

130
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,150
These guys are... pros.

131
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,780
All right, I like it.

132
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,120
For the revival of our fighters, let's do our best!

133
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,580
Cheers!

134
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,220
 Cheers!

135
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,550

136
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,090
We're planning on the work areas and open-air storage.

137
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,470
So we are planning on moving forth with a legal development.

138
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,620
It's 10 million won.

139
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,870
All right.

140
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,690
This is 40 million won from Masan.

141
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,170
The "40 million won from Masan."

142
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,480
Hyungnim, 50 million won from Mokpo.

143
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,170
The "50 million won from Mokpo."

144
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,130
The pledge!

145
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,070
 The pledge!

146
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,320
- One! 
  - One!

147
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,030
Our council will be swift in responding

148
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,230
to a crisis for our country and our people!

149
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,110
In addition to operating our development company,

150
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,690
we need to also buy out the lands near the redevelopment site.

151
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,190
With the funds of the council, it would be more than possible.

152
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,930
If ten represents the development company profits,

153
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,160
then profits from rising value of neighboring land will be...

154
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,610
Over a hundred.

155
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,450
- Bingo. 
 -  "A hundred"?

156
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,920
All right.

157
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,810
Finally!

158
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,130
About 12,000 households will enter.

159
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,370
About 300-400 residents are participating in the sit-in.

160
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,990
Hyung and Seon Woo, only get involved in the compensation,

161
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,590
but not in the demolition work.

162
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,000
I wonder if other gangs won't cause trouble during the demolition.

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,770
We just need to ensure we don't get reported on the news.

164
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,960
For something minor, guys are willing to take the fall for it.

165
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,160
The higher-ups will get them released on probation or bail.

166
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,220
Also, don't forget to buy land around the redevelopment site, Hyung.

167
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,990
That is the council's source of profits and lifeline.

168
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,390
Got it.

169
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,780
If you look here, from there–

170
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,190
Doo Hak, I'm sorry. Give me a sec.

171
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,800
Hey! What's with you?

172
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,050
Why don't you call me?

173
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,400
Wh-Why should I?

174
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,660
That night!

175
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,820
"That night"?

176
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,460
"Night"?

177
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,890
I told you I'd pay for the drinks at the street food cart!

178
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,080
Gosh, that's okay! It wasn't even that much, anyway.

179
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,810
Hey, you jerk! Are you an idiot?

180
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,580
Oh, okay.

181
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,230
Hey, Bonehead (fool). Follow me.

182
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,420
I will buy you ten times worth of those drinks!

183
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,900
Aren't you coming?

184
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,260
What are you doing not following her?

185
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,890
Hey, we're not even done with our meeting...

186
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,460
Gosh, the meeting is over.

187
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,550
- The meeting is over! 
 - You should go!

188
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,600
It's over! You should go.

189
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
Go, go!

190
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,750
Hurry and go, you moron!

191
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,750
Come back late!

192
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,430
We gave you a better deal than the market price!

193
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,920
We'll give you this. It's a good deal!

194
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,060
Wait! Stop!

195
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,930
According to the district office, this land isn't very profitable.

196
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,800
- "This house"? 
 - Yes, this house isn't profitable.

197
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,460
So let's go across the street.

198
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,300
Gosh, we almost ended up making a big mistake!

199
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,090
- Gosh. 
 - Wait, wait a sec!

200
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,950
- Yes, let's do it. 
 - Do what?

201
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,350
- You said you won't do it. 
 - Give it!

202
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,130
Aigoo, goodness.

203
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,610
Then take 100,000 won off the amount.

204
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,560
I'm joking! Just sign already.

205
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,250
- We got it. 
 - Good work.

206
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,150
- Oh my. This is a triangle zone. 
 - Where are we going?

207
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,560
For times like this...

208
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,850
Oh, sorry, sorry.

209
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,270
- Gosh, your spit... 
 - It's over here.

210
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,520
Aigoo, Ma'am.

211
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,230
You're doing well.

212
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,660
Gosh, then have a drink.

213
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,950
Site back and have a drink.

214
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,680
Thank you.

215
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,400
Aigoo, here. Sign with a smile!

216
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,120
You are earning a profit like this.

217
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,200
Gosh, you are earning a lot.

218
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,690
Oh, Boss, you have a lot of work. We'll help you out a bit.

219
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,340
I happen to be quite good at this.

220
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,010
Watch me carefully!

221
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,150
Let's go!

222
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,430

223
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,770
Oh, thank you.

224
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,690
Welcome.

225
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,570
- Oh, look who it is! 
 - Hello.

226
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,060
This land looks good. Yes, this is good.

227
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,210
Oh, really?

228
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,790

229
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,960
- Welcome. 
 - Hello.

230
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,460
I would like this land here.

231
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,660
There aren't any.

232
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,870
None?

233
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,290
You should have come sooner.

234
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,430

235
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,450
Where should we go now?

236
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,020

237
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,790
Land around the major apartment complex is the most valuable.

238
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,510
But Doo Hak bought it all

239
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,460
at a steeply discounted price, leaving only the useless land.

240
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,570
When the development ends, do you know how much all that would be?

241
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,320
I didn't know that he had access to such funds.

242
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,420
It's a business run by the government

243
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,350
so how could bears do the tricks while the thug b*stards–

244
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,040
While the thugs take all the money?

245
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,710
- That definitely won't do. 
 - Then

246
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,810
what will you do about it?

247
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,800
Cheol Woong isn't picking up my calls, and I'm worried sick.

248
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,920
Lee Doo Hak is definitely taking care of business well.

249
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,910
He moves quickly, and produces less noise than other work managers.

250
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,830
However,

251
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,540
he is also buying up land near the site to be redeveloped.

252
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,340
Really?

253
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,320
That's outside of the site we've designated so it doesn't matter.

254
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,170
But it's an incredible amount of over 90%.

255
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,840
That land was bought with funds from the union of gangs

256
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,790
so our company does not have even 1% of the shares.

257
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,370
Let him be.

258
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,160
It's better for us that their land prices increase.

259
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Excuse me?

260
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,690
None of our money went into it, and

261
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,710
if you think about it, it is purely a crime organization's profits.

262
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:08,380
That is why there is always a trap to freedom.

263
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,180
Oh, and this is what I heard from a real estate agency near Gongjang-dong.

264
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,320
Supposedly, Lee Doo Hak has been leaking that our agency is behind him.

265
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,790
What?

266
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,390
Is that true?

267
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,030
With this much money, you can buy an apartment building.

268
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,720
Right, Hyungnim?

269
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,740
Hey, A**hole. You know what will happen if you take off with the money, right?

270
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,800
- Gosh, I know not to steal this. 
 - Hyungnim.

271
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,700
Yes, what is it?

272
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,970
That never happened.

273
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,280
Why would I do something that hastens my own death? And...

274
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,390
as you well know, this business uses the council's funds.

275
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,300
If this business goes wrong, it'd negatively impact gangs all over the country.

276
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,350
So why would I do such a foolish thing?

277
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,630
Who told you that?

278
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,680
I will confirm who it is and shut him up.

279
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,990
Forget it. I understand what you're saying

280
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,790
so make sure I never hear anything like that again.

281
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,510
If something like this happens again,

282
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,530
the development company and whatnot will go down the drain.

283
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,610
Lee Doo Hak.

284
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,290
What are you trying to do with the gangs' money

285
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,660
after refusing to take loans

286
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,350
that we offered?

287
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,780
I will handle that myself.

288
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,320

289
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,030
Is business going well?

290
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,060
- Is it you? 
 - What do you mean?

291
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,970
The one digging up stuff about me and telling everyone.

292
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,780
Oh, about you setting up the council?

293
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,310
I know you had a fancy launching ceremony.

294
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:26,930
Hyung, if a South Korean prosecutor doesn't know that, he'd be a North Korean spy.

295
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,680
A sunbae I know tried to look into it,

296
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,480
but his higher-ups stopped him.

297
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,420
He said it's good if the gangs decide to be friendly with one another,

298
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,020
instead of battling each other.

299
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,370
But I don't believe it.

300
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,420
Be friendly?

301
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,950
You're saying thugs would know such a beautiful word?

302
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,650
A dog walking by would laugh.

303
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,800
In any case, you're amazing to make such a union organization.

304
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,530
Is that because someone is watching your back?

305
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,230
I'll be going.

306
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,650
Come on. Why are you being so silly?

307
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,150
Be careful.

308
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,230
I could arrest and put in jail

309
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,890
South Korea's biggest gang boss.

310
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,080
Well, I have no debts to repay you anymore, Hyung.

311
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,360
I know.

312
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,230
But I already retired.

313
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,600
So I'm saying you shouldn't come visit me like this out of the blue.

314
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,920
We might meet later as prosecutor and defendant so it's a bit uncomfortable.

315
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,420
Oh, my mom might remarry soon.

316
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,090
Don't come then either.

317
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,450
Well, you probably won't get invited anyway.

318
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,320
But you should still come.

319
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,030
I'll send you an invitation.

320
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,350
I'm marrying Jung Shin.

321
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,180
We have to go somewhere. Please change your clothes.

322
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,150
I said we have to go somewhere!

323
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,840
Gosh, gosh.

324
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,820
Wow, goodness!

325
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,990
Gosh, this is so good.

326
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,300
Kyeong Ja.

327
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,580
What will you do when Cheol Woong's mom gets remarried?

328
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,950
What power do I have?

329
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,740
If she tells me to work, I'll work.

330
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,260
If she tells me to leave,

331
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,670
I'll have to leave.

332
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,660
Then again, I guess for both you and me,

333
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,900
have we ever been the star?

334
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,890
Do we have money, or were we educated?

335
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,890
But...

336
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,120
educated people shouldn't act like that, no?

337
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,810
What do you mean?

338
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,980
They were hugging and kissing in front of the gate.

339
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,090
Aigoo, aigoo, it was so embarrassing to watch.

340
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,370
How did you manage to see that?

341
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:05,720
Last time, when I returned from my father's sixtieth birthday in Yeosu,

342
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,760
they were like that in front of this gate.

343
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,100
How were they doing it?

344
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,690
Were they like doing it like this?

345
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,240
Gosh, what are you doing?

346
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,520
How were they doing it? Do it to me.

347
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,150
It was gross (indecent)!

348
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,600
How did they do it? Was it like this?

349
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,760
But you know,

350
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,160
I heard something a bit weird.

351
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,270
- Hey, Mom. 
 - Aigoo.

352
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,480
- Doo Hak! 
 - Yes.

353
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,330
Oh, Honey, you're here, too.

354
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,270

355
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,390
But what's the matter?

356
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,550
You acted like you weren't ever going to come home.

357
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,230
Hey, Mom. What about Jung Ok?

358
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,990
We only talk on the phone sometimes.

359
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,590
She just says she's doing fine.

360
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,690
She won't even tell me where she's works or lives.

361
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,930
She thinks someone is trying to arrest her, like before.

362
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,780
Forget it.

363
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,930
She's not coming home since she's fine.

364
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,000
She isn't a baby.

365
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,630
What are you so worried about?

366
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,670
Your father is acting again.

367
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,380
His heart is burnt black from worrying about Jung Ok.

368
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,570
Who says I am?

369
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,960
When Jung Ok returns, please tell her

370
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,460
to come to my wedding.

371
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,420
Are you getting married? For real?

372
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,690
Who is the bride?

373
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,240
Jung Shin.

374
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,530
Jung Shin?

375
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,660
The daughter of the owner of Yeosu Namhae Theater!

376
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,050
When is the wedding?

377
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,530
We'll set the date soon.

378
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,960
When we set the date, I will introduce her properly to you all.

379
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,850
Aigoo, you're just like a goblin!

380
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,700
Why do you keep shocking people?

381
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,860
Also, now I...

382
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,710
I've really...

383
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,640
left that type of work.

384
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,380
Are you serious? Do you really mean it?

385
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,120
Yes, I am now working in construction.

386
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,110
Oh, goodness. I'm proud of you, my son.

387
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,300
I am proud of you!

388
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,530
Whenever I thought of you, I felt terrible inside, like I had indigestion.

389
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,080
You did well. You did well.

390
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,990
Hey, Mom. You should eat. Eat up.

391
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,030
Now you can sleep peacefully at night now, Honey.

392
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,360
You should say something to him!

393
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,880
Thanks.

394
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,690
And I'm sorry.

395
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,400
I didn't stop doing it for you, Father.

396
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,220
I know.

397
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,360
I should get up now.

398
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,450
You guys eat up before you leave.

399
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,250
I mean, if you will leave, we should leave together!

400
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,900
Mom, Mom.

401
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,490
I still have things to tell you.

402
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,720
Oh wait, he left his cigarettes behind.

403
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,550
I'll quickly run out and give it to him.

404
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,300

405
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,700
Aigoo.

406
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,950
Ahjussi!

407
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,000
Why did you come out?

408
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,860
You should eat more.

409
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,250
Were you looking for these?

410
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,890
You left it behind inside.

411
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,920
Thank you.

412
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,780
You should hurry inside and eat up!

413
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,860
Also, come visit our home sometimes.

414
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,630
Yes.

415
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,710
But, Ahjussi.

416
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,730
What is it?

417
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:07,620
By chance, is Cheol Woong not the real son of the boss who passed away?

418
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,990
Wh-What are you talking about?

419
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,700
Of course, he is Mr. Choi's son!

420
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,620
Right?

421
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,710
Then please get home safely.

422
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:23,810
Tell me. Who said anything like that to you?

423
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,020
Did Doo Hak's mother say stuff like that?

424
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,550
No, she didn't.

425
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,550
What do you mean, she didn't?

426
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,880
That wretched wife of mine!

427
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,230
Gosh, I told you she didn't!

428
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,330
Madam Kang said so. It was Madam Kang.

429
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,890
Madam Kang?

430
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,690
Yes.

431
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,200
 I never knew that my son went through so much like that.

432
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,380
 It's not your fault, Oppa.

433
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,490
 No.

434
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:03,190
 If I had found you a bit sooner,

435
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,040
 and if I knew that Cheol Woong was my son,

436
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,250
 he wouldn't have gotten so hurt like that.

437
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,750
 This is all my fault.

438
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,890
 At this rate, the gap between father and son will only increase.

439
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,640
 How about you tell Cheol Woong instead?

440
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,820
 That I am his birth father, he'll find out sooner or later, anyway.

441
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,530
 Please,

442
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,770
 give me some time.

443
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,510
 Yeo Jin.

444
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,410
I'm sorry.

445
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,810
I think I shouldn't have told you that.

446
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,950
Kyeong Ja.

447
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,250
Yes?

448
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:46,260
That is definitely not true so you can't repeat it to anyone.

449
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,790
Gosh, I really can't figure out what is true and what is false.

450
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,210
If it's true or false, don't mention this to anyone!

451
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,530
You got that?

452
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,720
I got it.

453
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,800
I swear.

454
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,290
Take a look at this.

455
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:10,580
I put your name as the owner of the apartment, Mom.

456
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,480
It should be comfortable enough for three people to live.

457
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,400

458
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,780
Hey, Doo Hak!

459
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,010
What took you so long? You should sit down and eat up.

460
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,210
Y-Yes.

461
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:32,250
Kyeong Ja, we can live like actual people now.

462
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,930
Doo Hak, you shouldn't let your father leave like that on such a good day!

463
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,020
You should go and bring him back.

464
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,520
Please?

465
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,170
Cheol Woong.

466
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,680
Ahjussi.

467
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,110
- Is it you, Ahjussi? 
 - That's right.

468
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,080
I came to see Doo Hak, and I thought

469
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,840
I'd see your face before I go.

470
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,650
It's 70% of the down payment for the redevelopment apartment in Gongjang-dong.

471
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,200
Great work.

472
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,090
Thank you.

473
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,660
Also,

474
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,120
- I have a favor to ask you. 
 - Yes?

475
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,290
I would like you to give up half the neighboring land that your company bought

476
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,210
near the Gongjang-dong redevelopment site.

477
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,380
- Excuse me? 
 - We'll pay you 5% on top of the value.

478
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,180
That land has nothing to do with the redevelopment site.

479
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,230
Just do it this time around.

480
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,150
I'm not the one making the request.

481
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,190
I have too many family members in the council I need to feed.

482
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,330
I'm sorry, but please understand.

483
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,220
I will definitely repay you next time.

484
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,520
Really?

485
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,750
I'm really sorry.

486
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,060
Please drink slowly.

487
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,280
Cheol Woong.

488
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,910
Yes?

489
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,300
Your Choi family is a great family line.

490
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,520
Your grandfather was a leader in the independence movement,

491
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,400
and your father refused to take

492
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,380
even a silk path if it was not a righteous path.

493
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,060
No matter what the world says,

494
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,660
you should be proud that you have the last name of Choi,

495
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:47,450
and never forget your grandfather and father.

496
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,050
Of course.

497
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,290
I always think proudly about that.

498
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,970
You don't need to worry about that.

499
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,520
Even if your mother remarries,

500
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,160
you are a man of the Choi family.

501
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,780
So you've heard.

502
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,960
You are a man of the Choi family, you got that?

503
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,730
Yes.

504
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,630
Say it even louder!

505
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,080
Yes, I got it.

506
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,860
That's right!

507
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,590
You heard about Hyung Doo Hak getting married, right?

508
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,720
I did hear.

509
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,990
Do you think you can...

510
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:48,010
postpone that marriage just for a little bit?

511
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,650
What's the reason?

512
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,600
The prosecution is closely watching Hyung Doo Hak

513
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,190
if he really quit being a gangster.

514
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,080
If it's only...

515
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,310
If it's only that he disguised himself as a businessman,

516
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,300
the bride...

517
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,060
The bride will be hurt too much, wouldn't she?

518
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,700
Cheol Woong...

519
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,690
I'm indeed his father,

520
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:28,150
but with what right can I possibly tell him to marry or not?

521
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,180
When I'm the one who sent that youngster off to jail,

522
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:35,180
even after he clung to me in tears!

523
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:41,180
Even though I made the decision,

524
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,060
but you should stop it now.

525
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:50,860
That poor boy is trying to start a life with the woman he loves.

526
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,620
He's still...

527
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,580
your hyung, isn't he?

528
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,560
Hyung, you say?

529
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,960
He was my hyung.

530
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,950
And your blood is indeed thicker than water,

531
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,270
since Hyung Doo Hak is your son.

532
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,300
Are you leaving?

533
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,710
Yes, I should get going.

534
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,640
Cheol Woong.

535
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,830
Let me give you a hug.

536
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,940
I'm...

537
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,690
really proud of you.

538
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:07,170
I'm totally fine, okay?

539
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,480
I really...

540
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,580
don't regret it at all.

541
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,810
Ah-Ahjussi...

542
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,840
Hello?

543
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,430
What a great coincidence for you to pick up.

544
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,340
This is Doo Hak's father.

545
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,020
Oh, yes.

546
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,780
What's the matter at this late hour?

547
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,700
Is Doo Hak's mom still not home?

548
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,700
Well, I'm still in Seoul.

549
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,450
 You came to Seoul?

550
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,890
Yes. I just...

551
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,270
met with Cheol Woong.

552
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,670
Did you meet Cheol Woong?

553
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,600
What was the occasion?

554
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,730
I met Cheol Woong and told him

555
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,280
that even if you remarry,

556
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,820
he should not forget he's a son of the Choi family.

557
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,290
What do you mean by that?

558
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,130
 Madam...

559
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,930
I've never once thought of

560
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,710
Cheol Woong as my own child.

561
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:42,040
 Since Cheol Woong has always been Choi Young Shik's son.

562
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,030
That's how I've lived my life!

563
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,770
But how dare someone else call Cheol Woong his son?

564
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,080
Ahjussi. Doo Hak's father...

565
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,930
I have no idea what you're saying.

566
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,910
I can't understand a word.

567
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,910
 Madam.

568
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,930
 You can't be doing this.

569
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,430
You really can't be doing that!

570
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:10,690
 If you say Cheol Woong is the son of the man you will remarry,

571
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:13,980
 it'd be too sad for

572
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,560
  the elder and your late husband.

573
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,810
You really can't be doing that.

574
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:27,510
 Ahjussi, I don't know what you heard from whom,

575
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,960
 but even if what you heard is true,

576
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,430
that's for my family and I to decide.

577
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,720
 Whether my son

578
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,450
 stays Choi Cheol Woong or becomes Kim Cheol Woong,

579
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,400
it's not your place to have a say.

580
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,580
 Do you understand?

581
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,080
Madam!

582
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:53,080
If you'll really be like this,

583
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,950
I'll...

584
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,260
go and get my child back.

585
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,280
Do you think that makes sense?

586
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,010
 If that doesn't make sense,

587
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,800
I'll go to the man you'll be marrying...

588
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,830
and tell him the clear truth that Cheol Woong is my son!

589
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,190
Ahjussi, Doo Hak's father.

590
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,610
Let's meet and talk. Okay?

591
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,330
I'll come and meet you...

592
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:27,200
when you make up your mind.

593
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,230
Hello?

594
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,080
Ahjussi, Ahjussi! Hello? Hello?

595
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,740
What do I do?

596
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,310
It's this glass this time. Okay?

597
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,080
- Deal. 
 - All right? No backing out later!

598
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,990
- Let's go. We're doing this! 
 - Who's going to spin it?

599
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,260
- Please, please, please. 
 - You need to spin it hard.

600
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,030
Hey, you didn't do it right!

601
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,690
Go on and tell me.

602
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,450
I'll listen to anything you have to say.

603
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,020
I must be getting punished.

604
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,320
You didn't commit any crimes to be punished for.

605
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,310
I actually...

606
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,330
have been...

607
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,650
getting blackmailed for a long time.

608
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,170
By whom?

609
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,200
I can't...

610
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,760
endure it anymore.

611
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,180
What are they blackmailing you with?

612
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,270
He wants half of all I own.

613
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,560
What if you don't?

614
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,770
He said he'll destroy Cheol Woong.

615
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,320
What is Cheol Woong's weakness?

616
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,630
You can tell me. I can cover for you.

617
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,750
He had committed murder before!

618
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,460
During high school in Yeosu...

619
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,350
And then?

620
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:30,630
That man's son, who was Cheol Woong's friend,

621
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,200
went to jail in his place for murder.

622
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,210
I had desperately asked that man,

623
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,290
who was a servant of my family,

624
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,060
saying I'll give him a lump sum.

625
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:46,690
And is that man's son Lee Doo Hak?

626
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,500
I was curious why Cheol Woong let Lee Doo Hak use him and have his way.

627
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,700
But now I know.

628
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:10,250
His son used Cheol Woong, and the father blackmailed you.

629
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,160
Oppa, only if...

630
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,450
Cheol Woong will be okay, I can give up everything, but that person

631
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,440
will go on to harass Cheol Woong after I die.

632
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,510
Oppa, what do I do now?

633
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:26,050
Oppa, what do I do?

634
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,140
One, two, three!

635
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,850
 All right!

636
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,280
 Hooray!

637
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,550

638
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,330

639
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,110

640
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,100

641
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,330
I'll be taking a picture now!

642
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:19,200
 "Loyal Brotherhood"!

643
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,430
Hey, wait.

644
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,170
- One more? 
 - Okay, one more.

645
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,400
One more, one more.

646
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,480
They're gang leaders, each representing the region they come from.

647
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,100
Each one of them is as notorious as the other.

648
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,190
Is Lee Doo Hak's company the one managing the funds?

649
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,640
Yes, Goo Pan Shik is the chairman on paper,

650
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,640
but the actual leader of Loyal Brotherhood is Lee Doo Hak.

651
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,700
They all know it, too.

652
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,520
However, I'm glad they stopped knifing each other lately.

653
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,970
Wouldn't a criminal organization...

654
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:07,190
- be a possibility? 
 - Sorry?

655
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,450
Aren't you two kind of close?

656
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:12,100
Yes.

657
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,120
It's because I know him.

658
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,260
If he gets worse, his sentence will be heavier.

659
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,950
It's just as I told you back then.

660
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:58,760
Cheol Woong isn't my son or anyone else's.

661
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,790
He's the son of

662
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:03,990
Young Shik of the Choi family.

663
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,020
Of course.

664
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,800
Who told you such nonsense?

665
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,180
Is that what matters?

666
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,610
The problem is that you're thinking such things!

667
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,510
Isn't that right?

668
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,290
How could you do that?

669
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:22,630
How could you tell that man he's the father?

670
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,840
It was for Cheol Woong.

671
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,700
Since Cheol Woong needs to be his son to succeed.

672
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,500
Is he that much of a powerful person?

673
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,490
Cheol Woong was able to become a prosecutor

674
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:43,590
only because that man helped.

675
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,050
From now on, too...

676
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,660
at least until Cheol Woong grasps some power in that world—

677
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,130
I don't know how high Cheol Woong will rise there!

678
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,470
No, even if he becomes the president...

679
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,350
his blood doesn't change!

680
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,310
Not that it even should.

681
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:02,630
What's the point of success if he forgets his roots on the way?

682
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,710
That makes him less than a beast!

683
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,660
Ahjussi...

684
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,080
I beg of you.

685
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,680
Please look the other way just this time.

686
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,560
If anything happens to Cheol Woong,

687
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,200
it will kill me.

688
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,850
I'll make sure you're compensated. No...

689
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:26,350
More than enough.

690
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,720
I didn't have much time so this is it for today, but—

691
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,810
Madam!

692
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,850
You really can't be doing this!

693
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:43,780
Don't you even feel sorry for your late husband?

694
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,860
You came home early.

695
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,370
Was it you?

696
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,950
- It's you, right? 
 - Madam...

697
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,080
what did I do?

698
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,240
You're the only rat in this house.

699
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,010
Pack your things and leave right away.

700
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:33,840
Madam! It's all my fault.

701
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,420
I really didn't know anything—

702
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:39,070
M-Madam! I-I really didn't know.

703
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,150
Madam!

704
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:46,920
Aigoo! Why are you being so pitiful all by yourself?

705
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,600
What brings you home so early today?

706
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,420
That's not up to me.

707
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,910
I just come and go as she tells me to.

708
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,540
It's up to Madam.

709
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,290
What now? Did she say you can stop coming?

710
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:05,720
Oh my. Why would she fire me, who serves her the way she likes to be served?

711
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,480
I guess she's not feeling well. She said she'd take a break.

712
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,170
Don't put it away and leave it.

713
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,920
I bought some beef.

714
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,190
I'll make bulgogi so let's eat dinner together.

715
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,100
You can eat them all.

716
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,580
I've no appetite.

717
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,510
Oh my.

718
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,880
It's beef, I said.

719
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,990
It's beef!

720
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,520
Kyeong Ja.

721
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,360
Ahjussi.

722
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,930
What brings you here?

723
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,340
Were you kicked out?

724
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:54,660
You told everything I told you to Madam, right?

725
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:59,350
- W-Well... 
 - This is all because of you!

726
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,620
I saw the memo and came. What's the matter?

727
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,410
I'm busy so I need to return quickly.

728
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,510
Why are you looking so ill?

729
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,850
Are you sick, Mom? Mom?

730
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,060
It looks like you're ill.

731
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,430
Have you been to the hospital?

732
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:47,260
Come on and get up. Let's go see a doctor.

733
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,410
Cheol Woong.

734
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,820
I don't need to remarry.

735
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,500
I just need you, Cheol Woong.

736
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,740
G-Gosh, I got it.

737
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:03,330
We'll talk about that later, and let's go to the hospital first.

738
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:05,280
One second.

739
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,050
Cheol Woong.

740
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,600
your biological father...

741
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,380
is Deputy Director Hwang.

742
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:46,390
Lee Jung Ok, you're really something else, too.

743
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,100
You're the first one to be on the run for this long after a wanted order.

744
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,190
Let's give up and go now.

745
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,690
Why, you little...

746
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,390
Let go of me!

747
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,230
Stay still!

748
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,730
Stay still.

749
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:03,850
I did hear that...

750
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:08,880
you broke up because Grandpa was against it.

751
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,930
But still, this is...

752
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,190
I didn't know, either.

753
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:16,050
Only if my father didn't marry me off

754
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:20,510
so hastily out of fear that I might go back to him.

755
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:25,750
Why are you telling me this? You could have hid it

756
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,790
for the rest of my life.

757
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:34,330
Because I met him again.

758
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:37,770
I just felt so sorry for you, who couldn't even

759
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:43,600
recognize your own father after fate brought us back together.

760
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,850
I'm sorry.

761
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,320
I have

762
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,830
already told him.

763
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,630
I'm sorry, Cheol Woong.

764
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,450
I'm sorry.

765
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,460
Don't cry.

766
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,750
I'm sorry, Cheol Woong.

767
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,640
Thank you.

768
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,990
You're working so hard. Do you remember me?

769
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:20,250
I had come from the prosecution regarding Prosecutor Choi's matter.

770
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,800
Oh, yes, yes.

771
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,990
But what brings you here?

772
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,730
You're working so hard.

773
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,060
Why don't you have a drink first?

774
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:34,430
He told me you like rice wine, insisting that I must

775
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,420
buy one on the way.

776
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,760
Who insisted?

777
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,260
I'm talking about Prosecutor Choi.

778
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,170
Thank you.

779
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:56,560
By the way, what did he want to see me for?

780
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:01,720
Oh, was it regarding the ancestral burial mountain in Yeosu?

781
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,480
Anyhow, please hear the details in person.

782
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,790
Prosecutor Choi is waiting at the restaurant.

783
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,210
- I'll get changed quickly and come— 
 - No.

784
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,670
You can just go as you are.

785
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:18,380
Also, after you're done eating,

786
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,150
I'll give you a ride back home.

787
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,030
What's up?

788
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:32,430
For the successful Prosecutor Choi to come visit a prosecutor no one knows?

789
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:37,800
Since you lack charisma, I decided to help you develop some.

790
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:43,420
The Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong I know doesn't know what "love your colleague" means.

791
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:48,830
Well, the true feelings don't usually rise to the surface.

792
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:50,120
What's this?

793
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,530
A case that will make you a star, Prosecutor Park Jae Hwan.

794
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:59,020
It smells a bit funny.

795
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,130
What's the real reason?

796
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,240
He's a childhood friend.

797
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,250
It's awkward, you know?

798
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,230
Is that really it?

799
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,940
Who is it?

800
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,990
Lee Doo Hak.

801
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,950
You'll miss him if you blink an eye.

802
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,050
Do you think you can do this?

803
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,820
♫  Even if the path I take will be rough and long  ♫

804
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:49,340
♫  I'll be happy if you'll come with me  ♫

805
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,910
 Kiss her now! Kiss her now!

806
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:56,550
 Kiss her now! Kiss her now!

807
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:01,520
♫  I'll tell you that I'm happy  ♫

808
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:05,130
♫  Even if I look this way and that  ♫

809
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:13,100
♫  The best thing is being with you  ♫

810
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,200

811
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:19,620
♫  To me, you're the one who gives happiness  ♫

812
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,470
Gosh, congratulations, Hyungnim.

813
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:23,560
Have a happy honeymoon, Hyungnim!

814
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,600
It's Executive Director now! Stop calling him Hyungnim!

815
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,830
Yeon Ju, please understand. They're just not used to it.

816
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:33,540
Executive Director, forget about work and have a nice trip.

817
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,190
Thank you so much for the bouquet.

818
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:38,900
I'm sorry for passing you, even though we met later than you two.

819
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,390
I know you're impatient, Yeon Ju.

820
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:43,240
We'll catch up to you soon.

821
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,360
Hey, don't come empty-handed when you return.

822
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,810
Make sure you make a baby.

823
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:50,010
Gosh, seriously!

824
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:53,190
O-Oh, that's right. Yeon Ju.

825
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:58,620
Executive Director is a virgin so he could be quite clumsy.

826
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,300
Don't get too angry at him.

827
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,350
- I told you not to tell her. 
 - Come on.

828
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,430
Let's hurry and go!

829
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:06,620
- We'll be late for the flight. 
 - Hurry! Have fun!

830
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,920
- We'll be going. See you all later. 
 - Sure.

831
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,750
- Hyung Joo, fighting! 
 - Fighting!

832
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,910
Fighting!

833
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:17,520
 Hooray!

834
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,800
I waited after getting your call.

835
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,540
We'll be off the clock soon. Shall we have some soju after?

836
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,230
No, Sir.

837
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,870
I have some work piled up.

838
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:36,100
By the way, I don't see Coordinator Oh Man Ok.

839
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,230
Yes, he left for personal business.

840
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,590
I heard from Mother

841
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,840
that you're my biological father.

842
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,410
Really?

843
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:02,270
You must have been shocked.

844
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,000
Yes.

845
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,490
I still can't believe it, but I understand those circumstances.

846
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:16,050
It's not like it was my wedding. Why am I so tired?

847
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:17,540
Gosh, me, too.

848
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,420
It's because you and I don't have a lover.

849
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,300
What now?

850
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,150
- Hello. 
 -  Is it Doo Hak?

851
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:29,120
- Yes, Mother. 
 - Your dad still isn't home.

852
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,010
 Two days passed already, but I didn't even hear from him.

853
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,030
I don't know what's going on.

854
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,700
He must have gone to Yeosu.

855
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,210
You said he goes to weed Cheol Woong's family grave site.

856
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,590
I'll be glad if that's the case.

857
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:42,770
But it's just been too long.

858
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,360
Just wait a little more.

859
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,900
We need to get ready to move, too.

860
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,830
- Gil Su and Seon Woo! 
 - Jung Shin!

861
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:52,160
Mom, I'll call you back later.

862
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,570
Doo Hak, choose a tuxedo from here and let's go to the tailor tomorrow.

863
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:58,450
Doo Hak... Gosh.

864
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:12,700
Honestly, I'm fine with getting ready-made clothes and getting you a tailored one.

865
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:17,160
Hey, I'm fine since I'm pretty and shine in whatever dress I wear.

866
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,630
But you need a tuxedo to back you up.

867
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:23,010
- Isn't that right? 
 -  Yes, you're right.

868
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:27,990
I can't watch you show up in rags.

869
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,100
Oh, is that how it is?

870
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,250
All right then.

871
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,990
Okay then. We'll be going now.

872
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:38,660
You two can have a lovely time.

873
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,600
Wait.

874
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,860
We might not go home.

875
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:45,470
- Oh... 
 - That's even better!

876
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:47,910
Let's please see you tomorrow.

877
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:51,690
Hey, hey, S-Seon Woo!

878
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:52,860
What's your deal?

879
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:55,880
So what? We're going to be married anyway.

880
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:00,390
Are you still scared I'll eat you up?

881
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:02,460
That's not it.

882
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,900
I have my role in front of the boys.

883
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,970
Hey, Lee Doo Hak. Are you acting tough in front of me?

884
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:11,420
I won't act tough.

885
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,660
All right.

886
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,280
 The dead man didn't have an ID on him.

887
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,460
- I can't tell the difference. 
 -  Wounds and bruises from the car accident...

888
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,340
- I like these. 
 -  were found all over his body.

889
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:25,360
 The police are looking for a witness, assuming it to be a hit-and-run.  
 - Wait a second.

890
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,980
 But the investigation is stalled since the estimated time of death was at dawn...

891
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:31,210
 He left his cigarettes behind.

892
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:34,080
 I'll quickly run out and give it to him.

893
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,670
 Inside the pockets, a pack of matches and Baeksol cigarettes were found.

894
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:39,110
Why?

895
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:41,610
 According to the statements from the person who found the corpse,

896
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:43,960
 there was a lot of blood in his head...

897
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,330
Doo Hak... Lee Doo Hak!

898
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,350
Wait a second!

899
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:50,600
Where are you going? Is something wrong?

900
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,540
I need to check on something.

901
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,890
I'll call you so wait for me inside.

902
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:07,480
 This is all because of you, Father.

903
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,780
 Father, why don't you say something?

904
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,320
 Father, all went according to your will.

905
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,560
 You said not to study so I stopped studying!

906
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,730
 You told me to go to prison so I went to prison!

907
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:25,720
 After doing as you said, all I could do was become a gangster.

908
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:31,690
 If you say not to do this as well, then should I just die?

909
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:39,230
 I am most likely... not your son, Father.

910
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,220
It seems to be a hit-and-run.

911
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:57,260
And... by a large vehicle too.

912
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,320
We're currently looking to see

913
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,460
if there was any witness, asking the locals.

914
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:13,090
Is that you, Doo Hak?

915
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:14,710
What on Earth is going on?

916
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:17,560
Does it have to do with the news from earlier?

917
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,180
My father passed away.

918
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,390
What did you say just now?

919
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:29,290
Your father?

920
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:32,190
Yes.

921
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:53,560

922
01:01:53,560 --> 01:02:00,940
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

923
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:08,060
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

924
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:12,800
♫  Above the rough sky  ♫

925
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,900

926
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,590
 Doo Hak. Cheol Woong. To tell you the truth...

927
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:21,460
 Choi Cheol Woong's mother is remarrying, and the man is...

928
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,290
-  Hwang Choong Sung. 
 - What did you say?

929
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:26,130
 Lee Doo Hak... please cut ties with him. I'll do the same.

930
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:28,910
 Cheol Woong, please just leave Doo Hak and me alone.

931
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,630
 You are under arrest for charges of violence and related offenses.

932
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:34,690
 I don't have to get married so save Doo Hak, no matter what.

933
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:37,160
 Absolutely don't lose sight of Oh Jung Shin.

934
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,290
 Lee Doo Hak will surely show up in front of Oh Jung Shin.

935
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,480
 Let go of the hostage.

936
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:45,600
 I can really shoot you, Hyung!

937
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:49,720
♫  Be different  ♫
