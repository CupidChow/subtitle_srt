1
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,740

2
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,590

3
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,140
- Jung Shin! 
 - You scared me!

4
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,720
Here. I got this for you.

5
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,970
It's nothing.

6
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,760
What's all of this?

7
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,410
- Where are they? 
 - That way.

8
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,330
I'm still curious about something.

9
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,120
Yes, what is it?

10
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,000
When we were in Yeosu, why did you choose me?

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,720
I mean, Cheol Woong is smart and from a prestigious family.

12
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,290
So why did you choose a poor agricultural student like me?

13
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,320
Are you still so curious about that?

14
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,430
Yes.

15
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,990
Then if you were me, you would have chosen Cheol Woong?

16
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,400
Of course!

17
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,770
Lee Doo Hak doesn't seem to have much of a future.

18
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,660
That's the difference between you and me.

19
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,430
I can see things that you can't.

20
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,500
What difference? My eyesight is really good, too!

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,070
Well, Cheol Woong... Yes.

22
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,030
He's rich; his independence leader's family

23
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,180
is a shining family with wealth and prestige.

24
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,350
Cheol Woong is just an extension of that shining family.

25
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,030
Then I guess I was a bit on the extension of darkness.

26
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,580
Gosh, that's not true.

27
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,370
It's true your family was poor, but your eyes always shone like the rising sun.

28
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,250
The darker it was, the brighter they shone.

29
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,600
Typically, people would lose motivation in circumstances like yours.

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,300
- Was I like that? 
 - Yes.

31
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,540
But the more important reason was

32
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,150
I wanted to become Princess Pyeonggang (married a commoner and made a great general).

33
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,100
"Princess Pyeonggang"?

34
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,810
Then what? Am I a F-Fool Ondal?

35
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,950
That's right. Hey, I think I'm a natural film producer.

36
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,670
Such an unexpected twist to turn this fool

37
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,120
into the best general there is. Isn't it awesome?

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,340
So what you're saying is that I'm an actor

39
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,950
you cast in the film of your life?

40
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,720
- That's right. 
 - Gosh, that's a little disappointing.

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,800
Doo Hak, all of that is meaningless.

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,590
I'm grateful that you've become a kind man under such hard circumstances,

43
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,150
and I felt sad for you when I saw you struggling due to Cheol Woong.

44
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:38,180
And gazing at me, your bright eyes were always honest and touching.

45
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,390
I guess altogether that seems lovely to me, even to this very moment.

46
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,040
Gosh, Jung Shin.

47
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,890
Why? Was it a bit touching?

48
00:03:50,200 --> 00:04:01,000
♫  I already know that we are in love with each other  ♫

49
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,820
♫  We knew that deep within our hearts  ♫

50
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,830
♫  Deep within our hearts  ♫

51
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,570
Be my Princess Pyeonggang.

52
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,830
I will repay you for the rest of my life.

53
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,470
♫  Burning under the sunlight  ♫

54
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,180
Gosh, what is this, Lee Doo Hak? I'm disappointed.

55
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,700
The diamond is this tiny!

56
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,840
Oh, really?

57
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,480
I thought you liked simple things so I intentionally got a small one.

58
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,100
Fine then, I'll get you a huge one.

59
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,530
Just put the ring on me.

60
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,340
Hurry and put the ring on me, Fool Ondal!

61
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,740
♫  I want to go to you, but I cannot  ♫

62
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,600
♫   I want to see you, but I cannot  ♫

63
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,110
♫  In this everlasting time  ♫

64
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,610
♫   I want to go to you, but I cannot  ♫

65
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,370
♫   I want to see you, but I cannot  ♫

66
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,400
♫  In this everlasting time  ♫

67
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,450
Thank you, Doo Hak.

68
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,630
And I don't need diamonds and stuff.

69
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,940
You are my diamond.

70
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,270
I'll slay you if you take away my diamond!

71
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,220
So don't ever leave me for the rest of my life.

72
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,260
Thanks, Jung Shin.

73
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,870
I love you, too.

74
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,510
♫  Until the moment I must forget you  ♫

75
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,540
♫  I want to love you  ♫

76
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,320
Lee Doo Hak was reported dead after he disappeared.

77
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,070
And no one entered the country under the name Lee Doo Hak.

78
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,960
After looking into the immigration records,

79
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,940
he came from Tokyo to Gimpo (airport) as Lee Hyeong Guk, a foreign national from Japan.

80
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,130
Check his every move and report to me all you find. Got it?

81
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,790
What are you doing just standing there?

82
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,780
- Yes, Sir! 
 - Get out!

83
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,510
Toot-toot!

84
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,040
What's with such a pretty cake?

85
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,160
Welcome aboard our boat!

86
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,630
Congratulations!

87
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,180
I hope we can safely cross the seas breaking through waves.

88
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,170
- Of course, we will. 
 - Of course!

89
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,820
Our captain is an amazing man.

90
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,140
Did he not cross the seas of death to get here?

91
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,510
All right. Hyungnim and Sister-in-law!

92
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,620
Let's wish for you two to never be separated again!

93
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,060
- Blow out the candles already so we can eat cake! 
 - Yes, we should.

94
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,820
Jung Shin, here. One, two!

95
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,930
All right. For Jung Shin, the bride-to-be...

96
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,250
 Cheers!

97
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,530

98
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,660

99
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,510
Hold on.

100
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,620
Yes, it's Hotel Rice Soup.

101
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,470
Someone is on your tail.

102
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,530
Who sent him?

103
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,500
Well, it's Choi Cheol Woong.

104
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,530
 Since I gave you an important piece of info,

105
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,880
Lee Doo Hak should also give me an important piece of info.

106
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,920
Bring me proof who tried to have me killed.

107
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,860
- I feel you've gotten even prettier. 
 - Come on...

108
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,680
Someone is tailing us.

109
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,710
Excuse me?

110
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,720
I think they figured out your identity.

111
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,090
Oh Man Ok, that b*stard–

112
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,180
No.

113
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,840
Choi Cheol Woong put him on us.

114
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,510
- What? 
 - Quietly exit the kitchen back door.

115
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,460
We will have to close down here a while.

116
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,740
Hyung, we'll need to speed up our plan.

117
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,530
Got it.

118
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,800
Doo Hak.

119
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,040
Just meet with Cheol Woong, not avoid him.

120
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,980
I will go with you. He can't act rashly in front of you.

121
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,850
I'll meet with him. I should at least give him a chance.

122
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:34,150
Well, he might have changed, but I'll go alone.

123
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,030
Let me go with you.

124
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,320
I'd feel uneasy.

125
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,800
Also, you know we need to resolve some things by ourselves.

126
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,420
Since Cheol Woong brought in the general, we'll have to bring in reinforcements.

127
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,070
The one who was asked to kill you was that guy,

128
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,950
and the one who hired him was...

129
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,700
He's here.

130
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,420
Lee Doo Hak came back alive.

131
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,060
I know.

132
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,700
How did you...

133
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,250
Then

134
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,760
do you know the source of his funds to do what he wants here?

135
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,600
"Source of his funds"?

136
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,800
If I tell you everything truthfully,

137
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
put Lee Doo Hak in jail and guarantee my business' safety and mine.

138
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,850
Look at this b*stard. Tell me.

139
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,050
Lee Doo Hak is running an illegal private gambling house with me.

140
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,960
Running what?

141
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,130
"A private gambling house"?

142
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,610
Yes.

143
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:07,440
He split the shares with me, and we are running about fifteen in the country.

144
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,710
From now on, whatever that b*stard, Lee Doo Hak, does wherever,

145
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,730
I will become your eyes, Prosecutor.

146
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,890
Call me anytime.

147
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,960
Does it feel real to you now?

148
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,070
Even if it weren't for me, you would have died anyway.

149
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,650
If that b*stard keeps delaying it, he may hire someone else to do the job.

150
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,820
If you're scared, just go into hiding while you're still ahead.

151
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,920
If I do that, I would lose everything.

152
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,900
Why?

153
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,570
I'm sure you could live off the money you made up to this point.

154
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,880
That's chump change compared to money I made for that family.

155
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,180
And they're an organization that can take away even that.

156
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,250
I must strike them first and withdraw.

157
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,260
Hwang Choong Sung's slush fund?

158
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,590
That would be impossible.

159
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,660
Kang Yeo Jin's wealth,

160
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,350
that is possible.

161
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,590

162
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,470
Wh—

163
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,860
Who are you?

164
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,410
Oh, yes. You must be tired.

165
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,530
Here, drink one.

166
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,170
Oh, you are working so hard.

167
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,100
Oh my, Song Yeon Ju!

168
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,120
Wow, you're so pretty, Song Yeon Ju!

169
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,480
Aigoo!

170
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,990
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

171
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,880
I'm doing well, as always.

172
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,090
But if it's all right with you, could I get an autograph?

173
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,910
Let's finish discussing business first.

174
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,830
Yes, of course.

175
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,910
Please take a seat.

176
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,800
She is the owner of a building in Apgujeong.

177
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,420
You know very well who this is without me introducing her, right?

178
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,560
Hello.

179
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,650
It's nice to meet you.

180
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,680
Well, the building custodian gave me a tour so I got a good look at it.

181
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,980
There weren't any water leaks. It was quite clean.

182
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,560
Of course.

183
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,090
It was built recently so of course, it should be clean.

184
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,410
Also, this is only possible since the owner here is in a rush.

185
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,300
It's listed at a ridiculously low price.

186
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
So did you make a decision?

187
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,270
- Please lower the price. 
 - Excuse me?

188
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,810
Since the building is so large, it's difficult to gather necessary funds.

189
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,640
Please lower the price by 500 million won.

190
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,030
I can't do that. It's already listed at a low price.

191
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,370
A down payment of 10 billion won and a balance of 2 billion won.

192
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,860
I can't take anything below that.

193
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,880
The owner here is in a rush so she put it up for such an absurdly low price.

194
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,770
Then give me a 300 million won discount.

195
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,470
Gosh...

196
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,450
This is driving me nuts.

197
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,910
Ma'am, what will you do?

198
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,910
You know the situation with my son.

199
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,580
How about both sides consider it for one more day?

200
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,270
I can't promise no one will buy it in that time.

201
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,450
All right.

202
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,850
Wait!

203
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,070
How about that autograph I asked for?

204
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,360
Well, as for that...

205
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,990
I will give it to you when I sign the contract.

206
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,480
Oh, okay.

207
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,060
Gosh, this is awkward.

208
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,360
Well, don't worry about this, Ma'am.

209
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,880
Accountant?

210
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,560
Will you have a cup of tea with me?

211
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,010
Yes, you did great. Please wrap things up well.

212
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,860
Thanks.

213
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,710
That's all you wanted from me, after all this time?

214
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,050
Sorry.

215
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,990
If you're sorry, then don't ask me for favors.

216
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:00,580
You asked me to break up when you went to jail, and now you ask me to con someone.

217
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,340
It won't cause you any harm.

218
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,960
Let me ask a favor, too.

219
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,070
A special marriage and a unique divorce,

220
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:18,470
as a result, it was easy to return to acting, but it's taking forever to forget you.

221
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,990
You should come back to me.

222
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,120
Will you retire again? I might end up back in jail.

223
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,600
You still value loyalty more than love.

224
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,380
No, I just have bad fortune so you'll become unhappy.

225
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,010
I'm sorry, and I'm grateful.

226
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,390
I won't ever call you again.

227
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,170
Please live happily.

228
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,110
All right.

229
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,020
I won't wait for you any longer.

230
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:10,380
♫  What kind of meeting should I prepare for?  ♫

231
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:17,800
♫  But remember what we talked about in the past  ♫

232
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,730
♫  And I, who turns away from you after our breakup  ♫

233
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,870
♫  My love  ♫

234
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,440
- Where is she? 
 - She's inside.

235
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,890
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes, we're sure.

236
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,600
Doo Hak.

237
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,550
Jung Ok will be in shock. I'll go first.

238
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,110
Okay.

239
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,690
Jung Ok.

240
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,500
Unnie.

241
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,260
How did you find me?

242
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,530
Your brother came with me.

243
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,450
My brother?

244
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,270
Do you still run away when I'm not around?

245
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,910
Oppa.

246
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,200
What happened?

247
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,800
I came back from the dead so I can take you home.

248
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:46,190
♫  If in those pure eyes, the raindrops well up  ♫

249
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,110
I'm sorry, Mom.

250
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,330
No.

251
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,170
No.

252
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,820
Thank you, my child.

253
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,870
Thank you.

254
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,700
It's all right. Everything's all right.

255
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,060
 From now on, don't come here.

256
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,040
 - Don't put money in my canteen either. 
 - Oppa.

257
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,850
 I'll be out on parole soon.

258
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,170
 That's great news! I'll tell our comrades as well.

259
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,260
 No. Don't tell them.

260
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,190
 Excuse me?

261
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,100
 When I leave,

262
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,990
 I don't think

263
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,610
 I can be with you anymore.

264
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,240
 What do you mean?

265
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,480
 You can curse me all you want.

266
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,050
 From now on, I will be walking a different path than you guys.

267
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,560
 Thank you for our time together.

268
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,860
 Why are you suddenly being like this?

269
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,510
 Oppa.

270
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,740
 Oppa!

271
00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:00,930
♫  It was love  ♫

272
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,140

273
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,350
What, they're getting this much profit?

274
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,080
What is this nonsense?

275
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,690
In the case of a special sale of housing in Suseo,

276
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,850
this is the projected profit by Ministry of Works and Seoul City Hall.

277
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:19,610
There was a big difference from what you told Ms. Kang, Chairman.

278
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,840
That's because civil servants don't know everything.

279
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,180
So many funds are not calculated into the estimate!

280
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,190
You know that well, Team Captain.

281
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,790
In any case, Ms. Kang is very disappointed.

282
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,510
So then what?

283
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,100
Are you saying she wants more?

284
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,860
We can never do that.

285
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,410
Then

286
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,180
pull out our money.

287
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,920
What?

288
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,310
How could we do that at this stage?

289
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:53,600
If the Deputy Director finds out, things would become uncomfortable for you.

290
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,060
These borrowed name accounts of our company,

291
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,180
break up the funds into tenths and deposit them there.

292
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,710
We will give you a bit more of the profits.

293
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,400
We can't give you a lot.

294
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,600
As you know, many expenses can't be listed on financial statements.

295
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,540
Right. There is also the insurance money,

296
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,520
just in case the project goes under.

297
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,350
And that was your main goal in asking me to join you in this venture.

298
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,450
We will give you 5% more. We can't give you any more.

299
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,600
- Let's just forget it then. 
 - Ms. Kang.

300
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,750
I was disappointed that you didn't tell me honestly from the start.

301
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,170
Isn't trust the basics of business?

302
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,890
I understand.

303
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:57,360
If you want more than that, give us some time to consider.

304
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,900
But Ms. Kang, don't ever give me something like this again.

305
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,290
What's this?

306
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,640
Aren't they the borrowed name accounts you asked us to deposit the money into?

307
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,960
What are you doing?

308
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,610
Can't you even figure out Lee Doo Hak's whereabouts?

309
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,140
I'm sorry.

310
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,450
He keeps evading us as if he knows we're tailing him.

311
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,600
Instead of making excuses,

312
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,000
- hurry up and find him. 
 - Yes, Sir.

313
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,520
It appears something isn't working out for you.

314
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,190
If there's something I can help you with, please tell me.

315
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,900
I will help you whenever you need me.

316
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,440
"Help"?

317
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,790
Don't you mean threaten?

318
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,860
Geez. What are you so hung up on now?

319
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,150
Someone will do great things in the future.

320
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,960
I don't know.

321
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,600
I want to do great things, but I have shackles around my ankles.

322
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,890
Don't just think of it as shackles.

323
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:14,210
Wouldn't it feel better to see it as a symbiotic (mutual) relationship like a crocodile and crocodile bird?

324
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,620
"Symbiotic relationship"?

325
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,480
Instead of a parasitic relationship?

326
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,910
If it's symbiotic or parasitic, isn't it the same that they live together?

327
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:27,610
Wouldn't you need to kill a parasite to become healthy?

328
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,100
Do you know who will win if a lion and tiger fight in an open field?

329
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,240
The answer is nobody wins.

330
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,230
The lion and tiger know each other all too well.

331
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,720
Even if one kills the other and wins,

332
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,020
it would get critically injured and ultimately die as well.

333
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:57,650
So a lion and a tiger avoid each other. They never fight each other.

334
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,470
So...

335
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,980
are you saying you are a lion or a tiger, Team Captain Oh?

336
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,700
Are you saying you won't die alone? Something like that?

337
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,800
From what I can see, you are just a leech.

338
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,890
You latch on and drain the blood out of them. I think you do more harm than good.

339
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,750
Don't you want to work with me?

340
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,260
With my help, you can achieve what you want,

341
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,290
get the person you want, and defeat that one you want.

342
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,880
You could resolve all of that.

343
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,270
Didn't you hear what I said?

344
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,530
Get the heck out of my sight!

345
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,490
I will

346
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,730
get the heck out of your sight.

347
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,530
Oh, Mother, what brings you here?

348
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,220
Hey.

349
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,630
I need to discuss something with you.

350
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,970
What is it?

351
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,000
Well, since Doo Hak and Jung Ok returned,

352
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,510
there's just one more thing I need to do.

353
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,380
But the thing is...

354
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,090
people would be a bit shocked if they found out.

355
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,140
So I really don't know what I should do.

356
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,580
What is it, Mother?

357
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,680
My gosh.

358
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,900
But what is Doo Hak up to right now?

359
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,230
Actually, I have something to tell you as well.

360
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,050
This is Choi Cheol Woong.

361
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,680
It's me.

362
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,170
Hyung. You were alive?

363
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,210
As if this is news...

364
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,510
You knew already.

365
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,120
I suppose.

366
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,260
You should have called me sooner since you're back.

367
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,310
Is that really true?

368
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,450
I'm so sorry, Mother.

369
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,290
I should have told you sooner.

370
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:47,760
I feel so bad for Doo Hak, who took the blame for a crime he didn't commit.

371
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,710
Goodness...

372
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,760
My goodness...

373
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,570
Goodness, how will we be punished for all we've done?

374
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:02,460
Gosh, goodness. How will we be punished for all this?

375
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,720
That's why... that's why he said that...

376
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,570
 Who knows what can happen in this world?

377
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,670
 Also, we didn't commit a sin or anything

378
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,380
 so shouldn't Cheol Woong know now, too?

379
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,190
 It would make things complicated

380
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,520
 for Doo Hak and Cheol Woong.

381
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,960
My wretched husband didn't tell me anything!

382
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,270
This won't do. It looks like I really need to step in!

383
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,490
Goodness! Goodness...

384
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:40,620
♫  Will I be able to come to you again?  ♫

385
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:47,540
♫  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  ♫

386
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:54,890
♫  Above the rough sky, my heart floats away  ♫

387
00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:03,030
♫  Only your name is engraved like this  ♫

388
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,060
What's with that look?

389
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:16,350
Are you glad to see me or disappointed?

390
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,420
I'm just in disbelief.

391
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,880
Sit down.

392
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,610
Still, I thought you would at least pretend to be glad to see me.

393
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,680
I'm glad to see you.

394
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,230
Jung Shin wanted to come with me, but I stopped her.

395
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,340
Since we need to resolve it ourselves.

396
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,180
If you were alive, you should have contacted me.

397
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,000
Do you know how much I struggled and blamed myself?

398
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:06,920
If the shooter is struggling, how much more pain do you think the one felt who got shot and

399
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,910
fell into the cold ocean?

400
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,680
Did I shoot the gun?

401
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,190
I wanted you to flee to a foreign country.

402
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,100
A fugitive?

403
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,400
What difference is there between living as a wanderer and dying?

404
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,590
So what?

405
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,310
Did you come to get revenge?

406
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,860
Shall I apologize to you?

407
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,610
Cheol Woong.

408
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,520
As for an apology, you don't do it because you were told to.

409
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,970
You just have to apologize if you're at fault.

410
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,050
Hyung, you know where I'm at now, right?

411
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,750
Getting rid of you is a piece of cake for me.

412
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,030
Of course, I know that.

413
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,680
A mere gangster has a hard time handling a prosecutor,

414
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,840
let alone someone who's part of Namsan.

415
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,470
I'm not that stupid.

416
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,670
Then what do you want?

417
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:21,150
I want to get back to the life I had before I died and live quietly.

418
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,500
That's all I need.

419
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,480
Is that it?

420
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,940
When the right time comes, I will go abroad with my family and live there.

421
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,820
What about Jung Shin?

422
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,670
She would need to come with me.

423
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,440
She promised to marry me.

424
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,680
What if I say no?

425
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,560
Cheol Woong.

426
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,970
I know how much you liked Jung Shin.

427
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,660
Jung Shin is not a possession.

428
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,460
She's not someone you can have just because you want her.

429
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:12,710
Jung Shin said she would go with me wherever I go.

430
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:18,970
So... just let go of us, please.

431
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,360
I'll let you go.

432
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,860
- But only you, Hyung. 
 - Cheol Woong.

433
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,250
You can't have Jung Shin.

434
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,510
She wouldn't go to you anyway.

435
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:45,760
She even knows I went to prison in your place already.

436
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,250
I'm not saying I'll hold onto her.

437
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,480
I can't leave Jung Shin to be

438
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,000
with a man who may get locked up any day on the run for the rest of his life.

439
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,470
It doesn't have to be me,

440
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,100
but I just can't watch Jung Shin become miserable.

441
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:11,170
You really haven't changed at all.

442
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,010
You're the one who hasn't changed at all,

443
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,630
still thinking of only yourself.

444
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,080
If you had agreed to let us go,

445
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:38,860
I was really going to forgive you.

446
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,570
The life that I lost due to you, and my father who died an unjust death,

447
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:48,870
but I'd say I'll forget everything

448
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:54,180
and live quietly back in my place.

449
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,190
Is that such a...

450
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,620
such a hard request for you to grant?

451
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,070
Are you saying even that much is...

452
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,450
an unfathomable greed for people like me, you son of a b*tch?

453
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,630
No.

454
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:24,870
You should dream about your happiness all you want.

455
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:29,490
It's also true I'm indebted to you.

456
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:34,450
That's why... that's why I'm saying I'll let you live!

457
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,240
I'll give you one week. Go back to Japan.

458
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,150
Go back and live on as Korean Japanese Lee Hyeong Guk.

459
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,490
If you do that, nothing will happen.

460
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,640
Got it?

461
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,680
Cheol Woong!

462
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:06,750
You really can't do this for me?

463
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,380
Must you really go this far?

464
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,040
Doo Hak!

465
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,330
How did it go?

466
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,670
You couldn't get his apology?

467
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,310
Does he even have a sense of conscience?

468
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:07,520
How could he not even apologize after ruining your life completely?

469
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,180
I thought about it on the way back.

470
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,890
I now think Cheol Woong never did anything wrong.

471
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:17,050
- What? 
 - A person doesn't change.

472
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,220
It's only the position of a person that changes.

473
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,940
The high schooler Choi Cheol Woong and the current Choi Cheol Woong,

474
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,880
he's still the same person. Isn't he?

475
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:32,270
Choi Cheol Woong still looks at me the same way,

476
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,880
as the servant's son.

477
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,420
I guess that's why they say if a person changes,

478
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,810
it means his death is near,

479
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,330
since it's impossible.

480
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,560
That rotten b*stard.

481
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,820
He told me to leave you and Korea in one week,

482
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,010
saying nothing will happen if I do that.

483
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,290
Don't worry.

484
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,610
As long as I'm here, that b*stard can't lay a finger on you.

485
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:01,840
I'll block all the arrows coming your way.

486
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,920
Choi Cheol Woong isn't our only foe.

487
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,330
We must take on Hwang Choong Sung and Kang Yeo Jin.

488
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,600
It'll be a difficult fight.

489
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,300
Doo Hak, what's gotten into you?

490
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,600
I'm a news magazine publisher, a journalist who surveils those in power.

491
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,620
Jung Shin, although Cheol Woong is twisted,

492
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:20,000
even you know his feelings for you were sincere.

493
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,400
Cheol Woong might be fully ruined when the trigger is pulled.

494
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,850
Will you be okay with that?

495
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,460
Go ahead.

496
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,450
Go ahead, nonetheless.

497
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,330
Choi Cheol Woong is really a messed-up b*stard.

498
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,100
It's true I feel bad, too.

499
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,170
However, the pain you had to suffer,

500
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,840
it's hell for me to see you relive that pain.

501
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,980
So go ahead...

502
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,100
and strike first before you get hurt.

503
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,480

504
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,960
I haven't heard of these companies.

505
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,020
Are these accounts related to your company?

506
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,560
They're related but how did you know, Mother?

507
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,120
I used a different alias, but why did he use those?

508
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,580
This is a common method.

509
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,400
You need to split the money to launder a big sum without getting traced.

510
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,520
The more you split, the less suspicion you get.

511
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,510
Anyhow, did you make a big investment in something?

512
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,660
Or did Father tell you about this?

513
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,730
No, your father doesn't know.

514
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,380
I had trouble with Chairman Geum.

515
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,390
But Team Captain Oh went to Chairman Geum

516
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:49,900
and told him to split my capital and deposit them into these accounts.

517
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:57,310
When we're laundering money, we need to report to our superiors.

518
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,530
But I didn't get any reports about this.

519
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:04,380
Also, these accounts aren't to be used for personal reasons.

520
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,600
What the heck is Team Leader Oh doing?

521
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,300
It's fine.

522
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,700
He was probably trying to get the money back safely,

523
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,150
since you or your father didn't know about it.

524
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,230
Hurry inside and rest.

525
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,590
Okay.

526
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,480
Mother.

527
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,990
Why?

528
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,470
It's nothing.

529
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,260
What is it?

530
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,510
I'll tell you at a later time.

531
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,470
Wow, Seoul sure is different, right?

532
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,590

533
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,300
How are you, Sir?

534
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,080
The air is stuffier than the oceanside, right?

535
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,680
Hello.

536
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,380
I called you since a good sword was rotting away.

537
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,180
A nutcase like me?

538
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,150
Nutcases are the ones who get the big shots.

539
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,110
Let's grab some dinner later.

540
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,270
Yes! Please take care!

541
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,490
Please buy me a delicious meal!

542
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,250
Yes, Kim Sung Yeob speaking.

543
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,630
Congratulations on entering Seoul.

544
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,650
No Sook Ja?

545
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,610
 Are you behind this too?

546
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,980
Come on, how could a homeless person like me do this?

547
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,710
Anyway, keep a sword nice and sharp.

548
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,650
 When will you show me your face?

549
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,790
 Do I come to Seoul Station?

550
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,770
I moved.

551
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,220
I'll come to you.

552
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,600
Yes!

553
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,400
Thank you.

554
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,040
A deposit of 10 billion won has been confirmed.

555
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,010
Aigoo, my son is safe now.

556
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,520
Aigoo, thank you for your work.

557
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,980
- Please give me your seal. 
 - Oh, yes.

558
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,230

559
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,080
Please let me know about good properties in the future.

560
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,920
Aigoo, no question about that.

561
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,360
Madam.

562
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,200
Please give me your seal.

563
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,680
This building is already profitable the moment you buy it.

564
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,520
You've got yourself a really great deal.

565
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,830

566
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,300
All right. Congratulations.

567
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,290
Now then...

568
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,880
By the way,

569
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,020
I'll pay the remaining balance of ₩2 billion next month.

570
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,560
- Oh, yes. Sure. 
 - S-Sure.

571
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,270
Yes, a month later.

572
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,470

573
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,650
♫  Lift my voice higher  ♫

574
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,780
Hurry, hurry!

575
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:02,320
♫  Bye bye, Fellows, I am leaving first  ♫

576
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,380
♫  There's no reason for me to be here  ♫

577
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:14,180
♫  Beat goes on, raise the volume for me  ♫

578
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,840
Hands in the air!

579
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:25,050
♫  Hit the wall now, I grow my strength more  ♫

580
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:30,880
♫  I will give one blow with all I've got  ♫

581
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:37,280
♫  Pressures I felt until now, I will throw it aside  ♫

582
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,960
 He barged in as you said.

583
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,180
That's our Prosecutor Choi, never keeping his promises.

584
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,650
He's trying to tie down my source of income first.

585
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,360
However, I won't let him.

586
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,520
You'd better keep your promise.

587
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,140
You're giving me all of your shares.

588
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,080
All right.

589
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,370
♫  Let me burn; take the world. Hey, look at me  ♫

590
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:01,170
Prosecutor Choi, why are you doing this to me?

591
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,160
I handed over all the information to you!

592
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,260
Hey, how can I trust a thug?

593
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,700
Don't you agree?

594
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:18,400
♪ Don't go too far away ♪

595
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:27,440
♪ Oh, I think I'll die ♪

596
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,370
- How is it? 
 - Wow, that's one great song.

597
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,930
Really?

598
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,440
It was worth secluding yourself in the countryside,

599
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,790
totally worth it.

600
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,850
Does that mean I get to feature my song in a movie now?

601
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,310
Well... sure.

602
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,340
Let's find a script that fits the song.

603
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,210
- Gosh, Jung Shin! 
 - Yes!

604
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,580
- It was a decent script. 
 - Really?

605
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:01,240
Cheol Woong.

606
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,440
What's up?

607
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,840
I said we won't ever see each other again.

608
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,670
I'm here strictly for official business.

609
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:12,330
I'll go on home first.

610
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:16,320
Is there any official business between us?

611
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,310
Lee Doo Hak will be publicly wanted soon.

612
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,190
But I gave him some time.

613
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:27,100
So could you tell him to stop being stubborn and leave, please?

614
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,050
Why didn't you apologize to Doo Hak?

615
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,640
What difference does my apology make?

616
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,420
- You're really— 
 - I mean...

617
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,460
you also deceived me.

618
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,800
You knew Hyung Doo Hak was alive.

619
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,590
- And you were obviously meeting him. 
 - Hey, Choi Cheol Woong!

620
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,780
You can't do this to me.

621
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,000
You can't do this to me!

622
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,040
And why can't I?

623
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,390
You hid the truth behind Doo Hak's sentence ever since.

624
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,300
Why did you apologize to me but not to Doo Hak?

625
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,990
Why aren't you letting him go?

626
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,430
He was your friend and hyung who sacrificed himself for you.

627
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,780
Shouldn't you be the one doing this?

628
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,280
It's because you'll be miserable.

629
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,840
I just can't bear to watch you become miserable, okay?

630
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,500
Will you live as a fugitive with Hyung Doo Hak until you die?

631
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,590
I'm fine being on the run for the rest of my life.

632
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,290
I'll protect Doo Hak.

633
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,360
Reporter Shin, you got the information, right?

634
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,890
Let us prepare now.

635
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,360

636
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,930
There's a problem.

637
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,360
Lee Doo Hak's currently working with Chairman Chae Dong Pal.

638
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,030
What?

639
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,450
Hey!

640
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,280
What's the matter?

641
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,550
Why didn't you tell me, Chairman Chae?

642
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:24,430
That Lee Doo Hak works for you.

643
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:28,000
"Lee Doo Hak"? Who is that?

644
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,990
I'm talking about Lee Hyeong Guk!

645
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,780
Oh, Lee Hyeong Guk. He does work for me.

646
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:38,550
Do I need to introduce you to everyone who works for me?

647
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,450
Lee Doo Hak, no—

648
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:45,770
Lee Hyeong Guk is a criminal who ran away from Korea.

649
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,450
Send him back to Japan at once.

650
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:53,740
If you don't, you'll have a lot of trouble doing business in Korea, Chairman Chae.

651
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,920
I don't know what crime this Lee Doo Hak committed.

652
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,370
But I just don't know him.

653
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:02,600
The only person I know is Lee Hyeong Guk.

654
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:08,710
He's never committed any crime, and he's a young man who works diligently for me.

655
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:14,790
I can't just send back a person I need just because you said so.

656
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,630
Chairman Chae, if you protect a criminal,

657
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,690
you could end up getting punished.

658
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,300
Are you threatening him right now?

659
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,730
It's not a threat. I'm just worried for him.

660
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:28,100
Hae Sung.

661
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,310
Please take your leave.

662
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,780
Why? Did the talk not go well?

663
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,100
Seriously.

664
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,060
People still don't know what kind of person Lee Doo Hak is.

665
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,790
Hyung, I clearly gave you a chance.

666
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,130
I'm the one who gave you a chance.

667
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:07,140
By the way, Hyung, are you sure you can beat me?

668
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,380
 Hyung. Will you be able to beat me?

669
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,450
 Who said I would fight with you?

670
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:15,070
 I really don't care so you do what you want!

671
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,760
Why doesn't a smart guy like you see that?

672
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,430
You lost your first place to me in high school once, right? You asked me then.

673
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:27,130
 Congratulations.

674
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,890
 Oh, no. I guessed a few.

675
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,300
 I just got lucky.

676
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,450
 For this exam, did you study with all your might for Jung Shin?

677
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:40,940
You were right. It was for Jung Shin; however,

678
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,110
do you know what was more difficult?

679
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:48,310
It's maintaining second place by a few points.

680
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:52,160
I'm saying losing to you purposely was harder.

681
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,650
I won't let you win anymore.

682
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:05,910
All right. Let's bring it on.

683
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,570
Welcome.

684
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,180
Have you been well?

685
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,690
You've been doing well, right?

686
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,500
Well, yes. Of course.

687
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,030
By the way, why did you want to see me so suddenly?

688
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,280
The thing is...

689
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:44,110
I'm a little busy right now.

690
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,940
If it's nothing urgent, I'll come back later.

691
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,500
I heard you did it, right?

692
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,230
Sorry?

693
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:58,820
In Yeosu...

694
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,340
I heard you did it, right?

695
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,850
Yes.

696
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,230
Just how painful must it have been for you all this time?

697
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,640
Wh-Why?

698
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,070
Is that what Hyung Doo Hak said?

699
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,650
Tell him to announce it on the news instead.

700
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:32,430
He can just let the news say

701
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:36,600
Choi Cheol Woong was the murderer, not Lee Doo Hak!

702
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,750
Wh-What's the matter, Cheol Woong?

703
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,610
You're right.

704
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:45,090
I'm acting a little weird today.

705
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,580
I'll get going now.

706
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,880
Cheol Woong, Cheol Woong!

707
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,080
Cheol Woong!

708
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,270
Cheol Woong! Just listen—

709
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:54,280
Cheol Woong, just hear me out one second.

710
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,860
Cheol Woong.

711
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,030
Cheol Woong, Cheol Woong! Just hear me one second.

712
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,340
Ahjumma, get back inside, all right?

713
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,450
Listen to me!

714
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:04,710
Cheol Woong! Cheol Woong!

715
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,820
Cheol Woong!

716
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,110
Cheol Woong.

717
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:15,560
Just listen to what I have to say one second.

718
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,530
It's custom-made in Japan.

719
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:26,540
You won't try to eavesdrop on our talking smack about you, will you?

720
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,520
Thank you.

721
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,320
Nothing is free. You owe me one for this.

722
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,260
Secure the recording and hand it over to me.

723
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:42,090
Then it all ends when you take the money and escape overseas.

724
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,760
Okay.

725
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,720
Does that mean I'm getting a happy ending now?

726
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,520
I don't want to let you have one, but you should go.

727
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,810
Get out of this country.

728
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:58,240
That's how this country will be a little cleaner.

729
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:05,130
But if you fail to secure the evidence, you'll be trashed at the Nanjido dump site.

730
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,890
Right.

731
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,880
Since we're on the same boat now...

732
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,650
want me to tell you a funny story?

733
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,700
I don't know what you're scheming,

734
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,000
but nothing you say will surprise or interest me anymore.

735
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,150
You know Choi Cheol Woong's birth father...

736
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:44,460
It is known to be Deputy Director Hwang Choong Sung.

737
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,440
But did you know this?

738
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,080
I got a call from Chairman Chae Dong Pal.

739
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,310
I heard you went to him.

740
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:11,250
- Yes. 
 - You should have discussed it with me.

741
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,500
I'm sorry.

742
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,010
You're already busy with the election.

743
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:17,040
I didn't want to be a burden.

744
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,830
I wanted to take care of it myself.

745
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,840
Just keep a watch for now.

746
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,820
Chairman Chae Dong Pal said he does good work.

747
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,430
He can't continue business with us if he sends him back to Japan.

748
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,710
A phenomenal amount of money was invested in this election.

749
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,490
We must save every bullet right now.

750
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,330
We can't give up the ammunition depot due to that one little thug.

751
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:39,800
Deputy Director, Lee Doo Hak isn't just a little thug.

752
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,060
Is it because of Jung Shin?

753
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,580
I don't think she is in the cards for you.

754
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,910
You should forget her now.

755
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,010
I'll have someone else watch Lee Doo Hak.

756
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:52,180
No, I'll put an end to it.

757
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,540
I told you to stop!

758
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,750
You may leave.

759
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,580
Aigoo, the national security is sighing away.

760
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,820
What makes you sigh so heavily?

761
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,440
Have you a concern or something?

762
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,680
Why do you ask?

763
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,020
Is the parasite trying to steal away my worries now?

764
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:22,760
A parasite steals everything that the host has, doesn't it?

765
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,990
By the way...

766
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:30,520
what are you trying to pull off scheming... between my mother and Chairman Geum?

767
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,750
Why did you give company accounts to Geum Man Cheol?

768
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:37,320
Do you want Madam's funds to be traced?

769
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,240
In that case...

770
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,110
you need to report to either Deputy Director or me, you a**hole.

771
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,960
"Report"?

772
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,770
Does it need reporting?

773
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:57,570
Deputy Director doesn't even know Madam invested in Geum Man Cheol.

774
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:04,160
I just did that to keep peace in the family. I'm starting to get offended here.

775
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,490
I'm sure I said we should respect each other.

776
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:12,280
Gosh, this f***ing insect.

777
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,980
Why?

778
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,280
Are you frustrated...

779
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,570
I didn't die?

780
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:26,270
Yes, B*stard. I'm frustrated.

781
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,590
How long do you think Deputy Director will be your umbrella?

782
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:32,410
You think he'll be your umbrella?

783
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,110
An a**hole with a rootless family...

784
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:42,850
What?

785
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:57,610
A pathetic a**hole who can't even take care of a f**king thug.

786
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:11,940
 Choi Cheol Woong knows I sent company accounts to Geum Man Cheol.

787
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,400
I can't withdraw the money, even if Geum Man Cheol deposits it in that account.

788
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,430
- What? 
 -  This means there's nothing in this for me.

789
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:23,230
I'm not really motivated to work.

790
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,760
I'll make up for it.

791
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,320
- How? 
 -  I'll deposit a billion won to your account.

792
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,920
The rest will be exchanged with the evidence once it's secured.

793
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,710
Then deposit it first.

794
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,960
I'll get on it once I see the money.

795
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:45,930

796
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:50,460

797
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,050
- Everyone is ready, right? 
 - Yes.

798
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:03,010
We secure the evidence that Hwang Choong Sung killed Doo Hak's dad and

799
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:04,750
expose it through Jung Shin's magazine.

800
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:07,300
Prosecutor Kim Sung Yeob will make his move after.

801
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,580
Preferential treatment for Kang Yeo Jin and provoked murder by Hwang Choong Sung.

802
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:15,300
The investigations on NSA's slush funds will extend like sweet potato stems (6 inches).

803
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,220
What about Choi Cheol Woong, who framed someone else for his murder?

804
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,290
Once Choi Cheol Woong's parents are doomed,

805
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,800
he's bound to sink along with them.

806
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,290
Everyone, listen up.

807
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,500
We don't have a second chance, no mistakes.

808
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,420
Yes!

809
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,520
Let's go catch the villains!

810
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,290
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go!

811
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,100
 Take a seat.

812
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,460
 You have a lot of hard work lately, Sir.

813
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,950
All right. What did you want to tell me?

814
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,330
Hurry and tell me.

815
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:26,830
I'm sorry to tell you this...

816
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:30,330
but I think it's time for me to leave your side.

817
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,470
What do you mean?

818
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,170
You promised to go to the end with me, didn't you?

819
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,490
I think this is the end of my abilities.

820
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:40,860
I'm sorry to keep causing trouble and burdening you.

821
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,330
What's the matter?

822
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:45,100
That's all in the past now. Everyone has a flaw or two.

823
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,450
We have many ordeals like congressional and presidential elections.

824
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:50,000
Who can I trust if I don't have you?

825
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,840
Many younger, more competent fellows are by your side, Deputy Director.

826
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,740
Especially, you have Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong.

827
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:03,100
Are you upset Cheol Woong is by my side, and I kept my distance from you?

828
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,870
Not at all.

829
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:07,200
You have taken care of me better than anyone else.

830
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,510
You're my captain for life.

831
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:12,430
 I don't even have an inkling of hard feelings toward you.

832
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:16,480
 It's just that I thought this was the end of my work.

833
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,720
 I do keep clashing with Prosecutor Choi and...

834
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,820
 I'm also quite exhausted.

835
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,300
Please accept my request.

836
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,240
Come on now.

837
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,710
I beg of you, Deputy Director.

838
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:35,460
I can't help but feel disappointed.

839
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,780
All right. You do that.

840
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:41,700
Before I leave, there's something I must tell you.

841
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,920
Do you remember Lee Yong Deuk?

842
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,140
Who?

843
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,890
His name is Lee Yong Deuk.

844
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:55,370
 The truck driver who killed Lee Joong Ho, Lee Doo Hak's father.

845
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:01,800
I heard Lee Doo Hak is back in Korea and is looking for Lee Yong Deuk.

846
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,470
 - What? 
 - I think he's suspecting an instigated murder.

847
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:11,220
 If he starts suspecting you of having ordered Lee Yong Deuk...

848
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,950
It'd be quite troublesome, won't it?

849
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:16,800
Team Captain Oh, watch what you say.

850
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,620
I'm sorry.

851
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:22,850
Take care of it of your own volition before you leave.

852
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,370
Yes, I'll take care of it myself.

853
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,120
Also...

854
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,270
there's one more thing I must tell you.

855
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:39,540
 I'm telling you this out of my sincere loyalty.

856
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,860
Prosecutor Choi Cheol Woong

857
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:47,560
isn't your biological son.

858
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,730
I'm sorry, Deputy Director.

859
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:04,540
However...

860
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:11,600
I couldn't bear to let you live on fooled without knowing anything.

861
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,460
Does anyone else besides you know this fact?

862
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:44,750
You're the first one I told, Deputy Director.

863
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:50,790
I also knew that Cheol Woong isn't my biological son.

864
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,020
Wait, but why...

865
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,530
 I just...

866
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:06,660
didn't wish to part ways again with the person I had longed for my entire life.

867
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:10,820
Choi Cheol Woong is also not bad to take as a son.

868
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,640
I can finally understand

869
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,880
why my wife defended you so much.

870
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,830
Both Cheol Woong and

871
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:23,080
Yeo Jin must have had it tough due to you, Team Captain Oh.

872
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,070
That's not true.

873
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:28,350
That's a misunderstanding.

874
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:53,780
Deputy Director.

875
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,520
For my family, please be loyal to the end...

876
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,040
Deputy Director—

877
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:31,680

878
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:40,980

879
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,190

880
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:56,180
 A North Korean spy?

881
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,600
 I don't think you'll be safe here.

882
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,730
 - You may kill him if he resists. 
 - "Kill him"?

883
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:01,660
 Please publish the article quickly tomorrow.

884
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:03,990
 I will hand myself over to the prosecution.

885
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:06,120
 Cheol Woong is really our son, right?

886
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,130
 This is Deputy Director and Cheol Woong's lives, also your life as well.

887
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:10,850
 Please save my dear Cheol Woong.

888
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:11,730
 Turn myself in?

889
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:16,640
 On top of framing me for your murder, you want to frame me for your dad's murder too?

890
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,650
 You two mustn't fight like this!

891
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,280
 Y-You two are brothers.

892
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,860
 No!

893
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,630
 You're not my son if you don't shoot now!

894
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:25,750
 No! No, Cheol Woong.

895
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,220
 I'm begging you. Don't do it.

896
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:32,760
♫  I just want to hold you  ♫
