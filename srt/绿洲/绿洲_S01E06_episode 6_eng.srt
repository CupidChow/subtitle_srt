1
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,440

2
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,330

3
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,850
Oh, Cheol Woong!

4
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,890
Ahjussi! Cheol Woong is here.

5
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,240
You're here?

6
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,710
Cheol Woong...

7
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,520
What do we do?

8
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,800
I feel so bad for your father...

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,640
I feel so bad for your father!

10
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,320
Your father...

11
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,660
I feel so bad for your father!

12
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,920
What to do? What do we do?

13
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,510
What do we do?

14
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,200

15
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,170
You must be in so much pain from mourning the death of your loved one.

16
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,960
He was such a crucial elder in our region

17
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,470
so we sincerely mournâ€“

18
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,160
Instead of mourning, you should be asking for forgiveness.

19
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,230
Why? Did I say something wrong?

20
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,510
Wasn't it you who accused him of engaging in illegal elections even after

21
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,260
he resigned as a candidate? Didn't you harass without letting him

22
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,050
sleep for several days, Chief?

23
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,630
Look here, Chief Mourner. You must be misunderstanding something.

24
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,820
"A misunderstanding"?

25
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,380
He valued his honor as much as his life!

26
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,040
How tormented he must have been that

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,790
he collapsed after drinking day and night for several months?

28
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,490
Let's go!

29
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,840
Thank you for coming!

30
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,100
I will be sure to go visit your mortuary!

31
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,340
Not too long ago, I received a call from Seoul city police.

32
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,560
A student from this village, who got a feast in his honor

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,460
for being the first to get into Hankuk University,

34
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,870
wasn't studying like he was supposed to

35
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,460
but became a pro-communist and participated in anti-government protests!

36
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,960
Also!

37
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,620
I was told to arrest him whenever he came down to this village

38
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,920
and send him up to Seoul!

39
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,400
Mother...

40
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,440
Mother!

41
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,920
You must be so tired from serving the country, Chief.

42
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,780
I am only grateful that you would take the time

43
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,790
out of your busy schedule to come here.

44
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,690
We are in the middle of mourning,

45
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,800
and how could we mourn our loved one without our chief mourner?

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,030
I will speak to him

47
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,000
so please show us some mercy.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,600
I beg you desperately like this.

49
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,620
Watch yourselves.

50
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,530
Your father told me...

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,470
to give you this after his funeral.

52
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,410

53
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,850

54
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,060
 However, your father never did anything that was shameful.

55
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,160
 Do not think about trying to get revenge

56
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,520
 and take good care of your mother.

57
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,810
Father...

58
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,740
left a will telling me not to get revenge.

59
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,420
But you know...

60
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,740
For me, I wonder why

61
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,520
that sounded like a request to get revenge for him at all costs?

62
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,820
I...

63
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,950
I reached this point after going through a lot.

64
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,150
And I will get stronger.

65
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,970
After becoming stronger,

66
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,550
those b*stards who made Father end up like that,

67
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,320
those b*stards who made me so miserable...

68
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,420
I will pay them back for the pain they caused us.

69
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,350
You're all grown up, my son.

70
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,860
Also,

71
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:50,930
I will protect my people so they won't ever be humiliated again like that, Mom.

72
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,590
So what are you saying?

73
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,070
Are you asking me... to find someone?

74
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,050
Please help me...

75
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,940
this once, Coordinator.

76
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,840
Our company is a place where we deal with national security.

77
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,560
It is not a detective agency that finds people.

78
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,000
Why does our company...

79
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,710
ignore the difficulties faced by its family members?

80
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,590
I will become part of the family.

81
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,430
Just help me this once.

82
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,190
Are you serious?

83
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,600
Yes?

84
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,180
What should I do?

85
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,780
He's quite a romanticist, I see.

86
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,120
Help him out.

87
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,870
Understood.

88
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,740

89
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,850
How long will you just sit there with your arms crossed?

90
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,730
We don't have time!

91
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,640
Let's call the police.

92
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,290
Yes, Boss.

93
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,760
We should at least save a person first!

94
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,210
Even if you report it, they can't find her.

95
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,510
Just trust me.

96
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,890
They know if they hurt Jung Shin, they can't stand ground

97
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,080
in this field.

98
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,970
- Aunt! 
 - Boss!

99
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,450
You... If you call Cha Geum Ok right now

100
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,260
and ask her to save you... if you just make that call once,

101
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,050
I will let you go right away. Understand?

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,690
If you kneel and beg before me,

103
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,120
I'll think about forgiving you, you sh*tty boss.

104
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,120
I told you I am not sh*tty!

105
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,720
I told you I'm not sh*tty!

106
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,160
Darn it!

107
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,140
Hong Joo!

108
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,410
Yes, Hyungnim!

109
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,560
You...

110
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,060
- You know some pimps, right? 
 - Of course!

111
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,270
- You know some, right? 
 - Of course, Hyungnim!

112
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,890
Hello?

113
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,420
It's me.

114
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,950
I found her.

115
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,810
 Where is she?

116
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,540
Gyeonggi-do Osan.

117
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,050
 The police are being dispatched right now, and I'll be going with them.

118
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,420
But... how did you find them so quickly?

119
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,800
President Byun recently obtained a new toy, and it was possible to track that thing's location.

120
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,990
 It is not something common in South Korea

121
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,730
 so I guess he didn't know it's trackable.

122
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,730
President Cha,

123
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,040
I can't hold back my guys anymore.

124
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,930
Listen carefully. You have exactly five minutes.

125
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,350
If not, you will have killed Ms. Oh, you got that?

126
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,220
You got that!

127
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,690
Gosh, his phone bill will be so high.

128
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,930
You're right.

129
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,700
Gosh!

130
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,670
What did he say?

131
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,690
This guy...

132
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,860
is coming out more tenaciously than I expected.

133
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,080
If he acts like this, I can't see any solution.

134
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,730
Aunt, don't you know you'll lose all your theaters

135
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,220
if we don't have Jung Shin anyway?

136
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,530
That's right!

137
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,190
If you have the Branch Manager, won't you always have a chance to come back and fight?

138
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,870
- Is that so? 
 - Yes!

139
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,090
- Aunt! 
 - Boss!

140
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,620
- Aunt! 
 - Boss!

141
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,180
Hyungnim, you received a call from Busan.

142
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,040
He says if you bring the girl, he could keep her there for at least ten years.

143
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,980
Shall we get going?

144
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,960
Gosh, that heartless b*tch!

145
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,990
Let's go.

146
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,470
Yes, Hyungnim.

147
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,550
W-W-Wait.

148
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,720
Hello?

149
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,020
Oh Jung Shin...

150
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,500
- Send her. 
 - Aigoo!

151
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,580
President Cha!

152
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,200
If you called any later, you would have been in big trouble!

153
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,030
My guys were just about to bury her in the ground.

154
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,560
No! Don't!

155
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,620
- No! 
 - Do you hear her?

156
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,970
- Do you hear her? You hear her, right? 
 - No!

157
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,280
Is Jung Shin okay?

158
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,300
Then I will send someone to pick up the contracts.

159
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,550
We did it!

160
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,360
- It's over! 
 -  Yes!

161
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,560
It's all over!

162
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,200
- Hong Joo! 
 - Yes, Hyungnim!

163
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
You go up to Seoul first and pick up the contracts.

164
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Yes, Hyungnim.

165
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,530
Let's go.

166
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,770
Too bad.

167
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,790
I won.

168
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,480
I'm Byun Hak Soo! Sh*t!

169
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,990
Catch them!

170
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,230
Put your hands up!

171
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,030
What's that noise?

172
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:56,320
â™«  Will I be able to come to you again?  â™«

173
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,790
â™«  Trembling eyes  â™«

174
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,190
What's this?

175
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,950
â™«  They're even more sorrowful  â™«

176
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,970
â™«  Above the rough sky  â™«

177
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,120
Go!

178
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,140
â™«  My heart floats away  â™«

179
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,140
- Hyung! 
 - What is it?

180
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,600
You son of a b*tch!

181
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,790
Jung Shin!

182
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,220
Gosh, seriously!

183
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,270
Are you okay?

184
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,340
Are you hurt anywhere?

185
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,000
- Put that down and raise your hands! 
 - Yes, Sir!

186
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,390
- Get on your knees! 
 - Yes, Sir!

187
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,330
How did you know to come here?

188
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,340
I called in the CIA.

189
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,350
I didn't know I was such an important figure.

190
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,570
Thanks for being safe.

191
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,570
Why are you doing this?

192
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,980
 Follow me!

193
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,180
P-Please, listen to what I have to say!

194
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,330
Stop!

195
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,990
Wait a second! Wait a second!

196
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,820
Please wait!

197
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,250
Hey, hey!

198
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,020
You deserve this, Sh*tty Boss.

199
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,880
- Gosh, my rib... 
 - Get up.

200
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,050
Thanks.

201
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,790
I will take over all the theaters that you have left.

202
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:35,760
- Geez! 
 - Gosh, my injured rib!

203
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,920
KCIA is fast, as expected.

204
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,840
"KCIA"?

205
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,030
What is that?

206
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,950
The National Security Agency, you b*stard.

207
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,260
Oh, the National Security Agency!

208
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,660
Wow, then how did they manage to find her so quickly

209
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,790
when we couldn't find her after searching all that time?

210
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,540
If we knew how, we would have found her.

211
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,420
Are you okay?

212
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,570
I really thought I was going to die.

213
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,150
I really thought I would die.

214
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,430
It's okay.

215
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,200
It's all over now.

216
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:39,690
â™«  Will I be able to come to you again?  â™«

217
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:47,210
â™«  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  â™«

218
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,860
Jung Shin.

219
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,500
You...

220
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,650
â™«  My heart floats away  â™«

221
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,790
Your nose is running.

222
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:01,610
What?

223
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,300
Do you want to die?

224
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,900
- It's always jokes with you! 
 - Ouch, ouch!

225
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,960
It hurts...

226
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,570
â™«  If I could turn back time  â™«

227
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:14,210
â™«  Would things be different?  â™«

228
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,820
â™«  It's such a useless thing to say  â™«

229
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,710
Why are you being like that?

230
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,210
Then this much is okay, right?

231
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,390
â™«  But I cannot hide it  â™«

232
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,050
Okay, since we're friends.

233
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,570
You don't know what the future holds.

234
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,350
Also, I am the one who saved your life.

235
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,730
Yes, that's right.

236
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,410
But... don't overreact about it.

237
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,070
â™«  Trembling eyes  â™«

238
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,670
Let's go.

239
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,540
â™«  They're even more sorrowful  â™«

240
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:07,040
â™«  Above the rough sky, my heart floats away  â™«

241
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:14,170
â™«  Only your name is engraved like this  â™«

242
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,620

243
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,870
Branch Manager...

244
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,200
I thought you were going to die, Girl!

245
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,500
You've been through a lot.

246
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,490
I heard you told the Sh*tty Boss to just kill me.

247
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,310
Since you didn't die, it's what matters.

248
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,400
And you wouldn't die easily anyway.

249
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,860
Branch Manager,

250
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,130
don't be so upset.

251
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,640
Even though the Boss spoke like that,

252
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,360
she said she would hand over all her theaters to save you, Branch Manager!

253
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,320
Gosh, seriously.

254
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,040
If you can't believe me, then look at the contract.

255
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,280
You have it wrong, Boss.

256
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,490
About what?

257
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,870
I put my life on the line to do this business

258
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,010
so this is more important than my life.

259
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,710
You shouldn't have put your seal on this even if I were to die.

260
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,330
What did you say?

261
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,320
To say it one more time, since I have my share in this,

262
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,620
you can't decide as you want if I live or die.

263
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,430
Your life is yours, but my life is mine.

264
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,490
I, Oh Jung Shin, get to decide my own life.

265
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,990
Wow, look at this determined b*tch.

266
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,970
In any case, since you played around with my life,

267
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,090
Star Entertainment landed in our hands

268
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,500
so we'll have to adjust my number of shares.

269
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,080
From now,

270
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,430
for shares of Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do film distribution companies,

271
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,600
I'll take 60% and you can take 40%, Boss.

272
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,160
- What did you just say? 
 - Branch Manager!

273
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,140
That is not how you should treat the Boss!

274
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,680
Otherwise, I will set up my own independent company.

275
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,190
What?

276
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,000
Jung Shin!

277
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,100
So... shall I set up an independent company?

278
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,710
Can you beat me in the Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do markets?

279
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,310
I knew you would be like this.

280
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,050
- Hey, Director Go. 
 - Y-Yes.

281
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,570
What I told President Byun wasn't wrong.

282
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,700
I knew that one day, she would try to eat me up.

283
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,850
All right, go ahead.

284
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:28,090
Actually, why don't you also take over Jeolla-do?

285
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,870
- Boss! 
 - But on one condition.

286
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,170
You... be my daughter!

287
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,020
I say to play under my domain if you play around.

288
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,190
Then I'll have you inherit all I have.

289
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,750
Let's go now.

290
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,380
Yes.

291
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,240
Don't think too long about it.

292
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,480
Hey, Boss.

293
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,280
Boss!

294
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,240
I'm not deaf!

295
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,690
Why? What do you want?

296
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,920
Do you want to ask me if I'll really give Jung Shin everything?

297
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,660
Yes.

298
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,550
I don't know about everything,

299
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,450
but I know two famous people who got on their knees:

300
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,810
One of those was Prince Heungseon, the father of Emperor Gojong (first Emperor of Korea).

301
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:35,290
The other was Han Shin, Liu Bang's general in Han Dynasty of China.

302
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,780
Of course, I also know about Prince Heungseon.

303
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,450
But I don't know that Chinese general.

304
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,280
I don't even expect you to know him.

305
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,560
In any case, those two guys had in common

306
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,540
that when both lacked strength,

307
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,740
they put on a show to reassure the person trying to kill them.

308
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,920
They first tried to avoid the storm

309
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,900
then built up their strength to beat their opponent.

310
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,800
They got on their knees under false pretense.

311
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,090
Gosh. They were dishonest guys.

312
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:15,810
How can we say dishonesty in a war where your life is at stake?

313
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,790
All deceive and are deceived by others.

314
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:22,880
So did those guys beat up their opponents in the end?

315
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,790
They beat them up quite easily.

316
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,170
They all croaked (died).

317
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,860
Oh my...

318
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,550
They're quite scary people.

319
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,900
That's right.

320
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,270
Thus the saying,

321
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:39,820
"Don't ever trust people who kneel too easily."

322
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:46,140
So to kneel means that they're thinking of beating me up.

323
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,780
That's what it is, I see.

324
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,280
Wait a sec.

325
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,890
Then Branch Manager, Oh Jung Shin, is also trying to beat you upâ€“

326
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,870
You little...

327
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,410
S-Sorry.

328
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,290
To a child like that, I said to be my adopted daughter.

329
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,230
Do you think she will take my offer or not?

330
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,220
Gosh, seriously.

331
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,470
Seeing how she was threatening you like that earlier,

332
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,340
she will never accept it.

333
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,380
Then that means she will be at war with me.

334
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,830
We shall see.

335
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,110
- You know Choi Young Shik, right? 
 - Yes.

336
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,140
Then I suppose you know Choi Cheol Woong as well?

337
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,590
Hello.

338
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,340
Did you also babysit Kang Yeo Jin's child?

339
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,060
Yes.

340
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,520
You know about Patient Choi Young Shik, right?

341
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,700
Oh, yes.

342
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,150
Let me take a look at his medical records.

343
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,220
Excuse me.

344
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,290
Who are you?

345
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,130
I came from the Prosecutors' Office.

346
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,850
You know about Choi Cheol Woong, right?

347
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,970
D-Did Cheol Woong do something wrong?

348
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,330
It's not that.

349
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,320
He will become an official judge or prosecutor soon,

350
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,750
but since that is such an important position,

351
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,580
we need to assess his background history and identity.

352
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,430
Also, don't tell Choi Cheol Woong about this.

353
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,540
It can have a negative impact on receiving promotions.

354
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,420
Oh, yes, yes.

355
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,990
Well, I heard in this neighborhood,

356
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,520
you were quite close with Choi Young Shik's family.

357
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,850
Oh, yes.

358
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,510
When Choi Cheol Woong was in high school,

359
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,930
apart from receiving a fine for violence,

360
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,400
did he ever commit any other crimes?

361
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,780
Oh, no, not at all.

362
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,750
I see.

363
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,140
Then did you ever hear any stories about

364
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,030
his going to a hospital for mental issues?

365
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,290
Oh, my gosh!

366
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,400
There's nobody who's as smart and upright as him.

367
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,320
I've never heard anything like that before.

368
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,410
I see.

369
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,820
Is it true that

370
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,420
Choi Cheol Woong is really Choi Young Shik's son?

371
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,510
What do you mean by that?

372
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,460
Well, it doesn't matter if he was adopted.

373
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:42,100
That wouldn't change anything about their legal parent-child relationship.

374
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,870
Just tell me comfortably and honestly.

375
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,960
W-Well... that is...

376
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,590
He is his real son!

377
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,370
Honey.

378
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,670
I've pretty much lived my entire life at that house.

379
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,410
What kind of ridiculous question is that?

380
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,800
Choi Cheol Woong is the descendant of the Choi bloodline.

381
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,590
Oh, I see.

382
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,930
It's not that I was doubting it.

383
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:24,750
I just asked as I need to confirm his personal background information.

384
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,840
Choi Cheol Woong is Choi Young Shik's real son.

385
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,110
Thank you.

386
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,610
Have a nice day.

387
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,300
E-Excuse me.

388
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,140
Excuse me...

389
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,150
There are no issues with Cheol Woong, right?

390
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,280
Come on!

391
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,030
Of course not.

392
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,560
This won't do.

393
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,540
What are you saying?

394
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,860
What if our Cheol Woong ends up in trouble later

395
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,590
because they find out this was false information?

396
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,110
You and I are keeping our mouths shut so how could they know?

397
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,860
Who knows what can happen in this world?

398
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,990
Also, we didn't commit a sin or anything

399
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,270
so shouldn't Cheol Woong know now, too?

400
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,410
You must be out of your mind!

401
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,330
We promised the elder and Mr. Choi, who passed away,

402
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,670
and Ms. Kang not to tell anyone!

403
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,460
Also...

404
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,920
it would make things complicated for Doo Hak and Cheol Woong.

405
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,510
What do you mean?

406
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,660
If they find out they're brothers, they will be happy!

407
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,380
Also, I want to hear my son call me "Mother."

408
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,170
If I say we can't, we can't!

409
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,770
Why cause trouble by bringing up what we kept buried for decades?

410
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,810
The promise you made to the elder may be important to you,

411
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,400
but my heart was burned black as a result!

412
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,510
I went through the pain of childbirth to give him life,

413
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,660
yet I could not even hear him call me "Mother"!

414
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,640
Every time I see him hug that fox of a woman and call her "Mother,"

415
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,490
I feel like my heart is set on fire!

416
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,140
Don't be like that.

417
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,940
I'm not looking for money or land.

418
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,010
All I want is for Cheol Woong to know

419
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:31,280
that we are his parents only while he's with us.

420
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,550
Stop it!

421
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:38,040
Then how could I ever face the elder and Mr. Choi in the afterlife?

422
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,650
I'm an idiot for living with someone who is so uptight and frustrating!

423
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,460
 If we say we have a son who is a prosecutor, the world would think so highly of us.

424
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,130
 Aigoo, seriously...

425
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:13,810
From my gut feeling, Choi Cheol Woong doesn't appear to be Choi Young Shik's son.

426
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,670
Contrast to how Lee Joong Ho, a servant of the family since the time of

427
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,030
Choi Young Shik's father, vehemently denied it,

428
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,760
his wife seemed so flustered as if her secret was found out.

429
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,490
Then do we now find the medical records that show Choi Young Shik

430
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,570
was receiving treatment from before marriage?

431
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,860
That is such an old record; it will take some time to find it.

432
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,130
You've gone through much.

433
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,070
Not at all.

434
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,110
Well, with all due respect, I have a question.

435
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,300
It is what you are thinking, Team Captain Oh.

436
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,400
I've got a lot on my mind right now as well.

437
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,450
I'm sorry.

438
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,480
Why didn't your dad come with you?

439
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,820
You know that Dad is busy with theater work.

440
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,010
He promised to come with me next time.

441
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,920
You're lying.

442
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,110
Your dad didn't even keep his promise to go to Jeju-do with me.

443
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,430
He promised to take me to Mokpo and buy me brown croaker fish.

444
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,970
Lies! He always lies!

445
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,480

446
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,590
Mom.

447
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,440
Dad...

448
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,620
Dad is already...

449
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,340
Dad is not a liar.

450
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,890
When he comes next time, he will do all that for you.

451
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,660
N-No...

452
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:52,540
Your dad is always lying to you, too.

453
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,640
He even stole a look at all your letters.

454
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,800
What letters?

455
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,650
Your friend's letters,

456
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,120
the friend who hurt someone.

457
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:10,050
He said you shouldn't meet that guy, and he would go visit him.

458
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,980
 Whatever you say doesn't matter to me,

459
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:22,760
 but what's certain is that you're a worse prison than this place.

460
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,230
 Please let me go now.

461
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,300
 I mean it.

462
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,630
This stupid b*stard...

463
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,850
- Hi, Hyungnim. 
 - Yes, Seon Woo.

464
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:48,270
Hyungnim, who is he that our boss is being so subservient?

465
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,580
He doesn't seem to be in our field of work.

466
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,030
He is likely a rich man, a scary man,

467
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,780
or Boss owes a debt to him.

468
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,510
Then I hope he's not a scary man.

469
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,420
Right.

470
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,120
But in this line of work, you always end up meeting people you want to avoid.

471
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,600
Come on, Hyungnim. Why are you so pessimistic?

472
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,890
- Why are you always talking so negatively? 
 - What?

473
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,060
Never mind, Hyungnim.

474
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,760
Let's go.

475
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,230
- Hey. 
 - It appears to be good.

476
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,740
It is a good thing.

477
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,960
Look at this.

478
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,250
They are really going for it.

479
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,470
In Seoul, where we host international festivals

480
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,010
such as Asian Games and the Olympics,

481
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,630
won't our nation be disgraced in this shape?

482
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,800
Gosh, these people are so immature!

483
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,210
I mean, the government has provided sufficient compensation and solutions,

484
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:43,060
but these tenants are being greedy and demand more money.

485
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,420
And most of the landlords already left without any complaints.

486
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,230
Do you think this will work?

487
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,190
Oh, and also, they will let us know in a few days.

488
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,100
Leave the minimum number of men in the stores and gather the rest. All right?

489
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,620

490
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,280
Gosh, that startled me.

491
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,200
Oh my, Young Man. Have some kimchi before you go.

492
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,750
Delicious, isn't it?

493
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,020
- Yes. 
 - Of course, it is.

494
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,670
Aigoo.

495
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,330
Do you want one more?

496
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,400
Over there is Two Myeongdang-dong.

497
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,620
And this here is Three Myeongdang-dong.

498
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,200
The region we got assigned is Three Myeongdang-dong.

499
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,340
Then this place is going to be filled with apartments?

500
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,920
Wow... that's crazy.

501
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,190
Do those people even have places to go?

502
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,810
I heard those people gathered here

503
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:55,320
after living in illegal constructs wherever, after the war.

504
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,580
Still, they're getting compensated so they'll find a place somewhere.

505
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,850
 - Hyungnim. 
 - What?

506
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:08,730
 To be frank, I don't care at all about us fighting among ourselves

507
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:12,580
 and beating each other up in our world.

508
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,190
 But...

509
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,170
 - But those people are... 
 - Why?

510
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,610
 Are you saying you feel guilty?

511
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,620
 Can't you do it?

512
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,040
 I can't.

513
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,680
 I think it'd be better for you to reconsider.

514
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,830
 Is that so?

515
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,000
 Sure, you can feel that way.

516
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,120
 I feel you.

517
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,220
 Doo Hak...

518
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:46,520
 you've got a long way to go to be a gangster.

519
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,730
Of course, they'll find a place... somewhere very far away.

520
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,130
Gosh!

521
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,060
Cut it out already.

522
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,510
Have we the luxury to be considerate of others now?

523
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,000
I heard the profit from fighting other gangs for years

524
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,540
doesn't come near one job like this one.

525
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,480
Our lives might change here.

526
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,210
Let's please focus on the future, okay?

527
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,350
But I still feel for them.

528
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,650
What then?

529
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,510
Shall we return to being scalpers at baseball games?

530
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,320
I did feel more at ease back then.

531
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,660
Gosh, you idiot!

532
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,310
Geez!

533
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,040
Will you keep hitting my head?

534
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,580
I'm stimulating it so you can think.

535
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,650
Those people's circumstances won't change.

536
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,640
If we don't do it, other gangs will take the job.

537
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,540
Isn't that right, Doo Hak?

538
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,950
Aigoo, sh*t!

539
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,390
Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's go now.

540
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,080
What is it you want to tell me?

541
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,620
Hyung, why are you always in such a rush?

542
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,080
To report on Jung Shin's kidnapping incident and

543
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,500
to celebrate our joint operation... while we're at it.

544
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,600
What's the need for a celebration?

545
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,510
As I reserved, please give us the A course.

546
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,650
Oh, okay.

547
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,070
It's for three people, right?

548
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,710
Yes.

549
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,490
What?

550
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,180
Who else is coming?

551
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,120
Yes.

552
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,310
Our sponsor, who's going to feed us today.

553
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,860
This b*stard... You're still on probation, and

554
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,280
you already learned the bad trades. Hey!

555
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,000
I'll take care of the bill today.

556
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,770
So just order some jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles).

557
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,640
How can we do that, Hyung?

558
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,490
She's a good person. It's okay for her to treat us.

559
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,520
So let's treat our stomachs today, okay?

560
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,820
Gosh, this little b*stard.

561
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,620
Hey!

562
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,690
You can eat all you wish.

563
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,930
Lee Doo Hak...

564
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,460
- Hey. 
 - What?

565
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,680
We have the right to get treated.

566
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,370
- You can eat all you want. 
 - Sit down.

567
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,280
You said you never avoided me.

568
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,610
Won't you feel uncomfortable

569
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,790
eating with a thug?

570
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:25,370
I don't feel uncomfortable. I just feel sorry for you.

571
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,930
What are you doing at a restaurant?

572
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,930
Both of you, stop that and sit down.

573
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,780
We three haven't met like this in a long time.

574
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,130
Let's eat. Okay?

575
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,620
Gosh, Hyung.

576
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,150
Seeing the entrees makes me nostalgic.

577
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,240
You know, when Jung Shin's grades ranked within the top 200 thanks to us;

578
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,640
Jung Shin's father bought us Chinese food.

579
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,880
You remember, don't you?

580
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,700
Does it make you a gangster to chug down alcohol like that?

581
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,160
Stop trying to act cool and eat food too.

582
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,320
She's right, Hyung. Have some. They're delicious.

583
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,040
Aigoo.

584
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,880
Sit down.

585
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,890
I have something to tell you.

586
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,900
Yes, Hyung. Take a seat. Let's talk.

587
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,540
Hey.

588
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,010
This pitiful gangster... accepted your charity.

589
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,000
So I'm off now. Okay?

590
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,200
What do you mean by charity, Hyung?

591
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,340
Hyung, you have more than enough right to feast.

592
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:48,400
Jung Shin, when you got kidnapped by President Byun,

593
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,660
Hyung Doo Hak is the one who told me.

594
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,890
Moreover, in a very desperate

595
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,650
and urgent manner.

596
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,380
- Hey, Choi Cheol Woong. 
 - What?

597
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,190
It's the truth.

598
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,610
That's why I was able to find you.

599
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:11,830
So you can say you owe half your life to Hyung Doo Hak.

600
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,300
- Is that true? 
 - It's not.

601
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,740
He made it up.

602
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,690
Stop lying.

603
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,490
Are you Daddy Long Legs (secret donor)?

604
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,940
Jung Shin, although Hyung talks like that,

605
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,440
it means he was

606
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:30,540
lingering around you all this time, in fact.

607
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,830
That's enough. Okay?

608
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,430
I arranged this meeting because...

609
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,790
I didn't want to be a coward or ashamed.

610
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,440
Jung Shin.

611
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,960
I'm going to take my chance at you one more time,

612
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,860
not with a young boy's feelings like back then.

613
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:53,080
But sincerely, with all my life on the line.

614
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,850
So...

615
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,630
don't put up a front and distance yourself.

616
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,310
Let's fight head-on, fair and square.

617
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,090
Hey, you a**hole. Do you reallyâ€”

618
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:07,040
This is really... such bullsh*t.

619
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,400
Am I your pastime toy or something?

620
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,380
Why do you mess with me whenever you want?

621
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,080
My lifesaver?

622
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,200
Hey! I'm not fated to die yet, even if not for you two.

623
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,320
And do you think we're still teens from Yeosu?

624
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,120
Please grow up, you idiots.

625
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,950
I'll donate today's dinner to you, so help yourselves, please.

626
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,520
That's what makes Jung Shin so cool.

627
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,790
Isn't that right?

628
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:44,220
Hey... Don't ever pull this kind of joke again.

629
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,910
- It's a warning. 
 - No,

630
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,660
I'm going to keep doing it.

631
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,160
I'm going to keep it up.

632
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,970
I'm going to keep competing with you

633
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,320
and make Jung Shin my woman.

634
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,410
You're a crazy b*stard.

635
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,680
Aren't you too poor for a gang leader?

636
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,600
What the heck is with you?

637
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,970
What do you mean? I couldn't even eat dinner due to you.

638
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,210
You need to take responsibility.

639
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:53,400
Aigoo! I'm starving to death. Bring me some food.

640
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,820
- Wait, how did youâ€” 
 - Doo Hak, is she your girlfriend?

641
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,250
Yes!

642
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,340
- Eat up. 
 - Should you really treat me like this?

643
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,750
This is how I usually eat.

644
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,990
Go and fry an egg, at least.

645
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,570
There's no such thing here.

646
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,460
You're a hobo, not a thug.

647
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,820
Gosh, seriously, you...

648
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,510
Gosh, you're about to shoot lasers.

649
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:26,250
Aigoo, you can't treat such a beautiful lady like this.

650
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,110
Thank you for the food.

651
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,670
It looks delicious.

652
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,590
Gosh, it's tasty!

653
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,080
Well, eat as much as you want.

654
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,610
Thank you.

655
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,160
Gosh, that hits the spot.

656
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,000
Don't you have soju?

657
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:48,310
Hey, just eat quietly and go. All right?

658
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,570
Can't I even have a drink with food?

659
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,580
What are you doing? That's so petty!

660
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,630
Just bring the whole bottle. We'll each have a shot.

661
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:17,550
â™ª You're a fool if you can't speak after holding onto him â™ª

662
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:24,880
â™ª You're a fool â™ª

663
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,540
â™ª If you can't say you love him after holding onto him â™ª

664
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,780
â™ª He'll just walk away â™ª

665
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,370
â™ª Hurry and speak up â™ª

666
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,910
Jung Shin?

667
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:44,950
Yes.

668
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:48,060
I called the film studio, but she didn't answer.

669
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,270
Well, she said she must meet someone so she will be a bit late.

670
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,240
Who would that be?

671
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,650
Whom did she say it was?

672
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,870
Oh! An abnormal guy she feels sorry for.

673
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,480
But who is that?

674
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,350
Not sure.

675
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,560
Seriously, Jung Shin, that girl.

676
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,950
She seems crazy from time to time.

677
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:16,000
Why the heck would she meet an abnormal guy? Is she seeking trouble?

678
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:21,700
Anyhow, she'll stop by here on the way home and go with me.

679
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,620
That's what we always did.

680
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,560
I see.

681
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,760
â™ª Hurry and speak up â™ª

682
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,150
â™ª Hurry and speak up â™ª

683
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,740
â™ª Hurry and speak up â™ª

684
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,850
Hey, Lee Doo Hak!

685
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:45,400
I, Oh Jung Shin, will conquer Korea's film industry.

686
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,630
With the movies I make, I'll make people laugh and cry.

687
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,890
I'm also going to make a ton of money.

688
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:54,980
Sure.

689
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:00,020
However, you don't even seem to make much money being a gangster.

690
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,830
Every gangster is different.

691
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,260
Just quit everything and come to me instead.

692
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,940
Come to me, help me with filmmaking, and go study in college too.

693
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,780
I just need to help you with all of it. I-I can afford that much.

694
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:22,060
Do you... pity me that much?

695
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,780
Yes. I pity you to death.

696
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,720
I'm also sorry.

697
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,240
I should have held onto you to the end.

698
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:37,350
Gosh, you're speaking nonsense.

699
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,020
I dumped you.

700
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,370
Does fooling your heart and pushing me away make you happy?

701
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:50,860
I heard my father went to visit you in prison.

702
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,870
"As long as you're happy, I don't care about my life."

703
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:58,040
Is it that kind of romantic melodrama?

704
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,520
You're a pure-hearted gangster, a rare find these days.

705
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,560
How awesome!

706
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,450
Sunday Seoul (magazine) needs to interview you.

707
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,990
Cut it out now, seriously.

708
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,510
- It's all in the past! 
 - If it's all in the past,

709
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,180
why do you keep lingering around me?

710
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:22,580
That was never my intention. You know how all film studios are related to my field.

711
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,280
I just heard the news and told Cheol Woong about it.

712
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,230
What a bunch of bullsh*t.

713
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,070
You're still not over me.

714
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:35,860
You still have feelings for me, you idiot.

715
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,340
Jung Shin.

716
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,310
You're the one who said it earlier,

717
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,580
if I think we're still teens from Yeosu or not.

718
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,460
You said it, right?

719
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:51,160
I'm already a gangster, and I'm fated to be one until I die.

720
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,280
I'm opposite from a civilian like you!

721
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,060
Hey, you're too drunk. Go now.

722
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,910
"Already a gangster"?

723
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,160
"Fate"?

724
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,310
Hey! We all die anyway so why bother to eat food?

725
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:09,200
We should just starve.

726
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,980
You still want to be by my side.

727
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:22,960
So get out of this field.

728
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,390
I'll feed you, and I'll even help you study!

729
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,340
I'm saying I'll be by your side.

730
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,820
You're still young.

731
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,620
What my dad did to hurt you...

732
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,380
and how I failed to hold on to you to the end...

733
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:45,260
I'll make up for it all.

734
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:49,070
Please get out of this, Doo Hak.

735
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,800
Please?

736
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,890
In this world, how many people do you think like their jobs?

737
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,570
We're all just enduring it.

738
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,510
"Filmmaking"? "College"?

739
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:06,700
Do you think this society will accept an ex-con like me,

740
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,630
who's a murderer?

741
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,330
Most in the filmmaking industry know

742
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,690
a gangster named Lee Doo Hak already.

743
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,910
If you get involved with me,

744
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,400
they'll also point fingers at you.

745
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,540
That's... my reality.

746
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,400
Do you understand?

747
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,470
So as I said,

748
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,200
take your leave now.

749
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,080
I told you to goâ€”

750
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,370
â™«  I want to hold your hand  â™«

751
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:14,110
â™«  I want it to be like a birthday  â™«

752
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:21,950
â™«  No matter you will be here, Forever Love, the only one  â™«

753
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:26,660
â™«  I want to look at your mind, hate me or nice  â™«

754
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:30,190
â™«  Let me in your beautiful life  â™«

755
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:37,930
â™«  Come over here, back in your love, in my life  â™«

756
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:41,900
â™«  Let me go  â™«

757
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,690
â™«  In my life  â™«

758
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,610
â™«  Let me go  â™«

759
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,530
â™«  In your life  â™«

760
00:48:53,530 --> 00:49:01,450
â™«  Love you, no more, I want to be myself  â™«

761
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:08,820
â™«  Let me go, in my life  â™«

762
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:16,980
â™«  Love you, no more, I want to be myself  â™«

763
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:24,230
â™«  Let me go, in my life  â™«

764
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,170
What a sight to see.

765
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,210
I'm thirsty. Give me some water.

766
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,120
You're really a handful.

767
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,400
Aigoo.

768
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,060
Gosh, how sweet.

769
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,170
Did you put honey in this?

770
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,520
How would a hobo have honey?

771
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,450
That's true.

772
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,090
By the way, did we sleep together?

773
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,220
What did you say?

774
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,400
Hey, y-you! What nonsense is that?

775
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,750
I slept on the bench due to you, shaking in the cold!

776
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:04,170
Why? You should have come in.

777
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:06,840
Were you afraid I would have you?

778
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,900
Darn. How can you say that so easily as a woman?

779
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,980
It's bad apples like you, who argue about purity.

780
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,540
- What's wrong with sleeping together? 
 - What?

781
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,050
Sleeping together makes you scum, but sleeping alone makes you pure?

782
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:23,340
If you like someone, hug her tight; that's really being pure.

783
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,440
You stupid gangster.

784
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,250
From what I see right now, you're not fully sober yet.

785
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,820
- Hurry and go. 
 - Hey.

786
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,330
- Did you hit me? You hit me?
 - Hurry and leave.

787
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,600
How dare you!

788
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,020
A well-mannered man escorts a lady to the main road.

789
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,960
You remember what I said yesterday, right?

790
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,700
Of course. That I'm  a gangster who lives as a hobo.

791
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,040
Is being sarcastic second nature to you?

792
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,640
Aigoo, seriously!

793
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,560
Follow me.

794
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,690
I'm giving you an opportunity now.

795
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,600
I never asked for one.

796
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,300
You couldn't bring yourself to ask, but your eyes said it.

797
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,170
You were happy inside since I stayed with you yesterday, right?

798
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,290
Wh-What the heck are you saying?

799
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:19,020
Aigoo, look at you blush. What use is a gangster like you?

800
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,990
You're naturally unable to be a gangster.

801
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:25,480
- How cute. 
 - Come on!

802
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,520
Lee Doo Hak!

803
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,800
Why are you so surprised?  It's not like it's the first time we did it.

804
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,610
We did it a few times in Yeosu.

805
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,880
Also, we even slept under the same roof.

806
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,260
Hey, youâ€”

807
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,130
Me? What about me?

808
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:51,920
You... you shouldn't play with a person's feelings.

809
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,260
I'm glad you said that.

810
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,030
Until you get out of this field, I must play you a bit.

811
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:58,610
- Come, let me kiss you. 
 - H-Hey, hey!

812
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,830
Hey, you... Don't come near me.

813
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:03,650
Why, why? Does the smell of alcohol bother you?

814
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,300
Hey, where are you going?

815
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,610
- Hey, hey! 
 - Come here!

816
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,740
Hey, Lee Doo Hak!

817
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,930
I'm good at worrying about others, but what will I do about myself?

818
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:31,990
Hello.

819
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:38,700
You need to speak if you called.

820
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,010
I accept being your adopted daughter.

821
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:53,390
Are you Jung Shin? I knew you would accept.

822
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,990
Instead, you keep your promise, too, President Cha.

823
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:59,980
Oh my. "President Cha"?

824
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,320
Mother.

825
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,270
Am I your mother-in-law?

826
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:07,920
Try calling me in a more friendly way.

827
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,660
Mom.

828
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,780
Yes, yes. How nice is that?

829
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,600
 My daughter.

830
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,260
Make sure not to skip any meals.

831
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,950
Also, diligently secure Gyeonggang distributions.

832
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,460
 What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine.

833
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,000
You got it?

834
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,100
- Yes. 
 -  Your phone bill will be high.

835
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,110
Let's keep it short now.

836
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:39,780
Yes, please take care.

837
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,520
You did well! You made the right decision, Jung Shin.

838
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,690
You really need to help me, okay?

839
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:52,320
You and I are now maternal cousins!

840
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,150
Oh... Hey!

841
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,580
I'm tired.

842
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,080
Let's just stay friends, okay?

843
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02,790
By the way...

844
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:06,900
where did you... sleep last night?

845
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:12,050
Right?

846
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:23,450
I had a few drinks and just blacked out somewhere.

847
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,150
Could it have been with that abnormal guy?

848
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:31,490
Oh my! Have you gone crazy?

849
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:34,040
Who the f*** is this guy to get you drunk?

850
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,620
I'm the one who made that punk drink.

851
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,600
None of what you're thinking happened.

852
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,920
So don't worry, Ham Yang Ja.

853
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,270
I'm leaving now.

854
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,640
Hey, hey, hey.

855
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,460
Cheol Woong waited for you all night.

856
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,790
Cheol Woong did?

857
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:53,560
Did you tell him what I told you over the phone?

858
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,270
Of course. About abnormal, pitiful guy.

859
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:01,870
Why? Should I not have told him?

860
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,130
It's okay. You did well.

861
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,710
He'll find out anyway.

862
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:11,260
Wait, is he someone Cheol Woong knows, too?

863
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:16,200
Hey, could that abnormal guy you mentioned be...

864
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,980
Lee Doo Hak, who used to be Cheol Woong's buddy?

865
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,490
The one you dated briefly, who went to prison.

866
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,250
Right?

867
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,510
You don't need to know about that.

868
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,340
Hey, Oh Jung Shin!

869
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,630
You're absolutely not dating him!

870
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:32,320
He's a murderer, a killer!

871
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,470
Hey!

872
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:36,650
I'm not dating a murderer.

873
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,990
Then what is he?

874
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,850
He's just... a person.

875
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:51,470
She's becoming a nutcase herself.

876
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,170
Hey, what's up? Coming all the way to my company.

877
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:01,960
- Aigoo. 
 - You want a cup of coffee, too?

878
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:06,870
That would be the sixth cup for me today. I'm fine.

879
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:09,770
I heard you waited for me all last night.

880
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,420
Yes.

881
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,600
After our dinner ended like that,

882
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,740
I went to drink with you for a second round.

883
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,270
To be honest, I was with Doo Hak the whole of last night.

884
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,620
Well, I know. Yang Ja told me about it.

885
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,740
We drank a bit together,

886
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,090
to convince him to leave that field.

887
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:38,590
So? Was there any progress?

888
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:41,250
Well, I did see potential.

889
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,930
You know how he's inherently good.

890
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:45,950
Is a gangster good?

891
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:51,570
Doo Hak may hit other gangsters, but he'd never be a scum.

892
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:58,290
Did you come to defend Hyung Doo Hak or apologize to me since I waited all night?

893
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,860
Did I tell you to wait?

894
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,590
It's not so much an apology.

895
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:06,920
Don't grow any feelings for me.

896
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:12,980
So you chose Hyung then?

897
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,830
Did you sleep together?

898
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:20,700
This is why it'll never be you.

899
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,030
It was a joke! Just a joke.

900
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:25,600
I know Hyung Doo Hak would run even if you had at him.

901
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,510
I just feel it's a little unfair.

902
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:35,560
Why won't you even give me a chance?

903
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,900
Since we were young, you had nine out of ten things.

904
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,410
But Doo Hak had nothing,

905
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,430
then and now.

906
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:46,390
Aren't pity and love two different things?

907
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:52,310
I can't sit and watch you end up in misery.

908
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:54,170
"Misery"?

909
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:56,830
Then are you someone who makes me happy?

910
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,900
Let me make this clear one more time.

911
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,510
My happiness and misery are up to me, and I'm responsible for that.

912
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,880

913
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,370
Let's go!

914
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:46,110

915
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:33,270

916
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:41,140
â™«  Will I be able to come to you again?  â™«

917
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:47,700
â™«  Trembling eyes, they're even more sorrowful  â™«

918
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:54,690
â™«  Above the rough sky, my heart floats away  â™«

919
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,850
â™«  Only your name  â™«

920
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:59,570

921
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:02,280
 I'd like to have someone watched.

922
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,360
 Who is it?

923
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,160
 Doo Hak, let's overthrow Gwang Tak.

924
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,600
 Don't miss a meal ever again.

925
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,900
 Please do that for me, Yeo Jin, even if it's starting now.

926
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,360
 She must be seeing a man.

927
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,330
 Hey, you thug. Did you move to avoid me so you could do this?

928
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,180
 I can't help my feelings for him.

929
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,370
 Yes, I'm going to date him.

930
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,730
 - Instead of just dealing with tenants, why don't you do the construction yourself? 
 - Pardon?

931
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:22,850
 Doo Hak's mother, would you like to help me with my work?

932
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:24,420
 - Move aside. 
 - Everyone, freeze!

933
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:27,360
 Yeom Kwang Tak and Lee Doo Hak's crimes, after taking over the gang.

934
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,340
 I'll take care of Hyungnim. Take both Achilles' heels from Doo Hak.

935
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:35,190
â™«  The times I confronted  â™«
