1
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
We were so incredibly naive.

2
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,879
How the hell could we believe

3
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,719
everything would end without bloodshed?

4
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,560
Victor’s life

5
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,319
was crucified like a worthless pawn.

6
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,960
Bastards!

7
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,000
They orchestrated every bit of it.

8
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,120
I was wrong.

9
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
Don’t blame yourself, Tiva.

10
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,360
No one saw this coming.

11
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,840
I KNEW it was gonna happen!

12
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,560
I knew the military...

13
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,159
was gonna crush us without mercy.

14
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,199
And they fucking did it!

15
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,400
I never thought they could be this cold-blooded...

16
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,599
Since when did you know about it?

17
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,280
Before he went up on that stage.

18
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,360
I've heard some very bad news about tonight.

19
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,319
From where?

20
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,000
Extremely bad news

21
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,960
about the safety.

22
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,479
You should avoid it at all cost.

23
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,319
Don't throw meat to a lion.

24
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,280
Why didn't you say anything!?

25
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,199
cause we couldn’t postpone it any longer!

26
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,199
And you damn well knew it!

27
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,800
This isn't how it should be.

28
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,919
Victor's death...

29
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,520
will not be in vain!

30
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,759
His death...

31
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,039
will ignite millions to rise up and fight!

32
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,960
But Victor didn't need to die!

33
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,360
You used him

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,719
like bait!?

35
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,879
Didn't he choose to risk it himself?

36
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,479
How the hell could I have stopped him?

37
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,800
Fucking bastard!

38
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,319
Coward!

39
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,439
How could you do this!

40
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,120
That cost someone’s life!

41
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,240
And that very person

42
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,560
was Victor!

43
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,759
Our friend!

44
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,960
If you were me,

45
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,680
wouldn't you do the same?

46
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,879
You’ve lost your goddamn mind!

47
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,000
You were so blinded you couldn’t even see

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,479
the worth of a human life!

49
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,719
Tiva, people like you—

50
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,240
are no different from those blood-soaked juntas!

51
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,039
How dare you call

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,800
this shit a revolution?

53
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,920
I've had enough.

54
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,199
Scumbag!

55
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,720
Don’t get involved with those hardliner students.

56
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,920
Don't go out

57
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,319
Stay with him.

58
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,720
Don't let him go there.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,160
He doesn't need to know about this.

60
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,199
Since when did you know about this?

61
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,160
Promise me you won't go out tonight.

62
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,199
Can you promise me?

63
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,560
Fuck you! How could you let him walk to his death like that?

64
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,120
Fuck it!

65
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,279
Fuck it!

66
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,879
Fuck it!

67
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,480
Fucking idiot!

68
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,720
Get out!

69
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,360
Chief, are you sure you're going to publish this?!

70
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,600
Just write the students are communists!

71
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,160
There is no evidence!

72
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,720
How the hell could you come here?

73
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,240
You’re suspended!

74
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,879
Get out!

75
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,560
These are the only pieces of evidence

76
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,600
I could gather from foreign reporters last night.

77
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,879
I swear the student murdered last night

78
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,279
wasn’t a communist like the news claimed.

79
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,519
I'm begging you, chief.

80
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,079
Just do the right thing for once!

81
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,279
Is this the picture of the murdered student?

82
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,600
You got a picture of the shooter?

83
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,199
No, chief.

84
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,240
These are from the protest.

85
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,199
And these... are when the chaos broke out.

86
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,160
The student

87
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,199
was dragged into a nearby alley and executed.

88
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,199
It had to be the state’s doing.

89
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,639
- It was staged. / - Wait.

90
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,319
Why the hell were you even there!?

91
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,519
- I did order / - Just fuckin' listen!

92
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,240
- I ordered your suspension / - Fuckin’ listen, damn it!

93
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,319
Everyone fucking knows!

94
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,639
Last night wasn’t a riot — it was cold-blooded murder!

95
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,319
What they said in the news was a lie!

96
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,959
He wasn't a fucking commie. If the press won't tell the truth,

97
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,839
then who the hell is gonna stand up

98
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,240
- and do what’s right!? / - Ran!

99
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,840
You're fucking out of line.

100
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,320
You know that?

101
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,720
I quit!

102
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,600
Go!

103
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,440
Move you ass out of here!

104
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,320
Guys, write this down.

105
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,200
These kids are communists!

106
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,240
No questions!

107
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,559
As for the violent incident that happened,

108
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,360
it has been reported in the news that

109
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,120
this was caused by the communists,

110
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,039
I—

111
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,200
am reiterating publicly that—

112
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,799
the report

113
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
was not true.

114
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,200
What actually happend was an operation staged

115
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,559
by the army

116
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,200
under the direct order of the commander,

117
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,679
General Pracha Suttisakol.

118
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,120
Colonel, stop it!

119
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,960
And I, Colonel Krailert Suwannapas

120
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,480
took part in this operation

121
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,919
by carrying out his command.

122
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,039
Hello, this is Dhevi Dechanara Suwannapas.

123
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,159
May I speak with Air Vice Marshal Tadthep Detnara?

124
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,600
Today,

125
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,480
I've decided

126
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,799
to reveal the truth

127
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,159
because I can no longer remain silent

128
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,240
while wrongdoing continues in this country.

129
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,480
We cannot allow our nation

130
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,759
to continue down this unlawful path.

131
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,080
I will let the people

132
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,799
be the judge of my actions.

133
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,679
Thank you.

134
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,679
Colonel!

135
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,440
You're destroying the army's image!

136
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,120
What you said will bring all of us down!

137
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,759
Please allow me, sir.

138
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,960
Take him.

139
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,080
I know Krailert made the confession himself.

140
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,399
But please, my brother.

141
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,639
No.

142
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,440
I'm not going anywhere.

143
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm his wife.

144
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,000
Can you please speak to him on Krailert's behalf?

145
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,039
Trin,

146
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,799
can you drive for me? There's somewhere I need to go.

147
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,639
Yes, sir.

148
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,559
Thank you very much, sir.

149
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,360
Prepare a public statement

150
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,120
saying Colonel Krailert

151
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,240
acted outside the army’s command

152
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,679
and defamed the army.

153
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,159
The military investigation department will immediately appoint a committee of inquiry.

154
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,200
Leak the news

155
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,519
about Colonel Krailert and how he is linked

156
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,679
to students activists

157
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,519
through his nephew.

158
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,159
The voice that no one has heard...

159
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
is the voice that does not exist.

160
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,759
Here... crispy fried duck egg

161
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,840
with madan fish sauce on rice.

162
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:37,399
Victor's and your favorite, Tiva.

163
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,080
You two fought over it since you were kids.

164
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,960
Eat it, son.

165
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,320
Auntie,

166
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,840
I'm so sorry, Auntie.

167
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,559
I knew they were going to crush us so badly...

168
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:28,360
but I never thought they would be this ruthless.

169
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,879
It's my fault. I let Victor die, Auntie!

170
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,080
I'm so sorry I let him die.

171
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,639
I want to take his place so badly.

172
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,240
I want to take his place so badly.

173
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,320
I’m so sorry...

174
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,720
No one deserves to die.

175
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,679
That's what happened to him.

176
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,039
And I ask you, son.

177
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,720
Live on for him!

178
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,640
Auntie... I’m so sorry.

179
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,240
I didn't mean it.

180
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,240
Please... take my life for his, Auntie.

181
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,160
I really didn't mean it.

182
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,200
How are you?

183
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,279
Not bad.

184
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,839
I never imagined this would happen.

185
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,119
Really?

186
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,960
But I always knew

187
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,480
this day would come.

188
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,759
The order’s come from above.

189
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,839
We must end this fast.

190
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,960
It’s starting to spiral out of control.

191
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,880
I'll order a lockdown of the area

192
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,759
so we can contain the protest site

193
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:31,359
and prevent...

194
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,559
No,

195
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,799
I’ll send in an SS team to sabotage from inside.

196
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,759
They could be some opportunists

197
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,640
lurking for a chance to stir up chaos,

198
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,720
or

199
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,880
communists.

200
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,279
they won’t even know

201
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,160
who’s killing whom.

202
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,920
But sir, we don't need to go that far.

203
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,640
There are ways to maintain peace and order

204
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,599
without killing innocent people.

205
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,720
Those hardliners aren't innocent!

206
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,839
But they are just students!

207
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,920
Aunt Dhevi,

208
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,559
How did you know Ms. Moira kept a video recording?

209
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,759
I don't know.

210
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,279
Perhaps... instinct.

211
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,799
Only women know what each of us is capable of,

212
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,160
and how far we can go.

213
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,880
Ms. Moira once said that at Grand Paradiso,

214
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,279
there was no secret she didn’t know.

215
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,720
Apart from the video evidence showing

216
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,799
General Pracha

217
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,720
as the one who commanded the murder of the student,

218
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,200
today we have received another video tape concerning

219
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,279
the death of the Huay Kham Saeng village chief.

220
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,160
Now the villagers are starting to ask

221
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,079
if what happened was really an accident.

222
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,480
Then do what you must.

223
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,079
Or would you rather this leak to the press?

224
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,759
Those who can’t keep their mouths shut

225
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,599
will never use them again!

226
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,200
Or

227
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,359
do you think

228
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,440
there are other options, Colonel?

229
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,839
With all due respect, I must say

230
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,279
that I disagree

231
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,519
with the way this problem is handled.

232
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,400
Maintaining stability

233
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,440
should not mean controlling people through fear.

234
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,119
As a military—

235
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,319
Colonel,

236
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,119
you're too inexprienced for this game.

237
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,680
Don't be so sure

238
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,279
your wife's family

239
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,599
can always protect you.

240
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,960
It's me, General Pracha.

241
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,359
I wish to speak to the Prime Minister.

242
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,839
I'm sorry.

243
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,240
His Excellency is not available.

244
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,480
Just tell him!

245
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,559
I need to talk to him!

246
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,279
He said he does not wish to talk to you.

247
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,720
Wait!

248
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Wait!

249
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,000
Leak these pictures.

250
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,240
Yes, sir.

251
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,160
Sir.

252
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,599
The Army Commander-in-Chief has ordered

253
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,160
General Pracha Suttisakol,

254
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,000
to be summoned for a committee hearing

255
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,359
on the unlawful abuse of power.

256
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,039
You must report yourself immediately

257
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,519
for the military disciplinary investigation

258
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,799
and interrogation process.

259
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,039
Please follow us.

260
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,799
I must thank you so very much, Ms. Mondira

261
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,440
I had no ideas who I could turn to for help.

262
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,359
I also must thank you, Mrs. Dhevi.

263
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,160
The whole drama has just made my life so colorful.

264
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,119
But for other matters,

265
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,839
they are truly beyond our control.

266
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:14,960
This is all we can do for you, Veera.

267
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,160
You installed video cameras

268
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,480
like the CIA?

269
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,319
Of course.

270
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,440
I need to know who and what’s going on in my premises.

271
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,640
You're

272
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,839
something else.

273
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,839
Because I'm Moira, Colonel.

274
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,160
But then, who would dare strike a hidden deal

275
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,519
at Grand Paradiso?

276
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,519
Actually, it’s better things turned out this way.

277
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,279
I'm bored

278
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,839
of those old scheming scumbags

279
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,039
plotting secret deals in my hotel.

280
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,359
Not funny.

281
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,640
Grand Paradiso must be a fun

282
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,559
and safe place for everyone.

283
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,480
Thank you, Moira,

284
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,119
for everything.

285
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
About that—

286
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,599
are you sure?

287
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,319
I won't be a coward anymore.

288
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,720
Now you're talking!

289
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,759
Here he comes!

290
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,720
How have you been, sir?

291
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,559
Colonel Krailert,

292
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,880
what do you think about what just happened?

293
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
(Let's fly beyond the clouds)

294
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,000
(where tomorrow awaits)

295
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,119
(and we'll be free)

296
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:15,960
(Sarasawadee's last letter)

297
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,720
Dear readers,

298
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,319
I am well aware

299
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,079
that this day would come, no matter what—

300
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,960
The day I must

301
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,440
say good bye

302
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,960
and finally face what I have always been avoiding:

303
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,599
myself.

304
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,079
Thank you.

305
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,079
For what?

306
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
For everything.

307
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,599
That's enough.

308
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,160
I'll take it off myself.

309
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,039
What do you want to say?

310
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,440
I must go,

311
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,359
Dhevi.

312
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:49,920
Where to?

313
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,599
Where I should have been

314
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,400
a long time ago.

315
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,240
America?

316
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,880
Europe,

317
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,839
or the moon?

318
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,200
Trin.

319
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,799
Can I come in?

320
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,640
You're going back to France?

321
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,759
Yes.

322
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,400
Tanakom's father

323
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,319
has arranged for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

324
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,440
to manage my secondment

325
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,400
to work at the Thai embassy in Paris.

326
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,559
It won't disrupt my civil service pathway.

327
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,680
So you’re all leaving.

328
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,880
What do you mean, Aunt Dhevi?

329
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,799
Say it.

330
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,559
We don't need to hide anything from each other anymore.

331
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Aren't we the same family?

332
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,039
At least...

333
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,480
we are right now.

334
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,720
What is it, Krailert?

335
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,240
Say it.

336
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,519
I...

337
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,480
love someone else.

338
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,920
Right...

339
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,599
That reporter, Naran.

340
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,119
You knew?

341
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,880
I knew.

342
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,440
And I also know

343
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,279
this isn’t going to end

344
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:09,079
with you eloping with that man.

345
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,519
I can say for certain—

346
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,720
you won't even make it to the airport.

347
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,599
You should know...

348
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,960
this will not be easy.

349
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,880
Pracha got arrested and you think it’s over?

350
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,319
They won’t let you walk away that easily—

351
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,319
not if my three brothers don’t intervene.

352
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,200
Aunt—

353
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Let me finish, since finally I get to speak.

354
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,200
That reporter, does he even understand

355
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,640
the risk he's about to take to be with you?

356
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,640
And Trin too.

357
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,759
Aunt, I—

358
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,720
I know you won’t hurt Trin.

359
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,799
Right.

360
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,039
Trin is my nephew.

361
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,640
But my three brothers

362
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,119
they won’t think the same.

363
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,400
Do you remember this ring?

364
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,799
Asawin Wiswa.

365
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,920
Do you remember what happened to him?

366
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,000
Asawin Wiswa...

367
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,920
You really think my father chose you?

368
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,759
It was me who chose you—

369
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,519
because I love you.

370
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,119
And you had chosen me—

371
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,799
the moment you put on that halo diamond ring.

372
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,039
So you're not going

373
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,880
to take responsibility for what you've chosen?

374
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,319
Give me the air ticket, Krailert.

375
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,359
Tell Trin to deliver it to him.

376
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,319
Tell him to leave as fast as he can,

377
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,159
if he doesn't want to end up like that movie star.

378
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,559
Although I disagreed with what my father did,

379
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,960
but I can't guarantee nothing will happen.

380
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,639
And you, Krailert.

381
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,400
It's high time

382
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,760
you play the role of my husband to the fullest extent.

383
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,760
We will have a perfectly happy family life together.

384
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,079
(Air ticket)

385
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,480
How could I ever think

386
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,880
it was going to be possible?

387
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,480
(Air ticket)

388
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,239
(Sarasawadee)

389
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,599
Sarasawadee

390
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:18,960
Bro,

391
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,039
you should go to sleep.

392
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,000
Come on. Can you get up?

393
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,639
Tanwa, don't stay here alone.

394
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,840
Get the hell out!

395
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,519
Just leave me.

396
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,239
(Sarasawadee)

397
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,559
Trin, you should go.

398
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,440
Uncle, you don't need to do this.

399
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,400
Isn’t there any other way?

400
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:35,760
Each one of us

401
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,159
must be responsible for our own choices.

402
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:43,440
I have already made mine,

403
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:49,519
and now I’m ready

404
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,960
to accept its outcome.

405
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,719
But Trin, you still have a chance.

406
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,400
I want you

407
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,159
to choose the life you want

408
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:09,639
and live it on my behalf.

409
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,119
That room was so charming, Uncle.

410
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:45,880
Mr. Klai Rung.

411
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:53,199
Yes.

412
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,519
It was charming.

413
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,440
(Sarasawadee)

414
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,079
Both Klai Rung

415
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,480
and I

416
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,960
know well

417
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:37,880
that some things

418
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:40,639
in life

419
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,280
will never change.

420
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,000
Klai Rung—

421
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,599
my stubborn rival,

422
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,280
so annoyingly unyielding.

423
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,519
He is the only one

424
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:50,320
I have ever fought with, all the way through.

425
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,360
And yet,

426
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,880
from the quiet depths of my soul,

427
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:01,960
I still find myself wishing to remain by his side.

428
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,960
My dear readers,

429
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:17,559
Do you have that one person in your life—

430
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,599
the one you wish to keep arguing with until your very last day?

431
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:28,480
Someone who, even in the heat of an argument,

432
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,199
you still hope will never stop speaking?

433
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:41,679
Someone who,

434
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:43,599
even in the throes of passion,

435
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:46,039
still makes you feel

436
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:48,840
that a million touches would never be enough?

437
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,199
I have never believed

438
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,519
there must be a single answer

439
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:00,559
to every single question in life.

440
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,440
But if I must give just one answer

441
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,280
to just one question,

442
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,480
I will

443
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,119
choose that person.

444
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,320
And I already know—

445
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:20,559
that person will choose me too.

446
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:26,400
Some things

447
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,920
do not need to be spoken aloud.

448
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:31,079
Some answers

449
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:33,639
are better left quiet, unannounced,

450
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,199
because we already know them,

451
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:37,639
deep down.

452
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:41,119
I believe our listeners must have heard

453
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,719
that Klai Rung

454
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:45,400
has announced his retirement from the column

455
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,000
following Sarasawadee.

456
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,639
Tonight,

457
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:50,159
let me bid farewell

458
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:52,920
to our dear rivals who have long graced

459
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,079
the newspaper pages—

460
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,199
with this song from a mysterious songwriter.

461
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,800
This is for love,

462
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,480
whether it be a joyful one or a sorrowful one.

463
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,920
Beyond the Clouds

464
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:56,960
(Victor Salenko)

465
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,400
Trin.

466
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:46,199
I heard from Tanakom that you would be here.

467
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,079
Trin.

468
00:52:57,199 --> 00:52:59,199
Could you at least go see Tanwa?

469
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:19,400
This is something he has to face on his own.

470
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:27,840
Please take care of Tanwa.

471
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,920
I have to go now.

472
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,119
(Draft: Education Policies,

473
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:47,639
submitted for consideration, by Dr. Trin Suwannapas)

474
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,719
We have received a report this morning

475
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:20,719
that General Pracha Suttisakol,

476
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:22,719
the former Army Commander-in-Chief,

477
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:25,639
was found dead inside his prison cell.

478
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:27,239
The body was discovered in a seated position,

479
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:28,920
with his neck tied to the cell grille.

480
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,360
At the time of the incident, no guards were present nearby.

481
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,679
The matter is now under further investigation.

482
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:52,000
That's enough, Tanwa.

483
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,800
How long are you going to keep folding paper stars?

484
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,159
The night is full of stars...

485
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,760
but why is it so dark in here?

486
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:17,400
Tanwa.

487
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,519
The sky is so damn lonely.

488
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,440
The moon is gone.

489
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,159
Stop it, Tanwa.

490
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,199
The moon isn’t gone!

491
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,000
Go!

492
00:59:58,199 --> 00:59:59,440
Go!

493
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:05,519
Stop burying yourself under this pile of paper!

494
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:09,320
Tanwa.

495
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,679
That is the moon!

496
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:32,639
The real moon!

497
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,800
Come out and see the real thing!

498
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,519
What's wrong with you?

499
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:56,079
I'm so disappointed in you.

500
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,480
Wake up!

501
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:18,760
I used to believe

502
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,440
we must choose to stand on only one side.

503
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,760
But when everything collapsed,

504
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,440
I realized

505
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:33,119
there aren’t just two sides to everything.

506
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,880
Still, I couldn’t decide which path to take.

507
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:49,119
Then I met the Rector,

508
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,519
and listened to his words.

509
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,599
My conscience seemed to return.

510
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,800
He said,

511
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,719
"Don't let failure stop us."

512
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,760
As long as we stand firm in what we believe,

513
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,079
we will always find the way.

514
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:16,719
I crossed to the other side.

515
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,360
I took a risk.

516
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,039
I loved.

517
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:26,400
I failed.

518
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,760
I learned.

519
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,000
I saw what the far side of the moon looked like.

520
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:36,320
I used to be afraid of the outcome of my own choice.

521
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,079
But today,

522
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,920
I finally understand—that choosing, in itself,

523
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:45,320
is what truly matters.

524
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,199
Regardless of the outcome.

525
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:52,440
It’s still better than not choosing at all.

526
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:39,000
Mom...

527
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:44,920
What is it, Dad?

528
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:46,719
Try reading it.

529
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,239
It's your mother's last novel.

530
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:51,599
She never finished it.

531
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:57,679
Why did you give it to me?

532
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:37,360
Night fell,

533
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,039
the indigo moon floated vividly in the sky,

534
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:47,119
I sat at the old spot

535
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:49,840
on the cruel, cold bed.

536
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,280
Every night was always too long—

537
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,280
stretching on with no end in sight.

538
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,320
The clock

539
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,039
kept ticking on the wall.

540
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,559
But I did not move with it.

541
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,760
Just read on.

542
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,639
I used to keep my hope in that small box.

543
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:32,360
I used to believe that if at the right time,

544
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,079
I opened it,

545
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,639
I would find something inside

546
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,920
that could keep me going.

547
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,800
But tonight, I opened it,

548
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,079
but it was empty.

549
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,400
I wasn’t surprised.

550
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,320
I was just...

551
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,079
too tired.

552
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,800
When the moon slips past the horizon,

553
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:56,399
it would be a blessing if I could disappear with it.

554
01:09:01,159 --> 01:09:02,279
You finished the book?

555
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,399
Dad, would you mind

556
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,640
if I continue writing Mom's novel?

557
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,319
I want to write it in my own way,

558
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:18,600
but the ending

559
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,760
will be different.

560
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,560
Of course not, Go on.

561
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,640
I'll be waiting to read it.

562
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,079
Bet on your words.

563
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:34,399
(2 years later, 1971)

564
01:11:37,479 --> 01:11:38,199
Hi!

565
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:39,760
Hello, Ms. Moira!

566
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,159
Please come back again, Ms. Moira!

567
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:53,880
You're no longer partying?

568
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,119
Sorry, Moira.

569
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:58,600
I’m tied up at the moment.

570
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:04,680
It seems my hotel needs to recruit a new musical band.

571
01:12:06,039 --> 01:12:07,640
You don't need to.

572
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,479
I'm still playing in the band.

573
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,239
Let me know your plan then.

574
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:19,840
I have handsome young men

575
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,119
queuing up for a job with me.

576
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:24,600
Let them wait.

577
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:27,239
Bye-bye.

578
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,920
Can I have the autograph of the future famous author?

579
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:17,720
(For Mondira, my best friend — Chanya)

580
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:23,640
Thank you,

581
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,680
Rimtara.

582
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:28,039
- Bye / - Bye-bye.

583
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,600
Dear Prof. Trin,

584
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,039
I hope this letter finds you in good spirits.

585
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:10,239
I’ve been stationed in Nadon

586
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,159
as Deputy District Chief for a while now.

587
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:14,840
I've also started a co-operative project

588
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,760
for education here,

589
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,479
following the method you once proposed.

590
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:22,199
I received a letter from Nuch,

591
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:23,239
Auntie Num

592
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:24,680
and Uncle Ivan.

593
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,720
They are doing well in America.

594
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:28,920
Nuch has been taking care of them.

595
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,520
She has even received a green card

596
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,880
after being legally adopted by Uncle and Auntie.

597
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,680
She will finish community college this year.

598
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:44,239
Nuch said that once she gets a job,

599
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,720
she would repay you

600
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,199
for the tuition fees

601
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,000
and air tickets you supported her with.

602
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,159
I still meet my old friends from time to time.

603
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:03,720
Narong opened his own tailor shop,

604
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:07,560
an extension of his father's fabric shop in Phahurat.

605
01:15:12,439 --> 01:15:13,319
These days,

606
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:16,159
everyone goes to Narong Tailor to have their suits made.

607
01:15:24,199 --> 01:15:25,319
Tiva

608
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,760
is still working with his juniors on student protests.

609
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,920
After the November 17 coup d’état,

610
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,279
various groups of students have come together.

611
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,039
It seems

612
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:44,439
the current situation is building toward a major revolution.

613
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,520
I just hope

614
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,600
Tiva

615
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,920
will lead them

616
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,119
there successfully.

(Community Development Volunteer Club)

618
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,680
We've been through so much together.

619
01:15:57,039 --> 01:15:58,479
Although in the end

620
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:01,239
we chose different paths,

621
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,279
our friendship

622
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,279
has never faded.

623
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:11,600
Whenever we visit Victor’s relic stupa,

624
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,000
we always see the fried dough

625
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,039
that M.L. Tanakom placed on the altar.

626
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,560
He said you told him

627
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,800
to place one there every Buddhist Sabbath.

628
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,199
Lastly,

629
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,840
I'd like to thank you

630
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,600
for initiating the village co-operative project

631
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,960
for education,

632
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:35,199
and Colonel Krailert for providing the funding.

633
01:16:35,479 --> 01:16:36,920
I once doubted

634
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,319
whether we could truly bring about change—

635
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,680
but now I know

636
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,199
it is possible.

637
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:47,159
I will do my best to keep it alive.

(Victor Salenko)

640
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:37,800
Monsieur!

641
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,279
Yes?

642
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:40,439
I need your signature,

643
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:44,720
but.. it’s really urgent, just a quick one.

644
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,439
That’s it —

645
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:48,560
It always ends up happening at moments like this.

646
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,359
I’ll also confirm it with the Austrian embassy.

647
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:52,279
No problem.

648
01:17:52,279 --> 01:17:53,920
Oh, I almost forgot —

649
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,239
there’s a small collection going around.

650
01:17:58,199 --> 01:17:59,119
Thank you.

651
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:16,600
Moira.

652
01:18:39,399 --> 01:18:41,640
Trin, you should read this.

653
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,760
This book is a great read,

654
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,600
especially for you.

655
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,520
You won’t be able to put it down.

656
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,039
Miss you,

657
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:50,520
Moira.

(Indigo Moon, by Rimtara)

659
01:19:17,479 --> 01:19:18,880
Tonight,

660
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,720
the indigo moon floated vividly in the sky,

661
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:26,399
I decided to open the small box

662
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,199
where I had kept my hope.

663
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:31,920
I used to believe

664
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,560
keeping promises

665
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,439
and keeping silent

666
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,720
were the best things I could do.

667
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,079
That day,

668
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:50,399
when, out of nowhere, that young man confronted me,

669
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:53,039
he asked,

670
01:19:57,039 --> 01:19:58,520
Do you really love him?

671
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,720
I love him.

672
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:28,880
Can you promise me

673
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,840
that you'll take care of him as best as you can?

674
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,079
I promise.

675
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:43,680
Wait.

676
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:46,439
Don't tell Phi Trin.

677
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,439
Don't let him know about this.

678
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:51,479
Stay with him.

679
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:53,520
Don't let him go there.

680
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,479
He doesn't need to know about this.

681
01:20:58,079 --> 01:20:59,800
Take care of Phi Trin.

682
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,279
Can you promise?

683
01:21:09,079 --> 01:21:10,159
I promise.

684
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,520
(Victor Salenko)

685
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:16,079
And that was

686
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,520
why I made that decision

687
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,359
on that fateful day.

688
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,319
I’m sorry

689
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,279
I couldn’t keep any of the promises you asked of me.

690
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,800
I have watched people walk away from me.

691
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,079
I respected all their decisions.

692
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:19,840
But today,

693
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,119
I choose to respect my own freedom.

694
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:26,079
I choose to live,

695
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:27,800
to stand up,

696
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,279
and to love.

697
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,880
I won't let everything

698
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,720
fade away in silence,

699
01:22:36,199 --> 01:22:38,439
and I hope that someone

700
01:22:38,439 --> 01:22:40,960
is still waiting to hear my voice.

701
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,399
I still believe

702
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,560
there won't always be

703
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:48,319
only nights of darkness.

704
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,840
The moon always shines.

705
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,720
The moon always shines.

706
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:36,800
I need to go back to Thailand urgently.

707
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,199
Please arrange my air tickets.

01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,359
Vanilla sky from beneath the Pont Neuf bridge

711
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,359
is truly stunning.

712
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,079
Want me to sign it for you?

713
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:51,319
No.

714
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,239
I don't want scribbles in my book.

715
01:26:24,199 --> 01:26:25,520
Nice to meet you.

716
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:32,920

Life

720
01:27:58,199 --> 01:28:00,039
never tells us

721
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:03,960
what lies on the far side of the moon.

722
01:28:09,399 --> 01:28:12,119
But crossing to that side on your own

723
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:18,439
is the truest beauty

724
01:28:18,439 --> 01:28:20,039
of living.

726
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,000
Sometimes,

727
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,600
the audacity to risk

728
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,359
brings us the most

729
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:08,920
unexpected happiness.

730
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,039
And such

731
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,159
is life.

732
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:15,640
C'est la vie.
