[THE HUNT]

00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:58,420
[2010, Weihai]

3
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,570
The Second Winter Tourism Industry Expo

4
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,710
will open in our city on January 4.

5
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,240
This year's theme is

6
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,259
North and South Connected,

7
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,789
Mountains and Seas United.

8
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,800
A grand fireworks display

9
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,280
will be held at 7:00 p.m.

10
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,540
Liu, out patrolling the mountain again?

11
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,060
I've checked the lower areas.

12
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,210
I'll rest for a while

13
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,960
and then head up to check the top.

14
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,560
If you freeze out there,

15
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,680
your pay won't even be enough

16
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,010
to cover medical bills.

17
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,030
Here.

18
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,970
It's good to be youngâ€”

19
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,680
full of endless energy.

20
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,190
Looks like it might snow.

21
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,000
I'd better hurry

22
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,680
to the small restaurant down the mountain
and order a few dishes.

23
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,960
I'll buy a bottle of baijiu too.

24
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,800
It's cold at night.

25
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
We can have a drink

26
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,470
to warm ourselves up.

27
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,030
Mr. Wang,

28
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,970
we shouldn't drink while on duty, right?

29
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,960
We're just security guards,

30
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,040
not police officers.

31
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,720
Don't worry.

32
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,430
It's freezing.

33
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,490
The captain won't come to check on us.

34
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,450
I look quite like a cop.

35
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,950
What a stench.

36
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,280
Can you handle it?

37
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,710
Maybe we should ask Wang to come to help.

38
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,240
Let me tell you, Wang is

39
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,790
even worse at this than I am.

40
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,980
I'll have it done in 5 minutes.

41
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,450
Quick, get the mop!

42
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,840
Xiangdong,

43
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,350
are we friends or not?

44
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,740
If I'm in trouble,

45
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,159
will you help me?

46
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,680
What's wrong?

47
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,980
No one else

48
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,560
can know about this,

49
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,360
not even Ximei.

50
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,750
Only you and me.

51
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,910
If anyone else finds out,

52
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,040
I might not be able to live.

53
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,630
If we're true friends,

54
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,630
help me with this.

55
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,240
Tomorrow at 4 p.m.,

56
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,670
go to my place and pick up a wooden box.

57
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,270
After dark,

58
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,560
take it to the old shack

59
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,090
at the peak of Mount Fufeng.

60
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,210
Before you go,
take the old road near the signal tower.

61
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,070
What's

62
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,800
inside the box?

63
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,860
[That accident from years ago
replays in a nightmare,]

64
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,370
[like tiny cracks
spreading across a frozen lake.]

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,540

00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,370
Mentor.

67
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,920
Go ahead.

68
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,440
An elderly couple on the second floor

69
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,270
reported a clogged toilet drain.

70
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,000
When they cleared it,

71
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,070
they pulled out a mess of debris

72
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,150
from the main pipeâ€”

73
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,270
some hair

74
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,200
and half of an ear.

75
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,740
Human.

76
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,970
They suspect it's a dismemberment case.

77
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,090
The forensic team is already inside,

78
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,510
checking the primary scene.

79
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,040
Mr. Meng.

80
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,290
Over there.

81
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,120
Mr. Niu.

82
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,600
Anything else besides the ear?

83
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,159
Not for now.

84
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,770
The scene's poorly preserved.

85
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,720
No clear signs

86
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,920
of a struggle either.

87
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,680
Anyone here?

88
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,780
[Xiaojun]

89

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,550
Xiaojun.

91
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,840
Xiaojun.

92
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,650
Xiaojun.

93
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,020
Who's there?

94
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,910
Liu!

95
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,120
Liu!

96
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,610
Officer,

97
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,390
what's going on?

98
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,000
We received a report

99
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,300
from a security guard at Mount Fufeng.

100
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,390
Was it you?

101
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,650
No.

102
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,370
Are there other security guards here?

103
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,590
There's one more.

104
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,700
He was just here a moment ago.

105
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
You haven't had dinner at this hour?

106
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,140
We're from
the Guanhai Criminal Investigation Unit.

107
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,740
Take a look.

108
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,740
Something happened downstairs.

109
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,600
Have you heard about it?

110
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,660
This has nothing to do with my family.

111
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:09,630
Yes.

112
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,930
But your units

113
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,280
share the same pipeline.

114
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,080
We'd like to go in and take a look.

115
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,010
Wait.

116
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,970
Come, you go in first.

117
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,340
Bring the luminol reagent.

118
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,280
What's your name?

119
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,960
Wu Ximei.

120
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,150
How to write

121
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,440
those Chinese characters?

122
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Go notify

123
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,670
the neighboring units

124
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,890
we'll investigate in their houses later.

125
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,500
Okay.

126
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,130
How many people live here?

127
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,390
Three.

128
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,300
Me,

129
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,620
my husband, and my son.

130
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,460
What's your husband's name?

131
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,720
Cao Xiaojun.

132
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,010
"Xiao" as in small, "Jun" as in soldier.

133
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,080
But on his ID card,
it's "Jun" as in gentleman.

134
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Anything unusual at home recently?

135
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,360
What time did you and your husband

136
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,720
leave home today?

137
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You suspect me?

138
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,550
We're asking every household.

139
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,670
It's standard procedure.

140
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,960
Yes.

141
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,240
We ask every household these questions.

142
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,710
I don't remember the exact time.

143
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,030
In the morning,

144
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,270
when I took Tianbao to school,

145
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,420
Xiaojun was still at home.

146
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,670
At noon, Tianbao was at after-school care.

147
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,930
When I came back,

148
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,440
Xiaojun was already gone.

149
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,170
Tianbao is your child?

150
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,410
You're not from here?

151
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,030
I'm from Nanyang.

152
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,960
Does Cao Xiaojun usually

153
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,090
come home this late?

154
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,250
Xiaojun works in moving services.

155
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,990
He's always running around.

156
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,570
When others are on leave

157
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,840
or on holiday,

158
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,000
he's at his busiest.

159
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,670
He works from dawn to dusk.

160
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,920
I'm never sure when he'll be home.

161
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,720
I'm used to it.

162
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,750
And what do you do?

163
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,800
Cleaning.

164
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,440
Where?

165
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,120
Dahu Advertising Studio,

166
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,600
No. 20 on Huanshan Road.

167
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,440
What time do you usually go to work?

168
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,550
I go once in the morning

169
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,010
and once in the afternoon.

170
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,200
I get off work at about 6 p.m.

171
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,870
What time did you go this afternoon?

172
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,420
I left a little after 3 p.m.

173
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,480
and arrived at the company at 4 p.m.

174
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,090
What about the time in between?

175
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,260
Working on small handcrafts.

176
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,450
Where's your child?

177
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,250
At Ms. Li's place next door.

178
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,960
He gets out of school early,

179
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,619
so he waits for us at her place.

180
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,930
This way?

181
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,400
The unit at the very end.

182
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,270
Wu and her husband

183
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,670
are quite busy with work.

184
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,760
Our children

185
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,130
are classmates,

186
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,640
and we're neighbors.

187
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,130
It's convenient

188
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,400
for me to pick up and drop off the child.

189
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,119
So I help her pick up her child.

190
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,750
The one in the sweater

191
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,310
is our Lele.

192
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,000
That one is Tianbao

193
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,150
from Unit 312.

194
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,710
Is something going on with their family?

195
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,170
No,

196
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,600
just routine inquiries.

197
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,480
Our 2 families

198
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,590
only started visiting more often

199
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,000
in the last month or 2.

200
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,880
Usually,

201
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,130
it's Cao's friend

202
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,960
who helps him

203
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,640
pick up and drop off the child.

204
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,630
They're closer.

205
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,630
Friend?

206
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,590
Who is this?

207
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,550
Xiaojun's coworker.

208
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,210
Do you usually visit often?

209
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,310
Not really.

210
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
He's in this picture

211
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:01,960
with your family of 3,

212
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,560
yet you don't interact much?

213
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,180
Tianbao is a still kid.

214
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,610
Maybe...

215
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,070
he happened to be there
when Tianbao drew this.

216
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,400
I don't quite remember.

217
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,270
His...

218
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,720
His eyebrow...

219
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,590
There's a scar here.

220
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,110
That friend of his

221
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,170
isn't a bad person.

222
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,490
And he's even-tempered.

223
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,460
He bought

224
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,260
toys and stuff for Tianbao.

225
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,680
Tianbao would

226
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,720
carry them over

227
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,870
happily to our place

228
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,270
and show off

229
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,100
to our Lele.

230
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,740
When was the last time

231
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,780
you saw him?

232
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,540
He hasn't been around for a while.

233
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,720
Ms. Li.

234
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:43,880
That's...

235
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,220
That's not true.

236
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,820
Today,

237
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,960
I saw him coming out

238
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,200
of Xiaojun's place.

239
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Around what time?

240
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,670
Around...

241
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,030
Around 3 or 4 p.m.

242
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,550
How did he seem then?

243
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,630
Anything unusual?

244
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,540
Who are you?

245
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,470
He's a police officer.

246
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,270
We're investigating the case

247
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,160
in Unit 212 downstairs.

248
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,360
If you know anything,

249
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,440
please cooperate with our investigation.

250
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,240
I...

251
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,990
saw him

252
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,160
carrying

253
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,500
a large box

254
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,440
out of the house.

255
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,770
I thought

256
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,080
since he

257
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,900
and Xiaojun's family are close,

258
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,990
I didn't think much of it.

259
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,480
Mr. Niu.

260
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,150
Anything?

261
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,820
Mind if I check the inner room?

262
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,590
Go ahead.

263
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,110
Same as Unit 212,

264
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,750
no clear signs

265
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,130
of a struggle.

266
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,670
The toilet area showed some reaction,

267
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,470
but the trace amount is minimal.

268
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,270
No matter how you look at it,

269
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,960
it doesn't look like a murder scene.

270
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,200
There are more units inside.

271
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,640
I'll hurry and check them all.

272
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,440
Okay. Thanks for your hard work.

273
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,440
Mr. Meng.

274
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,230
We've got something.

275
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,790
Just when we entered the room,

276
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,550
she said there's a box

277
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,880
missing from this spot.

278
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,960
What kind of box?

279
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,470
How big?

280
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,230
About... About this big.

281
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,460
Painted red on the outside.

282
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,110
This is strange.

283
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,830
Everything in the box is still here.

284
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,030
Only the box is gone.

285
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,160
Was there anything valuable inside?

286
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,220
Just these things.

287
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,450
Describe

288
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,500
the box's specific features

289
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,070
to me.

290
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,590
About half a person's height.

291
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,720
Very old,

292
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,720
but very sturdy.

293
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,860
Mentor.

294
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,790
This afternoon,

295
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,420
a resident in Unit 313

296
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,370
saw a man called Ni Xiangdong

297
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,340
coming in and out of here,

298
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,420
carrying a box.

299
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,720
Ni Xiangdong?

300
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,540
Is this him?

301
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,270
Yes.

302
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,350
How many keys do you have to your place?

303
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,110
Just 3.

304
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,240
One for me,

305
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,630
one for Xiaojun,

306
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,350
and one at Ms. Li's place.

307
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Does he have a car?

308
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,720
He has a used van.

309
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,440
Here's what you doâ€”

310
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,880
write down Ni Xiangdong's

311
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,680
and Cao Xiaojun's

312
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,410
phone numbers and names for me.

313
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,920
You go check the license plate number

314
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,050
of that van quickly.

315
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,830
Understood.

316
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,240
Qin K77651.

317
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,030
[Ni Xiangdong]

318
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,140
The suspect's vehicle spotted.

319
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,560
[Police]

320
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,520
License plate number: Qin K77651.

321
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,630
Xiaojun.

322
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,660
Xiaojun.

323
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,530
Who are you?

324
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,880
What are you doing here?

325
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,350
Where's Cao Xiaojun?

326
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,970
I'm asking who you are!

327
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,700
I'm asking who you are!

328
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,900
Don't move!

329
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,610
Who are you?

330
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,900
Why are you here?

331
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,650
I don't know.

332
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,510
Where is Cao Xiaojun?

333
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,240
I don't know.

334
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,780
Chief, we've arrived.

335
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,820
Help!

336
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:40,930
Help!

337
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,730
He Yuan is keeping watch
at the foot of the mountain.

338
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,640
Song and I

339
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,400
are heading to the reported location.

340
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,730
All roads up and down Mount Fufeng

341
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,790
have been blocked.

342
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,240
Good.

343
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,570
The person is probably in this area.

344
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,020
This area?

345
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,700
Do you know how big this area is?

346
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,360
The mountains are high,
and the forest is dense.

347
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,990
What's going on here?

348
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,350
[Police]

349
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:55,960
What happened?

350
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,220
This is the patrol guard at Mount Fufeng.

351
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,240
He was attacked

352
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,750
after reporting to the police.

353
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,840
The attacker was brutal.

354
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,500
Has the attacker been caught?

355
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,540
Let me introduce you to each other.

356
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,370
This is Tong Hao.

357
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,830
This is He Yuan. Call her Ms. He.

358
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,260
Ms. He.

359
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,180
Who hit you?

360
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
Did you see the attacker's face?

361
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,830
No.

362
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,810
Alright, get him

363
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,690
to the hospital quickly.

364
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,880
[Police]

365
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,750
Be careful on the way down.

366
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,160
Okay.

367
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,350
[Police]

368
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,160
Officer,

369
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,340
I need to use the bathroom.

370
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,040
Mentor,

371
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,240
something doesn't add up.

372
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,740
If Cao Xiaojun was in the box,

373
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,640
why was only an ear thrown

374
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,680
in the drain?

375
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,900
Carrying a box in broad daylight

376
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,830
to dispose of a body?

377
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,790
And if he was disposing of a body,

378
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,880
why not put the ear in the box

379
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,980
along with it?

380
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,380
This case is just...

381
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,120
strange.

382
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,310
Right?

383
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,940
Besides, who would dispose of a body

384
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,020
in broad daylight

385
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,270
so brazenly?

386
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,400
If you ask me,

387
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,790
body disposal should be done at night,

388
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,940
deep in the mountains.

389
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,110
Just like right now.

390
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,640
Also,

391
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,330
that security guard's eyesight

392
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,260
is really poor.

393
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,460
A frontal attackâ€”

394
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,960
yet he didn't see the person.

395
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,830
Half his face

396
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,140
was beaten bloody.

397
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,280
He'll probably be disfigured.

398
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
Which side was it?

399
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,370
Left... Left side.

400
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,520
What's wrong?

401
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:03,940
Let's go!

402
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,370
What's wrong, Mentor?

403
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,570
Arrest Ni Xiangdong!

404
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,090
Where is he?

405
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,220
Inside.

406
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,330
What's going on?

407
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,670
How many exits are there?

408
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,550
Just this one.

409
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,680
The person inside is likely the suspect.

410
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,070
You two follow behind.

411
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,890
Be careful.

412
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,690
Let's go.

413
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:13,550
Come out.

414
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,270
Come out!

415
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,090
He ran away.

416
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,620
Li, you're so drunk that you can't even
tell what card to play.

417
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,950
Slow down on the drinks.

418
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,680
Let's play another 2 rounds.

419
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,870
-Come on.
-Come on.

420
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,960
Take a look.

421
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,590
Yes.

422
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,680
It's him.

423
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,290
Liu Cheng'an.

424
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,240
What happened to Liu?

425
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,240
Has he been acting strange lately?

426
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,100
He thinks he's a police officer.

427
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,360
He's very meticulous.

428
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,260
He likes to meddle in everything.

429
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,550
There couldn't be anything unusual.

430
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,550

431
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,310
switch shifts weekly.

432
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,590
I went to a nearby shop to buy some food,

433
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,320
and he was gone when I came back.

434
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,370
He didn't even stay
for the handover drink.

435
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,030
What exactly happened to Liu?

436
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,840
Don't worry.

437
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,830
We're looking for him too.

438
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,210
We'll tell you
as soon as we know anything.

the bathrooms and kitchens

first define the nature of this case,

had an anniversary sale.

in your ability.

547
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,970

Don't worry about it.

553
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,480
No problem?

554
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,080

556
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,720
I was...

557
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,790
a bit harsh earlier.

558
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,350
It was my fault.

559
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,010

the criminal investigation unit,

573
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,370
In every way.

574
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,670
Wait, Mentor.

575
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,640
Um...

576
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,440
When you were taking

577
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,640
Wu Ximei's statement tonight,

578
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,400
I heard some strange things

579
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,640
from the neighbors.

580
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,640
I didn't think much of it back then,

581
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
but now it's starting to make sense.

582
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,550
That Officer Meng

583
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,550
is sharp-eyed.

584
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,250
I think he's already suspicious of me.

585
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,120
He asked me so many questions.

586
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,270
I answered everything

587
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,880
just as we discussed.

588
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,210
Tianbao's medical costs

589
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,160
keep rising.

590
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,000
Hundreds of thousands in insurance moneyâ€”

591
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,200
we could never

592
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,800
earn that much in a lifetime.

593
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,130
His life

594
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,960
now depends

595
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,630
on you and me.

596
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,620
If I get caught,

597
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,489
you need to leave immediately.

598
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,449
At least one of us has to stay free.

599
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,380
You're Tianbao's father.

600
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,400
He needs you.

601
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,050
So,

602
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,360
[Tiexi Police Spirit]

603
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
Wu Ximei is deliberately hiding

604
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,420
her relationship with Ni Xiangdong.

605
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,159
What's my license plate number?

606
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,159
See?

607
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,040
See?

608
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,120
That is how a normal person would react.

609
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,159
But Wu Ximei recited it directly.

610
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,429
[The license plate number
Answer: Qin K77651]

611
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,719
She claimed they weren't close.

612
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,630
So what does that mean?

613
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,290
Two things.

614
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,280
First,

615
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,300
she knows him very well.

616
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
Second, she rehearsed her answers.

617
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,550
But she couldn't remember
his phone number.

618
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,500
License plate numbers are short.

619
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,230
Phone numbers are much longer.

620
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,570
That neighbor who saw Ni Xiangdong
carrying a box out of her houseâ€”

621
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,030
which unit does he live in?

622
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,120
What's his name?

623
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,520
Unit 313, Li Qingfu.

624
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,070
Go to him first thing tomorrow.

625
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,460
Okay.

626
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,530
Where are you going?

627
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,160
They've been...

628
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,610
looking for you...

629
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,920
all day.

630
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,070
Come, have a drink.

631
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,150
We're the criminal police.

632
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:13,680
Hello.

633
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,410
The deceased, Li Qingfu,

634
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,110
suffered a severe blow to the head.

635
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:17,680
He died

636
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,360
roughly 1 to 3 hours ago.

637
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,300
Notify the team to send more officers

638
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,360
and set up a cordon.

639
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,030
Was he silenced, Mentor?

640
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,070
Within less than a day,

641
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,420
this place has actually seen

642
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,700
2 violent incidents.

643
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,500
Notify the trace evidence team.

644
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,100
Yes.

645
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,030
For this kind of grease stain,

646
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,480
a dry cloth won't work.

647
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,510
Try a washcloth

648
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,030
dampened with water.

649
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,230
It'll wipe right off.

650
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,510
Okay.

651
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,890
Li Qingfu died downstairs.

652
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,170
Did you know?

653
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,070
I saw it.

654
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,450
Was he close to Cao Xiaojun?

655
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,440
Not really close,

656
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,550
just acquainted.

657
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,330
They might have met a few times

658
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,560
when buying alcohol.

659
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,400
Xiaojun likes to drink,

660
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,290
so they probably

661
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,760
met at a beer house.

662
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,000
I heard Xiaojun say before

663
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,860
that he behaved badly when drunk.

664
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,230
Was he close to Ni Xiangdong?

665
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,000
I don't know.

666
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,690
Doesn't Ni Xiangdong come here often?

667
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,030
Could they have met?

668
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,110
He doesn't come that often.

669
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,110
I don't know.

670
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,320
Do you know how he died?

671
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,840
Is this related to Xiaojun?

672
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,080
Maybe not.

673
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,000
Maybe yes.

674
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,510
We found it.

675
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,920
Xiaojun?

676
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,510
The box.

677
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,890
Cao Xiaojun wasn't in the box.

678
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,740
Then where is Xiaojun?

679
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,960
We've sent people to investigate.

680
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,030
If you have

681
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:03,860
any useful information,

682
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,060
contact us promptly.

683
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,400
Officers,

684
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,520
if he's never found,

685
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,280
is he considered dead or alive?

686
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,860
Do you want him to be dead or alive?

687
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,110
He's my husband.

688
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,360
If possible,

689
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,260
I'd rather never find him.

690
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,640
What do you mean?

691
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,840
I want Xiaojun to be safe.

692
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,920
But it's been a day and night

693
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,710
with no news.

694
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,410
I'm scared too.

695
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,880
As long as his body is not found,

696
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,970
I can still hold onto hope.

697
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,770
When will Dad

698
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,760
come back?

699
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,370
Didn't I tell you

700
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,800
not to come out?

701
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,000
Why?

702
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:10,850
I want to ask

703
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,540
what exactly happened to Dad.

704
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,030
I said no, and that's final.

705
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,560
Do you want to make me angry?

706
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,850
Tianbao, you're the best boy.

707
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,590
Be good.

708
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:21,930
Good boy.

709
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,160
Good boy.

710
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,040
Don't cry.

711
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,720
Is everything okay?

712
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,580
Do you need anything else, officers?

713
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,230
I've told you everything I know.

714
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:51,760
I still need

715
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,890
to take Tianbao for a follow-up later.

716
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,480
So clean.

717
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,230
Even the table legs have been wiped.

718
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,250
Last night,

719
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,320
I accidentally spilled some water,

720
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,050
so I cleaned up while I was at it.

721
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,480
With something this serious,

722
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,540
don't you have any family to help you?

723
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,210
I don't have any other family.

724
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,820
You don't have any contact

725
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,620
with your parents or relatives?

726
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,190
No.

727
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,330
There must be someone who cares about you.

728
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
I don't need that.

729
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,630
I don't need anyone's concern.
