What about the compensation?

97
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,400
Insurance is money paid
by the insurance company.

he said the site ran out of money
and went bankrupt.

119
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,560
So that 50,000 in compensation

120
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,960
just went down the drain.

Do you take the vegetables
to sell yourself,

129
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,430
or does someone come to collect them?

130
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,360
Of course I take them to sell myself.

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,490

193
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,430
Alright.

194
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,190
Alright.

195
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,630
Hello?

196
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,960
We're at the insurance company.

197
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,290
Come over with Tong Hao.

198
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,250
We've figured out
the basic characteristics.

199
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:24,680
[Outstanding Performance Honor Roll]

200
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,270
We've already sent people after him.

201
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,970
This guy

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,040
has some nerve.

203
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,430
He cornered this colleague

204
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,960
in the underground garage,

205
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,890
and mainly asked about

206
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,510
Wu Ximei's

207
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,549
insurance claim situation.

208
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,480
Finally he said

209
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,080
Cao Xiaojun isn't dead.

210
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,110
Here, look.

211
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,169
This is the policy.

212
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,440
Reporting,

213
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,870
we found the suspected vehicle

214
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,120
near the apartment building
in Anhe Village.

215
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,360
License plate found inside:

216
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,910
Qin K, 32393.

217
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,160
Captain Ma,

218
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,670
this whole area is

219
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,990
an urban village about to be demolished.

220
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,550
There are still some residents inside,

221
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,250
and the conditions are quite complicated.

222
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:42,720
This place

223
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,550
is not far from Wu Ximei's home, right?

224
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,870
About two blocks away.

225
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080
Those of you

226
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,950
in uniform, stay in the vehicle.

227
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,320
Keep watch on this tricycle

228
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,100
and the entrances and exits.

229
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,600
Okay.

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,630
Those in plainclothes,

231
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,150
pair up.

232
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,910
Search separately.

233
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,200
Once you spot the suspect,

234
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,030
report immediately.

235
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,630
Tong Hao and I

236
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,030
will check out the main area.

237
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,480
Alright.

238
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,010
Alright.

239
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,440
Let's go.

240
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,440
Split up.

241
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,910
Mentor,

242
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,690
this demolition area is so big.

243
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,670
If he's really hiding,

244
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,070
it'll be hard to find him.

245
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,480
And why would he

246
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,940
choose this place to hide?

247
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,390
The terrain here is complex.

248
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,670
Buildings are of different heights.

249
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,440
If you asked him

250
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
to go directly to Wu Ximei's home,

251
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,840
he wouldn't dare

252
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,900
even with 800 guts.

253
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,350
He can only find a spot

254
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,080
where he can see Wu Ximei's house

255
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,000
from above,

256
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,320
observe for a while,

257
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
wait for the right moment,

258
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,580
and then make his move.

259
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,030
Mentor.

260
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
In this small area,

261
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,150
bullets can ricochet easily.

262
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,150
You take the gun and go first.

263
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,030
Give me the handcuffs.

264
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,030
Hand me the cuffs.

265
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,960
Suspect spotted in the northwest
corner of the demolition area.

266
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,040
Block him over there.

267
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,330
Stop running!

268
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,120
Freeze!

269

Freeze!

271

Stop!

272
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,960
Stop!

273
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,450
Freeze!

274
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,590
Hands up. Squat down!

275
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,390
Mentor, move aside!

276
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,320
What are you all shouting about?

277
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,000
Don't fight,

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,330
or I'll call the police.

279
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,050
After him!

280

284
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,540
How do you feel now?

285
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,270
Mentor.

286
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,960
Where's my gun, Mentor?

287
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,700
The gun is here.

288
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,330
If you lose your gun,

289
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,370
we're finished.

290
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,890
Get up. Come on.

291
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,560
Check where it hurts.

292
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,870
It's fine.

293
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,760
Are you dizzy?

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,330
I'm not dizzy. I'm fine.

295
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,620
I just went to the bathroom

296
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,630
and left the key in.

297
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,490
When I came out,

298
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,080
I saw him taking my motorcycle.

00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,620
My new leather jacket was still on it.

it's hard to be found?

where have you been these days?

345
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,840
I was sick

Why would Tianbao be with me?

375

What's going on?

While I was out buying medicine,

It's okay. Kids love to play.

Even when the game ended,

386
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,440
he never came back.

387
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,960
How long has it been?

388
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,250
It's been a while now.

389
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,120
Where were you playing?

390
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,340
Over there.

391
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,300
None of you saw him?

392
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,200
No.

393
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,590
Tianbao!

394
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,110
Tianbao!

395
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,460
Tianbao!

396
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,640
Uncle!

397
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,480
I saw him hide in the prefab house,

398
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,920
and then he left with a man.

399
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,720
Is there a scar

400
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,070
on that man's head?

401
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,160
Yes, he has a scar.

402
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,550
Uncle Ni.

403
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,960
Do you live in here?

404
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,590
Yes.

405
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,880
Hurry upstairs.

406
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
It's so cold here.

407
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,400
Hurry.

408
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,370
The wind is strong.

409
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,930
Yeah.

410
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,200
It's cold, isn't it?

411
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,070
Yeah.

412
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,650
Really cold.

413
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,400
We're here.

414
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,790
We're home.

415
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,070
Come in.

416
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
It's so cold.

417
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,590
Uncle Ni,

418
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,570
do you live here now?

419
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,300
Yes.

420
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,790
It's not as good as my home.

421
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,960
Not as good as yours?

422
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,610
We're all family.

423
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,580
There's no yours and mine, right?

424
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,490
Sit down.

425
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,750
Uncle Ni,

426
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,930
I'm so bored.

427
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,400
Do you have anything fun?

428
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,070
Yes.

429
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,880
I'll get it for you, okay?

430
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,270
Okay.

431
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,200
You sit here.

432
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,720
Hurry up.

433
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,350
My parents will

434
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,880
urge me to go home before it gets dark.

435
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,070
-We're here...
-Wait for me!

436
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,750
Don't make noise.

437
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,950
Wait for me to return.

438
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,830
Look at you.

439
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,110
When will you ever change

440
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,240
this impulsive personality of yours?

441
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,400
Why did you raise your gun this afternoon?

442
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,590
I just wanted

443
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,040
to scare him a bit.

444
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,740
We were in the same line of fire!

445
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,140
You...

446
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,030
You scared me instead.

447
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
We learned at the police academy

448
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,860
that you can only fire

449
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,880
under certain conditions.

450
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,680
I was right there.

451
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,960
You almost shot me.

452
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,040
I'm sorry, Mentor.

453
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,310
Mentor,

454
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,510
tell me the truth.

455
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,580
About Xu Qingli's escape,

456
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,030
what's the worst that could happen to us?

457
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,850
At worst, dismissal.

458
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,030
An official reprimand if it's less worse.

459
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,750
If we're lucky,

460
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,510
we'll just be excluded

461
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,770
from year-end awards.

462
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,610
And if it's more serious?

463
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,400
Execution.

464
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,360
You asked for the truth.

465
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,960
Well, I...

466
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,480
No, I'm joking about execution.

467
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,420
It'll be fine.

468
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,660
Let's search along the way.

469
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,520
Think about where he might go now.

470
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,980
Try to make up for our mistake.

471
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,420
What if we catch him?

472
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,030
Wu Ximei's workplace

473
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,470
is close to Mount Fufeng.

474
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,410
Anywhere else?

475
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,710
The insurance company.

476
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,370
No, he can't go there a second time.

477
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,640
The Yongshuo construction site.

478
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,880
Ni Xiangdong and Cao Xiaojun

479
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,660
both worked there before.

480
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,950
That abandoned building is where

481
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,200
that water dispute fight case happened.

482
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,100
It's in Yongshuo, right?

483
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,710
Yes.

484
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,050
There are still some residents there.

485
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,070
They bought pre-sale apartments

486
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,880
that haven't been delivered,

487
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,480
so they just moved in anyway.

488
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,730
Let's take a punt.

489
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,240
Why is your phone here?

490
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,070
Tianbao

491
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,180
was taken by Ni Xiangdong.

492
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,110
Ximei.

493
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,270
Ximei.

494
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,480
Tianbao!

495
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,220
Tianbao!

496
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,800
It's okay. I'll go find him.

497
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,350
Tianbao.

498
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,020
You go back first.

499
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,240
Let's go.

500
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,510
Ni Xiangdong!

501
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,380
Is Tianbao with you?

502
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,110
Let him go!

503
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,920
I'm begging you to let him go!

504
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,690
Our issues

505
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,960
should be resolved by ourselves.

506
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,590
This matter

507
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,050
has nothing to do with the child.

508
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,410
The child is innocent.

509
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,590
I'm begging you.

510
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,720
Please, I beg you to let him go.

511
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,480
Okay?

512
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,110
It's all my fault.

513
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,240
It's all my fault.

514
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,960
I'll give you my life instead!

515
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,200
Can you hear me?

516
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,240
I'm begging you!

517
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,310
Don't cry.

518
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,750
-Let him go!
-Xiaojun, I know you're listening.

519
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,480
You can have my life if you want.

520
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,590
Ximei.

521
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,280
-I'm begging you.
-Xiaojun.

522
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,800
Ximei.

523
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,850
Are we still brothers?

524
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,370
I'm begging you, Ni Xiangdong!

525
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,930
Your brother is in trouble now.

526
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,660
Will you help me out?

527
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,350
I'm begging you!

528
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,070
Ni Xiangdong.

529
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,680
It was me who did it.

530
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,240
If you have a problem,

531
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,120
come at me.

532
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,440
Tianbao is innocent.

533
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,680
Innocent?

534
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,070
I'm innocent too.

535
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,750
He's innocent.

536
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,790
I'm innocent too.

537
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,240
Right?

538
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,200
What did I do?

539
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,310
Then was the person

540
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,510
who was buried in the pit you dig

541
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,400
innocent?

542
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,360
Was that person guilty?

543
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,510
Answer me!

544
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,320
Listen to me.

545
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,560
I'll give you two places.

546
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,840
One is the Chengxi construction site,

547
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,540
and the other is Mount Fufeng.

548
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,640
Tianbao and I

549
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,160
will definitely be at one of these places,

550
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,090
waiting for you.

551
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,240
As for where each of you is going,

552
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,010
you need to decide quickly.

553
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,240
Do you hear me?

554
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,720
Hurry up.

555
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,110
It's very cold here.

556
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,270
Tianbao is also cold here.

557
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,250
Isn't he?

558
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,350
Decide quickly.

559
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:13,970
Ni Xiang-

560
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,720
Ximei.

561
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,770
Ximei.

562
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Ximei, look at me.

563
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,110
Tianbao.

564
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,400
Look at me!

565
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,640
I'll go to Mount Fufeng.

566
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,400
You go to the Chengxi construction site.

567
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,680
I guess he'll be waiting for me
at Mount Fufeng,

568
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,210
just like in the beginning.

569
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,350
Do you hear me?

570
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,960
I'm going with you.

571
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,710
We have nothing left to gamble.

572
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,030
No time to hesitate, Ximei.

573
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,540
I'll go to the construction site.

574
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,000
You take the car.

575
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,680
Alright.

576
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,920
I'll go to Mount Fufeng.

577
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,510
If I don't find them,

578
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,920
I'll come straight
to the construction site to find you.

579
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,110
Remember this.

580
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,020
Safety first.

581
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,130
Understand?

582
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:33,880
Xiaojun.

583
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,440
Be careful.

584
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,640
Get to Pier No. 3 by 10 PM

585
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,920
and find the boat boss.

586
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,970
Just go as soon as the ship leaves.

587
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:51,310
Okay.

588
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,830
It's fine.

589
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,780
I'm here.

590
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,210
Tianbao will be fine.

591
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,240
It'll be fine.

592
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,400
It'll be fine.

593
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,350
It'll be fine.

594
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,030
When will my parents

595
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,390
come to pick me up?

596
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,560
Uncle Ni, why do we

597
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,750
have to make such an effort

598
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,680
to climb up here?

599
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,210
Are you afraid of heights?

600
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,000
Afraid?

601
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,350
Very soon.

602
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,210
I just called

603
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
your parents.

604
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,640
They'll be here soon

605
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,590
to meet you.

606
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,270
Tell me honestly.

607
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,300
You don't want to move either, do you?

608
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,200
I want to set off firecrackers

609
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,160
with Lele and others during New Year.

610
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,960
That's right.

611
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,330
I don't want you to leave either.

612
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,400
I'll go and try

613
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,450
to convince your parents, okay?

614
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,440
Okay.

615
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,790
Dad will definitely listen to you.

616
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,860
I have some misunderstanding

617
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,590
with your parents.

618
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,640
They hate me now.

619
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,540
But I didn't mean to hurt them.

620
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,310
I want to apologize to them.

621
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,520
If I apologize,

622
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,920
they'll be happy.

623
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,170
Then I'll help convince them.

624
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,240
And we're not moving away, okay?

625
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,830
Great!

626
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,750
That's awesome!

627
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,440
Yes.

628
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,320
But Tianbao,

629
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,030
I need you

630
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,240
to do me a favor.

631
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,400
I need you to give

632
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,680
your mom and dad

633
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,000
a big surprise with me.

634
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,350

Wu Ximei.

659
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,160
Wu Ximei!

660
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,890
To Chengxi construction site.

661
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:49,920
Freeze!

662
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,640

Stay back!

665
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,070
Put the knife down.

666
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,830
-Wu Ximei.
-Let me go.

667
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,830
or I'll kill myself right here!

668
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,880
Don't move, Wu Ximei. Stay still.

669
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,510
Calm down.

670
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,680
I need to save my son.

671
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,030
I need to save my son!

672
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,670
Ni Xiangdong has taken him!

673
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,920

We'll take you there.

679
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,090
Wasn't he kidnapped

680
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,720

681
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,490
I'll take you there.

682
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,550
Put the knife down.

683
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,070
Wu Ximei, put the knife down.

684
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,920
Listen to me.

685
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,550
Cao Tianbao is so young.

686
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,590
You can't leave him motherless!

687
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,210
Wu Ximei!

688
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,300
How can I trust you?

689
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:16,790
Swear it!

690
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,440
I swear.

691
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:17,980
We're police officers.

692

It will be fine.

706
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,750
Alright.

707
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,900
My mentor says it will be fine.

708
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,610
Stop crying.

709
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,880
Tianbao is a good boy.

710
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,640

00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,000
Mentor.

767
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,480
[Police]

768
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,940
[Police]

769
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
Where's Tianbao?

770
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,670
Where's Tianbao?

771
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,050
Tianbao?

772
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,650
Take a guess.

773
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,550
What game are you playing?

774
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,400
Who's playing games?

775
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,590
It's you two.

776
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,590
You've been playing games all along.

777
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,480
Okay?

778
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,630
Brother,

779
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,590
I'm in a difficult situation now.

780
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,000
Can you help me out?

781
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,020
You let me carry up a box.

782
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,250
You cut off your ear and lay inside,

783
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,170
pretending to be dead.

784
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,480
Can you still hear me

785
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,880
with that ear of yours?

786
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,370
Ximei came to take my photo,

787
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,110
then tried to commit insurance fraud,

788
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:51,880
but failed.

789
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,630
You fools.

790
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,880
Afraid I'd discover your secret,

791
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,000
so you wanted to kill me.

792
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,860
When I wasn't paying attention,

793
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,920
you choked me unconscious,

794
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,630
then pushed me from above.

795
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,040
But I didn't die.

796
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,600
I'm still standing here.

797
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,920
It's our fault.

798
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,940
We're sorry.

799
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,920
We had no choice.

800
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,250
Treating Tianbao's illness needs money.

801
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,170
My insurance

802
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:20,760
and your insurance

803
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,560
could both save Tianbao's life.

804
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,110
My life doesn't matter.

805
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,800
I'd trade my life for Tianbao's.

806
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
That night,

807
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,670
a man and a woman,

808
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,100
digging a pit to bury a body.

809
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,840
The man's

810
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,780
named Cao Xiaojun,

811
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,840
and the woman's named Wu Ximei.

812
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,070
Isn't that right?

813
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,880
That tattoo of Guangong
with open eyes is on your back,

814
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,590
right?

815
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,260
Who are you really?

816
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:05,960
Who am I?

817
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,280
I'm your brother Dong!

818
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,000
Ni Xiangdong!

819
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,110
Don't you recognize me?

820
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,190
Cao Xiaojun!

821
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,030
I'm your brother Dong!

822
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,630
Kill me again!

823
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,520
Kill me!

824
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,590
Do you hear me?

825
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,190
I've already considered you family.

826
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,150
You know?

827
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,360
If you hadn't mentioned this,

828
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,160
I would never have brought it up.

829
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,920
If you had been honest with me,

830
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,110
we wouldn't be here today.

831
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,370
What a pity.

832
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,150
Right now,

833
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,480
at the Chengxi construction site,

834
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,880
Wu Ximei has already

835
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,480
fallen from that scaffold.

836
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,450
What have you done to Ximei?

837
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,190
What happened to her?
