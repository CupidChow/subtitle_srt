I'll come buy clothes from your shop
another day.

209
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,660

Don't put it that way.

219

This time, it's just pig's feet.

221

Next time, I'll transport something else
and make more money.

222

Anyway, this business is dangerous.

Don't do it again.

and getting by.

572
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,440
We just want to survive.

573
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,710
If things were so good with Ni Xiangdong,

574
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,280
why did you

575
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,630
end up with Cao Xiaojun

576
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,650
and even marry him?

577
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,550
Even the sweetest candy

578
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,520
will eventually turn bitter

579
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,890
if overcooked.

580
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,010
Close that door properly.

581
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,680
The light is making it hard to see the TV.

582
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,320
I'm going out for a while.

583
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,070
Don't wait up for me tonight.

584
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,270
I might not come back.

585
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,280
Where are you going?

586
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,320
Dinner is ready.

587
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,080
I'm going out.

588
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,280
A friend needs to see me.

589
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,280
You're going to see
the person surnamed Liang again?

590
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,840
When did I say that?

591
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,760
A friend of mine needs to see me.

592
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
You've gambled away your motorbike.

593
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,900
They lent you money to gamble.

594
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,150
It's obviously a trap.

595
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,920
Are you stupid?

596
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,230
And you're walking right into it!

597
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,480
When did I gamble?

598
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,320
I'm going out to make money!

599
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,710
Who's going to support you
if I don't make money?

600
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,800
You're not going!

601
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,280
Stupid!

602
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,250
Don't go!

603
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,000
Can you just stay put for one day?

604
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,400
What are you trying to do?

605
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,880
I need to go out for a bit!

606
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,710
Yet you won't let me!

607
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,240
My period

608
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,590
is late.

609
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,000
What's late?

610
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,630
I thought I couldn't get pregnant anymore.

611
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,880
Uncle Chen has been arrested.

612
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,230
One after another.

613
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,030
It never ends.

614
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,640
How will we raise our child if it's born?

615
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,330
It's not the right time.

616
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,280
Well, tomorrow morning,

617
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,800
I'll come and take you

618
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
to the clinic

619
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,090
to get an abortion.

620
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,920
Ximei, are you okay?

621
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,760
You shouldn't smoke.

622
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,730
I'm having an abortion anyway.

623
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,770
It doesn't matter.

624
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,230
Uncle Chen once said

625
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,280
I had been through too much,

626
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,080
and my body had long been ruined.

627
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,110
This might be

628
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,360
my last child.

629
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,960
If you really want this baby,

630
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,190
keep it.

631
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,630
He said...

632
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,480
Never mind him.

633
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,400
It's your body.

634
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,640
It's your decision.

635
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:59,920
I'm just a woman,

636
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,770
with little education.

637
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,400
I can't earn much money.

638
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,260
How can I raise a child?

639
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,860
If the baby is born,

640
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:21,920
I'll raise it.
