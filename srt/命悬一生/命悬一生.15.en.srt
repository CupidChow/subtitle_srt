Stalling for time now

203
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,530

208
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,080
She must be up to something,

209

and his face was smashed.

219
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,710

Having you confess

231
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,670

that you won't tell Tianbao about this?

Yes.

At that time,

238

Ni Xiangdong was already addicted
to drugs.

He often didn't come home,

240

One night he came home

242

and suddenly went crazy,

243
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,339
saying he wanted to find his gun
to settle a score with someone.

When I tried to stop him, he...

247

pinned me down on the bed

248
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,440

He stabbed him once in the back.

253

kicked Xiaojun away

lying on the floor.

259
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,640
I went to check on them

260
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,480
and found Ni Xiangdong was already dead.

261
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,170
Are you sure he was dead at the time?

262
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,860
His stomach was covered in blood.

263
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,370
Other than the wounds...

264
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,790
on his stomach and back,

265
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,670
were there wounds anywhere else?

00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,030
No.

I couldn't handle both of them.

271
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,310

272
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,640
to separate them.

273
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,010
Whoever
went to the Chengxi construction site,

274
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,640
it would buy me some time.

275

"I didn't do anything.

Then he suddenly got agitated.

285
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,330
He stabbed me with a knife.

286
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,330
I could only fight back.

287
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,200
Then I grabbed a rock

288

on the mountain.

577
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,480
You gambled that Mount Fufeng is so vast,

578
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,200
with so many rocks,

579
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,930
the police would never find it.

580
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,960
You gambled
that even if the police searched,

581
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,480
they might eventually give up

582
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,360
because the mountain is too big,
the rocks too numerous.

583
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,420
But you were wrong.

584
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,960
We police are best

585
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,500
at unraveling clues thread by thread

586
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,720
and finding a needle in a haystack.

587
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,200
The test results are conclusive.

588
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,270
The blood residue on the mountain rock

589
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,130
matches the victim's blood type.

590
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,520
The residual fibers

591
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
match those on the discovered glove.

592
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,480
Currently,

593
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,310
we are comparing the DNA on the glove

594
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,640
with the suspect's DNA.

595
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
I didn't kill him.

596
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,030
Why would I kill him?

597
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,270
We police solve cases

598
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
based on evidence

599
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,770
and thorough investigation.

600
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,000
Even without your confession,

601
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,010
as long as the evidence

602
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,880
is solid and sufficient,

603
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,750
we can still convict you.

604
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,590
Regarding the current situation,

605
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,650
I can tell you this:

606
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,550
physical evidence,

607
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,720
forensic conclusions,

608
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,050
and investigation records are complete.

609
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,450
It's enough to form

610
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,140
a complete chain of evidence.

611
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,280
You can keep saying you don't know.

612
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,280
You can say you're not sure.

613
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,440
Or you can

614
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,640
continue to remain silent

615
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,590
as you are now.

616
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:36,790
But

617
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,550
it will only affect yourself.

618
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,160
The name Xu Qingli—

619
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,810
you should know it, right?

620
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,550
So his name is Xu Qingli.

621
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,690
Now we have found

622
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,380
the real Ni Xiangdong's body.

623
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,380
Having you confess now

624
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,550
is giving you a chance

625
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,880
for leniency.

626
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,000
Tell us,

627
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,650
how did the real Ni Xiangdong die?

628
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,200
If

629
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,130
the one who died wasn't Ni Xiangdong,

630
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,800
it would be me and Cao Xiaojun.

631
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,410
Why do you say that?

632
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,930
Because Ni Xiangdong
killed someone at the time.

633
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,540
He killed someone?

634
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,790
Who did he kill?

635
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,640
Bao Desheng.

636
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
One night,

637
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,730
he came back from outside,

638
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,750
carrying a black leather bag.

639
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,310
His clothes were covered in blood.

640
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,690
Then Xiaojun checked

641
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,240
that leather bag.

642
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,560
There was a lot of money inside.

643
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,790
And the Bao family's gift receipt list.

644
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,200
Xu Qingli.

645
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,640
How was your relationship

646
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
with Cao Xiaojun?

647
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,550
We used to be friends.

648
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,470
Did he ever talk to you

649
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,550
about his past?

650
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,150
He never mentioned to you

651
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,140
he and Ni Xiangdong were sworn brothers,
did he?

652
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,020
They'd been gang members since childhood,

653
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,420
causing a lot of trouble.

654
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,410
But later,

655
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,070
Cao Xiaojun turned over a new leaf,

656
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,870
while Ni Xiangdong sank deeper,

657
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,310
ending up with a life on his hands.

658
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,770
There was no turning back.

659
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,680
Ni Xiangdong killed someone?

660
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,310
You've lived under Ni Xiangdong's name

661
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,830
for all these years.

662
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,080
Don't you know anything about him?

663
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,880
If

664
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,680
the Liu Cheng'an case hadn't happened,

665
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,200

all of Ni Xiangdong's sins

667
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,720

When that happens,

670
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,830
would you be Ni Xiangdong

or Xu Qingli?

672
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,000
I would definitely be Xu Qingli.

I am Xu Qingli.

better off without me.

763
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,740
I stabbed Ni Xiangdong to death.

764
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,940
It wasn't Xiaojun.

765
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,010
I stabbed him over a dozen times.

766
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,280
Xiaojun helped me bury the body.

767
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,920
Xiaojun was a good man.

768
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,800
I failed him.

769
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,760
I also killed Guo Adi.

770
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,440
I used a hatchet.

771
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,000
All my life,

772
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,150
I listened to my mother.

773
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,800
After my mother died,

774
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,400
I listened to my grandmother.

775
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,930
After my grandmother died,

776
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,620
I listened to my uncle.

777
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,590
After I killed Guo Adi,

778
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,760
I listened to Ni Xiangdong.

779
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,300
I thought he would love me.

780
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,940
Only Xiaojun listened to me.

781
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,400
Good and evil
always get their just retribution.

782
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,190
If I committed evil,

783
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,130
why should the retribution
fall on Tianbao?

784
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,550
This life has been so meaningless.
