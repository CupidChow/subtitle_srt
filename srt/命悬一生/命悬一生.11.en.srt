All these years of guilt in my heart

177
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,980
finally found a place to rest.

178

It's like atonement.

179
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,300
I can't help being good to him.

180
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,030

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,800
Is it possible

385
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,960
that it wasn't like what Wu Ximei said?

386
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,400
Maybe she and Ni Xiangdong

387
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,510
didn't make a clean break.

388
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,750
Maybe Ni Xiangdong

389
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,160
was dealing with something else

390
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,110
and didn't have time

391
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,320
for Wu Ximei and Cao Xiaojun,

392
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,930
give them the opportunity.

393
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,070
Is that possible?

394
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,680
But there's another thing
that doesn't add up.

395
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,510
Someone like Cao Xiaojun,

396
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,750
in and out of jail a few times,

397
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,750
turning over a new leaf after release

398
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,830
is somewhat understandable.

399
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,350
But Ni Xiangdong

400
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,510
was always lawless.

401
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,010
How did he get so lucky,

402
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,590
suddenly going quiet

403
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,190
right before the crackdown?

404
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,400
The estimated age of the body

405
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,030
found in Nanyang

406
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,690
is between 20 and 25 years old.

407
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,640
Ni Xiangdong

408
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,830
was born in 1978.

409
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,200
If Wu Ximei wasn't lying,

410
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,480
Ni Xiangdong

411
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,940
really is Cao Tianbao's biological father.

412
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,720
In 2003,

413
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,130
Ni Xiangdong was exactly 25 years old.

414
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,240
That matches the estimated age

415
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,400
of the body found in Nanyang.

416
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,080
The timing of his disappearance

417
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,070
aligns with the timing

418
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,480
of the Bao Desheng

419
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,570
and Xu Qingli case.

420
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,920
Combined with all the suspicious points

421
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
about the Ni Xiangdong in Weihai...

422
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,150
I have a rather bold theory.

423
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,610
Girl.

424
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,200
My name is Ni Xiangdong.

425
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,600
My name is Ni Xiangdong.

426
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,820
Wu Ximei has been misleading us,

427
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,050
making us believe

428
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,340
that Xu Qingli in Weihai is Ni Xiangdong.

429
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,640
In fact, the Ni Xiangdong in Weihai

430
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,940
is actually Xu Qingli.

431
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,620
The corpse in Nanyang

432
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,590
is Cao Tianbao's biological father.

433
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,370
He is the real...

434
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,310
Ni Xiangdong?

435
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,410
Xiangdong,

436
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,330
if we have a child,

437
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,310
would you want a son

438
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,960
or a daughter?

439
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,270
Of course a son.

440
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,550
I, Ni Xiangdong,

441
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,880
will surely have a son.

442
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,720
If it's a son,

443
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,160
I'll take him to fish,

444
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,720
play soccer,

445
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,160
and fight.

446
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,070
No.

447
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,070
No fighting.

448
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,570
My son would definitely be a handful.

449
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,770
Forget it. I'd rather have a daughter.

450
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,810
Our daughter will be as pretty as you.

451
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,800
No more smoking from now on.

452
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,130
I, Ni Xiangdong, am going to be a father!

453
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,750
Get in there!

454
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,610
Where is Ni Xiangdong?

455
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,220
Harm should not reach wives or children.

456
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,000
But Ni Xiangdong broke the rule first.

457
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,760
My son's head

458
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,920
took 17 stitches.

459
00:24:59,270 --> 00:24:59,920
Tell me,

460
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,920
what should I do

461
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,880
about this?

462
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,060
Tell Ni Xiangdong to meet me

463
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,300
at the usual place.

464
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,810
I'll be waiting for him.

465
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,500
You take her to Uncle Chen's place first.

466
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,880
[Pharaoh's]

467
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,480
Where's Kan Laosan?

468
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,770
Kan Laosan, get down here!

469
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,960
Ni.

470
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,880
Master Bao?

471
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,400
True martial virtue
lies in ceasing strife.

472
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,600
There is never an end of taking revenge.

473
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,030
Harmony brings prosperity.

474
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,570
Come up here.

475
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,070
The three of us will talk properly.

476
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,790
In front of all these men,

477
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,550
if we lay everything bare,

478
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,640
you'll lose face,

479
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,350
and so will he.

480
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,680
Fine.

481
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,890
You guys wait here.

482
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,570
Harm should not reach wives or children.

483
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,720
You

484
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,200
hacked Mr. Kan's son.

485
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,070
You broke the rule first.

486
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,550
Kan,

487
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,590
what you did

488
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,930
was also a bit too much.

489
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,110
You two,

490
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,850
stop fighting,

491
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,640
alright?

492
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,820
Shake hands.

493
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,440
Dong!

494
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,110
Dong!

495
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,200
Dong!

496
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,000
Alright, enough!

497
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,590
Young man,

498
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,220
you're hot-tempered.

499
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,980
I told you not to use violence,

500
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,510
but you insisted!

501
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,000
Courtesy before violence.

502
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,510
I've

503
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,550
shown you courtesy.

504
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,790
Kan Laosan,

505
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,880
you took my child from me!

506
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,100
I'll kill you sooner or later.

507
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,770
That is over-the-top.

508
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,700
If you don't have what it takes,

509
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,350
don't pretend to be a boss.

510
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,590
Your wife is unlucky,

511
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,350
stuck with a coward like you.

512
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,240
Beat him!

513
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,070
[No littering]

514
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,830
Xiangdong.

515
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,640
Liang Da.

516
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,330
How did you get beaten up like this?

517
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,090
Stop the bleeding.

518
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,590
Xiangdong.

519
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,590
Do you know

520
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,200
why the guys you brought

521
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,790
abandoned you

522
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,590
and ran away?

523
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,750
They're all useless.

524
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,880
It's not about being useless.

525
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,400
They came with you for so little pay.

526
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,120
If things got physical,

527
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,400
best case, they'd end up in jail.

528
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,440
Worst case, they'd be in the hospital.

529
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,680
It's not worth it.

530
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,400
In this business,

531
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,680
what do we rely on?

532
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,960
Connections.

533
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,240
Kan Laosan

534
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,510
knows how to play the game
better than you.

535
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,110
He's got connections with the Bao family
in the north of the city.

536
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,030
Don't be rash! Don't be rash!

537
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,930
After him! After him!

538
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,110
Stop!

539
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,510
Stop!

540
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,390
Stop running!

541
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,350
Stop running!

542
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,810
Still want to fight?

543
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,830
How many lives do you think you have?

544
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,870
Use your brain in this business!

545
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,680
He's got the Bao family backing him.

546
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,680
And you?

547
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,040
You've got the Liang family!

548
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,540
Losing the baby is a good thing.

549
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,000
Why insist on bringing a child into this,

550
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,200
just to be trampled on

551
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,150
like you?

552
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,880
You've been in this business long enough.

553
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,010
You should know how things work by now!

554
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,000
This time,

555
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,020
it did a lot of damage to your body.

556
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,040
In the future,

557
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,640
you might not be able

558
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,110
to get pregnant again.

559
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,000
Accept your fate.

560
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,680
Where's your man?

561
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:14,630
Let's go.

562
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,620
Are you hungry?

563
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,400
Let's go.

564
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,790
I'll make you a bowl of noodles
when we get home.

565
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:37,960
You kept man!

566
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,630
I'm calling you a kept man.

567
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,320
Can't you hear me?

568
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,030
You kept man!

569
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,480
You kept man! You kept man!

570
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,120
You kept man!

571
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,840
Is she yours? Is she yours?

572
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,610
I will kill you!

573
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,930
I'll be waiting! Come on!

574
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,180
Dogs with tails strut,

575
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,960
and so do dogs without!

576
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,020
Alright, alright!

577
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,470
Everyone, let's continue drinking!

578
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,560
[Pharaoh's]

579
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,090
Sir. Sir.

580
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,070
Don't get your white shirt dirty.

581
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,840
Wipe it off.

582
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,840
Thanks, bro.

583
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,630
Sir, where are you heading?

584
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,550
Want a motorcycle ride?

585
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,360
Motorcycle?

586
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:20,920
Where's the motorcycle?

587
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,630
Right here.

588
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,400
Sure.

589
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,480
A ride on your bike sounds nice.

590
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:27,880
Okay.

591
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,550
Otherwise, if I take a car,

592
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,880
I might puke all over it.

593
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,230
Come on. Where to?

594
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,580
To... To Fucheng Garden.

595
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,330
Alright.

596
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,070
Baozhen wants me home before midnight.

597
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,370
Sorry, sir.

598
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,250
Did I wake you?

599
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,230
The road is too bumpy.

600
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,380
Where am I?

601
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,490
I need to get to Fucheng Garden.

602
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,550
This is the old bridge!

603
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,920
We shouldn't be passing the old bridge!

604
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,940
Fine, I won't charge you.

605
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,030
We're almost there.

606
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,840
Stop!

607
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,030
Stop!

608
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,590
Stop!

609
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,370
I want to go to Fucheng Garden.

610
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,460
Why did you bring me to the old bridge?

611
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,740
Don't you know the way?

612
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,680
Sir,

613
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,590
today's your wedding day.

614
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,070
Don't get so angry.

615
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,070
You must've received

616
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,600
a lot of money from the guests
at your wedding.

617
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,320
Help!

618
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,440
Help me!

619
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,630
Help!

620
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,190
You want money?

621
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,660
I'll give you all my money!

622
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,820
Please let me go!

623
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,070
Weren't you just teaching someone

624
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,070
where to stab?

625
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,570
Teach me too.

626
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,190
Lots of guts here, right?

627
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,120
Please let me go!

628
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,150
Help!

629
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,020
Save me!

630
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,150
Think you're special because you're rich?

631
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,350
You're such a coward!

632
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,510
Dong.

633
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,560
Lock the door.

634
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,500
Xiangdong.

635
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,140
Xiangdong!

636
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,590
Where did you go?

637
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:10,870
Xiangdong!

638
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,670
You're scaring me.

639
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,480
Ni Xiangdong.

640
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,880
Are you okay?

641
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,670
Where exactly did you go?

642
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,110
Xiangdong.

643
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,750
Xiangdong!

644
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,660
Xiangdong.

645
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,880
Dong.

646
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,110
I'm so cold.

647
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,690
Get me a blanket.

648
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,510
Where did you go?

649
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,520
Why are you cold?

650
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,760
[Zeng's]

651
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:33,800
[Roast duck, pig ears]

652
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,280
What do you need?

653
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,110
This, this,

654
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,190
and that chicken.

655
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:36,710
Okay.

656
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
It's for 3 people.

657
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,170
Okay.

658
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,000
Come with me.

659
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,630
In broad daylight,

660
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,480
I won't hurt you.

661
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,160
I just want to ask you something.

662
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,720
Get in the car.

663
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,880
I'll come back for it later.

664
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,360
Okay.
