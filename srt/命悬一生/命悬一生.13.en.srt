00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,290
You need to hurry up.

192
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,310
Okay.

193
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,830
Here's the key.

194
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,180

196
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,510
I'll go find a job.

197
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,480

203
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,350
I couldn't find you.

205
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,960

[Emergency Department]

212
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,510
My child has always
had digestive problems.

213
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,350
We've been to the hospital before.

214
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,960
They said it was some kind of enteritis.

215
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,560
He's been taking medicine all along.

216
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,250
But he just won't fully recover.

[Name: Cao Tianbao]

218
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,260
This isn't just ordinary enteritis.

219
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,750
[Terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, rectum,
and hepatic flexure of the colon.]

220
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,290
It's a rare condition.

221
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,070
Of course,

222
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,400
there's no definitive diagnosis yet.

223
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,510
Once the diagnosis is confirmed,

224
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,710
it can be a bit tricky.

225
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,010
Let's take an X-ray first.

226
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,140
Run some tests.

227
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,750
We'll take another look at your child's

228
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,280
previous medical records.

229
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,290
Actually, I'm quite afraid of hospitals.

230
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,830
When my mother
was giving birth to my little sister,

231
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,160
she hemorrhaged badly.

232
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,260
They couldn't stop the bleeding.

233
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,690
I was still very young then,

234
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,100
just standing there helplessly.

235
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,590
I only remember

236
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,030
my mother was crying.

237
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,160
Mother cried,

238
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,500
and I cried too.

239
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,590
Her hand

240
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,850
was holding mine so tightly at that time.

241
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,270
I was thinking—

242
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,280
my mom was

243
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,880
always so gentle,

244
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,420
yet her grip was surprisingly strong.

245
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,880
Then,

246
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,170
her hand

247
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,920
gradually grew cold.

248
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,910
No matter how I
tried to warm it, I couldn't.

249
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,200
One year later,

250
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,480
that man remarried.

251
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,270
Another year passed.

252
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,880
They had a son of their own.

253
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
That man

254
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,560
went to work in another city.

255
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,000
He told others

256
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,090
he doesn't like having anyone at home
controlling him.

257
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,350
It's strange.

258
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,160
You don't like being controlled,

259
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,760
so why do you keep
marrying one woman after another?

260
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,780
He never sent money back home.

261
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,440
Life was hard.
That woman had it rough too,

262
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,970
so young yet having
to take care of three kids.

263
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,720
Later,

264
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,530
my little sister got sick.

265
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,850
We had no money for medical treatment.

266
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,610
We could only give her blessed water.

267
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,030
On the day of my sister's burial,

268
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,720
that man finally showed up,

269
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,510
reeking of alcohol.

270
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,240
He was arguing with that woman,

271
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,270
accusing her of killing

272
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,200
his own child.

273
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,550
But the one who killed my little sister

274
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,750
was clearly him.

275
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,100
I rushed over and fought with him.

276
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,120
He beat me mercilessly too.

277
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,510
I grabbed something

278
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,750
and threw it at him.

279
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,440
I only remember

280
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,350
he let out a terrible scream.

281
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,400
Then his eye

282
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,750
started bleeding.

283
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,360
I was terrified,

284
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,350
so I ran away.

285
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,650
I ran into the woods

286
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,740
and wandered for two days and nights.

287
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,510
Later,

288
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,790
Grandpa found me.

289
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,160
And then,

290
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,030
Grandpa passed away.

291
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,830
I had no family left.

292
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm not afraid of hardships

293
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,920
or death.

294
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
I'm only afraid of not having a home.

295
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,680
Ximei. Don't worry.

296
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,160

298
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,840

301

302
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,360
Right.

303
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,110
Why?

304
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,720
The route is cut off.

305
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,030

306
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,550

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,370
faces the mountain.

382
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:23,880
In winter,

383
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
there's no heating here.

384
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,140
We sealed it up before,

385
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,810
but someone opened it.

386
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,920
What's behind here?

387
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,110
Mount Fufeng.

388
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,880
How long does it take to reach the top?

389
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,270
If you drive to Mount Fufeng scenic area,

390
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,370
it takes about 20 minutes.

391
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,370
But this area is the back mountain.

392
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,510
Here?

393
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,640
How long to reach
the top of the back mountain?

394
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,310
The back mountain

395
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,170
is much closer.

396
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,540
If you walk,

397
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
about 10 minutes.

398
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,200
Mentor.

399
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,310
There's a small path up there.

400
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,240
You could make it up with your legs.

401
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,240
There are wild mountains behind here.

402
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,030
Usually there aren't many people

403
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,890
going that way.

404
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,510
Hello.

405
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:01,920
Hello.

406
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,130
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

407
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,160
Sure.

408
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,030
What time did you finish work last Friday?

409
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,940
5:30.

410
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,830
When you finished work,

411
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,160
what was Wu Ximei doing?

412
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,200
She should have been
in the Janitor's Room.

413
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,590
At that time

414
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,590
she should have finished cleaning.

415
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,410
When was

416
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,370
the last time you saw her

417
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,090
that day?

418
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,790
That day,

419
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,280
I got home and

420
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,790
I found that I didn't
bring my USB drive with me.

421
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,310
I was worried about
delaying my weekend work,

422
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,030
so I biked back to the office to get it.

423
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,810
When I got the USB drive,

424
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,650
Ms. Wu

425
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,270
was just coming out of the Janitor's Room.

426
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,770
She was probably getting ready to leave.

427
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,830
What time was it?

428
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,830
After 6.

429
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,590
That fits.

430
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,020
Those photos

431
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,780
were almost certainly

432
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,780
taken by Wu Ximei.

433
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,840
There're...

434
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,110
There're cameras upstairs.

435
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,070
The metadata on the photos

436
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,620
matches the camera model.

437
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,680
She had plenty of time

438
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,310
to take the photos and come back.

439
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,160
So Wu Ximei

440
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,760
deliberately ran into her colleague

441
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,310
to get an alibi.

442
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,440
But isn't that too coincidental?

443
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,160
That's not important.

444
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,880
Let me tell you.

445
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,410
There are security cameras

446
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,030
on the main road

447
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,520
that can prove

448
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,350
when she left.

449
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,790
She might have just taken a chance

450
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,310
and happened to run into someone.

451
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,350
Take that ear, for example.

452
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,550
Could you have predicted

453
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,070
it would fall into the drain downstairs,

454
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,590
clog it up,

455
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,070
and someone would
find it and call the police?

456
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,790
No way.

457
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,310
Besides,

458
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,960
even if the person downstairs

459
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,120
hadn't found the ear, it wouldn't matter.

460
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,310
She could have reported it herself,

461
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,040
saying Cao Xiaojun was missing

462
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
and she couldn't find him,

463
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,640
then she could have led us to the place.

464
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,840
The neighbor finding

465
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,550
the ear

466
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,160
at that time —
wasn't that also unexpected?

467
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,920
More or less.

468
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,420
Everything Wu Ximei did afterward

469
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,200
was probably just

470
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,330
to cover up this unexpected event.

471
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,720
She adapted to the situation.

472
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,880
So even the memory card

473
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,680
being delivered to the neighbor

474
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,960
was planned in advance.

475
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,160
The goal was to have an uninvolved person

476
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,290
deliver the evidence to us.

477
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:40,720
Right.

478
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,480
More natural

479
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,540
and more credible.

480
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,750
These two went to great lengths

481
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,280
to commit insurance fraud.

482
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,810
If Ni Xiangdong had died on Mount Fufeng,

483
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,550
they would have received

484
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,750
his insurance money.

485
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,960
Then if Cao Xiaojun hid for a few years,

486
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,440
he'd be declared missing.

487
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,400
And they would also get

488
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,790
Cao Xiaojun's insurance money.

489
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,750
But for all her calculations,

490
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,410
she didn't account
for Liu Cheng'an showing up.

491
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,800
Wu Ximei is quite something.

492
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,160
I think Cao Xiaojun is quite clever.

493
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,000
That ear was most likely

494
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,060
cut off by himself.

495
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,640
Losing so much blood,

496
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,710
and being locked in that box,

497
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,920
he could have suffocated.

498
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,880
It wouldn't matter if he died.

499
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,420
Cao Xiaojun already had it planned out.

500
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,030
The insurance money

501
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,490
was meant for Cao Tianbao.

502
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,480
If something happened to him,

503
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:17,950
this money

504
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,270
would be enough for Wu Ximei and the child

505
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:19,980
to get by.

506
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,400

Yes. Find Chu Xiao.

Look into this person Tian Baozhen.

516
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,420
Why investigate her?

517
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,660
Ni Xiangdong didn't run away.

518
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,920
There must be a reason.

519
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,330
Indeed.

520
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,240
If

521
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,000
Ni Xiangdong from Weihai

522
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,270
is actually Xu Qingli,

523
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:50,790
then the people he's looking for

524
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,790
might not just be

525
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,280
Cao Xiaojun and Wu Ximei,

526
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,620
but possibly also

527
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,400
his childhood sweetheart Tian Baozhen.

528
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,440
We've already visited

529
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,550
the bookstore

530
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,920
that Ni Xiangdong
went to, Captain Ma and I.

531
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,880
The owner, Zhen,

532
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,160
is indeed from Nanyang,

533
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,110
but her real name is Li Yizhen.

534
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,920
So sending money to Xu Caizeng

535
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,850
makes sense now.

536
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,400
We still need evidence.

537
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,800
Let's wait for Xia Jie's DNA

538

comparison results before we decide.

539
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,150
But there are still things
that don't add up.

540
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,360
If he is Xu Qingli,

541
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,550
why would he name

542
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,320
Cao Tianbao as his insurance beneficiary?

543
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,130
Why are Cao Xiaojun and Wu Ximei

544
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,070
so familiar

545
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,760
with the insurance process?

what Sun Chuanhai said back then?

548
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,070
But I had no idea
how to handle the insurance

549
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,060
or who to contact

and the insurance company

00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,440

00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,360
Come, put on your clothes.

571
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,900
The surname Ni is quite rare,

572
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,670
but in Mang Village,

573
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,190
it's actually a common surname.

574
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:36,510
Ye, Xiang, Rong, Yong, and Chuan.

575
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:37,950
So your father

576
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,820
should be from the Ye generation.

577
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,870
Hearing our hometown dialect

578
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,030
feels

579
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,100
so familiar.

580
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,760
Aren't we brothers?

581
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,090
Since we are brothers,

582
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,340
don't lie to me.

583
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,000
Tell me,

584
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,890
where are you really staying now?

585
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,730
[Death Beneficiary: Cao Tianbao]

586
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,380
[Name: Ni Xiangdong]

587
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,670
Ni Xiangdong.

588
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,030
[Xu Qingli]

589
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,510
What did I do wrong?

590
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,180
What did I do wrong?

591
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,760
Cao Xiaojun.

592
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,960
Wu Ximei.

593
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,040
I am

594
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,840
Xu Qingli!

595
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,360
What are you doing?

596
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,200
Who are you?

597
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:28,890
Get inside!

598
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,520
Don't be afraid.

599
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,040
I need to ask you something.

600
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,790
You must answer me honestly.

601
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,710
Wu Ximei.

602
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,940
Do you remember this name?

603
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,360
She called just a few days ago.

604
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,490
She asked about

605
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,650
the insurance matter.

606
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,790
A few days ago?

607
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,050
What exactly did she ask about?

608
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:57,880
Well, well...

609
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,840
About her husband's

610
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,720
disappearance insurance claim.

611
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,700
Did they get the money?

612
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,760
Of course not.

613
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:09,410
It doesn't meet the claim requirements.

614
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,890
Let me tell you something.

615
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,610
Cao Xiaojun isn't dead at all.

616
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,440
Shouldn't you

617
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,510
report this matter

618
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,800
to the police?
