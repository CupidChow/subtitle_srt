you're from Jialin.

There aren't

many people in Nanyang,

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,070
so it's quite by destiny that you could

87
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,950
meet in Weihai.

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,310

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,480

00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,740
it would be so amazing.

91
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,140
The first time I saw you,

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,470
I felt a connection.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,290
And when you spoke to me,

94
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,020
hearing our hometown dialect,

95
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,760
it really gave me

96
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,750
that feeling of

97
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,830
familiarity.

98
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,510
That's nonsense.

99
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,150
The first time

100
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,870
I talked to him,

101
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,190
he completely ignored me.

102
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,190
Not at all.

103
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,270

104
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,800
who doesn't like talking

105
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,510

106
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,130
Mr. Ni,

107
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,690
how did you get that scar

108
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,630
on your face?

109
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,680
When I was a kid,

110
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,240
my dad was tending a fire.

111
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,200
I was being naughty,

112
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,810
ran over to mess around,

113
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,050
and got burned.

114
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,520
Back then in the village,

115
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,260
we didn't have much medicine,

116
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,270
so it left

117
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,000
this big scar.

118
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,120
Does it look bad?

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,750
Not at all.

120
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,320
When I was young, the elders used to say

121
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,970
that eyebrow area represents brotherhood.

122
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,900
I don't really know what it means.

123
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,470
Xiaojun, do you know?

124
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,560
Isn't it that

125
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,750
if your eyebrows are injured,

126
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,240
it will harm your brothers?

127
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,560
Isn't that what it means?

128
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,820
The brotherhood area.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,680
Is that so?

130
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,120
I don't think it's a brotherhood area.

131
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,190
It's more like a marriage area.

132
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,480
At my age,

133
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,980
I don't even have a wife.

134
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,080
I don't think it's ugly.

135
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,560
It's very masculine.

136
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,159
Brother,

137
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,700

143
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,830
No, no. I should toast to you.

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,480
Are you a fool?

149
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,560
What were you thinking,

150
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,360
bringing a stranger to our home?

151
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
He has nowhere to stay now.

152
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,010
Besides,

153
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,630
he's helped us before.

154
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,240
That's not how you repay someone.

155
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,320
What did he do before?

156
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,980
Do we know anything about him?

157
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,720
How dare you?

158
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,360
It's just for a few days.

159
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,750
Tomorrow you need to tell him

160
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,540
that this is our situation

161
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,360
and he can't stay long.

162
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,910
Keep your voice down.

163
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,910
He's gone?

164
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,510
This money was left by him?

165
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,120
Xiaojun.

166
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,510
You're up?

167
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,550
You were staying here just fine.

168
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,080
Why did you suddenly leave?

169
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,550
This morning,

170
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,080
a friend

171
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,340
introduced me to a job.

172
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,950
The boss was pushing hard

173
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,150
and wanted me to report immediately.

174
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,750
When I left,

175
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,670
you weren't up yet,

176
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,870
so I didn't wake you.

177
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,370
Don't worry.

178
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,900
The job is good.

179
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,630
Meals and accommodation included.

180
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,090
Really.

181
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,270
I won't trouble you anymore.

182
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,270
Come back.

183
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,190
Really, don't worry about me.

184
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,790
I'll remember your kindness to me

185
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,840
in my heart.

186
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,240
Let me make some money first.

187
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,700
When I earn enough,
I'll come back to see you.

188
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,080
Aren't we brothers?

189
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,720
Yes,

190
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,720
of course we are.

191
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,940
Good brothers.

192
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,200
Since we are brothers,

193
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,360
don't lie to me.

194
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,720
Tell me,

195
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,610
where are you really staying now?

196
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,820
Xiangdong,

197
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,480
if you don't want to stay here,

198
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,320
I can take you to a place

199
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,780
where you can settle down.

200
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,670
The winter here is not like Nanyang.

201
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,960
You could freeze to death

202
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,420
without a place to live in.

203
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,360
Well,

204
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,840
alright.

205
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,080
What about my job then?

206
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,440
Nagging.

207
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,510
I'll wait for you at home.

208
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,080
Hurry up.

209
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,600
Okay.

210
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,150
This way.

211
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,750
Come in.

212
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,270
Ocean view.

213
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,320
Three bedrooms and one living room.

214
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,390
Good ventilation.

215
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,910
The only drawback

216
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,910
is there's no water or electricity.

217
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,030
Let me tell you,

218
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
about this place,

219
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:39,800
before,

220
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,790
I was working at a recycling station,

221
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,440
and then

222
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,630
it was demolished.

223
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,250
So I collected some old furniture

224
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,750
and took over this place.

225
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,750
Thought it might be useful someday.

226
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,080
There's no security around here.

227
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,150
If you need water,

228
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,990
go east.

229
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,630
There's a public toilet
about 300 meters away.

230
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,670
When nobody's there,

231
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,670
you can get some water.

232
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,750
If someone's there,

233
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,240
you can give him 1 yuan.

234
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,960
That'll do.

235
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,550
Another thing is

236
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,870
the windows.

237
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,610
I've sealed them all

238
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,790
with this plastic sheeting.

239
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,450
But I think

240
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,240
you should still get some

241
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,240
firewood.

242
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,720
There's some over there.

243
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,810
After you light it,

244
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,400
it won't be so cold at night.

245
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,770
Daytime is fine though.

246
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,790
Xiaojun.

247
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,040
What else do you need?

248
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Since I left Nanyang until now,

249
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,600
this is the first time I've met

250
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,060
such kind people like you.

251
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,150
Thank you.

252
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,720
Brothers look out for each other.

253
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
You said that.

254
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,870
This one has peanut and sesame filling.

255
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,440
It's still not as good as

256
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,320
the coconut filling back home.

257
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,910
Sun told me,

258
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,030
Wang Cheng from the construction site,

259
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,790
that boss,

260
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,280
got arrested again.

261
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,030
The wages are gone again.

262
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,540
It's okay.

263
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,600
That place in Yongshuo is not bad.

264
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,120
If we can't afford the rent,

265
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,360
we can move there.

266
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,450
Let's drink.

267
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,720
Cheers.

268
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,920
We should be happy during the festival.

269
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,240
Forget about that.

270
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,320
Let's be happy.

271
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,500
Xiangdong,

272
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
can you drive?

273
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,960
What's up?

274
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,100
No, I can't.

275
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,670
I found a moving job.

276
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,240
Paid daily.

277
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,060
We need one more person.

278
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,550
Want to join?

279
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,200
Sure.

280
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,840
Great.

281
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,030
We'll work with them

282
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,000
for a while,

283
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,700
continuously for ten days or half a month.

284
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,800
Let's figure out

285
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,720
how the moving business works.

286
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,510
Then we can save money

287
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,470
to buy a used truck

288
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,000
and start our own business.

289
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,970
I've already thought of a name.

290
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,890
It'll be called

291
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,390
Brothers Moving.

292
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,000
How about that?

293
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,790
Sounds good.

294
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,600
Brothers Moving.

295
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,080
Where are Tianbao and Ximei?

296
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,200
Tianbao, come out!

297
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,240
Happy birthday to you.

298
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,390
Happy birthday to you.

299
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,120
Happy birthday to you.

300
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:03,750
Happy birthday to you.

301
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,630
Uncle Ni, happy birthday.

302
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,560
Xiangdong, happy birthday.

303
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,750
Happy birthday.

304
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,010
What's all this?

305
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,480
You told me before.

306
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,320
I remember.

307
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,060
Tianbao told us,

308
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,320
so I know

309
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,550
your birthday

310
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,360
is on the Lantern Festival.

311
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,260
So today we

312
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,870
want to celebrate with you.

313
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,150
Thank you.

314
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,870
Thank you all.

315
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,270
Thanks.

316
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,370
What's next?

317
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,000
Make a wish. Now.

318
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,150
Make a wish now.

319
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,960
Make a wish.

320
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,720
Make a wish.

321
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,680
What wish should I make?

322
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,750
I wish we...

323
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,720
You can't say it out loud,

324
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,160
or it won't come true.

325
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,110
Uncle Ni,

326
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,400
why are you crying?

327
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,030
Who's crying?

328
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,550
You're mistaken.

329
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,480
I wish we...

330
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,790
Xiaojun.

331
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,290
Xiaojun, what's wrong?

332
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,110
Xiaojun.

333
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,550
Why are you here?

334
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,270
You're hurt?

335
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,980
Where are you hurt?

336
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,110
Where?

337
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,960
Let me see.

338
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,590
I'm fine.

339
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,510
I'm okay.

340
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,670
Why are you here?

341
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,210
It's nothing.

342
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,720
You called me

343
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,790
but you didn't say anything.

344
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,510
I was worried about you,

345
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,440
so I came over.

346
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,890
What are you looking for?

347
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,690
What's wrong?

348
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,720
My phone.

349
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,940
I think I lost my phone.

350
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,050
Wasn't it you who called me?

351
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,730
That person isn't dead?

352
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,550
Is he dead or not?

353
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,310
That's impossible.

354
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,130
It's clearly...

355
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,270
Ximei.

356
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,890
It's not safe here anymore.

357
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,320
We need to leave quickly.

358
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,740
How's it going with the insurance?

359
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,000
Missing for less than 4 years

360
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,730
can't get a death certificate.

361
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,810
The insurance company

362
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,420
says it doesn't meet
the compensation conditions.

363
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,710
What should we do?

364
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,560
What should we do, Xiaojun?

365
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,630
What if...

366
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,800
What if the police find out?

367
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,100
Let's run away.

368
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,130
Let's go somewhere else first.

369
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,610
Our lives are at stake.

370
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,030
We can run,

371
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,960
but what about Tianbao's illness?

372
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,550
Jiaonan.

373
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,330
Let's go to Jiaonan.

374
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,240
In Jiaonan,

375
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,970
there should be a way
to cure Tianbao's illness.

376
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,950
I've told you before.

377
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,990
Even if I have to sell my blood or organs,

378
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,680
I'll save Tianbao's life.

379
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,420
Let's leave Weihai first.

380
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,350
Early tomorrow morning,

381
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,810
I'll go find the boat boss.

382
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,270
I'm so tired, Xiaojun.

383
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,640
I don't want to keep running anymore.

384
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,970
When will this end?

385
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,970
Don't be afraid, Ximei.

386
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,200
No matter what happens,

387
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,590
I'll always be with you.

388
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,880
I'll stay by your side.

389
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,640
How did we end up like this?

390
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,500
How did we

391
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,550
come to this?

392
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,960
[Fortune]

393
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,750
Coming.

394
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:22,960
Ximei.

395
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,240
You don't need

396
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,300
to bring anything.

397
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,110
It's so hot today,

398
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,160
and I have to trouble you.

399
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,620
Ximei.

400
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,680
Give it to me.

401
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,720
Ms. Li.

402
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,160
Give it to me.

403
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,880
Ximei, do you have any vinegar?

404
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,650
Where's Tianbao?

405
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,500
Yes, I do.

406
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,260
Tianbao,

407
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,840
did you miss me?

408
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,070
Here you go.

409
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,790
I'll return it to you tomorrow.

410
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,190
It's fine. It's nothing.

411
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,310
Thank you.

412
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,930
Xiaojun.

413
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,880
Ni's already here.

414
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,480
-What is this?
-You're here.

415
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,480
Tianbao,

416
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,810
you asked for things from Uncle Ni again.

417
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,510
I said I would treat you.

418
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,590
Eating at your place is one thing,

419
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,270
but you've bought so many things.

420
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,480
You always buy toys for Tianbao,

421
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:53,960
and snacks.

422
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,000
We just bought some food and drinks.

423
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,880
What's wrong with that?

424
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,550
Besides, you like this wine too.

425
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,310
I'm willing.

426
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,160
Okay?

427
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,090
-Have a seat.
-Sit.

428
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,790
I'll go make dinner.

429
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,440
Okay.

430
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Which one do you like?

431
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,820
I like this one.

432
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,790
Do you remember

433
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,270
the boss of that moving company

434
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,800
when we first started moving business?

435
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,010
Mr. Wang?

436
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,630
What? Are you still in touch?

437
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,430
No.

438
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,850
I just saw their moving truck today.

439
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,490
Hu was still driving.

440
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,030
I just chatted with him briefly.

441
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,240
Hu told me that...

442
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,590
Mr. Wang's nephew died.

443
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,030
Died?

444
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,240
Yes.

445
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:33,840
Tianbao,

446
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,780
go play by yourself inside, okay?

447
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,270
Tianbao.

448
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,360
Give me a kiss.

449
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,070
How did he die?

450
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,030
I still remember

451
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,350
his nephew's nickname,

452
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,200
Lei.

453
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,160
Lei.

454
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,350
He was quite tall

455
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
with yellow hair.

456
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,640
He drove a small car,

457
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,920
revving the engine all day,

458
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,920
always racing.

459
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,960
Nearly knocked me down once.

460
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,240
Yeah.

461
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,550
He just

462
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,920
crashed while racing,

463
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,550
hitting a truck carrying steel bars.

464
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,400
From his chest to his back,

465
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,230
he was completely
impaled by the steel bar.

466
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,480
A hole this big.

467
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,160
Terrible.

468
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,680
The morning of the day
he had the accident,

469
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,890
Lei took his cousin

470
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,200
to that tattoo parlor,

471
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,510
and it happened that evening.

472
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,270
You know why?

473
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,560
He got a tattoo of
something he shouldn't have.

474
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,830
He tattooed Guangong.

475
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,440
Guangong.

476
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,970
You know where

477
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,070
his wound was?

478
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Right on Guangong's head.

479
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,460
Isn't that creepy?

480
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,630
It's just superstition, of course.

481
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,690
Let's not talk about it anymore.

482
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,000
Respect the dead.

483
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,440
Cheers.

484
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,030
Therefore,

485
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,310
when we drive in the future,

486
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,640
we must pay attention to safety.

487
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,410
Speaking of Guangong,

488
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,610
I remember something.

489
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,820
Do you want to hear it?

490
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,950
Tell me.

491
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's also creepy.

492
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,030
Many years ago,

493
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,960
one night

494
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,070
in the forest,

495
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,920
there was a man

496
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,370
and a woman.

497
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
What were they doing?

498
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,270
That man and woman

499
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,880
were digging a hole.

500
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,740
Digging a hole?

501
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,240
Do you know what

502
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,170
they were doing?

503
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:09,920
What?

504
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
Burying the body.

505
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:22,970
You know,

506
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,110
why I thought of Guangong

507
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,510
when telling this story?

508
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,760
The man who was burying the body

509
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,920
had a tattoo

510
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,860
of Guangong on his back.

511
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,130
Back then,

512
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,510
didn't those gangsters

513
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,480
all

514
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,070
copy those triad members and get tattoos?

515
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,510
Either Guangong or dragons.

516
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,110
Seven or eight out of ten

517
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,310
would get Guangong tattoos.

518
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,510
No,

519
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,070
his Guangong tattoo

520
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,000
wasn't an ordinary one.

521
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,640
He had a tattoo of Guangong
with open eyes.

522
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:05,960
Do you know

523
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,020
what a Guangong with open eyes means?

524
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,440
I don't know if you believe this or not,

525
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,260
but as the saying goes,

526
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,760
once Guangong

527
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,680
open his eyes,

528
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,010
blood will be spilled.

529
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
I scared you!

530
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,030
And then?

531
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,640
Then...

532
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,830
I don't know.

533
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,240
Later that friend got drunk.

534
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,550
He was drunk?

535
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,200
Yes.

536
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Why didn't that man call the police?

537
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,700
He was making it up.

538
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,110
I think he was too drunk.

539
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,800
In the middle of the night

540
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,590
and in the wilderness,

541
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,920
you can't see anything.

542
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,960
How could he see any Guangong tattoo?

543
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,480
Finish this drink,

544
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,700
then go back and rest.

545
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,440
We have important things to do tomorrow.

546
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,790
Yes.

547
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,150
Do you know that person?

548
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
No.

549
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,010
How would I know him?

550
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,110
We were having dinner,

551
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,400
and a friend brought him along.

552
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,720
I heard him talking there.

553
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,400
He was drunk and rambling.

554
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,650
Take it easy.

555
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,880
I'm drunk.

556
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,500
Careful.

557
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,630
Come.

558
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:54,820
Okay!

559
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,720
Be careful on your way.

560
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,850
I can walk by myself.

561
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,440
Don't you need me to see you off?

562
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,920
No need.

563
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,720
Get some rest.

564
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,590
I'm leaving. Time to sleep.

565
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,050
I'm going to the bathroom.

566
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,720
What's wrong?

567
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,450
I ate something bad yesterday.

568
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,590
If they call my number while I'm gone,

569
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,790
please take it for me.

570
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,490
No. 103,

571
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:13,640
[Weihai Police
Vehicle Management Office]

572
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,160
please come to the window.

573
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,590
Hello.

574
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,440
No.103 is my friend.

575
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,420
He went to the toilet.

576
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,440
I'm No. 104.

577
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,400
Both of your ID cards.

578
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,120

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,930

Let's go find Sun

590
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,590
and check the car.

591
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,660

599
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,920
I mean he was carrying

600
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,350

00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,510

is the same one

606
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,080

Think carefully.

612
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,000
Did you actually see

613
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,469
Dong's ID card back then?

614
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,130
It was too chaotic at that time.

No.

616

When I was cleaning up,

618
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,739
I didn't see it either.

619

Do you think...

620
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
It's impossible.

622
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,920
did you notice

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,520
anything strange about him?

624
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,440
Yes.

625
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,440
When I asked him...

626
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,280
I asked him

627
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,280
where his hometown is.

628
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,740
He said it's Mang Village.

629
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,510
But then he said

630
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,880
he grew up in the city

631
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,710
and didn't know about the village.

632
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,970
He didn't even know
his generation name.

633
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,480
The birthday he told Tianbao

634
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,490
isn't Ni Xiangdong's.

635
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,400
That should be

636
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,760
his own birthday.

637
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,800
But if he saw it,

638
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,700
how could he...

639
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,360
How could he act like nothing happened?

640

00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,480
why

642
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,170
is it in exactly the same place

643
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,520
as Ni Xiangdong's scar?

644
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,030
How can it be such a coincidence?

645
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,050
Could something be wrong?

646
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,840

-A schoolbag.
-Thank you, Uncle Ni.

658
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,030
I'm the Monkey King. I like it.

Let me put it away for you.

660
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,070
Tianbao was just talking about you,

661
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,070
guessing your zodiac sign.

662
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,500
He said Uncle Ni

663
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,030
must be born in the Year of the Monkey,
just like him.

664
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,250
Right.

665
00:36:59,250 --> 00:36:59,780
Tianbao,

666
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,850
ask your Uncle Ni

667
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,000
what his zodiac sign is.

668
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,530
Uncle Ni,

669
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,030
what's your zodiac sign?

670
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,670
Mine is...

671
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,080
the Horse.

672
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,360
If you were born
in the Year of the Monkey like me,

673
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,000
that would be great.

674
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,600
We'd be just like Sun Wukong.

675
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,580
Right.

676
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,760
Sun Wukong can do 72 transformations.

677
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,760
Uncle Ni,

678
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,280
if you could do 72 transformations,

679
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,010
what would you transform into?

680
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,450
If I could do 72 transformations,

681
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,630
I'd definitely transform into Sun Wukong.

682
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,610
Wouldn't there be two

683
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,610

684
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,360
No,

685
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,310
there's only one Sun Wukong.

686
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,960
The other one would be

687
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,760
the Six-Eared Macaque.

688
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,670
He doesn't understand
what you're talking about.

689
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,030
Come on.

690
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,490
Come on.

691
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,280
Blow out the candles.

692
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,940
Make a wish.

693
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,880
Come on.

694
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,280
Happy birthday to you.

695
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:52,400
Happy birthday to you.

696
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:57,150

697
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,880
Happy birthday to you.

698
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,960
Great!

699
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,910

700

709
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,450
Is this enough?

710
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,230
Here.

711
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,630
Here.

713
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,840
I'm not drinking anymore.

714
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,240
I got drunk the other day.

715
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,840
What are you afraid of? We're family.

716
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,700
Just one drink.

717
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,400
Okay.

718
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:38,960
One drink.

719
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,690
Cao Tianbao.

720
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,510
Didn't we agree

721
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,800
to celebrate your birthday at my house?

722
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,590
Alright, thank you.

723
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,030
I'll show you my new doll.

724
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,710
I haven't eaten yet.

725
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,280
You eat first.

726
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,940
My grandma steamed some bass.

727
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,760
It's okay, Tianbao,

728
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,800
go have some bass.

729
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,880
Lele, have a piece of cake.

730
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,670
Yes.

731
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,400
Take a piece of cake with you.

732
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,530
-Thank you.
-Here's for your grandma.

733
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,110
Right.

734
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,760
Tianbao, help Lele take it.

735
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,320
Okay.

736
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,690
-Stand there.
-Here, take the cake.

737
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,520
Good boy.

738
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,230
I will pick you up later.

739
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,800
Tianbao always wants to play with Lele

740
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,280
after school every day.

741
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,890
Well, he and Lele

742
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,510
make a good match.

743
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,800
Yes.

744
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,550
Ni,

745
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,560
in which year did you leave Jialin?

746
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,880
I left

747
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,840
in 2004.

748
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,670
What a coincidence.

749
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,280
What about you?

750
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,880
We also left in 2004.

751
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,400
Yes.

752
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,210
Yes, the year Tianbao was born.

753
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,590
What a coincidence.

754
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,630
Yeah.

755
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,460
Xiangdong,

756
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,320
I remember you mentioned

757
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,030
that

758
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,920
the scar on your face

759
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,710
was from a burn when you were a kid.

760
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,840
But I noticed there's no scar

761
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,040
on your ID card photo.

762
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,620
When did you

763
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,760
ever see my ID card?

764
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,800
Why so nervous?

765
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,710
I'm not.

766
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:06,890
That day

767
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,280
when we were getting
our driver's licenses,

768
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,110
you went to the toilet

769
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,920
and I took your ID card for you.

770
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,960
Is it hard to say?

771
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,630
No.

772
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,280
Look at you.

773
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,400
I'm just curious.

774
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,760
Xiaojun,

775
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,230
Ximei,

776
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,360
actually, there's something

777
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,440
I haven't told you.

778
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,360
That ID card you saw

779
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,160
isn't actually mine.

780
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:54,960
Whose is it then?

781
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,440
I don't know.

782
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,150
I bought it.

783
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,800
Bought it?

784
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,710
Back then,

785
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,560
I got into some trouble,

786
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,610
and I found someone

787
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,240
who had

788
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,760
many fake ID cards.

789
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,070
I spent 50 yuan

790
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,920
to buy one.

791
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,200
Now that I've told you this.

792
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,400
I have nothing

793
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,800
to hide from you anymore.

794
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,760
You've been so good to me.

795
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,070
So I'll tell you everything.

796
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,330
My surname isn't actually Ni.

797
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,010
My surname is

798
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,510
Yu,

799
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,810
and I'm from Yafen Village.

800
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,760
At the end of 2003,

801
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,880
I got into a conflict
with someone back home

802
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,150
and accidentally stabbed him.

803
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,800
After that, I just kept running,

804
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,800
hiding everywhere,

805
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,710
wandering around,

806
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,370
until I finally ended up here.

807
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,120
I originally had

808
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,280
no hope for my life.

809
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,440
I just thought

810
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,400
someday the police would arrest me.

811
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
I'd get sentenced

812
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,440
and go to prison.

813
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,120
I wasn't afraid.

814
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,480
But then I met you...

815
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,480
And you gave me

816
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,130
a feeling like home again.

817
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,960
That's when I decided

818
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,230
to stay here

819
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,030
and settle down.

820
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,030
Ni.

821
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,240
Look,

822
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,070
we don't mean anything else.

823
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,760
Right.

824
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,550
Yes.

825
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,800
I just want to tell you.

826
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,270
I don't want to hide it from you anymore.

827
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,290
I really wasn't

828
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,480
keeping it from you on purpose.

829
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,810
How am I supposed to tell

830
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,560
this kind of thing to anyone?

831
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,480
Anyway, now

832
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,010
I've told you everything.

833
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,440
It's your own

834
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,590
choice to make.
