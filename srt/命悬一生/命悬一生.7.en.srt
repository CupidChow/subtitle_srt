00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,550
They've all got their girlfriends
with them.

196
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,810
I'm the only one alone.

197
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,550
I'll lose face.

198
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,330
You go have fun, okay?

199
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,700
Hang out with them.

200
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,360
[Public Telephone]

201
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,600
I'm not going this time.

202
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Later, I plan to...

203
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,510
I've asked you out so many times

204
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,570
but you never come!

205
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,870
You only care

206
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,960
about your own stuff!

207
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,340
Do you know I'm about to...

208
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,890
You, you, you!

209
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,980
You only think about yourself!

210
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,910
Have you ever considered how I feel?

211
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,480
Xu Qingli,

212
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,750
I have exams next week.

213
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,360
Later, we received news.

214
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,790
Baozhen actually got admitted.

215
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,980
It was just a vocational college,

216
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,150
but still,
she became the first college student

217
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,720
in our village.

218
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,510
Xu Qingli sent a letter back,

219
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,600
saying

220
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,180
that after she graduated,

221
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,390
they'd return to the village and marry.

222
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,080
Back then,

223
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,860
Uncle Caizeng

224
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,750
was over the moon.

225
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,870
Then one day,

226
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
a Crown sedan

227
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,790
showed up in the village.

228
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,240
No one in our village

229
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,790
had ever seen such a nice car.

230
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,200
Everyone craned their necks

231
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,730
to see where it was heading.

232
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,320
It stopped right in front

233
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,400
of the Tian family's house.

234
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,520
Only later did we find out

235
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Tian Baozhen was engaged.

236
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,420
[Capital of Nanyang Province, 2003]

237
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,790
Baozhen.

238
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,360
Qingli.

239
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,600
You've really changed.

240
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:00,960
Yes.

241
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,560
I just...

242
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,560
finished class.

243
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,490
You're about to graduate?

244
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,510
Yes.

245
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,480
So...

246
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,200
what are your plans

247
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,150
for the future?

248
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,480
Qingli,

249
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,100
let's find a quiet place

250
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,030
to talk.

251
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,720
Sure.

252
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,700
These past few years, I've come to see

253
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,490
you made the right choice.

254
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,670
Impressive.

255
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,790
You're about to finish college.

256
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,900
But I've worked very hard too.

257
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,870
These past few years,

258
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,930
you were studying,

259
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
and I was working.

260
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,480
I've saved up some money.

261
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,740
Baozhen...

262
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,940
I'm getting married.

263
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,670
What?

264
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,230
I'm getting married.

265
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,870
Getting married?

266
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,510
To whom?

267
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,120
Bao Desheng.

268
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,270
The guy from Fucheng Sugar Factory.

269
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,400
You should know him.

270
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,480
Are you kidding me?

271
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,390
Bao Desheng?

272
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,780
You're going to marry him?

273
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,840
Yes.

274
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,270
He is

275
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,720
uneducated.

276
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,200
Everyone knows that.

277
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,250
You're going to marry him?

278
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,870
What's so good about him?

279
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,080
Don't talk nonsense

280
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
if you don't know.

281
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,210
I don't believe it.

282
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,200
Why wouldn't you believe it?

283
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,440
This is the life I want.

284
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,150
Understand?

285
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,390
Do you love him?

286
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,010
Does it matter?

287
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,610
Doesn't it matter?

288
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,480
No, it doesn't.

289
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,390
You... You want to be

290
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,250
with someone you don't even love?

291
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,040
Feelings can be developed.

292
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,670
Isn't that what people always say

293
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,330
when they urge a girl to marry?

294
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,870
Baozhen, stop joking.

295
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,320
What's wrong with you, Baozhen?

296
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,630
What kind of joke is this?

297
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,910
I'm not joking.

298
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,790
I know

299
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,180
you must have been upset lately

300
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,000
because I didn't visit you.

301
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,720
I'll come see you every day from now on.

302
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,440
Okay?

303
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,280
Then let me ask you a question.

304
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,750
If the factory director's daughter and I

305
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,610
both pursued you at the same time,

306
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,830
who would you choose?

307
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,840
Do I even need to think about it?

308
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,270
Of course...

309
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,470
Don't lie.

310
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,090
Liars get struck by lightning.

311
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,080
See?

312
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,850
It's fine when you do that,

313
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,630
but not when I do that?

314
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,150
You have all those grand principles

315
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,360
to lecture me.

316
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,840
Marrying only for love

317
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,320
is just gambling.

318
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,320
Love

319
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,790
is far more expensive and extravagant

320
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,720
than gold.

321
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,670
Even if you have it today,

322
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,130
it might be gone tomorrow.

323
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,420
Who can guarantee something
for a lifetime?

324
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,600
If I marry you

325
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,550
just for love,

326
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,150
what if you change your heart one day?

327
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,390
Who can I complain to?

328
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,080
Who should I cry to?

329
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,630
Baozhen,

330
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,790
you know me.

331
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,500
I would never change my heart.

332
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,600
Baozhen,

333
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,150
I can swear.

334
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
I will

335
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,320
treat you well my whole life.

336
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,440
Why should I marry you

337
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,170
just because you're good to me?

338
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,270
Why?

339
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,620
You can't even say for sure

340
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,630
if it will rain today

341
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,960
or tomorrow.

342
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,270
How dare you stand here

343
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,510
and promise something for a lifetime?

344
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,180
-Why can't I guarantee it?
-Besides,

345
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
I can't guarantee

346
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,130
that I'll love you forever either.

347
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,090
Baozhen, what are you talking about?

348
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,110
Has studying scrambled your brain?

349
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,600
No.

350
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,550
What are you talking about?

351
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,069
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

352
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,400
What's wrong with that?

353
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,369
It's perfectly normal.

354
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,430
Normal?

355
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,589
Love takes two.

356
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,339
Women have the right
to change their hearts too.

357
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,750
Why would you want to change your heart?

358
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,109
Let me tell you, people are animalsâ€”

359
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,270
loving this person today,

360
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,530
that person tomorrow.

361
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,069
You can't guarantee anything.

362
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,109
Everyone likes novelty.

363
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,030
If you'd chosen

364
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,640
the factory director's daughter just now,

365
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
I would understand.

366
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,140
I understand completely.

367
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,210
I'm not saying you're bad.

368
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,220
People have selfish desires.

369
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,960
Everyone is like that.

370
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,720
You are like that.

371
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,270
I am like that too.

372
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,070
Both men and women are like that.

373
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,960
Look at yourself now,

374
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,160
Baozhen.

375
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,610
You've been corrupted after all.

376
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,920
I've been corrupted?

377
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,400
What is good?

378
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,310
What is bad?

379
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,200
Is planning for myself bad?

380
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,440
Does being good mean revolving around you

381
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,240
my whole life?

382
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,980
Do you want a good woman

383
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,530
or a woman

384
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,960
you can easily control?

385
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,240
Baozhen.

386
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,960
Think about your mother.

387
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,130
She was such a proper,

388
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,270
good woman.

389
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,200
If she saw you

390
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,160
like this now,

391
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,170
-what would she think?
-She would be happy for me.

392
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,510
What?

393
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,480
She would be happy for me!

394
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,840
Happy I didn't follow in her footsteps.

395
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,640
Happy that I'm not trapped

396
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,680
my whole life by being good,

397
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,150
working like a slave,

398
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,950
taking care of the whole family,

399
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,680
unable to complain or resent,

400
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,030
and labeled a nag
just for grumbling a bit.

401
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Fifty years old.

402
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,080
She died when she was only 50.

403
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,680
The day she died,

404
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,410
she was still out in the field
cutting sugarcane.

405
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,860
What did she get in the end?

406
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,030
What did she get?

407
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,590
Not even half a year after she was gone,

408
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,390
my father got himself a new wife.

409
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,920
Do you want that kind of life for me?

410
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,000
I don't want that!

411
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,030
I know if I continue with you like this,

412
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,750
I can already see how it ends!

413
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,440
It's exactly that kind of life!

414
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,790
I don't want it!

415
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,880
What kind of life?

416
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,110
How do you know what my life

417
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,070
will be like?

418
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,720
I can make money too!

419
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,440
Baozhen.

420
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,240
What did I do wrong?

421
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,950
If I did something wrong,

422
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
I'd accept you treating me this way.

423
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,810
When you went to that massage parlor,

424
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,000
where did you put me?

425
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,780
You think I don't know?

426
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,250
You think I haven't been tolerating it?

427
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,880
Baozhen, I...

428
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,240
I was drunk.

429
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,640
You're treating me like a fool.

430
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,750
I was drunk.

431
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,400
I didn't want to...

432
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,440
Are you treating me like a fool?

433
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,350
No!

434
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,270
You left with me back then.

435
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,530
I remember that kindness.

436
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,630
But over these years,

437
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,960
finding jobs,

438
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,110
changing houses,

439
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,070
clearing up those messesâ€”

440
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,480
I've helped you a lot too,

441
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,110
Xu Qingli.

442
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,720
Changing one's fate
requires shedding a layer of skin.

443
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,480
It's harder for me to change my fate
than it is for you.

444
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,070
I'm terrified that one wrong step

445
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,790
will ruin my whole life.

446
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,240
Maybe you also think

447
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,310
I'm a bad woman.

448
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,240
Everyone thinks

449
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,400
I'm a bad woman.

450
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,400
It doesn't matter.

451
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,640
I don't care.

452
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,640
I just want to live a good life.

453
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,890
What's a good life?

454
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,750
I've made my choice now.

455
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,270
This is my choice!

456
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,880
You can't

457
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,940
give me what I want.

458
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,280
Of course,

459
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
what you wantâ€”I can't...

460
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,340
I can't fully provide either.

461
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,480
Let's part on good terms.

462
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,010
Baozhen.

463
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,400
Baozhen!

464
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,960
â™ª Standing far away â™ª

465
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,650
â™ª Can't see the white clouds â™ª

466
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:41,810
â™ª What a peaceful scene â™ª

467
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:49,270
â™ª Who knows that bad luck
has quietly come? â™ª

468
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,190
[Wedding]

469
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
I'm old.

470
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
You young people enjoy yourselves.

471
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,070
Thank you, Master Five,
for gracing us with your presence today.

472
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,270
On your wedding day,

473
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,640
of course I'm happy.

474
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,550
Baozhen!

475
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,510
â™ª Standing far away â™ª

476
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,590
Baozhen!

477
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,480
Baozhen!

478
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,510
â™ª Can't see the white clouds â™ª

479
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,960
I'm a bit tired today.

480
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,090
You all go have fun.

481
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,790
Okay.

482
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,680
I won't be joining you.

483
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,790
Baozhen!

484
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:40,310
â™ª What a peaceful scene â™ª

485
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,480
â™ª Who knows that bad luck
has quietly come? â™ª

486
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,240
Should we go for another round?

487
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,160
-Yes!
-Yes!

488
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,030
Where do you want to go?

489
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,030
-Pharaoh's!
-Pharaoh's!

490
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,400
Let's go! Get in the car!

491
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,590
â™ª You still haven't come back to me â™ª

492
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:11,350
â™ª The endless sorrow â™ª

493
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,890
â™ª From now on,
you'll have to endure it alone â™ª

494
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,480
Who are you looking for?

495
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,560
Who are you looking for?

496
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm looking for Bao Desheng.

497
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,830
Is he here?

498
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,050
You're Mr. Bao's friend?

499
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,240
Over there.

500
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,840
Come on, I'll take you to him.

501
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,650
He's right here.

502
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,130
It's him again.

503
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,880
Mr. Bao.

504
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,370
Your friend is here.

505
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,030
-Let go! Let go!
-What are you doing?

506
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,440
Is everything okay?

507
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,350
I need to speak with Mr. Bao.

508
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,640
It's my wedding day.

509
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,140
Come, you.

510
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,880
Come here.

511
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,030
Sit here.

512
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,350
Sit closer.

513
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,400
Bro,

514
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,350
my apologies.

515
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,130
Today is my wedding day.

516
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,960
I haven't been able
to attend to you properly.

517
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,000
It's fine.

518
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,410
I know you're busy.

519
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,030
So...

520
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,750
where's Baozhen?

521
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,280
Baozhen?

522
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,200
She's at home,

523
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,440
waiting for me.

524
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,300
Why aren't you going home then?

525
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,190
I still have these friends to attend to.

526
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,830
Let's drink then.

527
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,640
Drink.

528
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,270
What else do you want?

529
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,030
I just want...

530
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,030
I just want to say...

531
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,960
Baozhen isn't right for you.

532
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,750
You can't marry her.

533
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,000
Why can't I marry her?

534
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,350
Because you don't understand her.

535
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,750
If I don't understand her, who does? You?

536
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,640
I do.

537
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,290
You really don't understand Baozhen!

538
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,750
I do!

539
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,330
When I first met her,

540
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,650
where were you?

541
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,880
Bro, alright. Alright.

542
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,160
I understand Baozhen!

543
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,610
Bro. Bro.

544
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,000
You can't marry her.

545
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,510
-Listen to me.
-Mr. Bao, you can't marry Baozhen!

546
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,400
I must marry Baozhen.

547
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,550
What do you have to marry her?

548
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,720
Do you have money?

549
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,030
I will have money.

550
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,040
I will marry her.

551
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,590
What a buzzkill.

552
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,240
Baozhen.

553
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,720
Drag him away!

554
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,830
Mr. Bao.

555
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,720
Don't...

556
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,200
Don't touch me!

557
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,890
Don't touch me!

558
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,750
I need to talk to Mr. Bao!

559
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,690
Let me tell you.

560
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,720
If it weren't for Baozhen,

561
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,920
I would've killed you already!

562
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,510
I'm telling you.

563
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,110
You kept man! You kept man!

564
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,150
You brat! You brat!

565
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,410
Is she yours?

566
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,510
Is she yours?

567
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,960
You kept man!

568
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,750
I'm calling you a kept man.

569
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,200
Can't you hear me?

570
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,930
You kept man!

571
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,730
You kept man!

572
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,680
You kept man!

573
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,240
I've already married Baozhen.

574
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,070
Later, I'll go home

575
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,550
and consummate our marriage!

576
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,650
You kept man!

577
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,880
You brat!

578
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,200
You loser!

579
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,400
Everyone knows the story!

580
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,890
You're just a worker in my factory.

581
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,830
You want to marry Baozhen?

582
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,690
Keep dreaming.

583
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,170
Everyone knows he's a kept man.

584
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,160
Don't do this!

585
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,700
Mr. Bao!

586
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,750
Drag him away.

587
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,440
-Don't touch me!
-Baozhen supported you,

588
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,300
gave you money,

589
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,240
and fed you!

590
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,000
Or you think

591
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,640
you'd have survived till now?

592
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,200
Get lost!

593
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,270
Come on, say it again!

594
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,790
Who's a kept man?

595
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,790
Who's a kept man?

596
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,270
Here!

597
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,510
Stab me here!

598
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,150
Come on. Right here.

599
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,960
Here, come on.

600
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,240
Come on, here. Come on.

601
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,550
Come on. Come on.

602
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,680
Here, stab me!

603
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,790
Lots of guts here!

604
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,200
You're useless, trash!

605
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,550
Killing my buzz.

606
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,480
Bao Desheng,

607
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
I will kill you.

608
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,830
Come on.

609
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,270
I'll kill you!

610
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,510
Hurry up!

611
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,270
I...

612
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,400
I will kill you.

613
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,550
I will kill you.

614
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,070
I will kill you!

615
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,240
I will kill you!

616
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,180
Dogs with tails strut,

617
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,880
and so do dogs without!

618
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,090
Alright, alright!

619
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,410
Everyone, let's continue drinking!

620
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,320
What are you laughing at?

621
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,200
What are you laughing at?

622
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,880
What are you laughing at?

623
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,060
Stop laughing!

624
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,490
Everyone's laughing at me!

625
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,110
Stop.

626
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
Stand over there.

627
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,500
Stop laughing.

628
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,920
Or I'll kill you.

629
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,270
Stop laughing.

630
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,590
Stop laughing.

631
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,270
Stop laughing!

632
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,680
Stop laughing!

633
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,030
Stop laughing!

634
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,350
Stop laughing!

635
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,960
Help!

636
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,550
Help me!

637
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,810
[Weihai, 2011]

638
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,570
Zhen, you're here.

639
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,780
Zhen, you're here.

640
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,750
Morning.

641
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,240
Morning, Madam.

642
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,850
Thanks for your hard work.

643
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,510
No problem.

644
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,210
Have you seen this person?

645
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,590
No, I haven't.

646
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,260
Really, I haven't.

647
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,000
I've seen this person.

648
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,440
You have?

649
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,640
This guy

650
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,700
came here a few days ago,

651
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,920
looking for the boss lady.

652
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,250
He asked what her name is

653
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,550
and where she was, things like that.

654
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,560
I just saw him.

655
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,750
When I was taking out the trash earlier,

656
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,440
he was right there in that alley.

657
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,480
He was still there just now.

658
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,740
Yes, that alley.

659
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,750
Xu Qingli!

660
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,030
Xu Qingli!

661
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,680
Get up!

662
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,160
Get up!

663
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Who is it?

664
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,750
Baozhen?

665
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,880
Why are you here?

666
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,480
What's wrong?

667
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,830
You've gone too far!

668
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,200
How dare you kill someone!

669
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,060
What? What are you talking about?

670
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,400
I killed someone?

671
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Stop pretending.

672
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,720
Don't play dumb!

673
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,590
What's wrong?

674
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,060
Why did you slap me?

675
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,960
You killed someone.

676
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,240
You killed Bao Desheng,

677
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,070
didn't you?

678
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,060
When did I kill him?

679
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,790
Last night,

680
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,550
Bao Desheng was stabbed to death

681
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,640
at the old bridge.

682
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,470
The groomsmen said

683
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,510
they saw you

684
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,480
shouting

685
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,110
and swearing you'd kill him.

686
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,550
I was...

687
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
drunk.

688
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,320
I was... talking nonsense.

689
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,350
No matter what nonsense you were talking,

690
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,160
everyone is saying it was you.

691
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,070
Do you understand?

692
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,400
Bao Desheng is dead?

693
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,880
Bao Desheng is dead.

694
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,240
Completely dead.

695
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,240
What does that have to do with me?

696
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,420
What does this have to do with you?

697
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,350
Everyone is saying

698
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,290
that you killed him.

699
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,270
Do you understand?

700
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,070
It wasn't me.

701
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,720
I can go to them!

702
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,670
And I can explain to them!

703
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,550
The Bao family

704
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,760
is looking for you like crazy.

705
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,590
What good will explaining to them do?

706
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,190
Then what proof do they have?

707
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,190
They don't need proof.

708
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,030
If they find you, you're finished!

709
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,800
Got it?

710
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,150
What should I do now?

711
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,710
Kapok Lane.

712
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,260
You've been there before.

713
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,190
I have a friend there

714
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,320
who runs a small inn.

715
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,790
Go hide there for now.

716
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,800
Listen to me.

717
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,230
Wait.

718
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,320
-Before things are cleared up...
-But I didn't kill him.

719
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,550
Before things are cleared up,

720
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,360
don't come back

721
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,480
and don't run away!

722
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,440
Understand?

723
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,860
Will you ever stop?

724
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,060
Will you ever stop?

725
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,280
Doing this all day long!

726
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,190
What are you banging for?

727
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,670
You want me to kill you?

728
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,970
-Get out!
-Brother.

729
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,760
Brave enough to bang on walls,

730
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,150
but not brave enough to say it to my face?

731
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,230
Forget it.

732
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:11,810
Brat!

733
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,480
Where are you hiding? Come out!

734
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,090
-Stay out of this!
-Don't get so angry.

735
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:15,840
Get out!

736
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,070
We can just change our room.

737
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,400
Do you have a death wish?

738
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:18,800
Do you know

739
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,730
what happens when you mess with me?

740
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,320
Where are you hiding? Come out!

741
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,190
Get out!

742
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,480
Do you have a death wish?

743
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,510
Bang, bang, bang!

744
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,440
All you do is bang!

745
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,570
Come out if you dare!

746
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,400
It's me.

747
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,230
Baozhen.

748
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,910
You finally came.

749
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,850
Baozhen.

750
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,880
Sit, sit.

751
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,810
Baozhen.

752
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,920
What's the situation outside?

753
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,440
You have to run.

754
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,760
Why?

755
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,960
The Bao family is looking for you
everywhere.

756
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,070
They've spent a lot of money.

757
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,440
All those

758
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,590
shady friends of yours from before

759
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,480
are looking for you everywhere,

760
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,510
waiting to catch you and claim reward.

761
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,630
Why catch me?

762
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,500
I didn't kill anyone.

763
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,030
I didn't kill Bao Desheng.

764
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,190
But everyone's saying you killed him.

765
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,590
I can go to the police station!

766
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,590
I'll go right now!

767
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,720
Alright.

768
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,360
Even if the police believe it wasn't you,

769
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,560
the Bao family won't.

770
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,150
Bao Desheng was their only son.

771
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,030
He died for no reason,

772
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,710
while you're here alive and well.

773
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,920
How could his parents accept that?

774
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,510
How could his uncles

775
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,630
let you off?

776
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,860
They'll definitely catch you
to pay with your life.

777
00:37:59,070 --> 00:37:59,670
Why?

778
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,360
I didn't kill anyone!

779
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,760
What did I do?

780
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,880
There's some money here.

781
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,740
Go somewhere else to hide for now!

782
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,630
I won't hide.

783
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,150
Why should I hide?

784
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,360
I'll go back to Yafen Village
to my father.

785
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,500
Are you crazy?

786
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,710
The Bao family is looking for you
everywhere.

787
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,190
Go somewhere else to hide for now.

788
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,880
I'm not asking you to hide forever.

789
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,480
Just get through this first.

790
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,630
Tomorrow is
Bao Desheng's seventh-day ceremony.

791
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,590
I guess the Bao family
won't have time for you.

792
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,650
Leave at midnight.

793
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,140
What about you?

794
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,320
I have my own plans.

795
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,520
The police already questioned me once.

796
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,030
The Bao family can't control me now.

797
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,330
But they all say I'm...

798
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,550
a jinx.

799
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,000
They say I bring misfortune to my husband.

800
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,010
So I can't stay in Jialin anymore.

801
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,360
And I don't want to stay here either.

802
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,000
Baozhen,

803
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,660
let's leave this place together.

804
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,510
I won't go with you.

805
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,740
Where will you go then?

806
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,600
To the north, I guess.

807
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,930
I'm used to the sound of the waves.

808
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,890
I'll find a place by the sea.

809
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,540
Listening to the waves

810
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,370
helps me sleep better.

811
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:55,710
Baozhen.

812
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,320
I know

813
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,590
you've always cared about me.

814
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Otherwise, why would you

815
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,150
have found an inn

816
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,660
and gathered information for me?

817
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,520
Now that Bao Desheng is dead,

818
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,140
we can leave this place together.

819
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,230
You're crazy!

820
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,440
I'm helping myself!

821
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,880
With your personality,

822
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,150
if you get caught,

823
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,480
you'll implicate me.

824
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,230
That would be even worse!

825
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,680
What about my personality?

826
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,320
What do you know about my personality?

827
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,150
Let me tell you.

828
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,880
Bao Desheng...

829
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,070
was killed by me.

830
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,360
It couldn't be you.

831
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,240
After all that's happened these days,

832
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,960
I've seen clearly

833
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,650
it couldn't be you.

834
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,440
Maybe I never

835
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,040
should've asked you
to leave with me back then.

836
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,410
If you had stayed

837
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,170
in the village your whole life,

838
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,370
none of this would have happened.

839
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,880
Qingli,

840
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,110
forget me.

841
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,630
From now on,

842
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,320
take good care of yourself.
