[THE HUNT]

00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,280
Tomorrow morning,

3
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:22,530
come with me to your husband's family.

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,079
[1987, Baorong Village, Nanyang Province]

5
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,940
You don't need to bring anything.

6
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,710
They're afraid of your late husband's
spirit,

7
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,400
so they won't let you
bring anything there.

8
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:31,960
Otherwise, he might

9
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,750
follow you there to seek vengeance

10
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,870
and cause trouble.

11
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,220
That wouldn't be good.

12
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,579
I mean my son.

13
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,160
He's a boy.

14
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,050
Of course you can bring him there.

15
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,650
When you get there,

16
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,360
you’ll stay in an unused room
for one night.

17
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,400
The day after tomorrow,
you'll get married—

18
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,460
without a banquet.

19
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,360
So that's the plan.

20
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,430
Tomorrow morning,

21
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll pick her up at the village entrance.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,200
Thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

23
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,150
Let me walk you out.

24
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,680
It's okay.

25
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,470
Mom!

26
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,560
Mom, don't go!

28
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,800
Mom, wait for me!

29
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,800
Take me with you!

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Mom!

31
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,740
Mom, don't go!

32

Mom, wait for me!

39
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,220
I will come back to see you in a few days.

40
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,870
Be a good girl.

00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,540
Listen to Grandma

42
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,980
and Uncle.

43
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,360
A bride doesn't look back

44
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,590
so she won't bring bad luck.

45
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,840
Let's go.

46
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,300

49
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,900
I'm not being good!

only take my little brother

Ximei, you're a big girl now.

54

You should be a good girl.

55
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,180
I don't want to be a good girl!

It's okay. I'll handle it.

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,430
Fuchang is a good boy.

64
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,120
He helps out.

65
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,670
Fuchang's face is so dark,

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,480
like a dark-skinned sugarcane.

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,680
You're a black-skinned sugarcane too.

68

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,950
You're just too honest.

00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,840

She ran away to escape his beatings.

his wife was beaten to death by him

81
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,510

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,020
He stinks. His house stinks even more.

86
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,190
You can smell it from far away.

87
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,890
That's because he dries fish powder

He can't even afford the engagement money.

You'll be poor your whole life with him.

134
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,430
I'm not afraid of being poor.

135
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,060
If I have to get married,
I'll marry Fuchang.

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,270
Actually, Xiaojun...

170
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,120
was my 2nd husband.

171
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,400
I was

172
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,750
married once before.

173
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,390
No more drinking!

174
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,440
If I drink more,

175
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,200
it'll ruin my good day.

176
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,480
I'll come to your place tomorrow,

177
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,570
and we'll drink then,

178
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,440
okay?

179
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,550
Stop looking! Stop looking!

180
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,490
Go!

181
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,880
Don't look anymore.

on the first night,

185
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,470
you need to place a pillow
for the first wife's spirit.

186
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,630
And we're not supposed to…

187
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,910
The first wife's spirit? Nonsense!

188
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,390
What a bad omen.

189
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,710
Take off your clothes.

190
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,550
These need to be returned tomorrow.

191
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,870
Take them off!

192
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,100
I was still young back then.

193
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,360
We couldn't get a marriage certificate.

194
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,610
We just

195
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,470
had a small wedding banquet.

196
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,940
Thinking about it now,

197
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,970
I was really

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,130
a gambler back then.

199
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,000
I staked my whole life

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,480
on Guo Adi,

201
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,770
betting that...

202
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,800
he had a conscience,

203
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,350
that he would be grateful,

204
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,440
that he would treat me well.

205
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:38,910
And?

206
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,080
I won the bet.

207
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,050
He treated me very well.

208
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,580
He gave me

209
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,270
all the good food and drinks.

210
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,060
He cherished me dearly

211
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,960
and never hurt me.

212
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,150
Of course, we bickered sometimes.

213
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,260
Living together is like

214
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,180
using a spoon to stir in a pot—

215
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,080
there are always little bumps.

216
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,840
My grandma once told me,

217
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,870
"Suffering is a blessing.

218
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,630
Just endure it

219
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,000
in this life;

220
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,740
it will be better in the next."

221
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,760
You went to the village clinic, right?

222
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,480
What did He say?

223
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,870
Well...

224
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,600
He said

225
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,220
I might not be getting enough nutrition
lately,

226
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,680
so my period is irregular.

227
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,880
So you're not pregnant?

228
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,110
He's just a village doctor.

229
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,390
He knows nothing.

230
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,320
You should go to the town hospital

231
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,380
in a couple of days.

232
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,830
Oh,

233
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,910
when I was visiting the family graves,

234
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,150
I caught a gecko.

235
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,960
Later, take out that bottle

236
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,840
at home for making liquor

237
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,870
and wash it.

238
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,000
This afternoon,

239
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,030
I'll buy some double-distilled liquor

240
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,150
and make medicinal wine myself.

241
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,600
Okay.

242
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,640
Buddha, please bless us.

243
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,910
Bless Guo Adi to be kind,

244
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,630
so I can have some peaceful days.

245
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,740
Adi, have some tea.

246
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,630
Tea?

247
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,080
Do you know how people outside

248
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,120
laugh at me?

249
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,750
Why can't you have a child?

250
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,670
Why can't you?

251
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,390
You know, if you can't give me a son,

252
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,510
you won't even be buried
in our ancestral grave after death.

253
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,440
Adi, I'll go to town tomorrow.

254
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,670
Come with me.

255
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,190
You think there's something wrong with me?

256
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,390
What's wrong with me?

257
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,720
What's wrong with me?

258
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,790
What's wrong with me?

259
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,750
You think it's my problem, right?

260
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,720
What nonsense

261
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,790
did you

262
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,490
hear about me?

263
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,060
What did those quack doctors say about me?

264
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,900
Tell me!

265
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
What did they say?

266
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,290
You can't have children.

267
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,140
So why did I even marry you?

268
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,240
It's not me!

269
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,430
What's not you?

270
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,349
Tell me!

271
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,940
Didn't your previous wife

272
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,339
fail to get pregnant too?

273
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,900
If you want a child,

274
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,730
Adi, let's go to the hospital together.

275
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,150
Let's go together, okay?

276
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,300
Go to the hospital?

277
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,510
What's wrong with me?

278
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,109
Tell me!

279
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,010
Xiang!

280
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:18,790
Stop hitting her!

281
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,050
If you keep hitting her, she'll die.

282
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:20,569
Enough,

283
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,829
Adi, if you beat your wife to death,

284
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,530
no one will give you children.

285
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,060
Get lost!

286
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,870
Mind your own family's

287
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,540
business!

288
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,720
One day,

289
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,210
I'll beat you too!

290
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,490
Get lost!

291
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,660
Why can't you have children?

292
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,110
Have a child!

293
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,680
Grandma,

294
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,180
you said that having a child

295
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,620
would make life better.

296
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,880
But I can't have children.

297
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,330
Because I can't have children,

298
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,090
is this how my life should be?

299
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,270
I've always been well-behaved

300
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,720
and obedient.

301
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,270
I listen to you,

302
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,720
to Uncle and Auntie,

303
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,440
and to Guo Adi.

304
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,640
I listen to all of you.

305
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,400
So how did my life

306
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,640
end up like this?

307
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,010
Is this the "peaceful life"

308
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,790
you promised?

309
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,830
I know

310
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,070
I can only blame my bad luck.

311
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm scared.

312
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,070
I can't hold on much longer.

313
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,000
After I die,

314
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,000
I don't want to be buried
in their ancestral grave.

315
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,830
I'm keeping this cigarette for myself.

316
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,430
Hong Kong people smoke this.

317
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,510
Foreigners too.

318
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,930
Here, take this.

319
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,480
I won't smoke.

320
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,070
I can't smoke anymore.

321
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,170
What took you so long?

322
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,680
I've been waiting for ages.

323
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,290
We have a guest?

324
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:31,650
Come.

325
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,410
Come on in.

326
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,640
Have a seat.

327
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,960
Sit down.

328
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:35,920
Okay.

329
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,890
Let me introduce you.

330
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,260
This is Sanli's youngest son,

331
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,440
Wei.

332
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,750
Wei.

333
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,810
By...

334
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,040
seniority...

335
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,640
he should call you...

336
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,480
Sister-in-law.

337
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,740
What sister-in-law?

338
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,740
It doesn't matter what you call her.

339
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,340
He's a member of the Guo family.

340
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,370
We're all family.

341
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,030
Come back.

342
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,650
Don't go.

343
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,240
Don't go.

344
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,170
This...

345
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,160
Come.

346
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,440
Sit.

347
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,030
Have a seat.

348
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:18,960
Here.

349
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,040
Have a drink.

350
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,030
Wei

351
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,160
and his older brother

352
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,240
are in the smuggling business.

353
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,550
They make good money.

354
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,810
These prawns

355
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,770
were brought by him.

356
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,640
Look how big they are.

357
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,240
You two have a drink.

358
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,100
Have a drink.

359
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:47,960
Drink.

360
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,580
This liquor

361
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,870
was specially made for you.

362
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,860
Seahorse and gecko wine.

363
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,350
Very nourishing.

364
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,720
Wei.

365
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,790
What are you doing, Adi?

366
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,360
Shut up!

367
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,190
Stop yelling!

368
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,520
Wei!

369
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,530
Wei!

370
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,760
Don't!

371
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,320
Wei!

372
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,000
Don't!

373
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,480
Wei!

374
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,020
I'm begging you, Adi!

375
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000
Please!

376
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,580
Wei!

377
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,540
Wei! Don't!

378
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,240
No, Wei! Don't!

379
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,800
I just want a son!

380
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,380
I just want a son!

381
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
I want a son!

382
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,170
I want a son!

383
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,000
Come on!

384

You'd better get pregnant.

399
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,830
At that time, Adi and his cousin

400
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,510
were running Dafei,

401
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,490
which were speedboats.

402
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,370
Those boats

403
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,020
had 4 or 5 engines mounted on the back.

404
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,680
Smuggling?

405
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,240
Yes.

406
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,530

00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,720
Later I realized

409
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,000
it was illegal.

410
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,880

414
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,310
went out smuggling

415
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,460
and never came back.

416
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,920

how to wash hair and cut hair?

577
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,870
No rush.

578
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,110
I'll first teach you

579
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,670
how to dress up properly.

580
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,690
Come, have a seat.

581
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,070
In business,

582
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,850
we must

583
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,320
look clean and neat.

584
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,890
Otherwise, customers might dislike us.

585
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,690
Right?

586
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,230
Come, I'll show you.

587
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,020
Sit here.

588
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,930
You're so pretty.

589
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,800
Your face is so small.

590
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,030
I have some clothes in my cabinet.

591
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,250
The sizes might not fit you,

592
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,000
but that's okay.

593
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,190
As long as they look good on you.

594
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,940
They're all washed.

595
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,000
Pick one yourself.

596
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,670
-Go.
-Thank you, Mei.

597
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,290
It's okay.

598
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,840
The second cabinet,

599
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,770
the one with Andy Lau's photo on it.

600
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,750
Mei, hurry up.

601
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,890
Mr. Dao is here.

602
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:30,840
Coming!

603
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,840
Change quickly and go downstairs.

604
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,380
Mr. Dao's here.

605
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,110
We can't afford to piss him off.

606
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,220
Mei.

607
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,510
Mr. Dao.

608
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,360
Mr. Dao.

609
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,400
We have a new betel nut here today.

610
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,320
My goodness. She's amazing.

611
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,400
We specially saved this girl for you

612
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,360
to take a look.

613
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,280
Where is she?

614
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,440
Where's she?

615
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,440
She's upstairs.

616
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,230
Come down now!

617
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,050
What are you doing up there?

618
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,450
Hurry up!

619
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,060
What are you doing?

620
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,050
Be quiet.

621
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,210
We're running a business here.

622
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,190
How can we do business

623
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,390
if you keep shouting?

624
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,190
Mr. Dao.

625
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,110
Hello.

626
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,280
Come down.

627
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,230
Wash my hair.

628
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,110
Come on.

629
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,860
Are you messing around?

630
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,800
Get out.

631
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,440
The towel.

632
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,640
It's in the cabinet.

633
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,700
Bring me the towel.

634
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,480
I'm sorry.

635
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,490
I don't know how to do this.

636
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,000
Where are you from?

637
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
Baorong Village.

638
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,420
Baorong Village?
