If he misappropriated any money,

162
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,750
we would pursue him for embezzlement

How will you

382
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,780
face your students in the future?

383
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,180
When your father

384
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,880
asks you about this,

385
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,210
how will you answer him?

386
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:38,970
Enough.

387
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,350
Say no more.

388
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,350
You were once a teacher.

389
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,700
You don't look like

390
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,920
a teacher at all.

391
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,270
You have no sense of responsibility,

392
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,750
yet you taught your students

393
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,750
to be good people.

394
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,400
You're afraid to face the truth.

395
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,160
Yes.

396
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,830
You're afraid to face the police.

397
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,550
Yes, I am.

398
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,640
If you had even a little faith

399
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,830
in us police officers,

400
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,920
you wouldn't have

401

ended up here today.

402
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,010
What about that kid?

403
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,480
He's only 7.

404
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,310
How will he

405
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,680
face his life?

406
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,350
How can he ever trust anyone?

407
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,150
Ni Xiangdong!

408
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,480
I killed him.

409
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,240
Say it again.

410
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,110
Ni Xiangdong...

411
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,640
was killed by me.

412
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,340

414
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,720
I'm terrified.

427
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,480
You have medicine?

428
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,170
Where is it?

429
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,330

00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,320
Why did they want to kill me?

437

Don't move.

445

What should we do now?

446
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,810
Take me down the mountain.

447
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,980
Down the mountain?

448
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,090
Down the mountain?

449
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,370

Wu Ximei committed murder

503
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,290
