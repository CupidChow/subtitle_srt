1
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,239
Keep it down.

2
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:20,780
What if someone hears us?

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,480
What if someone hears us?

4
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,300
Who cares if they do?

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,600
Are you worried your low-born sword servant

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,079
your commoner fiancé, Chen Yuanqi,

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,239
could even get into the back mountain?

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,219
A precious night together.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,859
Do you really want me to stop now?

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,340
Don't regret it later.

11
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,039
No.

12
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,179
Senior Brother.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,380
Chen Yuanqi is just a low-born wretch.

14
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,920
How could he compare to a noble son like you?

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,600
A noble descendant.

16
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,659
My body and heart belong to you.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,159
Yanzhi.

18
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,379
You...

19
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,599
Yuanqi.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,620
How did you get in here?

21
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,579
Why be afraid of a mere insect like him?

22
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:14,900
Don't ruin the mood.

23
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,939
Fu Qingyun.

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,500
Yanzhi is my fiancée.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,659
How dare you humiliate her like this?

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,900
Do you think I'm dead?

27
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,780
I humiliated your fiancée?

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,739
Disgusting.

29
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,859
You commoner trash.

30
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,739
You don't deserve someone as beautiful as Yanzhi.

31
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:36,900
Wait.

32
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,099
You haven't even tasted her yet, have you?

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,340
I tried her for you.

34
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,879
So weak.

35
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,579
You probably can't satisfy Yanzhi in bed.

36
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,439
Bastard!

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,099
I'll fight you!

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,079
Insect.

39
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,460
Do you know why you failed the exams these past two years?

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,560
The Fu family switched your results with mine.

41
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,680
Did you really think hard work mattered?

42
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,259
What did you say?

43
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,539
Animal!

44
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:25,860
Yanzhi!

45
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:27,639
Yanzhi, run!

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,479
Go to Tianyuan Academy and find the elders.

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,659
Ask them to give us justice.

48
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:36,659
Yanzhi.

49
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,479
Just say the word,

50
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,199
and I won't kill him.

51
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,060
It's all up to you, Senior Brother.

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,680
Did you hear that?

53
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,340
Why?

54
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,060
Why are you doing this to me?

55
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,800
Because insects deserve nothing.

56
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,099
Cut the weeds, remove the roots.

57
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,180
I heard Chen Yuanqi has an old mother, right?

58
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:16,039
Where does she live?

59
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:17,539
Feiyun Village.

60
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,139
I'll show you the way, Senior Brother.

61
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,060
Don't rush, we're not done yet.

62
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,800
Let's finish this first, then go.

63
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,500
You're annoying.

64
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,259
Senior Brother.

65
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,719
Where am I?

66
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,180
Am I dead?

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,560
Why?

68
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,039
Why?

69
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,560
Why did you do this to me?

70
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,599
Because this is fate.

71
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:11,180
What's wrong, insect?

72
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:12,639
Not willing to accept it?

73
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,000
Want to climb up?

74
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,079
Who are you?

75
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,939
Below the Cliff of Despair.

76
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,439
Hetu Heavenly Book.

77
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,399
Celestial Goddess.

78
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,319
Can change your fate.

79
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,300
Hetu Heavenly Book.

80
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:35,959
Celestial Goddess.

81
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,240
Old woman

82
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,860
Your son stole a spiritual herb from me.

83
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
Wait for Yuanqi to return.

84
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,560
I'll get to the bottom of this.

85
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:52,300
That useless fool won't come back.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,720
He was caught by me and jumped off the cliff in shame.

87
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:56,300
Below the Cliff of Despair,

88
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,420
is a bottomless abyss.

89
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,560
He must be dead, not even a body left.

90
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,939
Young Master Fu, please beg the sect for mercy.

91
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,079
You've worked hard your whole life.

92
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,740
But you were born poor.

93
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,399
It's hard to cross the gap between noble families and commoners.

94
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,279
A chasm as vast as a mountain.

95
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:12,220
Your whole family is doomed

96
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:14,139
to be bullied to death.

97
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,620
What?

98
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,720
I've seen hundreds of people with supposed destiny end up here.

99
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,040
All wanted to change their fate.

100
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:25,199
None died well.

101
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:26,480
Give up.

102
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,240
I'll put in a word with the King of Hell.

103
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,939
So you can be reborn into a better life.

104
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,019
No, don't!

105
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:33,040
Don't!

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,579
Don't!

107
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,339
My mother is still waiting for me to come home.

108
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,639
I can't let those who hurt my family

109
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,779
get what they want.

110
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,019
Your meridians and inner core are destroyed.

111
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,199
Your only chance to change your fate

112
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,800
is to cultivate the Reverse Immortal Ascension Art.

113
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:52,879
What?

114
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,019
Reverse...

115
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,720
Reverse Immortal Ascension Art.

116
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:57,560
That's right.

117
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,759
It's a violent technique.

118
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,379
If you fail, you'll be destroyed body and soul.

119
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,720
Do you dare?

120
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,480
If this is the fate of us poor folk,

121
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,899
then the path to change fate

122
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,139
even if it's a road through hell,

123
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,480
I'll still take it.

124
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:28,959
You chose this path yourself.

125
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,439
Boy, don't regret it.

126
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:33,160
Borrow the power of heaven and earth.

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,439
Let the Heavenly Book enter your body.

128
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:18,379
Another lowly horse has been burned to death.

129
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,639
There are always so many poor fools who overestimate themselves.

130
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,259
Born as insignificant as ants.

131
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,740
Why risk your life for nothing?

132
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,459
I didn't expect this.

133
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:37,959
A tough one emerged among the lowly.

134
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:39,319
Divine Lady,

135
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,459
Did I pass?

136
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:43,860
Boy,

137
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:46,139
You have mastered the first stage of the Reverse Immortal Ascension Art.

138
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,959
For now, you are invincible among your peers.

139
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,160
You can even fight those a level above you.

140
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,220
But you have only just begun.

141
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,040
From now on, maintain your inner harmony.

142
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,819
Then you can see me within your mind.

143
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,560
But don't bother me unless it's important.

144
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,139
Fate isn't so easily changed.

145
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,540
How far you go depends on you.

146
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,740
After all, it's heaven's will.

147
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,540
Your fate is not a fortunate one.

148
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,519
Kings and nobles—

149
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,420
Are they truly born great?

150
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,939
My fate is mine to control, not heaven's.

151
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,559
Those who insult my mother—

152
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,759
must die.

153
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,820
Mother!

154
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:53,419
Mother!

155
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,419
Mother!

156
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:57,179
My son...

157
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,000
Chen Yuanqi!

158
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,879
You're actually still alive!

159
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:01,879
Mother!

160
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:03,679
Mother, are you alright?

161
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm fine.

162
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,279
Not only am I alive,

163
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
I will also make you treacherous pair

164
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,879
pay the price.
