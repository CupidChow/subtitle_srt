1
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,420
Mother

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:22,960
Mother

3
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:24,719
Mother

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,800
Why are you here?

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,239
Mother

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,079
Mother

7
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:33,380
Mother

8
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:36,420
Sect Leader

9
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,039
Why is my mother like this?

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,719
You should ask your mother

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,100
why her soul was sacrificed to Dugu Zhantian

12
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:44,219
and still survived.

13
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:45,500
Sect Leader

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,840
How do you know

15
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,280
my mother's soul was sacrificed to Dugu Zhantian?

16
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:51,979
I also know

17
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,299
someone took the remnants of your mother's soul

18
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,119
the undigested part

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,280
and combined it with Spirit Hound flesh to make a Spirit Hound Pill

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,060
which saved your mother's life.

21
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,140
Spirit Hound Pill

22
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,939
The Spirit Hound clan is full of treasures.

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,859
Their flesh and blood can be used as spiritual medicine.

24
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,159
It can boost cultivation.

25
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,680
And heal serious injuries.

26
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,560
But the Spirit Hound clan

27
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,540
has always been friendly with our people.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,959
There are no permanent allies,

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,180
only eternal interests.

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,000
Lord Dugu Zhantian

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,099
He thinks highly of you.

32
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:26,799
As long as you know your place,

33
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:29,260
you can take your mother away right now.

34
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,000
Sect Leader

35
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,599
What did you just say?

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,540
You called Dugu Zhantian "Lord"?

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,879
You're colluding with the Demon Sect!

38
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,659
Colluding? That's such an ugly word.

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,739
A wise man submits to circumstances.

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,500
A hundred years ago, the strongest heads of the four great clans all died in battle.

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,019
Only then was the Demon Lord sealed.

42
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,519
Now the Lord has returned.

43
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,280
The descendants of the four clans are far weaker than before.

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,980
The merit of backing the rising power

45
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,159
is something I don't want to miss.

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,520
You're right.

47
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:14,860
So, Lord Dugu Zhantian

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,860
where is he now?

49
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,360
The Lord is in seclusion.

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,099
Yuanqi

51
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:24,240
As long as you serve us,

52
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,439
I can free you from your Lowborn Swordsman Status

53
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,699
and make you a clan disciple.

54
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,560
You'll enjoy endless wealth and glory.

55
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:33,680
Bring the wine.

56
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:41,099
Come.

57
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:42,659
Drink this cup.

58
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,240
From now on, we'll be allies.

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,699
Sect Leader

60
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,379
The wine is good,

61
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,479
but for me, Chen Yuanqi,

62
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,860
my mother

63
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,319
is not a bargaining chip.

64
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,099
Your mother is missing a soul and a spirit.

65
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,879
If you agree,

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,800
when the Lord rules the world,

67
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:15,400
he can heal your mother.

68
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,340
What do you say?

69
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:17,360
And the Spirit Hound clan?

70
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,580
What will happen to them?

71
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,379
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

72
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:24,639
They're just spirit beasts.

73
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,360
If they die, so be it.

74
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,139
What if

75
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,379
I refuse?

76
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,379
I'm sincere.

77
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,300
And I don't want to be disappointed.

78
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,780
Fine.

79
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,020
Sect Leader

80
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,699
I understand what you mean.

81
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,580
This first cup

82
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,300
I offer to my mother.

83
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,699
Failing to protect her is my shame.

84
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,939
But I will stand tall as a true man.

85
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,039
I will never let my mother down.

86
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,960
This second cup,

87
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,460
I offer to the fallen Spirit Hounds,

88
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,939
and to those

89
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,160
slain by the Fu Clan

90
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,139
and the Demon Sect—innocent lives lost.

91
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,199
I, Chen Yuanqi, know right from wrong.

92
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,519
One day,

93
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,420
I will avenge them.

94
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,100
This third cup,

95
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:39,699
I offer to the gods,

96
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,860
to the heavens above who witness all.

97
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,120
Listen well, Tang Tianyuan.

98
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,980
There should be no rich or poor among our people.

99
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,199
But even if there is,

100
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,660
I’ll use my sword

101
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,160
to carve out a world where all stand equal,

102
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,139
where the poor have a place.

103
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,800
Mark my words—

104
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:09,399
from this day on,

105
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,980
I am your enemy, and the Tianyuan Sect is mine.

106
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:19,000
Mother,

107
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:20,920
I’m taking you home.

108
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,339
Get him!

109
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,300
Cripple him!

110
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,660
Chen Yuanqi!

111
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,279
Will you serve the Lord of the Demon Sect or not?

112
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,220
I, Chen Yuanqi,

113
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,540
swear I never will!

114
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,560
Then I’ll grant your wish.

115
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,259
How pathetic.

116
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,540
Lie Shumei.

117
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:15,000
Thank you.

118
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,360
I didn’t save you by choice.

119
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,420
The Chiyou Sword wouldn’t let you die.

120
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,740
But

121
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,639
I can’t stand this bunch of bastards even more.

122
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,339
They’re even more of an eyesore.

123
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:25,459
Fine.

124
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,759
Lie Shumei,

125
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,680
let’s fight our way out together!

126
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,860
Go!

127
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:22,279
Wait, Yuanqi.

128
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,740
Your mother's soul is broken and lost.

129
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,639
Don’t you want to save your mother?

130
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,779
How can I save her?

131
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,439
It’s not certain who will die yet.

132
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,000
All’s fair in war.

133
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,160
You’re draining my power.

134
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,199
All’s fair in war—I learned it from you.

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,860
Spare me.

136
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,939
I was wrong.

137
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,519
I know the Guanghan Jiang Clan has a treasure.

138
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,540
The Soul Jade.

139
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,459
It can mend souls.

140
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,339
Let me live.

141
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,680
I’ll serve you.

142
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,079
I’ll help you get the treasure.

143
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,180
My lord.

144
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,180
I beg you.

145
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,120
Sounds like a good offer.

146
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,620
Hard to refuse, isn’t it?

147
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,600
How *wise*, Yuanqi.

148
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,220
No.

149
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,139
My lord.

150
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,259
Then put down your sword.

151
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,800
What a pity.

152
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,279
To join forces with a righteous parasite like you—

153
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,579
I fear my mother would think me filthy.

154
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:24,339
What do you mean?

155
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:25,839
I mean—

156
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,379
I’ll take the Soul Jade myself.

157
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:31,139
You will die today.

158
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,899
Brother Yuanqi,

159
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,000
Brother Yuanqi,

160
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,659
Don’t scare me.

161
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,000
Wake up, Brother Yuanqi!

162
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Brother Yuanqi!

163
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,659
Wake up, Brother Yuanqi!

164
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,720
His soul is on the verge of shattering.

165
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,159
He’s doomed to die.

166
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,159
Let me possess his body instead.

167
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,659
That way, his body won’t be destroyed.

168
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:27,299
No, you can’t!

169
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,419
Step aside.

170
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:30,980
You just want to save your own people.

171
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,200
If I possess him, I can help you save them too.

172
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,399
But you’re not him.

173
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:34,899
You—

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,480
Then don’t blame me for being ruthless.
