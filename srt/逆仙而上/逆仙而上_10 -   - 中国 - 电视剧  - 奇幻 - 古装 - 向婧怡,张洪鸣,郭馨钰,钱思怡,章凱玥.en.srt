1
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:17,420
What are you doing?

2
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:31,600
What's going on?

3
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,100
Why is the Chi You Sword controlling my mind?

4
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,619
This sword has a temper.

5
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:41,039
It wants to help its master.

6
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:42,920
Because its master was bullied.

7
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:50,240
What are you doing?

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,299
No!

9
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,340
Where did Lie Shumei go?

10
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,540
Finally found you.

11
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,519
Chen Yuanqi.

12
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,140
Xiao Qiu.

13
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,239
Xiao Qiu seems to be under a spell.

14
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,640
Today is the day you die.

15
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,840
What's happening?

16
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,340
Why do I feel so weak?

17
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,260
Goddess.

18
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,680
I just escaped one danger and fell into another.

19
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,319
What should I do?

20
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:03,359
Come.

21
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,040
This one will teach you a Summoning Art.

22
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,040
Summoning Art?

23
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,139
Could it be...

24
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:13,939
Sister Goddess,

25
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,319
Are you coming out with me?

26
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:17,340
To fight everyone together?

27
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,500
You're going to show up yourself?

28
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:21,840
So you'll go out with me?

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,080
You'll fight them with me?

30
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,340
Something like that.

31
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,719
Repeat after me.

32
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:30,879
Divine light shines bright.

33
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,919
Sword echoes through the sky.

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,300
Destined Sword Spirit.

35
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:34,639
Break through the void and appear.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,500
Say it quickly!

37
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,379
Divine light shines bright, sword echoes through the sky.

38
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,879
Destined Sword Spirit, break through the void and appear.

39
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,400
Goddess.

40
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,599
It's up to you now.

41
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:58,560
Goddess.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,120
Why does your figure look so amazing all of a sudden?

43
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,960
Open your eyes and see who I really am!

44
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:05,840
Lie... Lie...

45
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,199
Lie Shumei.

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,120
You... you...

47
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,620
Saintess, spare me!

48
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,939
We're from the Demon Sect too!

49
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:20,860
Fine.

50
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,240
If you kill Chen Yuanqi,

51
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:24,599
I won't take your lives.

52
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,479
Goddess.

53
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,259
Come out and save me!

54
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,939
No one can save you.

55
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:34,280
Kill!

56
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,319
Saintess!

57
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,960
We promise to keep your secret.

58
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,080
Please don't kill us!

59
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,080
We can swear a Heart Demon Oath!

60
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,020
I don't want to kill you either.

61
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,139
But my body isn't under my control.

62
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,020
Dodge!

63
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:58,939
That's Lie Shumei for you.

64
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,819
Slay them all!

65
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,000
Shut up!

66
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,199
You...

67
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,539
What are you going to do?

68
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,360
You...

69
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:16,959
You...

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,259
Goddess.

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,579
Save me!

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,439
Where did you go?

73
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,980
Lie Shumei wants to kill me!

74
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:25,980
Kid, relax.

75
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:27,019
Go pat her head.

76
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,540
Are you crazy?

77
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,259
I don't want to die yet.

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,199
You don't trust me?

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,500
Then don't come to me next time.

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,480
Don't...

81
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,639
I'm afraid if I pat her head, I'll never survive.

82
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,759
What are you afraid of?

83
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:41,220
She may have mastered her dream Divine Technique,

84
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,720
but the Divine Sword has countered her.

85
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,060
She has become your Sword Spirit.

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,639
So,

87
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,180
little brother, you're her master now.

88
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,620
Really?

89
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,920
I was wrong.

90
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,779
It really works!

91
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,579
Chen Yuanqi.

92
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,540
Get down!

93
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:11,920
Don't let me find an opportunity.

94
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,439
You...

95
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:13,720
Otherwise,

96
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,620
I'll make sure you die by a thousand cuts.

97
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,680
Fine.

98
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,180
We'll talk about that later.

99
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,600
You...

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,220
Meow like a cat for me first.

101
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:27,839
You're asking for trouble.

102
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,399
Meow.

103
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Does that really work?

104
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,660
Then...

105
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,300
Can I do something even more outrageous?

106
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,860
Chen Yuanqi.

107
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,459
If you dare touch me,

108
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,339
I'll make you pay for it.

109
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,680
Beast!

110
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,639
You... you...

111
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,300
Just like this...

112
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,279
What?

113
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,160
I'm helping you heal, isn't that good?

114
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,019
Bastard!

115
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,279
If I touch you, I'm a beast.

116
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,060
If I save you, I'm a bastard.

117
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,339
What do you want from me?

118
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,100
Alright then...

119
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,480
Help me with one more thing.

120
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,560
I knew it.

121
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,519
Shameless man.

122
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,879
What do you think about all day?

123
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,420
I just want you to break Xiao Qiu's Seal Spell.

124
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,579
How am I shameless?

125
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:46,259
I...

126
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,420
Chen Yuanqi.

127
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,319
Don't let me get a chance.

128
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,240
Or I'll possess your soul.

129
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,139
And destroy your Spiritual Soul.

130
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,699
Goddess.

131
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:14,379
Why can I sense her thoughts?

132
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,540
She's your Sword Spirit.

133
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,459
Your minds are connected.

134
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,540
She wants to possess and devour her master now.

135
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,160
How do I guard against her?

136
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,100
You can do as you please with her.

137
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,660
Familiarity breeds affection, doesn't it?

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,740
You...

139
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:28,980
Familiarity breeds affection?

140
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:30,560
Why do you talk so dirty?

141
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:32,660
Really?

142
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,339
Then have a nice life.

143
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,339
Get lost!

144
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,060
Alright.

145
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,620
Brother Yuanqi!

146
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,500
It's really you!

147
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:52,600
That's great!

148
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,319
Xiao Qiu, you're alright!

149
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,779
Brother Yuanqi is in trouble.

150
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,579
My clansmen...

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,740
All were captured by Dugu Zhantian.

152
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:05,959
What?

153
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,300
How did this happen?

154
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:10,300
I... I don't know either.

155
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,220
I...

156
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,480
I also saw people from Tianyuan Academy.

157
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,959
Xiao Qiu.

158
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,319
Don't worry.

159
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,819
I promise you,

160
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,860
I'll help you rescue your clansmen.

161
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,160
Brother Yuanqi.

162
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,720
It's so good to have you here.

163
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,240
So what do we do next?

164
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,159
Tianyuan Academy.

165
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,759
There might be clues about Dugu Zhantian.

166
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,340
With the divine sword in hand,

167
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,460
we might as well pay them a visit.

168
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:44,860
Alright.

169
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:58,519
Xiao Qiu.

170
00:08:59,159 --> 00:08:59,840
I'll go in first.

171
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:00,980
Wait for me here.

172
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:03,220
If I don't come out in an hour,

173
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,000
leave here immediately.

174
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,720
I'll wait for you right here.

175
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,539
I'm not going anywhere.

176
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:08,740
Brother Yuanqi.

177
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,620
I believe you can do it.

178
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,940
I'll wait here for your return.

179
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,919
Going alone is risky.

180
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,340
I'm just afraid someone won't come back.

181
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,059
Don't beg me to save you then.

182
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,559
Master of the Academy

183
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,259
Fu Bufan, Fu Qingyun, and others

184
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,820
slaughtered the Spirit Hound clan in Beast God Forest

185
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,259
and colluded with the Demonic Sect

186
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,419
Such actions

187
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,700
are undoubtedly tarnishing the century-old reputation of Tianyuan Academy

188
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,980
Master, please give us an explanation

189
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,779
I didn't expect this to happen

190
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,159
Yuanqi

191
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,340
What do you think should be done?

192
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,559
Yuanqi believes

193
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,879
the Fu family's deeds should be made known to the world

194
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,100
and

195
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,580
all Fu family disciples in the academy should be thoroughly investigated

196
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,240
to see if they have colluded with the Demonic Sect

197
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,220
Nonsense!

198
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,460
As an elder of Tianyuan Academy

199
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,100
and a member of the Fu family

200
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,159
how dare you tarnish the Fu family's reputation!

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,659
Master

202
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:28,519
if this person is not removed

203
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:29,960
the Fu family of Chang'an

204
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:31,679
will lose all face

205
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,159
Yuanqi, look at this

206
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,960
the filthy deeds your Fu family has committed

207
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,799
are you afraid the world will find out?

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,399
You...

209
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,440
Ignorant child!

210
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:44,720
Stop making baseless accusations!

211
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,860
Yuanqi, you...

212
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,980
Don't ruin the harmony

213
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,600
Yuanqi

214
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,360
I have someone here

215
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,200
who I want you to meet

216
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,519
Someone, come in!

217
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,519
Bring them in
