Okay.

You two better behave.

195
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,050
There are other people here.

Fine, you can continue
being lovey-dovey.

We're going out to make some purchases.

Hi, Yan.

213
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,250

217
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,651
and shouldn't waste time anymore.

218

Why are you here?

219
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:38,451
Uncle Yan is in the kitchen.

Okay.

Do you know how to make it?

226

Yes.

227
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,290
How are things at work?

228
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,730
Pretty okay.

229
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,050
Do you lack anything at home?

No.

you guys went to
the Civil Affairs Bureau this morning.

233
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,530
We finalized our divorce today.

234
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:07,090
Everyone will feel relieved

235
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:08,931
this way.

236
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:13,730
Junze,

237
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,931
I might leave

238
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:17,570
after a few days.

239
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,691
Where are you going?

240
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:23,931
I have a friend in Guangzhou

241
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:25,090
who made a fortune recently.

242
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,691
He started a restaurant there.

243
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,691
He always thinks I'm a good cook.

244
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,050
So he wanted to hire me

245
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,050
as his cook.

246
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,570
Since

247
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,090
I already did
what needed to be done here,

248
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:36,971
it's time for me to go too.

249
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,211
If you're just going to work,

250
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:44,411
it's better to stay.

251
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,090
It's not just about working.

252
00:27:49,611 --> 00:27:50,931
Actually,

253
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:52,050
I really like cooking.

254
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,411
If I work for him,

255
00:27:53,411 --> 00:27:54,770
I can bring my skills into play.

256
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,090
I think

257
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,691
it's pretty good to work

258
00:27:59,891 --> 00:28:00,810
as a cook.

259
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,171
I'll see you off

260
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:16,250
when you leave, then.

261
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:19,931
Okay.

262
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:35,770
Put more.

263
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,530
We're almost done.

264
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:38,691
We should go back now.

265
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,411
Let's buy some frozen pears.
My mum wants some.

266
00:28:41,411 --> 00:28:42,090
Okay.

267
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,090
Mister,

268
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,010
give me some frozen pears.

269
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:46,770
I'm sorry.

270
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,290
This madam has bought the last of them.

271
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:51,651
Madam, you bought a lot.

272
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:52,810
Can you leave some for us?

273
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,851
Oh, I can't.

274
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:54,810
My daughter is pregnant,

275
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,050
and she's craving them.

276
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,330
Madam, my family wants to eat it too.

277
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,090
It's a special circumstance.

278
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,371
Can you leave some for us?

279
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:03,971
What you crave determines
the gender of the baby.

280
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,851
Since it's for good luck,

281
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:06,691
I'll leave half for you.

282
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:07,411
It's not me.

283
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:08,570
I'm not the one who wants to eat it.

284
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,651
I can't believe you.

285
00:29:11,651 --> 00:29:12,730
How can you let a pregnant lady

286
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,010
come out in such cold weather?

287
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,451
Give half to her.

288
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:18,050
Okay.

289
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,730
I'll be careful next time.

290
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:21,490
Scan the code here.

291
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,490
- Okay.
- It's 20 yuan.

292
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,651
- Okay
- I'll carry them.

293
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:26,570
- Thank you.
- No problem.

294
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,250
Thank you.

295
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:28,131
Thanks.

296
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,931
Did you hear what that madam said?

297
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:44,891
You shouldn't take me out
in cold weather like this.

298
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:46,211
You should do the purchases yourself.

299
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,490
Okay.

300
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:48,691
Pregnant lady,

301
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:50,010
I'll pay more attention next time.

302
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,691
Tell me if Aunt Hui wants

303
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:54,451
to eat frozen pears.

304
00:29:54,451 --> 00:29:55,451
I'll buy them for her.

305
00:29:58,411 --> 00:29:59,971
Actually, my mum doesn't like it.

306
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:01,971
My dad liked it.

307
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,290
Before my dad passed away,

308
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,211
he kept asking for frozen pears.

309
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,371
But my mum said
it wasn't good for his stomach.

310
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,050
So she didn't let him eat it.

311
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:16,010
After my dad is gone,

312
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:19,131
it's my mum's turn wanting to eat it.

313
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,490
When I first arrived here,

314
00:30:26,211 --> 00:30:27,530
you were freeloading at home,

315
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,050
Yan came back to work,

316
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,211
and Mi Lan had nowhere to go.

317
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:35,931
When I recall all these,
it feels like a dream.

318
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:38,290
If my dad didn't pass away,

319
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,411
I wish

320
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:42,691
I would never wake up from this dream.

321
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,931
Mu Zili,

322
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,770
luckily your family has you
after Uncle Mu passed away.

323
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:52,451
Isn't this the reason

324
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:54,971
you came to this universe?

325
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,411
But we're leaving soon.

326
00:31:05,611 --> 00:31:06,931
March the 1st

327
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:09,330
will arrive soon.

328
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:11,050
Before we leave,

329
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,211
shouldn't we take care

330
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:14,490
of everything here?

331
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,971
Including our restaurant.

332
00:31:19,371 --> 00:31:22,090
Yan knows our situation.

333
00:31:22,651 --> 00:31:23,931
But I think

334
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:29,010
it's hard for the rest
to understand or accept it.

335
00:31:32,371 --> 00:31:33,891
Shouldn't we have interfered

336
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:36,010
in their lives?

337
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,411
Isn't that Uncle Yingjun?

338
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:00,171
Yes, Daqian.

339
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:00,971
What's the matter?

340
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:02,651
Dad, where are you?

341
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,290
I'm

342
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:07,691
eating with my friend

343
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,290
at the restaurant.

344
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:11,810
What have you been doing these two days?

345
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,171
I wasn't doing anything.

346
00:32:13,611 --> 00:32:15,010
I've been looking for a job.

347
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:17,131
Are you going for interviews or eating?

348
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,250
Shouldn't we socialize before anything?

349
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,451
Well, I have to go now.

350
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:22,691
We'll talk at night.

351
00:32:27,651 --> 00:32:28,330
Lizi,

352
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:30,090
follow that auto rickshaw.

353
00:32:57,971 --> 00:32:59,090
Thank you, mister.

354
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,330
You're welcome.

355
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,931
(Xilaile Band)
Sorry, I'm late.

356
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:27,810
(Xilaile Band)
You're early.

357
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,611
(Xilaile Band)
There you are.

358
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,371
I bought some fruits for you guys.

359
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:31,371
Thank you.

360
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,411
Let's practice first.

361
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:36,730
(Xilaile Band)
Then we'll enjoy the fruits, okay?

362
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,330
(Xilaile Band)
Okay.

363
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,171
What is my dad doing here?

364
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:42,651
Isn't this the company

365
00:33:42,651 --> 00:33:44,131
that handled my dad's funeral?

366
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,730
I came here once to look
for an opening for my dad.

367
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:47,971
Is your dad interested

368
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:49,770
in this field?

369
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,971
Of course, not.

370
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,770
I caused a misunderstanding

371
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,891
by bringing him here.

372
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,931
He even threw a fit at me.

373
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,651
It surly sounds like something you'd do.

374
00:33:58,891 --> 00:34:00,810
The trumpet will go first
with the F key.

375
00:34:01,211 --> 00:34:01,971
Ready.

376
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:37,851
What do you think?

377
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,331
I'd never expected

378
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:40,931
he'd work in this field.

379
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,050
On the day of the funeral,

380
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,570
he played a song.

381
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:48,690
I thought

382
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,451
he played it
because he was being emotional.

383
00:34:50,971 --> 00:34:52,371
It doesn't look like it now.

384
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:53,690
He looks like

385
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,291
he committed to playing funeral songs.

386
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:57,371
It's his first formal job

387
00:34:57,371 --> 00:34:59,210
since he was laid off.

388
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,610
I think it's pretty good.

389
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,570
Actually,
Uncle Yingjun is pretty reliable.

390
00:35:10,411 --> 00:35:12,771
Previously, I didn't even see him
for one last time.

391
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,650
I felt I owed him too much.

392
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:19,010
Back here, I saw him again.

393
00:35:20,971 --> 00:35:21,851
I can't tell

394
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:24,371
if he's really my dad.

395
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,291
I only hope

396
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,971
when I leave this place,

397
00:35:31,771 --> 00:35:33,251
he'll be in good health,

398
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,771
live peacefully with my mum,

399
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,971
and find a new direction in life.

400
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,650
I can't stay with him.

401
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:43,570
So long it's something
he really wants to do,

402
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,170
I'll support him unconditionally.

403
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:49,931
They've walked with us for some time,

404
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:52,291
and so have we.

405
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,331
It's good enough

406
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:55,411
if we remember the good things

407
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,291
during our encounter.

408
00:35:58,331 --> 00:35:59,210
That's what my dad said.

409
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:05,251
I understand.

410
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:10,690
Let our presence

411
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:14,090
be a secret in this world.

412
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:16,291
Let's not interfere in their lives.

413
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,090
Okay.

414
00:36:17,891 --> 00:36:20,610
After the other "us" return,

415
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,650
they will naturally

416
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:23,771
go on living their way.

417
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,490
We rarely agree on anything.

418
00:36:28,731 --> 00:36:30,610
We'll always agree
with each other after this.

419
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:45,891
Mum,

420
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:47,490
eat more.

421
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:48,530
Eat more.

422
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,371
Daqian, have more vitamins.

423
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:51,130
Thank you, dad.

424
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:53,891
Dad,

425
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,130
what have you been doing lately?

426
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,170
What do you mean?

427
00:36:58,451 --> 00:36:59,971
You've been going out every day.

428
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,371
Have you found a new job?

429
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:02,811
Why don't you tell us about it?

430
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:04,891
I'm still looking for a job.

431
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:06,291
I don't believe you.

432
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,731
You've been wearing a suit
while carrying a bag every day.

433
00:37:07,731 --> 00:37:09,130
Don't tell me you were out for a walk.

434
00:37:09,891 --> 00:37:11,451
If I don't wear my suit,

435
00:37:11,451 --> 00:37:12,210
it'll go moldy.

436
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,210
So I wore it to dry it under the sun.

437
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,130
So Mr. Zheng,
the financial tycoon of the Northeast,

438
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,090
where have you been making
a fortune lately?

439
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:18,090
Dad, don't keep

440
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:18,931
the good news to yourself.

441
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:19,971
Just tell the truth.

442
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,210
Zheng Daqian,

443
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:22,371
what's there to tell?

444
00:37:22,371 --> 00:37:23,331
Fine. Since you don't want to tell,

445
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:24,170
I'll tell for you.

446
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,371
Mum, my dad found a new job.

447
00:37:25,371 --> 00:37:26,931
I heard the pay is not bad.

448
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:30,570
What job?

449
00:37:30,891 --> 00:37:31,490
Dad,

450
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,291
are you going back
to music industry again?

451
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,490
No, I'm not.

452
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,490
Don't listen to her.

453
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,451
It's just a job in the service industry.

454
00:37:37,451 --> 00:37:39,490
It's something
like doing music performances.

455
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,371
One for all, all for one. Am I right?

456
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,570
You finally know
how to be considerate of others now?

457
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,931
Do you perform every day?

458
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,411
The performance is not fixed.

459
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:50,411
I get a few days off in a week.

460
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,451
Where do you perform?

461
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:53,210
Well,

462
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,371
Baihe...

463
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,130
Where?

464
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,811
There are many performers.

465
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,291
Tell me where it is.

466
00:38:01,851 --> 00:38:02,811
Baihe Funeral Home.

467
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,170
You better be serious

468
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,210
and tell me properly.

469
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,010
Where exactly is that place?

470
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,130
Xilaile Funeral Service Company.

471
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:11,490
My dad has been leading
their rehearsals every day.

472
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,411
Mum,

473
00:38:12,411 --> 00:38:13,130
my dad has become...

474
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,411
Funeral service, right?

475
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,170
So you're wailing at funerals?

476
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,331
Zheng Yingjun.

477
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:21,331
Mum.

478
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:22,371
Zheng Yingjun, would you die

479
00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:23,411
if you don't upset me?

480
00:38:23,411 --> 00:38:24,650
Mum, he isn't wailing.

481
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,010
It's a music performance.

482
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,690
I don't care
if he is wailing or singing.

483
00:38:29,411 --> 00:38:31,210
What were you thinking?

484
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,331
I told you to find a job.

485
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:33,650
But you chose to work
at a funeral company.

486
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,610
Are you trying to kill me?

487
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,570
Do you really want me

488
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,490
to go to Shenzhen?

489
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,931
Do you really think I should go away?

490
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:39,530
Am I right?

491
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,331
Fine. From now on,

492
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:41,731
I'll fulfill your wish.

493
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:42,570
From now on,

494
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,530
you can do whatever you want.

495
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,530
Do whatever!

496
00:38:44,731 --> 00:38:45,411
Mum!

497
00:38:45,411 --> 00:38:46,130
What is this?

498
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:46,971
Why...

499
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,210
That's not what I expected.

500
00:38:58,893 --> 00:39:02,893
(Baihe Convenience Store)

501
00:39:23,851 --> 00:39:24,650
Dad,

502
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:27,090
I only wanted to make mum happy

503
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,570
by telling her.

504
00:39:32,931 --> 00:39:35,130
You just have
too little experience in fighting.

505
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:36,931
I planned to tell her some other time.

506
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,291
You got me into trouble

507
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,130
by helping me out.

508
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:43,931
I don't know what to do anymore.

509
00:39:49,771 --> 00:39:52,090
You can't bear my mum leaving, right?

510
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,610
I've been holding
your mum back half her life.

511
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,411
If she really wants to go,

512
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:02,851
can I even stop her?

513
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:06,570
I want to leave

514
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,010
a good impression before she leaves.

515
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,570
So that she knows
I'm on the right track.

516
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:12,130
When she leaves,

517
00:40:13,331 --> 00:40:14,971
she could think of my good side.

518
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,931
Daqian,

519
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:24,090
be honest with me.

520
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,090
Do you also think

521
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:27,891
I shouldn't work there?

522
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,451
Of course, not.

523
00:40:29,811 --> 00:40:31,451
My dad has finally found
what he wants to do

524
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:33,050
and made a living honestly.

525
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,851
There's nothing wrong with that.

526
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:40,251
My mum is too outdated.

527
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:42,291
She blew up in anger over little things.

528
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:43,811
You can't blame your mum for that.

529
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,650
People have their own levels
of accepting certain ideas.

530
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,050
We're not young people like you,

531
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,610
who have sharp minds, less burden,
and are quick-witted.

532
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,291
Am I right?

533
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,331
Then can you finally accept it now?

534
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:09,650
After your Uncle Mu left,

535
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,690
I feel empty inside.

536
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,170
I suddenly lost someone
I could depend on.

537
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:20,130
I never thought

538
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,331
what he said was right back then.

539
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:23,931
After he's gone,

540
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,210
I always see

541
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:28,610
images of him

542
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,971
advising me earnestly.

543
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:32,771
He wanted me

544
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,971
to find a stable job

545
00:41:37,771 --> 00:41:39,251
and live peacefully with your mum.

546
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,291
He asked me to speak nicely

547
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:43,090
and don't fight.

548
00:41:50,731 --> 00:41:51,931
He was wordy

549
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,371
in a leisurely manner.

550
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,731
Sometimes, I think

551
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,771
the people Uncle Mu worried

552
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,090
about the most were Aunt Hui

553
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,851
and you.

554
00:42:11,411 --> 00:42:13,090
You've been best friends all your lives.

555
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:24,411
Dad.

556
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:28,731
You must live earnestly.

557
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:32,010
You must not let Uncle Mu worry.

558
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:35,811
You must not let me worry.

559
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:38,411
I know.

560
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,690
I won't let you two worry about me.

561
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,291
Daqian,

562
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,010
guess what?

563
00:42:54,331 --> 00:42:56,451
The funeral industry

564
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:59,210
is more modern than before.

565
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:02,210
I like this job.

566
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,731
It reminds me of
my days in the troupe.

567
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,530
And

568
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,690
whispering and playing the music

569
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:14,610
for the departed

570
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:17,731
is something I find very meaningful.

571
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,010
My dad is all grown up now.

572
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:24,690
The old Zheng

573
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,170
wouldn't talk to me

574
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,490
about something meaningful.

575
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,530
You've reached a higher level in life.

576
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:33,371
No manners.

577
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:36,050
All right.

578
00:43:36,971 --> 00:43:38,971
