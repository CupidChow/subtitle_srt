Here are some buns from our restaurant.

171
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,060
They're for free.

172
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,500
Have some while you wait.

173
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,770
Have some while waiting.

174
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,380
Okay.

175
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,890
Your food will be ready soon.

176
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,530
Don't worry.

177
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,650
- Okay.
- Let's eat this bun as we wait.

178
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,700
Your food will be ready soon.

179
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,770
Don't worry.

180
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,450
I'm starving.

181
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,770
Today's business is really good.

182
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,700
I don't even want to talk about it.

183
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,620
Help us out here.

184
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,260
Why are there only two dishes?

185
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,020
I'll get it done soon.

186
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,380
Why don't you serve
these two dishes first?

187
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,890
Okay, I'll send these two out first.

188
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,620
Wait.

189
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,140
The order says shredded pork
with garlic sauce rice.

190
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,530
Why did you make shredded pork
with green peppers?

191
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,290
The fried shredded potato
with vinegar

192
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,620
becomes fried shredded potato
with chilies.

193
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,740
I'll make them again.

194
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,820
No, it's already very late.

195
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,380
I'll serve these two dishes first.

196
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,330
I'll give them discounts
if they complain.

197
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,210
Okay, that'll work.

198
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,050
It's full of people.

199
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,140
Mu Zili, why didn't you watch
where you were going?

200
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,930
You must be from the construction site.

201
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,930
Yes.

202
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,140
I'm the restaurant manager.

203
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,570
We'll give you 20% off
for all the dishes.

204
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,530
- Nice!
- Thanks!

205
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,860
Dad, I need you in the kitchen.

206
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,770
But I'm serving the customers.

207
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,290
We don't have time for that.
We're in trouble.

208
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,570
- What happened?
- Hurry up.

209
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,980
What happened?

210
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,260
It's an emergency.

211
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,770
Dad, how do we clean up this mess?

212
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,810
Give me the order.

213
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,690
Let's order some takeouts.

214
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,070
(Closed)

215
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,050
Who ordered takeout?

216
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:48,980
Over here.

217
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,980
Come here.

218
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,770
Be careful not to spill it.

219
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,650
Arrange them nicely.

220
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,170
A total loss.

221
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,220
Zili,

222
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,890
this is called the big picture.

223
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,500
The food is good today.

224
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,770
Yes, it's very good.

225
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,810
Not bad.

226
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,620
Are you full?

227
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,460
Yes.

228
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,020
Mister,

229
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,020
how was the food?

230
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,770
They're good. But it took too long.

231
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,860
We just opened.

232
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,410
We'll make it quicker
when you come again next time.

233
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:36,740
Okay.

234
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,530
Please come again.

235
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,380
- Okay.
- We'll come again.

236
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,460
Come again.

237
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,050
Bye-bye.

238
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,220
Go back inside. Aren't you cold?

239
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,170
Daqian.

240
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,930
What do you want?

241
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,410
There's something
I need to tell her in person.

242
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,980
She's not interested
to hear what you have to say.

243
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,290
Daqian, you've changed.

244
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,620
You're more beautiful now.

245
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,380
Do you know

246
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,570
how hard it was for me to find you?

247
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,980
I called you more than 60 times

248
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,500
and sent more than 50 text messages.

249
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,340
You didn't answer my calls
or reply to my text.

250
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,170
(What a glib.)

251
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,290
(No wonder that Zheng Daqian
was fooled.)

252
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,020
From Ningzhou to Baihe,

253
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,410
that's 2338.9km.

254
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,650
I came all the way

255
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,050
just to see you.

256
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,770
Since you're good at numbers,

257
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,770
why don't you count
the interest you owe me?

258
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,980
Can I go inside and have a seat?

259
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,050
No, you're not welcome.

260
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,340
Come in.

261
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,650
Take a seat.

262
00:11:59,170 --> 00:11:59,810
What is it?

263
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,650
I haven't eaten all day

264
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,100
just to look for you.

265
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,340
Can you serve me some food?

266
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,980
We're closed.

267
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,100
The business hour is over.

268
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,890
You're closed during the day.

269
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,570
I just saw your customers leaving.

270
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,460
Fine.

271
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,050
What do you want to eat?

272
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,340
Just order.

273
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,770
Let me see.

274
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,690
I'll have the salmon salad, then.

275
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,740
Is the salmon fresh?

276
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,260
Yes.

277
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,380
One grilled steak, medium rare.

278
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,740
Any recommendations for your wine?

279
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,890
If you don't,

280
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,650
I'll have this one, then.

281
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,500
This wine.

282
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,290
Any allergies?

283
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,220
Yes.

284
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,740
Allergic to not having you around.

285
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,340
What's wrong?

286
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,650
What's wrong with you?

287
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,170
He's spending money so let him eat.

288
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,740
We're doing business anyway.

289
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,290
It's foolish not to do his business.

290
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,260
You're the fool.

291
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,220
Do you remember what you told me?

292
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,100
You said you'll tell him to get lost

293
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,740
if you see him again.

294
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,530
Look at what you're doing now.

295
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,810
You're cooking for him
the moment you see him.

296
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,260
I'll explain it to you later.

297
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,100
Where's my dad?

298
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,050
Uncle Yingjun is upstairs.

299
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,740
He said he was hungry.

300
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,140
I'll send this food to him.

301
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,460
Daqian, there's a customer.

302
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,980
Tell him to wait. We're out of plates.

303
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,220
Are you done working?

304
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,380
What's wrong?

305
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,620
You might have to wait for a while.

306
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:40,930
Why?

307
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,930
The kitchen is understaffed.
We're too busy to wash the dishes.

308
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,860
So we're already out of plates.

309
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,620
I see.

310
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,810
Why don't I help you?

311
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,860
I'm free now.

312
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,650
Really?

313
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,020
That's great.

314
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,860
Come with me.

315
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,340
Wash the dishes

316
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,260
and clean up wherever needed.

317
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:58,860
Are you okay with that?

318
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,620
No problem.

319
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,340
Where are you taking him?

320
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,740
To the kitchen.

321
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,810
The kitchen area
is for authorized personnel only.

322
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,380
I only ask him to help us clean up.

323
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,020
Listen.

324
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,050
We don't welcome you.

325
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,140
You better pay back the money and leave.

326
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,860
Chill, man.

327
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,690
I'm only here to help.
You don't have to be upset.

328
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,460
He's right.

329
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,050
Come here.

330
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,340
You can start washing

331
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,570
all the dishes

332
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,460
in this sink

333
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,530
and mop the floor.

334
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,770
Thanks, Guan Zhe.

335
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,290
So you're Guan Zhe.

336
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,380
What are you doing here?

337
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,460
I'm here to help out.

338
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,980
I can do this myself.

339
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,050
I don't need your help.

340
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:53,690
Tell him to leave.

341
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,140
Oh, I know you.

342
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,530
You're Yan Junze,

343
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,220
the so-called childhood friend

344
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,050
who was obsessed with Daqian, right?

345
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,530
Yes.

346
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,170
I may be her boyfriend after this.

347
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,100
I might be her husband in the future.

348
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,740
You're pretty good
at seizing opportunities.

349
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,050
Did she say yes?

350
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,340
Enough already. Start doing the dishes.

351
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,380
There are so many dishes.

352
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,100
♪You are like a fire in winter♪

353
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,860
Who's this handsome guy?

354
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,340
Dad, you have no business here.

355
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,460
Why don't you go and get some rest?

356
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,500
Why aren't you introducing him to me?

357
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,690
Uncle Zheng,

358
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,020
I'm Daqian's good friend.

359
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,740
I heard you started a restaurant.

360
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,340
So I came here to help out.

361
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,650
I can take care of the cleaning.

362
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,500
You can get some rest.

363
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,220
Friend?

364
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,530
Your friend is not bad.

365
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,690
Yes, not bad.

366
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,340
He's capable of hard work
and sacrifices himself for others.

367
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,620
Let's go and get some rest.

368
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,810
He likes doing things alone.

369
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,890
He won't be able to get things done.

370
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,890
He's very efficient working alone.

371
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,380
Come on, let's go.

372
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,220
I don't think that's a good idea.

373
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,570
Not at all.

374
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,170
Wait a minute.

375
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,050
You look so familiar.

376
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,050
Have we met before?

377
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,530
Me?

378
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,290
We did have

379
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,890
a close relationship in the past.

380
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,650
I'm Guan Zhe.

381
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,980
So you're Guan Zhe.

382
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,140
You scumbag!

383
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,460
Dad! Dad!

384
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,930
Calm down. Calm down.

385
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,860
Have you forgotten
what you did to my daughter?

386
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,810
How can you come here

387
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,260
and surrender yourself so shamelessly?

388
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,890
Dad, he's here to pay back the money.

389
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,650
You played around
with my daughter's feelings.

390
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,020
You swindled her money
and took advantage of her.

391
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,100
You're one lying little dirtbag.

392
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,410
I'm going to beat you up today.

393
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:39,860
Dad! Dad! Dad!

394
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,980
Please don't. Don't.

395
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,890
I'm here to pay back the money.

396
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,170
Take this 10,000 yuan first.

397
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,020
I'll pay back the rest.

398
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,810
It's only right to pay what you owe.

399
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,100
But I still want

400
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,050
to settle scores with you!

401
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,220
Dad! Dad! Dad!

402
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,050
Go back now. Leave here to me.

403
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,220
Don't worry.

404
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,690
Here.

405
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,620
You can start doing the dishes.

406
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,940
(Starry Sky Restaurant)

407
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
(Starry Sky Restaurant)
Thank you for today.

408
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,570
The food at your restaurant
is really good.

409
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,090
Thank you for today too.

410
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
You should go back now.

411
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,090
I'll pay you back slowly.

412
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:27,980
Okay.

413
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:30,940
What are you doing?

414
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,660
Your hair is messy.

415
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,500
I'm glad to see

416
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,220
you're fine.

417
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,180
Since you're done looking at me,

418
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,570
you can go back now.

419
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,370
After parting with you, I realized

420
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,980
I couldn't live without you.

421
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,130
I realized

422
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,940
that no new romance can be compared

423
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,330
to our sweet simple life.

424
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,290
(Guan Zhe of this time and space
is fulsome.)

425
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,980
I know I made a mistake.
Can you forgive me?

426
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,290
Based on your personality,

427
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,570
you wouldn't ask me
to pay back the money

428
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,980
if you didn't want
to be involved with me.

429
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,660
So I know

430
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,130
money is only an excuse.

431
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,900
You still want to see me, right?

432
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,980
(Luckily, I'm not
the Zheng Daqian you know.)

433
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,900
Daqian, are you listening to me?

434
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,900
Go on talking.

435
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,660
We broke up so many times.

436
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,700
Yet, we manage to overcome it.

437
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,020
It shows

438
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,530
we're fated to be together.

439
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,370
I'll make it up to you.

440
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,980
Give me another chance.

441
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,610
Where are you staying?

442
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,700
I... I'm staying at the resort.

443
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,610
How about this?

444
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,940
Consider it as taking a holiday.

445
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,570
I'll go and find you later.

446
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,610
Does that mean you'll let me stay?

447
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,850
Can I come over if I'm free?

448
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,900
Please don't.

449
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,610
I'll go and find you myself.

450
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,130
Okay.

451
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,290
Then

452
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,940
I have one last request.

453
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,770
Can you add me to your WeChat contact?

454
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,850
Okay.

455
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,660
Okay, I'll make a move.

456
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:03,940
Good night.

457
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,850
A leopard will never change its spot.

458
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,220
Unrepentant.

459
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,370
Turn

460
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,570
over a new leaf.

461
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,370
People like him don't change.

462
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,850
I know you're worried about me.

463
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,700
But please believe me.

464
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,500
I'll never get back to him.

465
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,850
(I'm Guan Zhe.)

466
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,050
Daqian, the weather is cold.

467
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,050
Don't catch a cold.

468
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,900
Remember to keep warm
and drink more warm water.

469
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,530
Daqian, you must stay away from him.

470
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,570
Daqian,

471
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,940
a scumbag will always be a scumbag.

472
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,330
I won't allow you

473
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,940
to be cheated twice.

474
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:46,770
Okay.

475
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,660
I understand.

476
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,850
Thank you.

477
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:52,660
Bye.

478
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,130
What's wrong?

479
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,180
I called my former co-worker

480
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,740
just now.

481
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,260
I know why Guan Zhe is here.

482
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,900
It turns out the head office found out

483
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,130
about the customer's complaint
against him.

484
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,220
Wang Anna whom he cheated on me with

485
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,050
cut ties with him

486
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,220
to protect herself.

487
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,740
He was fired.

488
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,020
That's why he shamelessly

489
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,330
come here looking for me.

490
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,980
This guy should get out

491
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,850
of Baihe.

492
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,090
Won't that be too easy for him?

493
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,610
You know what?

494
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,980
He's good
at manipulating people's minds.

495
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,530
He's so good with words.

496
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,330
First, he'd coax you with sweet talk.

497
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,090
Once you were hooked,

498
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,460
he'd beat you down without mercy.

499
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,420
He'd attack your confidence
and self-esteem

500
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,370
to let you think

501
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,530
he was the only person who loved you.

502
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,370
After that, he'll let you deal
with his infidelity and abuse.

503
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,020
What a scumbag.

504
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,570
So now the chance is here.

505
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,290
I'll do something
so he'll never dare bug me again.

506
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,130
Mi Lan, you must play along with me.

507
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,460
How?

508
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,460
Hello.

509
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,530
Guan Zhe?

510
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,180
Hi, there.

511
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,770
Hello.

512
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,050
Is Daqian here?

513
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,180
Not yet. I think she'll be here soon.

514
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,570
Why don't you sit while you wait?

515
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,810
Okay, I'll wait here.

516
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,090
I'll go and get you some water.

517
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,900
Do you need any help?

518
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,260
No, thanks for asking.

519
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,460
Here you go.

520
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,090
Thank you.

521
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,050
I'm glad Daqian has a best friend

522
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,850
like you.

523
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,290
Are you serious

524
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,330
about getting back together with her?

525
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,530
I know

526
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,530
I had wronged her in the past.

527
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,370
in the past.

528
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,850
But I'm serious
about making it up to her.

529
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,330
I see.

530
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,090
To be honest,
she still has feelings for you.

531
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,290
After all,
you guys dated for so many years.

532
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,050
Really?

533
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,050
After she came home,

534
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,090
Yan has been pursuing her.

535
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,770
But she never said yes to him.

536
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,900
I think

537
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,740
it's because she still can't forget you.

538
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,530
I knew it.

539
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,980
Is the rental here expensive?

540
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,020
Oh, we didn't rent this shop.

541
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,770
Daqian bought it.

542
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:09,700
She bought it?

543
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,810
If she bought this shop,

544
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,460
is she planning
to stay in Baihe for good?

545
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:15,980
Well, not really.

546
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,460
This shop will be demolished soon.

547
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,330
They said they were going
to build a museum here.

548
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,050
There will be a huge compensation.

549
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,940
Compensation?

550
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,090
That's good to hear.

551
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,850
Why don't you wait for her here?

552
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,740
- Okay.
- I'll get back to work.

553
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,770
Okay, I won't be in your way.

554
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,330
You're here.

555
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,420
Why are you here again?

556
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,570
Guan Zhe, you're here.

557
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,260
Hi, Daqian.

558
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,770
Do you have any plans today?

559
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,810
No.

560
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,290
You see.

561
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,220
I need your help with something.

562
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,740
Can you do me the favor?

563
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,460
Sure.

564
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,980
Why don't you check out from the hotel?

565
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,980
How about staying at my house?

566
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,980
Because it might take

567
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,090
a week of your time.

568
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,940
No problem.
Staying at your house is better.

569
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,770
Your house is near to this restaurant.

570
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,940
It'll be convenient for me
to come and help out.

571
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,460
I was wondering

572
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,020
if I should buy some furniture for you.

573
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,220
The tablecloths here are pretty worn.

574
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,330
You're so considerate.

575
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,330
Zheng Daqian, what's your problem?

576
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,020
Are you the only owner here?

577
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,940
You can't just let anyone join

578
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,770
without our permission.

579
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,900
Don't interrupt.

580
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,260
I'll explain it to you later.

581
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,660
Where are you going instead of working?

582
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,740
Aren't you going to keep the restaurant?

583
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,570
Let him go.

584
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,700
I can help you if you need help.

585
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,500
Okay.

586
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,460
Are we almost there?

587
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,660
Yes, we're here.

588
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,460
This is my house.

589
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,660
We need to fix the windows, right?

590
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,500
Yes.

591
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,740
Which room will I be staying in?

592
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,050
This double-story house is my home.

593
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,610
You can pick any room you want.

594
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,770
Okay.

595
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,370
Dad, I brought him here.

596
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,500
There you are.

597
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,610
Uncle Zheng.

598
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,610
Guan,

599
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,460
I was too upset

600
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,700
the other day.

601
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,660
I hope you don't mind it.

602
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,460
Why would I?

603
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,570
It was my fault, to begin with.

604
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,530
You see

605
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,500
how sensible he is.

606
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,660
I appreciate it.

607
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,530
Daqian said

608
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,180
you were in the renovation field.

609
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:11,770
Yes.

610
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,610
Then can you do us a favor?

611
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,980
Sure, what is it?

612
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,020
You see

613
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,330
this wall here needs

614
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,850
to be repainted.

615
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:20,940
Just keep

616
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,850
the original paint color
of the door frame.

617
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,330
This is easy.

618
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,570
There's one more place.

619
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,130
Follow me.

620
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,180
I'll take you there.

621
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,810
This kitchen

622
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,770
would be even easier.

623
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,810
You don't have
to keep the original design.

624
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,900
I want a modern design.

625
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,420
Guan Zhe, I'll leave this to you, then.

626
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,850
Work hard. I'll get going now.

627
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,260
Guan, I'll leave this to you.

628
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,940
Go for it.

629
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,420
Also,

630
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,180
Daqian's mom is a Virgo,

631
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,330
who pursues perfection.

632
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,370
You must be meticulous

633
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,050
when you work on it.

634
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,220
I believe in you.

635
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,050
I'll get going, then.

636
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,260
Mom, you're home.

637
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,660
Zheng Daqian,

638
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,220
do you have anything

639
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,260
to tell me?

640
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,050
What?

641
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,940
Why is your ex-boyfriend,

642
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,770
Guan Shuangji
[*The character ‘zhe' consists of two 'ji'.]

643
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,810
here?

644
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,180
He was cleaning up the house.

645
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,740
Don't worry about it.

646
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,940
He's here to atone for his sins.

647
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,610
He'll return
after his punishment is over.

648
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,610
You already broke up.

649
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,260
Why are you still messing with him?

650
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,500
Tell him to leave now.

651
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,660
He hasn't paid me back
the money he owes me.

652
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,740
I'm making him pay by doing labor.

653
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,050
Don't worry.

654
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,460
We can go back home

655
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,530
in less than a week.

656
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,420
Mu Zili.

657
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,090
What?

658
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,740
Do you have time for coffee?

659
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,180
I'm busy.

660
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,260
I think I need to talk to you.

661
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,810
I don't think so.

662
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,900
No matter what's your reason,

663
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,290
you shouldn't have any contact with him.

664
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,290
You'll always be the one who gets hurt.

665
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,850
I haven't said anything. Don't go.

666
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,740
What?

667
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,770
Are you unhappy

668
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,810
that Daqian's ex-boyfriend is here?

669
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,660
Why would I feel unhappy?

670
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,420
How did you know?

671
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,900
Four middle-aged people
talked about it all night.

672
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,810
Daqian is too soft-hearted.

673
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,460
You're not that good yourself.

674
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,570
Even if Daqian's ex-boyfriend
is not here,

675
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,570
there's Junze.

676
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,290
You're only lying to yourself
and the people around you.

677
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,980
What do a kid like you know?

678
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,500
Just draw whatever you're drawing.

679
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,770
Are you eating?

680
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,570
Sit.

681
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,290
Are you eating instant noodles?

682
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,770
That's not healthy.

683
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,700
Eat this. I brought it for you.

684
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,220
Thank you, Uncle.

685
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,130
Not bad.

686
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,610
Uncle,

687
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,330
there's only rice.

688
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,810
I forgot the meat and vegetables.
I'll go and get them.

689
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,420
It's okay.

690
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,940
I can eat it with instant noodles.

691
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,940
Guan, I'm so sorry.

692
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,050
It's okay.

693
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,130
Eat.

694
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,900
I'll leave, then.

695
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:42,700
Nice work.

696
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,090
Guan Zhe,

697
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,260
you worked so hard.
Come and have a drink.

698
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,260
Okay.

699
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,610
Thanks.

700
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,810
Hi, Uncle Zheng.

701
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,940
Guan,

702
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,660
your progress is a little slow.

703
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,810
How about I find
a couple of helpers for you?

704
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,900
But I don't think they're
as meticulous as you.

705
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,330
You should take care of this yourself.

706
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,090
I'll feel assured this way.

707
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,740
Of course.

708
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,660
I'll get going, then.

709
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,570
Be quick about it.

710
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,850
Guan Zhe.

711
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,610
Daqian,

712
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,290
why are you here?

713
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,500
I bought milk tea for you

714
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,570
to keep you energized.

715
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,570
You can do it.

716
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:52,980
Okay.

717
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,180
The renovation is almost done.

718
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,900
After we air out the house,

719
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,130
we can move back in.

720
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,610
It's finally done.

721
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,370
Does that mean

722
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,220
Shuangji will leave now?

723
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,530
Yes, he's going to leave.

724
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,460
But speaking of which,

725
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,220
it's all thanks to him.

726
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,050
I can't count on your dad.

727
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,020
I don't know when he'll get it done.

728
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,940
Dad isn't like that.

729
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,500
The renovation was completed perfectly

730
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,810
because he supervised the work.

731
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,090
He also comes by
to help out at the restaurant.

732
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,660
Stop taking your dad's side.

733
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,330
I know him very well.

734
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,900
He lacks perseverance.

735
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:53,900
Also,

736
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,660
do you think I don't know what happened

737
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,460
at the restaurant?

738
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,330
It's not guaranteed
that you can open tomorrow.

739
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,050
I can guarantee

740
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,500
that Zheng Yingjun will change for good.

741
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,530
Fine.

742
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,130
You better pack your things.

743
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,290
We've been staying here for too long.

744
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,180
We've been giving so much trouble.

745
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,850
I'll pack mine

746
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,770
after I'm done packing yours.

747
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,130
We can finally go home.

748
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,420
Yes, we can finally go home.

749
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,500
(Look up and see joy.)
Daqian, come here.

750
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,090
Come in quick.

751
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,740
Look at the wall.

752
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,020
I cleaned this all up.

753
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,260
It was so hard to clean.

754
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,130
It looks pretty good.

755
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,130
I repainted the ceiling too.

756
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,370
Nice.

757
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,290
So do you like it?

758
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,900
Did you also repaint the door frame?

759
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,050
Yes, I repaint it.

760
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:42,940
I used Eco-friendly paint.

761
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,050
There's no smell at all.

762
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:44,660
Nice.

763
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,900
It looks pretty good.

764
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,460
Not bad, right?

765
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,050
Since the work is done,

766
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,260
don't you think

767
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,810
we should do something else?

768
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,570
Sure.

769
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,980
Let's eat dinner tonight.

770
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,570
Dinner?

771
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,020
I'm not familiar with Baihe.

772
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,940
You pick what you want to eat.

773
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,700
It'll be my treat.

774
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,980
How about going to our restaurant?

775
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,050
There's no one there at night.

776
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:20,980
Okay.

777
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,020
Daqian,

778
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,090
you're good at holding your drinks now.

779
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,330
I learned how to drink after I returned.

780
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,460
You're so different now.

781
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,260
How different?

782
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,090
The feeling you're giving out
is different.

783
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,020
You are more outgoing, confident,

784
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,220
and charming now.

785
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,980
I like your better too.

786
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,740
You're lying.

787
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:58,810
I'm telling the truth.

788
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,850
You really surprised me.

789
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,330
I've given this a thought.

790
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,020
If

791
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,090
you want to stay in Baihe for a while,

792
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,090
I can accept

793
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,130
if we have a long-distance relationship.

794
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,610
After all, I owe you too much.

795
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,050
So long you're happy,

796
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,210
I can wait for you.

797
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,730
We're out of wine.
I'll go and get some more.

798
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,340
Lizi.

799
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,210
Why do you look so disheartened?

800
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,980
Where are you going?

801
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,500
I'm going to the restaurant
to look for Daqian.

802
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,900
Don't go to the restaurant
for the time being.

803
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,020
Or you'll ruin their time together.

804
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,530
Their time together?

805
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,900
Are you talking about Guan Zhe?

806
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,050
Daqian is planning

807
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,130
to have a showdown with that scumbag.

808
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,650
I thought they were...

809
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,460
They have nothing to do with each other.

810
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,250
Daqian was just teaching him a lesson.

811
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,300
I even brought

812
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,460
that scumbag's luggage here.

813
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,380
She's meeting him

814
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,300
to make him pack up and leave.

815
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,730
You don't have to be shy.

816
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,820
Didn't you make me stay

817
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,250
so we could get back together?

818
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,690
Guan Zhe,

819
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,020
I have something to tell you too.

820
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,210
Thank you

821
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,690
for renovating the house for me.

822
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,210
You don't have to pay back
the money you owe me anymore.

823
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,650
We're even now.

824
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,020
You should go back
to where you come from.

825
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,610
What do you mean?

826
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,610
Do you think

827
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,090
I don't know why you were fired?

828
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,530
You fled here after being caught

829
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,940
while waiting for another opportunity.

830
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,650
Are you messing with me?

831
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,460
Did you plan everything

832
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,690
just to get back at me?

833
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,380
Why?

834
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,980
Your pretentious tales no longer work,

835
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,690
right?

836
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,020
After being dumped by Wang Anna

837
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,170
and doing a week of labor in Baihe,

839
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,380
attained a higher level now?

840
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,570
Does your travel
to the Northeast more fulfilling?

841
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,610
Zheng Daqian, you've crossed the line.

842
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,940
You crossed the line first.

843
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,780
Do you think I'm a pushover?

844
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,380
What are you doing?

845
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,130
Do I look like a pushover to you?

846
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,090
- Let me go!
- Playing hard, huh?

847
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,860
What are you doing? Let me go!

848
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,780
Lizi, stop hitting him.

849
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,460
Stop it.

850
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,250
Stop it!

851
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,380
Are you okay?

852
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,340
Yes.

853
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,050
I'm going to call the police.

854
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,500
I'll call the police right now.

855
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,650
You want to call the police, right?

856
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,940
Okay, I'll call the police for you.

857
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,900
Lizi, do the math.

858
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,340
How much is the cost
of his meal and his accommodation?

859
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,530
This scum has no money at all.

860
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,570
He has been freeloading.

861
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,730
Freeloading?

862
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,610
I paid for the renovation of your house!

863
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,340
You owe me even more.

864
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,610
I have the transaction record in WeChat.

865
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,340
See that?

866
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,020
We have surveillance cameras
in the restaurant.

867
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,860
I'll sue you for sexual harassment.

868
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,460
Since you're a good talker,
you can explain it to the police!

869
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,210
You said I was waiting
for opportunities, right?

870
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,050
Well, you're in cahoots
in setting me up!

871
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,820
- What are you doing?
- Lizi.

872
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,460
Listen carefully.

873
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,380
Next time,

874
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,050
don't show up in front of her.

875
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,690
Leave now!

876
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,780
Fine, I'll leave!

877
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,730
Zheng Daqian,

878
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,500
you were likable once.

879
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,250
Look at how pretentious you are.

880
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,500
Disgusting!

881
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,050
- Disgusting!
- Lizi, stop.

882
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,090
- Don't stoop to his level.
- You're disgusting!

883
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,300
He's a scumbag.

884
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,250
You'll go bankrupt sooner or later.

885
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,380
He's just a scumbag.

886
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,460
He's a scumbag.

887
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,610
Why did you get so close to him?

888
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,020
Do you know how dangerous it was?

889
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,570
If I didn't come,

890
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,730
I can't imagine what would've happened!

891
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,250
What could happen?

892
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,820
Listen, Zheng Daqian.

893
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,570
I won't meddle in your affairs anymore.

894
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,690
Do what you wish!

Thanks.

897

I'm sorry.

898
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,130
Forget it.

899
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,380
Don't be so willful in the future.

900
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,020
This is not how you solve problems.

901
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,170
I'm solving this problem
for the other person.

902
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:58,730
Who?

903
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,340
Myself.

904
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,570
I think

905
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,130
I used to do this a lot for you.

906
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,730
Why did it feel so natural
when I hit him?

907
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,300
It seemed it had happened before.

908
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,300
I think so too.

909
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,780
It feels like

910
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,460
you were fated
to teach Guan Zhe a lesson.

911
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,050
Don't take

912
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,530
what that scumbag said seriously.

913
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,420
I know.

914
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,570
I must start running

915
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,730
our restaurant seriously.

916
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,020
I'm scared my mom will leave my dad

917
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,250
if this goes on.

918
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:47,860
I'll help you

919
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,980
and Uncle Yingjun.

920
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,900
You have to work hard after this.

Yan, you're here.

924
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,210
Mi Lan said you got hurt.

925
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,250
Show me.

926
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,530
I'm fine. See?

927
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,340
I heard someone wanted
to call the police.

928
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,130
Where's the culprit?

929
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,340
He already left.

930
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,610
I can't wait to hear

931
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,650
what happened just now.

932
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,380
What did you say?

933
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,690
Zheng Daqian made her ex-boyfriend
renovate the house?

934
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,020
Talking about using
that good-for-nothing,

935
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,780
Daqian is the one to go to.

936
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,020
Enough already.

937
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,420
Don't encourage her.

938
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,300
Taking revenge
by putting herself in danger.

939
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,460
He almost forced a kiss on her.

940
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,500
Kiss?

941
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,610
Mu Zili, can you not touch

942
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,940
a sensitive subject like that?

943
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,900
Stop talking about it anymore.

944
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,730
Yan will go after him
if you keep talking about it.

945
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,500
I'm going now.

946
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,460
No, they were just kidding.

947
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,690
Let's start grilling the meat.

948

Here.

949
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,610
If you come back for good,

I'd be so happy.

951

Why don't we pick a day

952
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,650
to go ice skating?

953
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,340
No way.

954
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,210
It's so warm and cozy at home.

955
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,020
Besides, I'm not good at ice skating.

956
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,210
What are you waiting for?

957
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,250
Let's drink.

958
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,340
Drink till you drop!

959
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,130
Drink til we drop.

(Starry Sky Restaurant)
No one is allowed to go.

Don't go until you finish
all the drinks.

Watch your feet.

966

You can't go too.

967
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,730
I'm not going anywhere.

968
