you've been studying so hard

I think studying in the province
is good.

She's more stable now.

I'm glad to hear that.

I'll drop by and visit her tonight.

222

He's not taking the exam in Beijing.

223

Mi Lan, how about you talk to Zixi?

224
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:45,972
He'll listen to you.

225

Was there something wrong
with my eyesight?

226
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,891

Your eyes were fine.

228
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:05,611
I was disappearing just now.

229
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:08,131
It happened several times before.

230
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:09,932
Why didn't you tell me?

231
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:12,932
I thought
something was wrong with my eyes too.

232
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:15,531
Do you still remember
the group photo we took

233
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:16,452
during the new year?

234
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:17,932
I was disappearing at that time too.

235
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,491
But only Yan noticed.

236
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:22,851
He also told me

237
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:25,011
that the bolide
will appear in several days.

238
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:26,731
The closer we get to that day,

239
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:28,452
the more frequent

240
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:29,932
this unstable phenomenon will be.

241
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:32,572
The bolide was the reason
for the time and space swap.

242
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,212
When I drove back here,

243
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:35,651
I saw it too.

244
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:37,292
After that,
I was involved in the car accident.

245
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:43,011
Yan even took me
to Tieyuan Station that day

246
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:44,692
to see if there were any abnormalities.

247
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,531
We didn't discover anything.

248
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:51,011
I answered an odd phone call.

249
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:52,371
What call?

250
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:54,651
(Unknown Number)
It was an unknown number.

251
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:56,651
But my call didn't get through
when I called back.

252
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:59,092
What did that person say?

253
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:01,851
It was static noise.

254
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:05,412
It sounded like static interference.

That was pretty long.

00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,132
what the Yan in our universe is like.

341
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:47,571
What did you tell him?

342
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:49,331
I said he's pretty delicate.

at the train station.

346
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:01,531
See if you missed out anything.

347
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:04,652
I couldn't hear anything
but static noise.

348
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:08,251
It sounded like there were
incoming calls at the same time.

349
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:12,571
Under normal circumstances,

350
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:15,212
the signal from the base transceiver
station shouldn't be in a mess.

351
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,811
There must be some issues
with your phone.

352

Isn't this your expertise?

353
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,051
Can you think of a way

354
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,531
to extract the sounds individually?

355
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:24,011
Then we can hear them clearly.

356
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:25,811
Okay.

357
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:27,972
Remember to record the sound

358
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:29,212
when it happens again.

359
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:33,172
How about we go to Tieyuan Station now?

360
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:34,692
What if I get that call again?

How's your preparation?

368
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,291
I don't want to take the exam.

Why not?

370
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:13,771
It's meaningless.

Have you forgotten what you said?

373

You said painting

374
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:21,811
is the most meaningful thing

Stop picking them up.

The bolide isn't here yet.

How did I manage to
receive her call, then?

398
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:47,172
That means our universes

504
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:45,731
I'll search nearby the Old Street.

505
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:48,331
Huixian didn't come and see me.

506
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:51,251
Okay.

507
00:28:51,452 --> 00:28:52,612
I'll call your dad now.

508
00:28:52,612 --> 00:28:53,212
Okay.

509
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:54,972
Juan, watch my counter for a while.

510
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:55,692
Got it.

511
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,291
All right.

512
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:57,412
Please make your payment here.

513
00:29:35,331 --> 00:29:36,011
Mum!

514
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:37,491
Mum!

515
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:38,692
Li Huixian!

516
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:40,172
Lizi,

517
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:41,972
is she here?

518
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:42,731
No.

519
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:44,771
I've searched all the places
she usually goes.

520
00:29:44,932 --> 00:29:45,892
But she wasn't there.

521
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,692
Where else could she go?

522
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:50,011
It's all my fault.

523
00:29:50,011 --> 00:29:52,491
I should have stayed by her side

524
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:53,571
and accompanied her.

525
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:55,652
I should've stayed next to her
no matter what.

526
00:29:56,932 --> 00:29:57,771
It's all my fault.

527
00:29:57,771 --> 00:29:59,372
It's my fault for not watching over her.

528
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:06,972
Hello, Dazhi.

529
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:09,412
You found her?

530
00:30:14,372 --> 00:30:14,972
Mum.

531
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:15,972
Mum.

532
00:30:19,892 --> 00:30:21,132
Mum, where did you go?

533
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:23,331
I didn't go anywhere.

534
00:30:23,331 --> 00:30:25,531
Why are you all here?

535
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:27,372
We came to check on you.

536
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:29,692
Where did you go?
You didn't even answer your phone.

537
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:31,251
I didn't really go anywhere.

538
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:32,932
I just went out for a walk.

539
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:35,331
After that, I ran into Dazhi,

540
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:37,212
and he sent me home.

541
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:38,811
Well, as long as you're back now.

542
00:30:38,811 --> 00:30:39,452
It's cold outside.

543
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:40,692
Bring your mum inside the house now.

544
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:42,412
Go inside.

545
00:30:43,731 --> 00:30:44,372
Daqian.

546
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:50,452
Dazhi,

547
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:53,051
where did you find her?

548
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,251
Uncle Mu's fireworks factory.

549
00:31:09,652 --> 00:31:11,251
What's this smell?

550
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,172
What do you want for dinner?

551
00:31:16,172 --> 00:31:17,412
I'll make them for you.

552
00:31:17,932 --> 00:31:18,852
It's okay, mum.

553
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:20,251
You should get some rest.
I'll make dinner.

554
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:22,331
Take off the apron.

555
00:31:22,692 --> 00:31:24,212
Mum, wear these slippers.

556
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:35,491
Mum, I'll go and get a basin of water

557
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:36,331
for you to soak your feet.

558
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:38,291
It's okay.

559
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:39,852
Mum, just let him get it.

560
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:41,731
Go and get some rest.

561
00:31:41,731 --> 00:31:42,692
Daqian is here too.

562
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,932
So let her accompany you.

563
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,412
Daqian, you should go home early.

564
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:48,972
Don't let your parents worry about you.

565
00:31:48,972 --> 00:31:50,251
I'm not in a hurry to go home.

566
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:52,091
It's been a while since we last talked.

567
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:04,291
Daqian, have an orange.

568
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,291
Thank you, Aunt Hui.

569
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:06,571
Have some sunflower seeds too.

570
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:07,172
Okay.

571
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,612
Just eat anything you want.

572
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:16,132
Aunt Hui, what are you looking for?

573
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:18,412
I'm looking for the TV remote control.

574
00:32:18,412 --> 00:32:20,251
So we can watch TV.

575
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:22,852
It's okay. Let's not watch TV.

576
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:24,251
We can just talk.

577
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:31,331
Mu, where did you keep
the remote control?

578
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:33,852
I can't find it.

579
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,452
Help me find it.

580
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:42,372
Why don't you stop looking for it?

581
00:32:42,372 --> 00:32:44,212
Come and join our conversation.

582
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:48,892
Listen.

583
00:32:48,892 --> 00:32:50,612
Next time,

584
00:32:50,612 --> 00:32:51,972
let me keep all the remote controls.

585
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:53,051
If you keep them,

586
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:54,652
I don't know where to find them.

587
00:33:05,412 --> 00:33:07,692
Mum, I kept the remote control.

588
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:08,731
It's over here.

589
00:33:12,212 --> 00:33:14,251
Mum, soak your feet first.

590
00:33:14,612 --> 00:33:16,491
You can soak your feet
while watching TV.

591
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:17,372
Okay.

592
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:20,571
I'll soak mine first.
Then it'll be your turn.

593
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:58,452
I'm happy to see

594
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:00,172
both of you getting along.

595
00:34:01,132 --> 00:34:02,452
Don't worry, mum.

596
00:34:02,452 --> 00:34:03,571
We're getting along well.

597
00:34:15,932 --> 00:34:18,611
Mum, I made bird's nest soup for you.

598
00:34:18,611 --> 00:34:20,531
Get some sleep after you drink it,

599
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:21,131
okay?

600
00:34:21,332 --> 00:34:21,932
Okay.

601
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:33,452
Mum, are you cold?

602
00:34:33,452 --> 00:34:34,611
Is the water warm enough?

603
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:36,372
Yes, it's not cold.

604
00:34:43,252 --> 00:34:45,932
(I really look forward
to finding love and marriage,)

605
00:34:45,932 --> 00:34:46,972
(because I think)

606
00:34:46,972 --> 00:34:48,211
(my life has been)

607
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,372
(very smooth)

608
00:34:49,372 --> 00:34:50,332
(this year.)

609
00:34:50,332 --> 00:34:51,651
(So I need some setbacks.)

610
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,252
Mum, I'm home.

611
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:57,972
How's your Aunt Hui?

612
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:03,491
Not good.

613
00:35:05,011 --> 00:35:05,932
How so?

614
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:13,051
She kept talking about Uncle Mu.

615
00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:15,292
I didn't expect

616
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,091
Aunt Hui still hadn't come around

617
00:35:17,732 --> 00:35:19,372
after Uncle Mu passed away
for a long time.

618
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:23,732
Of course.
They had been married for so long.

619
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:26,252
When the other one passed away,

620
00:35:26,252 --> 00:35:27,892
how could she not be shaken by it?

621
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,732
When two people have been together
for so long...

622
00:35:30,732 --> 00:35:31,651
How do I put it?

623
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:33,892
It feels like

624
00:35:34,252 --> 00:35:36,332
the pair of shoes you've been wearing.

625
00:35:36,332 --> 00:35:36,812
They're the first thing
you think about wearing

626
00:35:36,812 --> 00:35:38,651
wherever you're going.

627
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:40,531
They may be old.

628
00:35:42,011 --> 00:35:42,732
But it's...

629
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:47,651
It's similar

630
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:49,332
to a walking stick you lean on.

631
00:35:49,332 --> 00:35:50,972
So you won't fall when you're old.

632
00:35:51,611 --> 00:35:52,972
No matter how happy,

633
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:54,932
angry, or sad,

634
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,252
wherever you go,

635
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:58,772
it'll always be there.

636
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,171
Mum.

637
00:36:05,091 --> 00:36:07,091
Can you stop arguing with dad?

638
00:36:07,372 --> 00:36:08,772
No matter how bad he is,

639
00:36:08,892 --> 00:36:10,211
he's still the shoes
and the walking stick

640
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,531
you're used to.

641
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:12,412
Your dad?

642
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:14,772
Your dad isn't that useful.

643
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:16,611
Your dad

644
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:18,651
is just like a northwest wind

645
00:36:18,651 --> 00:36:19,972
when you're calm.

646
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:21,932
He's the big puddle in front of you

647
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:23,091
when you forge ahead.

648
00:36:23,691 --> 00:36:26,091
And the game, Richman,
you used to play as a child.

649
00:36:26,091 --> 00:36:27,732
He is the one that falls from the sky.

650
00:36:27,772 --> 00:36:28,972
- The God of Misfortune.
- The God of Misfortune.

651
00:36:29,732 --> 00:36:30,571
Your dad

652
00:36:31,452 --> 00:36:32,812
is too unreal.

653
00:36:32,812 --> 00:36:34,091
Day by day,

654
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,131
he's ever-changing.

655
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:38,211
You're talking
as if he's the Monkey King.

656
00:36:38,452 --> 00:36:39,091
Enough talking.

657
00:36:41,051 --> 00:36:42,171
You should go to bed.

658
00:36:42,892 --> 00:36:44,051
You too.

659
00:36:49,691 --> 00:36:50,292
Mum.

660
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:53,211
Good night.

661
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:54,892
Good night.

662
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,640
(Today, the other Zheng Daqian said...)

663
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:35,691
I can see you're still typing.

664
00:37:36,372 --> 00:37:37,412
What is it that you want to tell me?

665
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:46,011
Nothing.

666
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:47,732
How's Aunt Hui?

667
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:52,651
She's already asleep.

668
00:37:53,812 --> 00:37:55,691
I plan to take her
to the hospital tomorrow.

669
00:37:59,091 --> 00:38:01,452
If you and Zixi need any help,

670
00:38:01,452 --> 00:38:02,571
remember to tell me.

671
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:05,332
We're okay.

672
00:38:05,571 --> 00:38:06,531
Don't worry.

673
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:08,852
You had a long day too.

674
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:10,292
Get some rest.

675
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:12,051
Good night.

676
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:55,452
Mi Lan.

677
00:38:55,972 --> 00:38:57,571
There are a lot of flowers downstairs.

678
00:38:57,571 --> 00:38:58,611
Did you buy them?

679
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:01,051
Yes. Since it's going to be spring soon,

680
00:39:01,051 --> 00:39:02,292
I wanted to buy some fresh flowers

681
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:04,611
to make it look like springtime.

682
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:07,372
Didn't Lizi come with you?

683
00:39:07,651 --> 00:39:09,171
He's taking care of Aunt Hui at home.

684
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:12,531
If you look at him,

685
00:39:12,531 --> 00:39:14,732
he may look careless.

686
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:17,091
But he's really thoughtful.

687
00:39:18,531 --> 00:39:19,491
You're right.

688
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:21,932
How can a person like this

689
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:24,531
abandon his family

690
00:39:25,171 --> 00:39:26,732
and leave?

691
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:28,651
Leave?

692
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:31,412
Is it about starting a business?

693
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:33,332
Oh, nothing.

694
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,332
Mi Lan,
I'll leave you with your flowers.

695
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,211
I'll get back to work.

696
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:38,171
Wait.

697
00:39:39,372 --> 00:39:40,091
Sit down.

698
00:39:41,852 --> 00:39:43,131
I have something for you.

699
00:39:54,252 --> 00:39:55,211
Open it.

700
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:56,772
What's this?

701
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:05,732
Why did you give me an onion?

702
00:40:05,812 --> 00:40:07,651
It's not an onion.

703
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,412
This is hyacinth.

704
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:11,571
Why are you giving me a present?

705
00:40:12,372 --> 00:40:13,531
Oh, no reason.

706
00:40:13,892 --> 00:40:15,051
I just want to thank you.

707
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:16,452
For what?

708
00:40:17,131 --> 00:40:20,171
Thank you for
allowing me to own this restaurant.

709
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:23,051
I'm really happy during this time.

710
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:23,972
I feel contented.

711
00:40:25,732 --> 00:40:27,772
Mi Lan, I want to thank you too.

712
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:29,131
Why?

713
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:32,171
Thank you for
staying by my side all this time.

714
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:35,332
I'll keep doing that.

715
00:41:02,972 --> 00:41:03,651
Daqian.

716
00:41:13,892 --> 00:41:14,531
Daqian?

717
00:41:16,452 --> 00:41:17,171
What's the matter?

718
00:41:18,051 --> 00:41:18,852
Yan,

719
00:41:21,131 --> 00:41:23,332
Lizi and I
went to Tieyuan Station yesterday.

720
00:41:25,772 --> 00:41:26,852
I answered

721
00:41:27,932 --> 00:41:29,171
a call by the other Zheng Daqian

722
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:32,131
from another parallel universe.

723
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:37,972
What did she say?

724
00:41:38,252 --> 00:41:39,292
She told me

725
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,292
we could switch places

726
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:44,491
at Tieyuan Station on March 1st.

727
00:41:47,812 --> 00:41:49,091
Isn't that good news?

728
00:41:50,531 --> 00:41:51,292
But

729
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:55,252
Mu Zili

730
00:41:57,812 --> 00:41:59,131
can never come back.

731
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:03,171
He can't come back?

732
00:42:08,011 --> 00:42:09,452
He died

733
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:12,932
