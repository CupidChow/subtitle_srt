00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,681
A special western restaurant.

173
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:11,320
As exotic as the Seine.

174
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,001
Order now.

175
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:19,161
We'll be making a lot of money today.

176
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,681
Don't celebrate too early.

177
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,640
Can we trust the group Uncle Yingjun
brought in?

178
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:26,361
Of course, we can.

179
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:27,721
The tour guide said

180
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:28,760
they had to pay for the meal.

181
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,200
But I saw on the Internet

182
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,320
that the tour agency is dodgy.

183
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,561
The tour guide looks like an honest man.

184
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:37,400
Don't worry.

185
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,161
An honest man?

186
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:44,681
Here you go.

187
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,440
Fruit salad.

188
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,520
Thank you.

189
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,440
Fruit salad.

190
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:51,561
Thank you, mister.

191
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:52,361
Thank you.

192
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,601
Enjoy.

193
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,721
Thanks, mister.

194
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:57,361
We'll visit again next time.

195
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:58,200
Sure.

196
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,400
Come, eat.

197
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,681
Have some salad.

198
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,760
It's quite delicious.

199
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,721
It's so good that you can't bring
yourself to eat it?

200
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:05,041
It's amazing.

201
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:06,760
I'll come again next time.

202
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,960
So good.

203
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:10,721
Mr. Zheng.

204
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:11,760
Perhaps

205
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,681
you can pay me the commission fee now?

206
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:15,760
Tour Guide Yang, what's the hurry?

207
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,361
They haven't paid yet.

208
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:18,001
Yes, they haven't.

209
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,801
But I think they might
find out about this later.

210
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:21,361
Also,

211
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:23,320
they are all senior citizens.
They won't run away.

212
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:24,200
Okay.

213
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,121
I'll trust you then.

214
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:25,601
Sure.

215
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:26,760
Will QR code do?

216
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,561
Feel free to bring
your tour groups here.

217
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,760
Sure. I see a long-term partnership
in the making here.

218
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:31,960
Right. For our partnership.

219
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,561
Okay.

220
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,440
Here.

221
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,100
(Starry Sky Restaurant)

222
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:46,081
Ladies and gentlemen, how's the meal?

223
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:47,001
- Pretty good.
- Pretty good.

224
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:47,841
- Very good.
- Very good.

225
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:48,560
I love it.

226
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,680
Is the food to your liking?

227
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,601
Not bad overall.

228
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:54,081
The noodles get stuck
in the teeth easily,

229
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,241
but the portion is good.

230
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,121
Yes.

231
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,880
So may I know who should I

232
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,560
pass the bill?

233
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,560
Wait.

234
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:03,481
Can you ask
Tour Guide Yang to come here?

235
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,241
Sure.

236
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:06,601
Tour Guide Yang,
a madam is looking for you.

237
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,081
Yes?

238
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,400
Did you enjoy the food, ladies?

239
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,920
Tour Guide Yang.

240
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:13,601
Give us a rebate with the commission fee
you just received

241
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:14,481
and we'll pay the bill.

242
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:15,201
What commission fee?

243
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:17,241
What commission fee?

244
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,800
What a joke, madam!

245
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,321
There's no commission fee.

246
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:23,241
Don't lie.

247
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:24,160
I saw you

248
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,560
getting paid over there.

249
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
I saw everything.

250
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,481
We added each other on WeChat.

251
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:28,560
You added each other on WeChat?

252
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
Show me your phone then.

253
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,280
- Show me your phone.
- What are you doing?

254
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,640
Madam, you can't put your hands
in my pocket!

255
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,280
Let's be civil.

256
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,441
I put my hands in your pocket?

257
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,441
Calm down.

258
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,040
- We can discuss it in a civil manner.
- Stop talking.

259
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,601
You work with the tour guide

260
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:40,640
to scam us.

261
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:42,321
I work with the tour guide?

262
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:44,001
I just met him today.

263
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,640
You also said

264
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,201
the food was delicious and cheap.

265
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:48,081
Everyone heard it.

266
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:48,601
Why is everyone

267
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:50,040
standing up now?

268
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,160
Stop recording it.

269
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,001
Don't listen to her.
There's no commission fee.

270
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:52,920
How much money

271
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,121
have you made off us on this trip?

272
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:55,081
- I'm telling you.
- Give us a number.

273
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:56,481
- Go tell us.
- Where's your evidence?

274
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:58,001
- You can't make up...
- I have evidence.

275
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,361
Of course, I have evidence.

276
00:09:59,361 --> 00:09:59,961
Report him.

277
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:01,121
For what?

278
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,920
Stop making things up.

279
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,121
I'll call the police now.

280
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:03,920
I'll report you.

281
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,321
- To who?
- To the consumers association.

282
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:05,961
- Right.
- Report me?

283
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:06,760
There's no way it'll work.

284
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,001
I'll report you

285
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:09,121
- to the customers association.
- Where...

286
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:09,560
I'll report you.

287
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,241
You're just being unreasonable.

288
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:11,241
I'll report you.

289
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:12,160
So you want to do it for real?

290
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,361
- You know...
- Yes, I'm serious.

291
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:14,001
I'll report you.

292
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:14,601
To who?

293
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:15,520
- Give it to me.
- I will report you.

294
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
- To who?
- Don't...

295
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,961
You can never report me.

296
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,280
Oh, my back!

297
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:22,721
My back!

298
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,680
My eyes!

299
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:28,640
Oh, no.

300
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,241
My eyes!

301
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:45,800
I have to get my money back.

302
00:10:58,481 --> 00:10:59,361
(Starry Sky Restaurant)
Have you eaten?

303
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:00,721
(Starry Sky Restaurant)
We can order something here.

304
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:02,680
(Starry Sky Restaurant)
They should be very busy now.

305
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:13,800
It's

306
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:15,001
dinner-hour now.

307
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:16,601
Why isn't there anyone here?

308
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,040
A slow day?

309
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,040
Order something.

310
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,081
None of you can leave if you don't

311
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:21,160
order 500 yuan worth of food.

312
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:23,560
I already ate.

313
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:26,601
Mi Lan.

314
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,160
What happened?

315
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:31,321
A tour group came during the day.

316
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,361
Isn't that great?

317
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,441
Not at all. Even an ambulance came.

318
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:38,361
What?

319
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:40,800
It's complicated.

320
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,280
We can't all sulk like this.

321
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,800
Yes, there is no customer.

322
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,201
But we have to stay strong.

323
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:58,280
Instead of waiting,

324
00:11:58,441 --> 00:11:59,721
let's do something.

325
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:02,481
Do what?

326
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:04,640
So,

327
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,121
allow me to present

328
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:07,920
the rules of this game.

329
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:10,841
Each of us has to raise five fingers.

330
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:11,920
Good.

331
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,001
And we will take turns

332
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,721
to say "I have never bla-bla-bla".

333
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:21,481
If you have done it before,

334
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:22,800
you withdraw

335
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,361
one finger.

336
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,680
If the same thing occurs again,

337
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,441
you withdraw another finger.

338
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:30,800
Whoever has the most fingers withdrawn

339
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,560

Okay.

343
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:43,880

00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:51,920
Come.

349
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:53,040
Five fingers.

350
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,760
Okay.

351
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,680
I'll go first then.

352
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:58,081
I have never won a prize.

353
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,441
All of you have won a prize before?

354
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,121
A free bottle.

355
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:07,241
A free packet.

356
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,880
I was luckier than them.

357
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,121
I got the first prize
in a shopping mall.

358
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:12,441
I spent 500 yuan

359
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:14,241
and got a necklace worth 5,000 yuan.

360
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:16,441
I think you got scammed.

361
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:18,121
Maybe you could get several of those
necklaces for 50 yuan.

362
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:19,800
But it's still winning a prize.

363

Fair enough. Go ahead.

My turn now. The second round.

370
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:35,321
I have never dated a friend.

377
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,160

the green scarf
when we were in high school.

379

I lost my memory. I have no idea.

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,441
It's none of your business.

508
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:26,800
Are you still mad about the scarf?

509
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:28,401
What scarf?

510
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:30,360
I should

511
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,201
explain to you.

512
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:34,641
I grabbed the scarf

513
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:35,840
by chance.

514
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,721
I can't recall my past at all.

515
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:39,800
Why are you telling me this?

516
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,080
I'm not interested

517
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,120
in your puppy love story.

518
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,800
Why are you mad then?

519
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,360
Who says I'm mad?

520
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,961
I didn't ask for an explanation,

521
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:51,320
but you came here with one.

522
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:55,120
We're all friends.

523
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,241
I don't want you to get any wrong idea.

524
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:58,721
There's no misunderstanding between us.

525
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:00,481
I can't believe you would forget
this too.

526
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,481
You must have been a horrible boyfriend.

527
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,760
- I...
- Don't just sit here.

528
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:06,280
You can come back here after I move out.

529
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:08,760
You can wear this if you want.

530
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,681
- No, thanks.
- I...

531
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,520
Lan.

532
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,721
You opened a restaurant, didn't you?

533
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:31,760
How is the business?

534
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,481
We're still testing the water

535
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:35,881
and adjusting our strategy.

536
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:38,800
You opened a restaurant without
a clear strategy in mind?

537
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,800
The young generation nowadays

538
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,441
is so unreliable.

539
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,441
Open for three days
and close for four days.

540
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:47,080
You think running a restaurant
is a simple task?

541
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,681
You have to work very hard for it.

542
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,040
You never like me anyway.

543
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:54,881
Growing up,

544
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,161
you never compliment me.

545
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,360
To receive a compliment,

546
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:04,961
you need to prove yourself worthy of it.

547
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,401
Am I wrong?

548
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,320
You're running

549
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,481
a tea party now.

550
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:12,481
That's not a career.

551
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,840
Come. Eat something.

552
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,721
Let's drop the topic.

553
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:22,080
Lan.

554
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,560
I have tidied your room.

555
00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:26,161
You can move back here.

556
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,280
Your dad misses you a lot.

557
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,840
He's harsh

558
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,800
towards you in person.

559
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:34,401
But if he doesn't see you,

560
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:36,040
he goes around to ask about you.

561
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,001
This house will always be here

562
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,040
whether she wants to move back or not.

563
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:47,961
Ms. Liu.

564
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:49,560
I won't move back.

565
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:51,080
I'll live in the restaurant.

566
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:53,840
That's not a good living environment.

567
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,481
It's better here.

568
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,721
Dad.

569
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,600
If I decided to run

570
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,921
a restaurant,

571
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,881
I will do my best

572
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:09,760
to run it.

573
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:11,600
Don't you worry about it.

574
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,840
I agree.

575
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:16,360
You should pursue what you like

576
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:19,600
when you're still young.

577
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Our society is prospering now.

578
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,961
If you work hard and persevere,

579
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:26,641
I'm sure you can make a name
for yourself.

580
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:28,600
Your dad

581
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,641
works in the school for far too long.

582
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,840
That's why he's more traditional.

583
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,040
Lan, if you need something

584
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,641
in the restaurant, just call me.

585
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:39,481
I'll send them to you.

586
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:55,120
Time flies.

587
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:56,441
We're about

588
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:58,241
to celebrate Chinese New Year together.

589
00:23:58,241 --> 00:23:59,320
Indeed.

590
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,201
At this point in life,

591
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:04,681
it's hard to find

592
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:06,080
real friends.

593
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,840
It's just the two of us left.

594
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,721
Mu.

595
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:13,641
You are my solace.

596
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
That's what I like to hear.

597
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:18,760
All right. Enough about that.

598
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:20,921
All you can do is coddling.

599
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,760
Something is meant to be said.

600
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,241
My buddy and I
are about to be separated.

601
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:29,600
Can't we appreciate each other?

602
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,961
Sure.

603
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:31,800
Do you have a problem with it?

604
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,721
Not at all.

605
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,641
No problem at all.

606
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:34,320
Zheng.

607
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,560
I'll chug it.
You do what you want to do.

608
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:36,760
Xiaoqin.

609
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,320
Just let them drink.

610
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,481
I don't want you guys
to move out either.

611
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:41,360
I'm serious.

612
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,600
We will hang out together.

613
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,721
I'm sure you'll visit us in a few days

614
00:24:43,721 --> 00:24:44,721
for hot pot.

615
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:46,241
It's not the same.

616
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:47,401
Uncle Mu, Aunt Hui,

617
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:48,881
I propose a toast to you two.

618
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:50,001
Thank you

619
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:51,320
for looking after us

620
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:53,280
and sorry for our imposition.

621
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,481
Oh, come on.

622
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
In our eyes,

623
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,481
you're like our daughter.

624
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:00,161
All right?

625
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:01,360
Exactly.

626
00:25:01,681 --> 00:25:04,881
So you proposed a toast
to Mr. and Mrs. Mu.

627
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:06,161
What about Zili?

628
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,401
You occupied his room

629
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:09,600
for a long time.

630
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,441
Shouldn't you thank him too?

631
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,080
Cheers then.

632
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,201
Now that we don't have to see
each other every day,

633
00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:21,320
you can move back to your room.

634
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:24,441
Out of sight, out of mind, right?

635
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:35,840
Let's eat.

636
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,760
Eat.

637
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,001
Lizi, grab a piece of meat for Daqian.

638
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,681
Mu.

639
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,921
I love your prawns.

640
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:54,800
Zixi.

641
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:56,681
When I was in high school,

642
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:57,800
did I date someone?

643
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:00,481
Zixi?

644
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,520
What?

645
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,481
Did I date someone in high school?

646
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,080
How am I supposed to know

647
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,520
if you had any secret affair?

648
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:14,481
Do you remember this scarf?

649
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,881
Did I ever bring it up?

650
00:26:16,481 --> 00:26:17,600
Look.

651
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:19,161
Do you remember which girl

652
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:19,961
gave it to me?

653
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,721
Girl?

654
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:24,161
Impossible.

655
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:25,320
Why?

656
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,760
No girl will want to give you a scarf
as a gift.

657
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:29,241
I...

658
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,320
You scared me.

659
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,241
Mi Lan.

660
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,080
I can't remember anything

661
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,760
about this scarf.

662
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,800
Was it just a joke?

663
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:02,481
It wasn't a joke.

664
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:04,080
You truly can't recall anything?

665
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,840
Mi Lan.

666
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:17,641
Lizi.

667
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:20,840
So...

668
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
What?

669
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,520
Can you be my girlfriend?

670
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,120
Sure.

671
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
You can have this.

672
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,080
Thank you.

673
00:27:58,401 --> 00:28:03,080
If we were together,

674
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,401
why didn't the others know about it?

675
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,001

Why?

What is it?

845
00:37:54,321 --> 00:37:56,240
Isn't this the scarf I gave Lizi?

846
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:57,881
He asked me to return it to you.

847
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:00,401
Okay.

848
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:03,600
So you gave it to him as a present?

849
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,640
Then you two were...

850
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:10,720
Nothing happened between us.

851
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:12,160
Why did you give him the scarf then?

852
00:38:13,281 --> 00:38:15,921
It was just a game.

853
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,720
Really?

854
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,761
Yes.

855
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,120
Daqian knew about this.

856
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:26,720
But somehow,

857
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:28,361
they both lost their memory

858
00:38:28,361 --> 00:38:29,240
about it.

859
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,001
Do you like the movie?

860
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,961
Just all right.

861
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,640
I think so too.

862
00:38:49,281 --> 00:38:51,841
Mi Lan and I...

863
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:53,441
Mi Lan has told me everything.

864
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,801
She did?

865
00:38:57,761 --> 00:38:58,720
So you knew?

866
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,841
You should have told me then.

867
00:39:04,281 --> 00:39:06,281
I was worrying for nothing.

868
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,921
Why were you worrying?

869
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,640
I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.

870
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,481
Nothing happened

871
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,040
between Mi Lan and me.

872
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,401
All right. Let's go home.

873
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:31,361
Which character from the movie
do you like?

874
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,001
I quite like

875
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:35,361
the one who traveled
to another parallel universe.

876
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:36,961
Right?

877
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:42,560
(Chicken ribs!)

878
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,040
(Delicious and cheap!)

879
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,401
(Buy one and get one free.)

880
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:46,401
(Don't miss the deal!)

881
00:39:46,401 --> 00:39:47,820

882
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,600
(Delicious and cheap!)

883
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,001
Slowly. Don't burn your tongue.

884
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,560
What else do you want?

885
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:56,520
Daddy, I want this, this, and this.

886
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,441
- And this too.
- Give me the squid.

887
00:39:58,441 --> 00:39:59,401
Liu Dazhi.

888
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:00,961
Daqian?

889
00:40:01,281 --> 00:40:02,761
The serendipity!

890
00:40:02,761 --> 00:40:04,040
Didn't you say you're our

891
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,441
most loyal customer?

892
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:07,761
It's buy one, get one free here.

893
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:08,761
Also, Niuniu

894
00:40:08,761 --> 00:40:10,600
keeps asking me to buy some.

895
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,680
Aunt Daqian.

896
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,080
Daddy said your restaurant
couldn't make this.

897
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,720
Kids don't mince their words.

898
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,200
Don't mind him.

899
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:20,881
Right.

900
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:22,401
Uncle Yingjun.

901
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:24,200
You're queuing?

902
00:40:25,761 --> 00:40:27,080
No offense but

903
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,560
you're helping our rival

904
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,720
instead of us.

905
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,200
As they say,

906
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,761
help your kin instead of an outsider.

907
00:40:32,761 --> 00:40:34,520
If you want to eat,
come to our restaurant.

908
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,441
Exactly!

909
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,640
No. 33.

910
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,961
No. 33!

911
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:39,680
No. 33!

912
00:40:40,281 --> 00:40:42,200
Mister, you're No. 33, aren't you?

913
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,401
I've been calling your number.

914
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
What are you staring at?

915
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:49,961
I just wanted to have a taste.

916
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:51,921
Buy one and get one free.

917
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,441
Daddy, are my chicken ribs done?

918
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,881
Today

919
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:23,441
marks the first Shareholders' Meeting

920
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:24,801
of Starry Sky.

921
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,881
I invited all of you here

922
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:27,801
to tell you

923
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:29,240
about something.

924
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,321
Due to the lack of experience,

925
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,520
we have trouble
finding the right strategy.

926
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:37,560
We're operating at a loss

927
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:38,441
but I believe

928
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:39,841
we will make profits soon.

929
00:41:39,841 --> 00:41:40,761
Don't worry.

930
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:42,120
I will make sure you get your return.

931
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:45,680
Patience.

932
00:41:46,801 --> 00:41:47,761
Be patient.

933
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,520
Running a western restaurant
is not easy.

934
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,281
Why?

935
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,001
One, it's expensive.

936
00:41:55,001 --> 00:41:58,600
Two, this is not a big city.

937
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:01,560
We need to find a suitable strategy.

938
00:42:01,961 --> 00:42:03,560
Let's start with something simple.

939
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,761
If you want something simple
and delicious,

940
00:42:05,761 --> 00:42:07,321
look no further than the chicken ribs
next door.

941
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:08,240
- Don't you agree?
- Delicious?

942
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:09,040
It's not as good as the one

943
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,961
- in the supermarket.
- Have you had it?

944
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:10,680
Of course, I have.

945
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,600
You buy one and you'll get another for free.

946
00:42:12,761 --> 00:42:14,761
Uncle Yingjun, the chicken ribs

947
00:42:14,761 --> 00:42:16,080
have their secret recipe.

948
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:19,401
Right, a secret recipe.

949
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,720
Hot pot then?

950
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,040
Hot pot and KTV.

951
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,881
- People can eat and sing.
- Wake up already.

952
00:42:23,881 --> 00:42:25,321
I don't think that will work.

953
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:28,801
Everyone likes it.
It can be both classy and down-to-earth.

954
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:29,761
Don't you think?

955
00:42:29,761 --> 00:42:31,160
Didn't I tell you?

956
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,881
Inviting them here

957
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:33,560
is akin to
having a Residents Committee meeting.

958
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,600
They are going to make it worse.

959
00:42:34,841 --> 00:42:36,401
They are our elderly

960
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,001
and our investors.

961
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,160
We just have to deal with it.

962
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:41,801
Your idea is just bad.

963
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:42,921
- Western food is better.
- Have you been to...

964
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:44,441
Stop.

965
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,640
Let me say something.

966
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,841
First of all,

967
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:50,761
we have to give credits

968
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:52,160
to our children's

969
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:54,281
determination and perseverance.

970
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,080
And if there's a problem,
we work together

971
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,321
to solve it.

972
00:42:58,321 --> 00:42:59,841
That's my first point.

973
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:02,080
Dad, make it brief.

974
00:43:02,321 --> 00:43:03,401
Okay.

975
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:06,281
What I want to say

976
00:43:06,281 --> 00:43:07,160
is that we

977
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,160
are not in a big city.

978
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,921
Dad, you already said that.

979
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,441
Let me finish.

980
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:16,361
So, we need to be down-to-earth.

981
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,441
How?

982
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:19,761
How can we achieve that?

983
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:20,520
Hot pot.

984
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,080
No.

985
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,080
I quite like

986
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,560
grilled cold noodles.

987
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,680
Grilled cold noodles?

988
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,520
Now, that's a bad idea.

989
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,560
Grilled cold noodles?

990
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,761
You might as well sell chicken ribs.

991
00:43:28,361 --> 00:43:30,481
I have been observing for a few days

992
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:31,520
and I have learned how to grill
chicken ribs.

993
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:33,921
We don't need a chef.

994
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:34,720
I can do it.

995
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,720
That will save a lot of money.

996
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,481
I'll grill some for you one day.

997
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,921
Hello?

998
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,761
You're still in the restaurant?

999
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:51,841
When are you coming back?

1000
00:43:52,481 --> 00:43:53,481
I'm here.

1001
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,481
What are you doing?

1002
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,841
I'm looking at the sky.

1003
00:44:00,841 --> 00:44:03,200
It's a beautiful night.

1004
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,680
There are a lot of stars.

1005
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:06,801
There is no star.

1006
00:44:06,961 --> 00:44:08,680
It's cold here. Go home.

1007
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,600
I'll go back now.

1008
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,560
Wait.

1009
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,921
This is for you.

1010
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,881
It's getting cold.
Cover your neck at least.
