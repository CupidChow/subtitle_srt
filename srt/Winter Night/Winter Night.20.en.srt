00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,759
She has always wanted to go there.

167
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,039
Then, they would have to part ways.

168
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,399
I've been thinking about this recently.

169
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,200
What if the happy ending I want

170
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,439
for them,

171
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:30,480
is just my own selfish wish?

172
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,799
So I will leave it to my mum to decide.

173
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,799
My dad said,

174
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,039
we don't have to

175
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,600
always sit at the same table

176
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,439
or live under the same roof
to be a family.

177
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,240
Junze,

178
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,120
do you still remember the incident
that happened when you were little?

179
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,799
You were playing firecrackers.

180
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,080
You were
holding a joss stick in this hand,

181
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,240
and a firecracker in that hand.

182
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,439
After you lit it,

183
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,480
you threw away the joss stick instead.

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,679
And you burned your glove.

185
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:17,880
That's right.

186
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,679
I felt so sorry for you.

187
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,759
Dad,

188
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,000
can we watch fireworks together
every year?

189
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,120
Sure.

190
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,559
Of course.

191
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,919
Mum.

192
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,799
Watch carefully.

193
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,759
Why?

194
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,120
These fireworks are purple.

195
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,240
It's your favorite color.

196
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,600
It's the most difficult
to get a purple firework,

197
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,399
because purple is the most subtle color
in the night sky.

198
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,000
It's not easy to make it.

199
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,159
Thank you.

200
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,120
It's here.

201
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,240
It's fine.

202
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,840
Even if we miss it this year,
we can always keep it in our mind.

203
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,559
Next year.

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,679
We'll watch it together next year.

205
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,240
Next year.

206
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,960
Sure.

207
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,240
We don't always get
to gather around like this.

208
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,200
Let's take a group photo together.

209
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,080
- Good idea.
- Sure.

210
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,120
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

211
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
- Yes. Sure.
- Yes. Sure.

212
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,279
I'll get the camera.

213
00:11:59,279 --> 00:11:59,880
All right.

214
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,159
When I count to three,

215
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,039
everyone will say
"happy new year" together.

216
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,120
Sure.

217
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,279
One. Two. Three.

218
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,200
- Happy new year!
- Happy new year!

219
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,360
Let's take another one.

220
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,559
What's the matter?

221
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,960
Nothing.

222
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,439
Happy new year.

223
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,279
Where did the others go?

224
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,679
They left after they sang
"Tonight is Unforgettable".

225
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,559
Why didn't you wake me up
when they were leaving?

226
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,880
You were sleeping so soundly,

227
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,919
and I didn't want to wake you up.

228
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,000
What are you carving?

229
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm almost done.

230
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:31,159
All done.

231
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,480
We didn't get
to visit the Ice Lantern Show.

232
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,320
I can only make it up with this.

233
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,320
I heard

234
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,880
there's an ice lantern in the festival
which can grant your wishes.

235
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,120
I don't know what it looks like,

236
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,960
so I made this up myself.

237
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,759
Let's make a wish.

238
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,439

241
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,799
I hope

242
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,399
we can go back in time.

243
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,399
I hope

244
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,240
time can freeze.

we're going to see a meteor shower?

Are we?

but what if

290
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,519
it causes a major power outage?

Now you've reminded me.

00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:17,040

blacked out.

302
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,159
If a bolide can cause a power outage,

303
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
will it confuse time and space too?

304
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,840
Do you think it's like what happened
in the movie, "Your Name"?

306
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:34,999
I have a question.

307
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,239
If

308
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,520
there really is a parallel universe,

309
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,959
will the bolide

310
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:41,159
swap two universes?

311
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,999
This sounds like a science fiction.

312
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,040
Why are you interested in this
all of a sudden?

313
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,239
I'm just curious.

314
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,999
Yan, do you still remember it?

315
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:50,320
Do you remember

316
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,360
when exactly we last saw the bolide?

317
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,080
I can't remember.

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,040
It'd be really great if I can go back.

501
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,840
If I can go back,

502
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,360
then your Zheng Daqian might be able
to come back here too.

503
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,280
Then, we'll return to the right time.

504
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:20,919
Hey.

505
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:23,479
We'll be right back.

506
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,280
What happened?

(Operating Room)

508
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,040
Is Mu Guoliang's family here?

509
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:41,199
Doctor, how's the patient?

510
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,840
The patient's vital signs
are very stable now.

511
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:45,639
We did an abdominal drainage for him.

512
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:48,080
It has significantly relieved
his abdominal pain and bloating.

513
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,360
What can he eat

514
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,600
when he's awake?

515
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,999
It's been more than a day
since he last ate anything.

516
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,199
He must be starving.

517
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:54,959
This...

518
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,880
It depends,
because he's still unconscious now.

519
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,840
We don't know for sure
if he'll gain his consciousness.

520
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:04,719
I would like to know

521
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,239
what he can eat if he wakes up.

522
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:09,959
Then...

523
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,360
Mashed vegetables,

524
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,600
or things like Chinese yam.

525
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,040
Eat in moderation.

526
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,520
Sure.

527
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,040
Thank you.

Lizi,

529
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,840
stay here with your dad.

530
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,840
I'll go home and make some food.

531
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,280
Excuse me, may I know
where the operating room is?

532
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,080
Over there.

533
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,199
Thank you.

534
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:59,239
Zixi, why are you sitting here?

535
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,040
How is Uncle Mu?

536
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,080
He might not be able
to regain consciousness.

537
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,360
I saw him lying there.

538
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,120
It felt like I was very close

539
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,080
to losing him.

540
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,719
Zixi, pull yourself together.

541
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,800
Uncle Mu is really proud of you.

542
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,800
How is Uncle Mu?

543
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,199
He's still in a coma.

544
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,080
Where is Aunt Hui?

545
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,280
She's gone home to cook for my dad.

546
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,399
We're not as good an actor as my mum is.

547
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,159
She knew about this a long time ago.

548
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:54,560
When two people are in love,

549
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,800
they'll be able to feel

550
00:31:58,919 --> 00:31:59,999
the slightest change.

551
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,959
Dad and mum are stronger
than we thought.

552
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,999
Uncle Mu needs you a lot right now.

553
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,639
Cheer up.

554
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:14,600
I'm fine.

555
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,600
Don't worry about me.

556
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,719
Like my dad always said,

557
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,560
stop being sad.

558
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,320
I'll go and get some paperwork done.

559
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,040
Give me the bills. I'll do it.

560
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,560
You should eat something
while you're here.

561
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:43,320
Aren't you hungry?

562
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,560
Would you like anything to eat?

563
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:00,159
Have something.

564
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:04,080
Uncle Mu will wake up very soon.

565
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,919
Eat something,

566
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:08,760
so that you'll have the strength
to put on an act later.

I can't lie

570
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,679
to you anymore.

571
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,600
I didn't know

572
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,080
you were pretty good at acting.

573
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,439
You even asked your son
to do it with you.

574
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:14,680
You've been acting for quite a while.

575
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,439
It was as if we were playing house.

576
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,360
Fine. I'll join you then.

577

Let's keep playing
until you recover from this completely.

All right?

579

the amulet there?

that this disease is curable.

What a lousy hospital.

600
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:57,439
If they can't do it,
we'll transfer to a bigger hospital.

601
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,200
I could call my buddies in other cities.

602

We can go to Tieyuan or Harbin.

If it won't work,
we can also transfer him to Beijing.

605

It has nothing to do with the hospital.

Calm down.

What are you talking about?

609
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,559
It's definitely the hospital's fault.

611

Get up.
