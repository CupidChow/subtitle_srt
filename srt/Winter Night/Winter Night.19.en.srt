00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:56,063
Yan, Lizi,

173
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:57,382
if

174
00:11:57,742 --> 00:11:59,262
we can't find them in the next hour,

175
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:01,103
we have to get back in the car
and gather up.

176
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:02,183
Do you hear me?

177
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:06,863
Daqian!

178
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:10,343
Uncle Yingjun!

179
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:13,983
Zheng Daqian!

180
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:16,542
Zheng Yingjun!

181
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,823
Zheng Daqian!

182
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:28,022
Zheng Daqian!

183
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:30,422
Mu Zili.

184
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:31,183
Zheng Daqian!

185
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,103
Slow down.

186
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:45,902
I told you

187
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:46,983
to wait for us.

188
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:48,343
Who allowed you to act on your own?

189
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,183
You never listened to me.

190
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:51,183
If you disappeared here at night,

191
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:52,662
we'd lose track of you tomorrow morning.

192
00:12:52,662 --> 00:12:53,502
You know that?

193
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,103
Why are you yelling at me?

194
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:56,422
I was worried. That's my dad.

195
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:57,782
Something might happen to him.

196
00:12:57,782 --> 00:12:59,103
It's completely possible.

197
00:12:59,103 --> 00:12:59,863
You know?

198
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:00,823
Maybe he'll die here

199
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,183
tonight.

200
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:03,183
I've got to go find him.

201
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,183
I must... I must...

202
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,382
- Wait.
- I must continue to search for him.

203
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:06,063
Wait.

204
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:10,742
Don't blindly search for him.

205
00:13:11,103 --> 00:13:13,103
It occurs to me that there's a place
your dad might've gone.

206
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:14,662
My dad got a cottage here.

207
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:15,983
They often went there back then.

208
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:17,622
Let's go. Hurry up.

209
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,343
This is the place.

210
00:13:55,422 --> 00:13:57,022
What to do? My dad is not here.

211
00:13:58,343 --> 00:13:59,303
Calm down.

212
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,662
There's a fire in the house.

213
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:02,382
And there's a half-eaten
sweet potato on the table.

214
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:04,022
It means
Uncle Yingjun must've been here.

215
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:04,983
I'll go outside and search for him

216
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:06,183
Let's go.

217
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,063
You stay in there. I'll go look for him.

218
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:10,823
No.

219
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:12,262
Don't go anywhere.

220
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:14,463
Where did Zheng Yingjun go?

221
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:25,142
Over here.

222
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:31,943
Uncle Yingjun!

223
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:34,303
Zheng Yingjun!

224
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:36,223
Uncle Yingjun!

225
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,463
Zheng Yingjun!

226
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:40,063
Uncle Yingjun!

227
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:43,303
Zheng Yingjun!

228
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:51,902
Zheng Yingjun!

229
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:53,622
Uncle Yingjun!

230
00:14:55,902 --> 00:14:57,902
Daqian. Daqian!

231
00:14:57,902 --> 00:14:59,103
Uncle Yingjun is here!

232
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:02,382
Uncle Yingjun!

233
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:04,262
Dad!

234
00:15:05,622 --> 00:15:06,223
Dad!

235
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:07,463
Dad, how do you feel?

236
00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:08,303
Dad!

237
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,382
Dad, can you move?

238
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:13,103
Don't scare me, dad!

239
00:15:13,223 --> 00:15:14,863
Dad, what's wrong with you?

240
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:16,463
Wake up, dad!

241
00:15:16,622 --> 00:15:17,983
Don't scare me, dad!

242
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:19,662
Dad! Dad!

243
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:20,863
Dad!

244
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:22,303
Dad!

245
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,183
Dad.

246
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:28,183
Daqian.

247
00:15:28,422 --> 00:15:29,902
Can you move?

248
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:32,343
How do you feel?

249
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:32,943
Uncle.

250
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:34,502
Uncle, why did you come here?

251
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:35,863
Zili.

252
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:38,662
You're all here.

253
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:41,823
What's wrong with you?
You're freaking me out.

254
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,742
You can't scare me like this.

255
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:47,742
I came here,

256
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,022
thinking to take a sip of liquor.

257
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,943
I will end myself after that.

258
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,542
All I thought about was you

259
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:04,142
when I closed my eyes.

260
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:06,983
It occurred to me

261
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,063
that you haven't got married

262
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:11,422
and had kids.

263
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:15,622
I was thinking

264
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:19,703
if anyone will treat you nice.

265
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:26,583
It made me regret.

266
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:28,183
No matter what,

267
00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:30,502
you can't scare me like this.

268
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:33,463
How am I supposed to live
if something happens to you again?

269
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:36,022
Let me ask you this.
Are you trying to scare me to death?

270
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:38,742
I'm scared to death.

271
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:41,742
You're scaring me!

272
00:16:44,622 --> 00:16:47,662
You scare me to death, dad.

273
00:16:51,422 --> 00:16:52,583
That's enough, Daqian.

274
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:53,542
Stop crying.

275
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,022
Let's quickly help Uncle Yingjun inside.

276
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:56,063
Come on. Let's go.

277
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,063
Let's go, dad.

278
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:58,103
Get up. Stop sleeping.

279
00:16:58,103 --> 00:16:58,703
Hurry.

280
00:16:59,303 --> 00:16:59,943
Let's go.

281
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:00,902
Come.

282
00:17:01,742 --> 00:17:02,542
Come, dad.

283
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:03,583
Come, one, two...

284
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:06,463
Let's go.

285
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:07,703
Let's go.

286
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,183
Where are we going?

287
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:09,902
Going back.

288
00:17:09,902 --> 00:17:11,583
To the cottage.

289
00:17:29,063 --> 00:17:29,702
Daqian,

290
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:31,662
let Uncle Yingjun take
a sip of warm water.

291
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:32,783
So it can warm him.

292
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:35,063
I'll give it to him later.

293
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,382
Let him sleep for a while.

294
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:42,263
Lizi, where are you?

295
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:44,063
Yan and I are in the car now.

296
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,702
Reply me if you receive my message.

297
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:47,982
Dazhi, I've found Uncle Yingjun.

298
00:17:48,222 --> 00:17:50,103
What about Daqian?
Have you found Daqian?

299
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,023
Yes, I've found them.

300
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:52,942
Where are you?

301
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,462
We're in the cottage now.

302
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:55,982
I'm coming for you.

303
00:17:55,982 --> 00:17:57,063
Forget it.

304
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:58,422
It's not safe at night.

305
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:00,503
There's no reception here.

306
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,422
You should go back

307
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:02,662
and report safety to your family.

308
00:18:03,422 --> 00:18:05,382
Okay, stay safe.

309
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:10,222
It's an exhausting night.

310
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:12,622
It's even tougher than my work.

311
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:16,583
Hello.

312
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,422
Hello, Aunt Qin.

313
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:18,382
We've found Uncle Zheng.

314
00:18:19,142 --> 00:18:19,942
He's fine.

315
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:21,503
They'll stay overnight at the cottage.

316
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:22,783
They asked us to report safety to you.

317
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:24,982
Okay, good, as long as they found him.

318
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:27,023
Thank you, Junze.

319
00:18:27,503 --> 00:18:28,503
Rest assured.

320
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:29,982
Yes, I feel reassured.

321
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:30,942
Goodbye.

322
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:41,263
Stop pulling a long face.

323
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:43,182
We've found Uncle Yingjun

324
00:18:43,182 --> 00:18:44,023
and he's fine.

325
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:48,863
I guess I've figured out
the reason why I came here.

326
00:18:49,343 --> 00:18:50,382
Coming back here

327
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,063
has given me time
to get along with my dad.

328
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:55,902
It has given me the chance

329
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,422
to do something that I haven't done.

330
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:01,382
When I was looking for my dad,

331
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:04,662
all I thought about was

332
00:19:05,982 --> 00:19:08,063
that I haven't spent enough time
with him.

333
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:10,743
Time is very limited.

334
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:14,583
That I'm afraid
I might suddenly lose him.

335
00:19:23,982 --> 00:19:24,702
Daqian,

336
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:30,543
I didn't go to you

337
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:32,382
at the Ice Lantern Festival,

338
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:38,103
because I figured out
my dad's actual condition.

339
00:19:54,942 --> 00:19:56,702
It's pancreatic cancer.

340
00:19:57,743 --> 00:19:59,422
And it's in its last stage.

341
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:01,343
The doctor said

342
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:03,503
it's pointless

343
00:20:05,462 --> 00:20:06,422
to undergo a surgery.

344
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:11,783
We can only control it
with chemotherapy.

345
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:13,583
Did...

346
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,422
Did my mum

347
00:20:16,823 --> 00:20:18,583
know that?

348
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,462
Kid,

349
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:29,503
you already knew it now.

350
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:32,343
It's good.

351
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:36,263
I don't feel lonely anymore.

352
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:37,942
Dad,

353
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:40,543
I'll accompany you

354
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:42,222
until you're healed.

355
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:52,422
Don't be ridiculous.

356
00:20:58,303 --> 00:20:59,942
I'm no longer important.

357
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:03,863
What matters is this family.

358
00:21:07,863 --> 00:21:08,863
Look.

359
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:11,023
How nice this family is.

360
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:14,343
I spent my life...

361
00:21:15,422 --> 00:21:18,343
Everything I've done in my life

362
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:21,503
is for this family.

363
00:21:22,462 --> 00:21:24,343
To make you guys happy.

364
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:27,902
Do you know how much I love your mum

365
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:31,023
and these two sons of mine?

366
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:34,063
But I don't have much time left.

367
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,303
I could leave you guys

368
00:21:39,182 --> 00:21:40,902
at any moment.

369
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:44,583
There's only one thing
I can't let go of.

370
00:21:45,063 --> 00:21:46,543
It is this family.

371
00:21:47,902 --> 00:21:49,142
I hope that you could

372
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:52,622
take up the responsibility
toward this family.

373
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:54,543
After I leave,

374
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,583
you must keep

375
00:21:59,263 --> 00:22:00,702
your mum and brother

376
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:01,503
company.

377
00:22:05,142 --> 00:22:07,543
Don't let me leave with regrets.

378
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:13,263
Can you promise me that?

379
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:37,702
I went for the second chemotherapy
with him.

380
00:22:38,783 --> 00:22:40,783
The doctor said
his condition has improved.

381
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:44,382
There might be a chance.

382
00:22:45,182 --> 00:22:46,783
You know that my dad

383
00:22:48,662 --> 00:22:50,783
fears to see people sad.

384
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:54,982
He always asks me
to further develop my acting skill.

385
00:22:55,902 --> 00:22:57,462
He said we can't be sad

386
00:23:00,063 --> 00:23:01,823
even if he has to go.

387
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:04,222
He said one's birth

388
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:08,263
should be solemnly celebrated.

389
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:13,023
It should be relaxing when one leaves.

390
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,783
As light

391
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:17,702
as possible.

392
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:21,702
It's best to be like a joke.

393
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,303
To make each other feel
like there's a future.

394
00:23:35,303 --> 00:23:36,422
I need to get some fresh air.

395
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,583
It'd be great if this is a dream.

396
00:24:39,182 --> 00:24:40,743
Nothing has happened

Let's come here next time.

Dad.

It's alright. Don't be afraid.

415

If mum comes back,

let's just be cool

We must be sincere.

419

Mum is sharp-tongued but tender-hearted.

Yes, Uncle.

You're one family, after all.

425
00:26:29,343 --> 00:26:31,783
Zili, this is different.

426
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:35,182
I'm in great trouble this time.

427
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:40,462
You've eaten and drunk your fill?

You've come around?

You've decided to leave the hill?

Calm down, Aunt.

431
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:52,103
Uncle Zheng went to our family's cottage

to get you some blueberry wine.

Lizi, come on in. It's cold out there.

It's okay, Aunt.

I've got to go home

Talk nicely.

Well,

445
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:44,142
I'll delete the stock market software.

The computer.

447
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:49,583
I'll sell the computer.

448
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:52,422
From now on, I'll behave steadfast

449
00:27:52,543 --> 00:27:54,583
and be practical.

450

If you don't believe me,

451
00:27:57,823 --> 00:27:59,222
I'll write you a notarized statement

452

and sign it.

What are you waiting for?

454
00:28:39,103 --> 00:28:40,222
Will you

455
00:28:40,222 --> 00:28:41,583
still go to Shenzhen?

456

You're going to stay here?

457
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,382
I haven't slept well lately.

458
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:52,263
From today onwards,

459
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:52,863
you sleep over there.

460
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:56,543
On the couch?

That's great.

462
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:01,142
It's soft and warm.

463

Even food can't shut you up.

464
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,103
Is there no garlic?

465
00:29:13,182 --> 00:29:14,583
Why are you asking so much?

466
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:22,182
It's alright if you don't have any.

467

As the Spring Festival is approaching,

471

there's a lot of things to handle
at the Fireworks Factory.

472
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:45,823
I'll give him a hand.

473
00:30:46,422 --> 00:30:47,662
Okay, I got it.

474
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:49,023
For how long?

475
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:50,422
Maybe

476
00:30:51,222 --> 00:30:53,222
three to four days.

477
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:54,222
Okay.

478
00:30:54,662 --> 00:30:56,063
Then, bring more clothes with you.

479
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,222
The weather is cooling down in two days.

480
00:30:58,182 --> 00:30:58,783
Sure.

00:31:07,103 --> 00:31:07,702
Sure.

Slow down, Dad.

let me ask you a trick question.

Sure.

488
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:54,982
Let's say

489
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:57,702
a lion and a bear are having
a poop match.

490
00:32:58,023 --> 00:32:59,503
Who will win the match?

491
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:03,422
I have no idea.

492
00:33:03,543 --> 00:33:05,182
Of course it's the lion.

493
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:06,503
Why?

494
00:33:06,942 --> 00:33:10,743
Because lion's poop defeats that of bear.
[*Actions speak louder than words]

495
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:17,982
Good, this is impressive.

496
00:33:19,023 --> 00:33:21,743
It's a punchline.

497
00:33:22,382 --> 00:33:23,343
I got it.

498
00:33:24,063 --> 00:33:25,823
Dad, if you're tired,

499
00:33:25,823 --> 00:33:27,103
just stop talking

500
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:28,182
and get some rest.

501
00:33:28,622 --> 00:33:29,583
Take a rest, Uncle.

502
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:30,823
I'm not tired.

503
00:33:32,503 --> 00:33:34,863
I like to chat with Daqian.

504
00:33:36,942 --> 00:33:37,662
Daqian,

505
00:33:39,462 --> 00:33:41,023
I'll ask you a trick question as well.

506
00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:42,103
Sure.

00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:46,982
I was put on a drip.

509
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,982
What kind of fluid is that?

510
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:54,263
Dad,

511
00:33:54,263 --> 00:33:56,222
you've surfed the internet a lot.

512
00:33:56,222 --> 00:33:58,103
Uncle, you're definitely the king
of punchlines.

513
00:34:04,863 --> 00:34:05,823
Let him sleep for a while.

514
00:34:06,662 --> 00:34:08,182
Get some sleep, Uncle.

515
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:24,062
The cancer cells are spreading too fast.

516
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:28,462
Tumor of the pancreatic head

517
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:30,663
is inoperable.

518
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,183
Besides, with his condition,

519
00:34:33,703 --> 00:34:35,143
the patient won't be able to take this.

520
00:34:35,663 --> 00:34:36,823
But,

521
00:34:37,462 --> 00:34:39,502
you said there was hope for him

522
00:34:39,582 --> 00:34:41,982
during the second chemotherapy.

523
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:44,343
That the targeted drug did work, doctor.

524
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:44,982
Yes.

525
00:34:45,743 --> 00:34:47,663
But the cancer cells are
strongly invasive

526
00:34:47,703 --> 00:34:48,663
and they can metastasize.

527
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:50,502
This kind of characteristic will

528
00:34:50,623 --> 00:34:52,663
allow the cancer cells
which have just been reproduced

529
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:54,102
to invade and metastasize

530
00:34:54,102 --> 00:34:55,343
the other important organs.

531
00:34:56,582 --> 00:34:58,022
The reproduction rate
of the cancer cells is

532
00:34:58,502 --> 00:34:59,663
beyond our imagination.

533
00:35:12,502 --> 00:35:13,783
Go back and get prepared.

534
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,982
It's time to tell your family members
about it.

535
00:35:19,062 --> 00:35:21,022
Try to make
the patient feel comfortable.

536
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:52,343
Well,

537
00:35:53,022 --> 00:35:54,942
how much longer does he have?

538
00:35:57,263 --> 00:35:58,623
We'll see after this Spring Festival.

539
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:09,343
I'll take you to this movie
when we go back.

540
00:36:09,982 --> 00:36:10,663
Sure.

541
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:11,863
How was it?

542
00:36:18,942 --> 00:36:22,382
The doctor said there's no problem.

543
00:36:23,062 --> 00:36:24,502
Just continue the treatment.

544
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,022
You'll get well soon.

545
00:36:31,663 --> 00:36:32,743
Just now,

546
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:36,382
Daqian told me about the movie.

547
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:39,582
It's fun.

548
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:43,542
It reminded me
of the time when I was young.

549
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:46,542
To be honest with you.

550
00:36:46,783 --> 00:36:47,743
That time,

551
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,223
I didn't just write poems.

552
00:36:50,703 --> 00:36:54,022
I even held a poetry reading.

553
00:36:54,102 --> 00:36:56,183
Uncle Mu, you can even write poems?

554
00:36:56,183 --> 00:36:57,462
What kind of poem did you write?

555
00:36:58,942 --> 00:37:02,263
You have to ask his mum then.

556
00:37:09,303 --> 00:37:10,422
I'm not bragging.

557
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,303
It's so romantic.

558
00:37:18,982 --> 00:37:19,902
Son.

559
00:37:37,462 --> 00:37:38,783
Let's go home.

560
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:45,942
I don't want to go for the chemotherapy.

561
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,102
I miss your mum.

562
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:38,183
I'm sure there will be a miracle.

563
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:41,582
There must be.

564
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,663
You've got to improve
your acting skills too.

565
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:57,062
When we go back...

566
00:38:57,863 --> 00:38:59,582
When we go back...

567
00:39:01,102 --> 00:39:03,303
We still have to put on a show
with my dad when we go back.
