You sure we don't need

She's fine. She ate too much.

She has always been like this.

You didn't eat anything just now.

I can buy the house at the moment.

You two are close then.

Who cares?

344
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:44,841
He's Zheng Daqian's father.

345
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:46,240
You can't take his money.

wake up already.

If this carries on, you'll screw yourself

Something's wrong with the recruitment.

I don't think

354
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:02,280
we can sign the contract.

355
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,321
It can't be.

356

I signed and pressed my thumbprint too.

357

I brought the cash too.

Mr. Zheng, we can't take the money.

359

an illegal product.

00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,601
what Wang Dahua was doing.

506
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:40,561
And back in Ningzhou,

507
00:26:40,561 --> 00:26:42,680
they were involved in a similar case

508
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,000
and were arrested too.

509
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,680
She has a criminal record?

510
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,841
It's not that serious.

511
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:49,440
It was just
an administrative punishment.

512
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,401
It's the same today.

513
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:54,361
Mi Lan did not commit a crime.

514
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,401
You just have to fill in some papers

515
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:57,680
and you can leave with her.

516
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,601
I'll go back in.

517
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
(Hedong Police Station)

518
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:12,121
Lanzi, don't take it to heart.

519
00:27:12,401 --> 00:27:13,601
It's nothing serious.

520
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,841
Mi, what are you doing?

521
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:20,200
Let's talk it out.

522
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,720
You bring dishonor to your mom.

523
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
Mi.

524
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,200
Lanzi, your dad is just upset.

525
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:29,561
Mi.

526
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:42,041
Lanzi, don't make a hasty decision.

527
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:43,760
We can have a conversation about it.

528
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,440
Okay?

529
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:45,801
No thanks, Lizi.

530
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:49,200
Sorry for the trouble.

531
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:51,121
This is...

532
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:52,760
Zheng Daqian.

533
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,601
Zheng Daqian.

534
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,720
Daqian.

535
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,000
I owe you an explanation.

536
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,161
Dahua and I

537
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:13,881
didn't work together
to scam Uncle Yingjun.

538
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:15,801
Once bitten, twice shy.

539
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,841
Lanzi.

540
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:43,361
It's late at night.
Why are you drinking coffee?

541
00:28:43,361 --> 00:28:44,760
You don't want to sleep?

542
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,601
None of your business.

543
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,960
Look.

544
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,920
You should have heard Mi Lan out.

545
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:54,881
You shouldn't have ignored her
just like that.

546
00:28:54,881 --> 00:28:56,121
It won't solve anything.

547
00:28:56,881 --> 00:28:57,641
What are you doing?

548
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,121
Daqian is just trying to be
your sketch model here.

549
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,920
You guys fought?

550
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:07,000
We? Impossible.

551
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:08,920
It's because of Mi Lan.

552
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,161
Mi Lan?

553
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,161
What happened to her?

554
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,081
She left.

555
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:17,520
She left?

556
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:20,881
Where did she go? And why?

557
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:23,280
What happened?

558
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,841
Hi, I'd like a ticket to Tieyuan.

559
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,200
The last train has left.
Please come again tomorrow.

560
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,401
Let's go, Xiaoyu.

561
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,720
Sure.

562
00:29:37,841 --> 00:29:39,161
We're closing. You should leave too.

563
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:40,321
All right.

564
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,200
Miss, you're heading to Tieyuan?

565
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,801
I can give you a lift.

566
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:49,401
On meter.

567
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,000
No, thanks.

568
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,200
E-hailing won't work.

569
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,361
It's too late.

570
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:01,240
Don't worry.
I always find customers here.

571
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
I'm not a liar.

572
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,520
If you're not in a rush,

573
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,641
then you wait until tomorrow morning.

574
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:07,720
There's no more taxi tonight.

575
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,240
If you're in a rush,

576
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:10,960
we can leave at 2 a.m. OK?

577
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,720
Is this a metered taxi?

578
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,480
Yes.

579
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:17,240
I'm serious. Come.

580
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,000
Let's go.

581
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,680
Mi Lan.

582
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:29,881
Mi Lan.

583
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:42,121
Hi, the number you have dialed
is unavailable.

584
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:47,561
I heard from Dazhi that something bad
happened to Mi Lan?

585
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,000
Where is she?

586
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:51,401
She left.

587
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,440
Where to?

588
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:55,041
No idea.

589
00:30:57,161 --> 00:30:58,801
You have no idea either, Daqian?

590
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,920
No idea.

591
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,321
Where can she be this late at night?

592
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
Call your brother.

593
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,121
He's looking for her. You can ask him.

594
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,041
He just left.

595
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,520
Call him. Don't waste time.

596
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,121
Hello?

597
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:21,401
Zixi, have you found Mi Lan?

598
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:22,680
She took an illegal cab.

599
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,240
I'm hailing a taxi to chase after her.

600
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:25,121
An illegal cab?

601
00:31:25,321 --> 00:31:26,440
Why did she take one?

602
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:30,401
Zixi, why did Mi Lan hail
an illegal cab?

603
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:31,000
Wait for us.

604
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,161
We're driving there now.

605
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:33,000
Okay.

606
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:34,601
Hurry up.

607
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:35,601
Let's go.

608
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:36,720
It's too dangerous for a girl

609
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
to take an illegal cab now.

610
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:54,041
Miss, you're traveling to Baihe?

611
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,680
It's late now.

612
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,841
Going to Tieyuan alone

613
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,480
is dangerous.

614
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:04,561
What are you doing there?

615
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,680
Mister, how far are we from Tieyuan?

616
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,200
Another two-hour drive.

617
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:34,240
I can't reach her either.
Her phone has been switched off.

618
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:35,920
Don't tell me something bad happened.

619
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,200
Mu Zili, drive faster.

620
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,361
I'm driving as fast as I can.

621
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:40,920
We can just call the police

622
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,081
and ask Dazhi to help us.

623
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:43,841
Okay. I'll make the call.

624
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,881
That's the cab.

625
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:53,480
Is she in the cab?

626
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,280
I couldn't see clearly.

627
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,081
- Mu Zili. Turn back.
- Okay.

(It's a visual effect,
don't imitate the dangerous play.)

629
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,960
What the heck?

630
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,881
Do you know how to drive?

631
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:19,881
It's dangerous.

632
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:23,361
Where is she?

633
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,601
Where is she?

634
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:25,361
Zixi. Zixi.

635
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:26,960
What? Let go of me.

636
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,841
- Let go of me.
- Let him go.

637
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:28,480
Let go!

638
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:29,561
Calm down.

639
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:32,440
Where is the passenger?

640
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:45,361
Mister.

641
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,200
You're lying.

642
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:49,321
Miss, watch your mouth.

643
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:50,440
I didn't lie to anyone.

644
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,361
Something's wrong with your meter.

645
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,960
This place is around

646
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,321
30km away from Baihe.

647
00:33:55,321 --> 00:33:56,920
Your meter is going crazy.

648
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,280
It's working. This is the price.

649
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:00,881
No way.

650
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,321
This is more expensive than a cab.

651
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:05,401
I said it would be metered

652
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:06,960
but I didn't say it would be cheaper
than a cab.

Why?

658
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,921
Get off the car then.

You're in the middle of nowhere here.

You won't find a taxi driver.

00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:50,521
Right. I can't see the road clearly either.

673
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:51,800
What should we do then?

674
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,200
Are we going to be stuck here?

675
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:55,800
Stuck here it is.

676
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:58,200
This car has a heater.
We won't freeze to death.

677
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,521
We came in a hurry

678
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:16,320
and I forgot to fill the tank.

679
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,921
Guys.

680
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:21,001
Let me switch off the heater.

681
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,521
Please bear with me.

682
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:38,680
You can have them.

683
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:41,880
Put them on.

684
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,081
Daqian.

685
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,561
Put on mine.

686
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,041
Look at Yan.

687
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,561
Trustworthy and reliable.

688
00:37:57,601 --> 00:37:58,200
Right.

689
00:37:58,481 --> 00:37:59,161
Right.

690
00:38:00,441 --> 00:38:01,800
How long can we stay on the road?

691
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,200
I estimate

692
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:06,400
that we can't go home.

693
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:10,280
But

694
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:13,280
Tiexi is around 3 km from here.

695
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,720
My grandmother lives there.

696
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,041
If possible,

697
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,601
we can stay with her tonight

698
00:38:17,601 --> 00:38:19,320
and go back tomorrow
once we fill the tank.

699
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,481
3 km

700
00:38:21,561 --> 00:38:23,400
is plausible.

701
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,641
Mi Lan.

702
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,840
We're five here.

703
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,041
Will it be all right?

704
00:38:29,081 --> 00:38:30,161
It should be fine.

705
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,961
I also haven't seen her in a long while.

706
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:34,400
All the more reasons

707
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,121
to visit her.

708
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,200
Besides, everyone is starving.

709
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,601
I'm going to die from starvation.

710
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:42,320
I would kill for a hot meal.

711
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,521
I would kill for a petrol station.

712
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,360
Grandma.

713
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,161
There's no food here.

714
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,601
Do you know what time it is?

715
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,280
It's snowy.

716
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,521
Instead of staying at home,

717
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:19,840
you loiter around.

718
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:22,081
And before you went out, you didn't
check the weather forecast.

719
00:39:22,161 --> 00:39:22,961
It's so late

720
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,760
and I have to stay up.

721
00:39:24,921 --> 00:39:26,720
You are all good for nothing.

722
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:29,441
Why are you smiling?

723
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:31,240
All right.

724
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,800
Sleep now.

725
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:35,641
Leave tomorrow morning.

726
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,481
Lanzi.

727
00:39:43,161 --> 00:39:44,081
Your grandmother

728
00:39:44,641 --> 00:39:45,840
is like this?

729
00:39:46,521 --> 00:39:47,760
Sorry.

730
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,360
She was the village chief

731
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:51,961
and she used to yell at people.

732
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,360
She was a leader, I see.

733
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,001
Whatever. I'm tired.

734
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,121
Goodnight.

735
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:00,521
Wait.

736
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,161
Where do we sleep?

737
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,601
The men sleep on the left

738
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,481
and the women sleep on the right.

739
00:40:04,481 --> 00:40:05,641
The kid sleeps in the middle.

740
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:07,001
Who's the kid?

741
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,561
You.

742
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,641
Say that again?

743
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,521
Who is the kid?

744
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:12,880
You're so impolite.

745
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,921
What are you doing, Zili?

746
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:14,840
Let go.

747
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,641
- Come. Let's make the bed.
- Respect your brother.

748
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:17,200
Mu Zixi.

749
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,280
Ouch.

750
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:22,641
- Stop bullying him.
- You keep bullying me.

751
00:40:22,641 --> 00:40:23,601
Stop it.

752
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:24,521
You will learn today

753
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,121
