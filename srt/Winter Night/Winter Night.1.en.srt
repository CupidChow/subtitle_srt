I no longer enjoy mocha. Thank you.

53
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,320
This report is for the client.

54
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,480
If there's no problem,

55
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,120
we can settle this invoice
this afternoon.

56
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,680
The PVC pipe installed
is not as per requirement.

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,240
We asked for 20mm.

58
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,760
Why is it 16mm?

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,240
It's just a proper replacement.

60
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,360
Even the thermal insulation coating
is wrong.

61
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,920
The company's standard is 60mm.

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,080
Now it's 40mm.

63
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,560
The temperature is not cold.

64
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,360
40mm is already enough.

65
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,440
The thermal insulation coating
is within the wall.

66
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,760
The PVC pipe is underground.

67
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,960
Just because the client can't see it,
it doesn't mean they don't know.

68
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,040
We're just working for the company.

69
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,560
Is it necessary to be so serious?

70
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
Can you keep it down?

71
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,720
This is my client.

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,000
So I need to be responsible for him.

73
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,560
This is also my client.

74
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,480
We're just closing a deal.
There's no need to be like this.

75
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Don't overdo it.

76
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,440
I'll submit this report to Ms. Wang.

77
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,000
We'll talk inside.

Zheng Daqian,

79
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
we broke up three months ago,

80
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,840
and that's how long I've endured you.

81
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,400
Do you have to deliberately target me?

82
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,120
Can you be more professional?

83
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,320
I'm more professional than you
in work and private matters.

84
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,200
I just don't get it.

85
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,560
Do you have to be so immature

86
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,200
and deliberately disgust me?

87
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,200
When I saw someone else's underwear

88
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,920
and hair at home,

89
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,960
didn't I feel disgusted?

90
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,000
You lied by saying you broke up with me
to cut my losses.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,840
You don't call that disgusting?

92
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,400
Who disgusts who first?

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,960
I'm showing you this

94
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,240
because the engineering department

95
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,520
didn't meet the client's requirements.

96
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,040
They cut corners

97
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,640
without the design department's
approval.

98
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,920
It'll cause a loss to the company
if the client finds out.

99
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,960
It must be hard for you to liaise

100
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,760
with the engineering department, huh?

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,520
You're facing a dilemma
over personal and work affairs.

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,280
Am I right?

103
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,360
Ms. Wang, I have no issue with either.

104
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,800
I can liaise as always

105
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,440
and handle this professionally.

106
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,480
You can rest assured about this.

107
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,840
I don't think

108
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,960
the design department has brought

109
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,120
your talents into play.

110
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,800
It limits you instead.

111
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,840
Have you ever thought of planning
for yourself?

112
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,840
Let's say

113
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,040
to gain experience and learn more

114
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
from other departments.

115
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,800
Ms. Wang,

116
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,200
I like my current department.

117
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,640
I also like working with clients

118
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,080
and being part of the design team.

119
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,720
The design department
is also full of talent.

120
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,840
Daqian,

121
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,400
when can you get your big break?

122
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
You're turning 30 soon.

123
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,160
A 30-year-old woman

124
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,880
should make a choice.

125
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,800
It's either the marriage

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,360
or the career.

127
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,720
Ms. Wang, I don't think

128
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,200
this has anything to do with age.

129
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,600
I'll just be frank, then.

130
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,200
We've been receiving feedback
from clients

131
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,440
regarding the miscommunication
among our staff

132
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,200
in recent months.

133
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,880
I've been containing
this feedback for you.

134
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,720
I suggested another department
for your sake.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,680
Get it?

136
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,520
Zheng Daqian.

137
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,800
Why are you here?

138
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,320
I'm here to celebrate your birthday.

139
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,720
Where's my birthday present?

140
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
I traveled thousands of kilometers

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,920
to celebrate your birthday.

142
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,920
What presents do you want?

143
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Let's go out.
I'll buy you a meal and a drink.

144
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
There's one more person.

145
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,520
Who?

146
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,360
Happy birthday!

147
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,400
What is she doing here?

148
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,080
I rarely visit.

149
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,720
Let's get together
with some old friends.

150
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,640
You knew

151
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,360
I didn't keep in touch
with her for a long time.

152
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,000
All the more reason
for this get-together.

153
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,920
Come on, get in the car.

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,720
Coming.

155
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,680
Let's go.

156
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,960
Sit tight. We're setting out.

157
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,800
Please.

158
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,200
A good friend of mine
owns this place.

159
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,160
Next time, just mention my name
when you come.

160
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,680
Lan.

161
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,840
I haven't seen you around for a while.

162
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,600
I've been busy.

163
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,920
I missed you.

164
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,560
Even our crabs missed you.

165
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,160
What a smooth talker.

166
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,000
This must be new.

167
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,200
It's so pretty.

168
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I'll get you one next time.

169
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,320
Thank you, Lan.

170
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,800
I've reserved a room for you
on the second floor.

171
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,800
Take them there.

172
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,560
I'll have your food prepared.

173
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,680
What do you think about this place?

174
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,840
The ambiance is pretty good.

175
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,560
This way, please.

176
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,520
Come in.

177
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,360
Excuse me. One pot of rice wine, please.

178
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,400
Okay, please wait for a moment.

179
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,000
Thank you.

180
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,160
The wine will be right over.

181
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,040
Okay.

182
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,560
I didn't expect

183
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,240
she'd complain to you.

184
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,280
It's okay. As long as I know about it.

185
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,960
I'll take care

186
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,040
of the renovation cost.

187
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,600
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

188
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,520
But

189
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't like you working with her.

190
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,080
Me either.

191
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,040
I feel uncomfortable seeing her now.

192
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,760
Trust me.

193
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,400
Really?

194
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,320
Yes.

195
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,880
But she's your ex-girlfriend.

196
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,320
It's not worth mentioning at all.

197
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,320
How are you getting along
with your boyfriend?

198
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,440
It's just the same.

199
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,440
Just break up if it doesn't work.

200
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,680
I can introduce several men to you.

201
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,680
You see.

202
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,640
My husband

203
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,960
has several friends

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,320
who are outstanding men.

205
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,040
I know you want to find a relationship
where you love each other.

206
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,280
But just look at the qualifications
when it comes to picking men.

207
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,960
Love is hard.

208
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,560
Mi Lan, you're saying
as long as they're rich,

209
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,280
right?

210
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,000
Of course.

211
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,560
A person's economic stability
determines his level of living standard.

212
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,840
In this universe,

213
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,440
you can solve 90%

214
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,000
of the problems with money.

215
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,280
As for the other 10%,

216
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,160
you need more money to solve it.

217
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,120
Am I right, Yan?

218
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,120
The last time the three of us
had a get-together

219
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,480
was several years ago, right?

220
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,360
It was back in our hometown
in the Northeast.

221
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes, it's been a long time
since I went home.

222
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,240
When was the last time
you went back to Baihe?

223
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,960
Since my dad's funeral.

224
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,920
Why is Lizi not here yet?

225
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,000
Look at the time.

226
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,000
Is Mu Zili coming too?

227
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,160
The more, the merrier.

228
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,720
How is he doing lately?

229
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,160
I heard he's doing pretty well.

230
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,680
The business he set up in Beijing

231
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,920
was booming.

232
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,360
I heard he moved his company
to Ningzhou.

233
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,040
He's in Ningzhou?

234
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
Didn't he contact you?

235
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,280
No.

236
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,320
We didn't keep in touch
for a long time.

237
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
We had a fallout

238
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,240
and blocked each other.

239
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,560
Are you ready to order?

240
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,120
Come in.

241
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,280
Lizi.

242
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,640
There you are, Lizi.

243
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,480
Come here.

244
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,080
- Have a seat.
- You're finally here.

245
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,880
After so many years,
you look more handsome now.

246
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,840
You don't look so bad yourself.

247
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,280
What are you doing here?

248
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,040
I'm here to celebrate your birthday.

249
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,480
I wish that

250
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,800
everything goes smoothly as you turn 30.

251
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,560
It's 29.

252
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,760
Is it time for cake now?

253
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,280
Did you come empty-handed
to have free cake?

254
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,320
That's pretty shameless.

255
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,920
I came with a gift.

256
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,160
Best wishes to you.

257
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,520
Open it up.

258
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,480
What's this?

259
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,640
Pepper spray and taser.

260
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,000
A must-have
for single women living alone.

261
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,680
Who told you I'm single?

262
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,520
Aren't you?

263
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,880
Then why

264
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,360
do I feel you treat her better than me?

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,360
Impossible.

266
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,040
Well, I have to be nice

267
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,640
since she's my colleague.

268
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,480
Then why did you keep stalling

269
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,760
before breaking up with her?

270
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,960
I've been wanting to break up with her.

271
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,640
But she kept on begging me
not to leave her.

272
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,560
I hate it.

273
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,720
I feel the same.

274
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,320
I'm tired of dating her.

275
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,400
But only you

276
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,440
can make me feel settled.

277
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,320
Don't underestimate this taser.

278
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,080
It has a powerful electric current.

279
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,680
See?

280
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
As for this pepper spray,

281
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,200
I don't need to demonstrate it.

282
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,520
Give it to me.

283
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,640
Why are you giving her all these?

284
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,320
She can call you for help
if anything happens.

285
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,960
You should add each other's WeChat.

286
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,200
Do it now.

287
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,240
I don't think it's a great idea
after blocking each other.

288
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Can I even rely on him
if anything happens?

289
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,280
Who can you rely on, then?

290
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,720
Your boyfriend, Mr. Guan?

291
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
Listen, he's not reliable at all.

292
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,320
You better break up with him.

293
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,800
What do you know?

294
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,160
How do you know I don't know anything?

295
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,240
I'm going to the washroom.

296
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,640
What on earth are you giving her?

297
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,120
You really need some beatings.

298
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,440
Go and check on her.

299
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,440
Daqian.

300
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,840
I was just joking with you.

301
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,320
We haven't seen each other
for many years.

302
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,440
Don't speak carelessly
if you don't know anything.

303
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,120
I knew he was unreliable
when I looked at him.

304
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,920
You argued with me

305
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,560
and blocked me

306
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,880
because of him.

307
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,600
It's not worth it at all.

308
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,080
I only blocked someone
who thought he was right

309
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,040
and liked to nag.

310
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,120
So I can keep a boyfriend
who takes care of me.

311
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,440
I think that's worth it.

312
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,680
Where is he, then?

313
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Why isn't he accompanying you?

314
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,160
He went on a business trip.

315
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,920
We're always together.

316
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,680
A birthday is just another ordinary day.

317
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,800
I don't mind.

318
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Does he treat you well?

319
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,040
Very well.

320
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,600
Is he responsible to you?

321
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,480
Do you have plans for the future?

322
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,480
Responsible!

323
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,800
Guan Zhe has proposed to me.

324
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,280
We're planning to buy a house now.

325
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,160
You're lying to me, aren't you?

326
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,800
No.

327
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,360
You didn't break up with her, right?

328
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,480
You're two-timing us!

329
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,240
What's going on?

330
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,760
Proposed?

331
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,880
Who proposed to you?

332
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,080
What new house?

333
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,560
What nonsense are you talking about?

334
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,480
I already dumped her. Really.

335
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,600
So you really cheated on me
with Wang Anna.

336
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,760
You even kept lying to me.

337
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,280
When did you dump me?

338
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,760
I was the one who broke up with you

339
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
and kicked you out!

340
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,600
Wang Anna, you wanted
to have me transferred, right?

341
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,880
I won't let you get what you want.

342
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,720
Guess what? I quit.

343
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,920
You better show some respect.

344
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,560
Disgusting.

345
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,600
Who are you calling disgusting?

346
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
You, Guan Zhe. You're disgusting.

347
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,400
Stop pestering me endlessly.

348
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,800
We've broken up.

349
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,200
Listen. Any form of entanglement

350
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,680
after a breakup

351
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,400
is a loser

352
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,480
and is shameless.

353
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,880
Daqian.

354
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,200
I'm sorry.

355
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,960
Sorry that you have to see that.

356
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,200
I was too stubborn

357
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,880
to admit.

358
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
What you said was right.

359
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,280
I made bad judgments about men.

360
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,840
It's not your fault.

361
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,000
Not all men are like him.

362
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,280
I hope so.

363
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,640
Cheer up.

364
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,120
It's your birthday.

365
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
If

366
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,720
you feel sad on your birthday,

367
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,200
things won't go smoothly the whole year.

368
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,440
It didn't go smoothly
for the past 29 years.

369
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,320
So there's no difference
if it goes badly next year.

370
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,400
What's your plan after this?

371
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,960
Will you come back?

372
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,880
I've taken care of my dad's funeral.

373
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,480
I won't come back anymore.

374
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,120
Why not?

375
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,480
You should've visited
your father before.

376
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
(Baihe Commercial Bus)
You could've at least met him for once.

377
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,200
(Baihe Commercial Bus)
He'd have listened to you...

378
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,720
There's no point talking
about this anymore.

379
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,760
(Baihe Commercial Bus)
He's already gone.

380
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,000
(Baihe Commercial Bus)
What else can I do?

381
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,040
I'm going to lose my job soon.

382
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,720
I can't sleep every night
because I feel anxious.

383
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,440
Come and work for me.

384
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,880
No.

385
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,840
Zheng Daqian, stop being so stubborn.

386
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,880
Are you going to continue
living with Guan Zhe?

387
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,840
Don't lend him money any more.

388
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,320
Mr. Zheng was afraid
he might leave you with no money.

389
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,080
Who are you to tell me what to do?

390
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,920
I know how to decide.

391
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,040
His words are merely sweet talk.

392
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,440
They're all sugarcoated bullets.

393
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,320
Can you stop indulging
in your fantasies?

394
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,680
Can you be more resolute?

395
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,040
You don't know anything about me.

396
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,120
My dad is gone.

397
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,080
Who are you to tell me what to do?

398
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,120
At the end of the day,
we're just friends.

399
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,760
Just friends?

400
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,400
Yes.

401
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,480
You never care about others.

402
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,320
You don't understand others at all.

403
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,000
To be honest, I don't even want
to be friends with you anymore.

404
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,970
(Delete Friend)

405
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,840
Don't contact me anymore.

406
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,880
I ruined

407
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,160
your birthday cake.

408
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,720
So I bought a new one for you.

409
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,080
Happy birthday.

410
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,720
Make... Make a wish.

411
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,800
Just pretend the candle is lit.

412
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,160
Make a wish.

413
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,280
I wish that

414
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,800
everything goes well

415
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,520
in the coming year.

416
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,760
It'll go smoothly.

417
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,280
You have me.

418
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,760
Say,

419
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,720
did you really move your company
to Ningzhou?

420
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,800
When my dad knew
I was coming to Ningzhou,

421
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,640
all he talked
about on the phone was you.

422
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,680
He told me to find you

423
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,600
to see if you're doing well.

424
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,560
But you didn't look for me, did you?

425
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,520
You deleted me from your contacts.

426
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,000
Can't you find me
even if I deleted your number?

427
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,280
You deleted me.

428
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,040
Doesn't that mean
you don't want me to find you?

429
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
You're right about that.

430
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,600
You are such a proud person.

431
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,480
Facing you, I won't care about that.

432
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,520
Are you really leaving Beijing?

433
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,600
Why?

434
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,440
Is there no place for you in Beijing?

435
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,480
Because you're not in Beijing.

436
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,160
You're right about that too.

437
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,240
Then what?

438
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,640
How long are you planning
to stay in Ningzhou?

439
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,840
Maybe ten years.

440
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,600
So are you going
to celebrate my birthday every year

441
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,000
until I turn 40?

442
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,520
I'm planning to celebrate
until you turn 100.

443
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
As a friend?

444
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,000
As a lover.

445
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,720
Daqian,

446
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,240
we've known each other for 29 years

447
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,960
and fought that long.

448
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,560
But at the end of every fight,

449
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,320
I still want to see you.

450
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,240
If friendships can last a lifetime,

451
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,520
why can't love last that long?

452
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,960
You don't have to answer me now.

453
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,840
After all,
I've waited for you for 29 years.

454
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,520
I'm not in a hurry.

455
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,360
Come on.

456
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,920

Isn't this what you wore yesterday?

504
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
I was in a rush today.

505

What about you?

506
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,520
I thought you had something to tell me.

507

I came here this time

Where are you going?

511
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,160
I'm going abroad to get married.

512
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,600
Really?

513
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,240
Congratulations!

514

I'm happier to hear

I may not be able

Of course,
I'll take good care of myself.

I can still manage

528

529

I'm sure you know who I'm talking about.

530

532

It'll be hard to be friends

533

534
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,440
You think too much.

Are you not going to eat
for fear of choking?

Okay.

How's your boyfriend?

547
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,840
We broke up.

548
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,680
I'm glad to hear that.

549
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,720
Daqian.

550
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,680
How about you listen to me once

551
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,920
and see how Lizi is doing?

552
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,760
I'm sure there's still hope.

553
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,280
Think about it.

554
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,520
He never had any girlfriend
after so many years.

555
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,280
Doesn't that mean he's waiting for you?

556
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,040
You must not miss out on him anymore.

557
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,880
If you keep wasting time,

558
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
you're going to be old.

559
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,640
What do you take Lizi for?

560
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,320
A dog or a donkey?

561
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,160
Will he come to me after beckoning him?

562
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,680
I took the consideration

563
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
that you grew up together.

564
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,320
That means

565
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,680
it'll be more advantageous to us.

566
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,400
Why did you call?

567
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,320
I'm getting married next month.

568
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,600
Your stepfather said

569
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,760
we're having a grand wedding.

570
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,040
So he's inviting you to attend.

571
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,560
You must come.

572
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,000
If you don't come,

573
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,360
my wedding will be incomplete

574
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,440
and imperfect.

575
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,840
My schedule is packed at year-end.

576
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,960
So I can't go.

577
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,040
What do you mean?

578
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,400
How can I marry if you're not coming?

579

581

to badmouth me behind my back?

582
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,360
They're going to gossip
all they want about me.

583
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,840
Can you bear

584
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,600
to let them laugh at me

585
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,880

You're all I have now.

you weren't to be seen either.
