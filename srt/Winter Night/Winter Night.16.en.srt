(H.X Photo Studio)

16
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,600
I'm planning to go back there

17
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:06,126
and start a new business again.

18
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:08,327
Are you sure?

19
00:02:11,287 --> 00:02:12,447
Have you told them?

20
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:16,806
I've told Lan.

21
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:17,646
What about Daqian?

22
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,287
As for Daqian,

23
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:24,806
I'll tell her
when I get the chance tomorrow.

24
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,447
It did cross my mind

25
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:33,167
that we might not stay
in Baihe for a long time.

26
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:35,086
I thought

27
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:37,007
it might be a short winter.

28
00:02:38,486 --> 00:02:40,086
But I didn't expect
you'd back out first.

29
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,526
Don't be so sentimental.

30
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:45,806
I'm not backing out.

31
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:47,646
I'll always
be the restaurant's shareholder,

32
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:48,526
don't you know that?

33
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:50,007
You still have to split
the dividends with me.

34
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:51,607
That's not what I meant.

35
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:54,086
The truth is,

36
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:57,007
you don't want
to just be her friend, right?

37
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:03,007
We can only be friends.

38
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:04,847
Have you asked her?

39
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:11,607
She's waiting for someone.

40
00:03:15,806 --> 00:03:16,887
You can wait too.

41
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:20,727
If it doesn't work out now,

42
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:23,246
it doesn't mean
it won't work in the future.

43
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:26,926
Perhaps

44
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:29,966
you'll find your happiness one day.

45
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:38,926
I'll get going.

46
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:11,407
You're so noisy.

47
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:13,447
Who says you can come back?

48
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:15,206
I thought you only needed your friends.

49
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:16,767
Go back to the restaurant.

50
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:18,047
Stop hanging out at home.

51
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:20,486
I'm sleeping on the sofa,

52
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:21,847
not with you.

53
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:23,126
I bought the sofa too.

54
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:33,886
Stop eating.

55
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,407
Can't you see it's late?

56
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:36,886
No one will want you if you gain weight.

57
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:38,767
That'd be great.

58
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:40,926
I'll be like my dad
and let you support me.

59
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:42,647
Why should I? I'm not raising pigs here.

60
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:43,806
Why should I raise you for nothing?

61
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:45,727
You better marry yourself off soon.

62
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:48,686
Looking for a spouse
is like raising pigs.

63
00:04:48,686 --> 00:04:50,607
It takes time.

64
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:54,607
There's no time.

65
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:56,006
He's leaving soon.

66
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:58,727
He's going to leave
and start a business.

67
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,847
Who would miss her?

68
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:03,287
Who's leaving?

69
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:04,686
Lizi.

70
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:06,727
Lizi is an outstanding guy.

71
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:07,926
Why would he spend

72
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:09,847
the rest of his life in Baihe

73
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,207
for nothing?

74
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:12,806
Who told you he's leaving?

75
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:13,407
His mom.

76
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:15,767
She called me this afternoon.

77
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:16,686
She said she couldn't bear
to be parted from him.

78
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:18,126
She was on the phone...

79
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:21,686
She was crying over the phone.

80
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:22,886
Where are you going at this hour?

81
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:27,446
Zheng Daqian.

82
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,446
Why are you wearing so few clothes?

83
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:34,607
Why did you break your promise?

84
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:38,486
What do you mean?

85
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:39,727
When are you planning

86
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:41,326
to tell me that you're leaving?

87
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,047
You've already made up your mind, right?

88
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:53,647
I was looking

89
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:56,326
for the right time

90
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:58,527
to tell you.

91
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:00,607
Didn't you promise
to run the restaurant seriously?

92
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:02,167
Didn't you tell me to rely on you?

93
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,126
Look at what you're doing now.

94
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:05,246
You're running off in less than a month.

95
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:07,446
Do you really want

96
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:09,806
to rely on me?

97
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:14,486
Well, you should keep your word.

98
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:17,767
How do I do that?

99
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:19,686
As business partner,

100
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:21,366
you must stay by my side.

101
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,047
Just as your business partner?

108
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:12,047

- That's great!
- Great!

How much did we make?

111
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,407
We made 108.30 yuan.

112
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:23,886
Well, that's a lot.

113
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:25,686
We still made some profit anyway.

114
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,767
It's pretty good for our first step.

00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:32,287
everyone worked so hard lately,

117
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:33,047
I suggest

118
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:34,647
we close the restaurant for one day
on this weekend

119
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:35,727
for team building activities.

120
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:36,326
Okay.

121
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:39,006
What's team building?

122
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:42,366
It's where young people gather
and have fun.

123
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:47,926
- I'll pass, then.
- I'll pass, then.

124
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:49,806
That's not what I meant.

125
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:50,486
We should get together

126
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:51,446
and have fun.

127
00:07:51,446 --> 00:07:52,727
We don't always get the day off.

128
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,686
Besides, team building is not for me.

129
00:07:55,686 --> 00:07:57,287
The kitchen suits me better.

130
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:00,207
You only want to spend your time
at the mahjong parlor.

131
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,047
Only my daughter knows me best.

132
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:04,886
I'll take my leave, then.

133
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,126
By the way,

134
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:07,647
I haven't seen Lizi

135
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:09,047
for the past two days.

136
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:10,767
Oh, he's been busy.

137
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,287
I hope you enjoy
your team-building activities.

138
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,167
Lizi is leaving in two days.

139
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:29,326
Aren't you going to talk to him?

140
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:31,047
He's leaving in two days?

141
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:33,086
Didn't he tell you?

142
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:35,887
I'm always the last person to know

143
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:37,407
he's leaving
and when he's leaving anyway.

144
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:38,846
Why do you think

145
00:08:38,846 --> 00:08:40,446
you're the last person to know?

146
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:41,846
He doesn't care about me.

147
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,287
No, it's because he cares
about you a lot.

148
00:08:44,846 --> 00:08:45,606
Can you be honest and tell me

149
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:46,966
how you feel about him?

150
00:08:54,127 --> 00:08:55,167
I'm very confused.

151
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:56,806
I don't know either.

152
00:08:56,806 --> 00:08:58,127
I thought I knew,

153
00:08:58,127 --> 00:08:59,326
but it's all jumbled up now.

154
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:00,966
In any case,

155
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:03,287
Mu Zili and I can only be friends here.

156
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:05,846
Why?

157
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:09,127
I'll give you an example.

158
00:09:10,247 --> 00:09:12,367
When two people
from parallel universes

159
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:14,127
suddenly cross each other's path,

160
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,007
they still have to part ways in the end.

161
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:20,446
But don't science fiction movies
always say

162
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:22,407
that two people
from parallel universes

163
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:23,806
can love each other?

164
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:31,446
Enough, stop overthinking.

165
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:33,726
Let's enjoy ourselves this weekend.

166
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:46,966
Let's set off.

167
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:48,966
Dazhi, why are you here?

168
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:50,086
What's going on here?

169
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:52,007
It's the weekend, isn't it?

170
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:54,726
How can we be excluded
from team building?

171
00:09:55,606 --> 00:09:57,367
What about you, Mu Zixi?

172
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:58,287
Shouldn't Grade 12 students study

173
00:09:58,287 --> 00:09:59,806
at home during weekends?

174
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:02,047
I'm an art student now.

175
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:03,047
I'm going to collect materials
for my art.

176
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:06,527
Mi Lan, get in the car.

177
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:07,767
You're playing favorites.

178
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:09,527
Aren't you going to ask me
to get in the car?

179
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:10,686
Greet your aunt.

180
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:12,726
Hey!

181
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:13,887
I'm too young to be called aunt.

182
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,887
Unbelievable.

183
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:18,606
The car is full now.

184
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,167
How am I supposed to go?

185
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,047
It's full?

186
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:25,287
Chill.

187
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:27,326
I have it all planned out.

188
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:30,167
There will be two of us taking the tram.

189
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:31,527
We'll meet

190
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:33,007
at the gate of the Tianmen Mountain.

191
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,326
Who's taking the tram?

192
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:35,726
Mu Zixi, get out of the car.

193
00:10:35,726 --> 00:10:37,127
A high school student
should take the tram.

194
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:38,086
Why should I?

195
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:40,726
Both of you should exercise more

196
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:41,846
since you look frail.

197
00:10:43,407 --> 00:10:45,287
Dad, let's go.

198
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,287
Let's go.

199
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,407
I hate hiking the most.

200
00:11:09,686 --> 00:11:11,127
The weather is so cold.

201
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:13,167
It'll be nice to stay at home.

202
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:15,206
You're right. It's cozy at home.

203
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:16,846
Why do they want
to go out in the cold?

204
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:33,887
Yan,

205
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:35,566
we have a problem.

206
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:37,247
Zheng Daqian suddenly has diarrhea.

207
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:38,686
Why are you using me as an excuse?

208
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:40,007
It's so bad

209
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:41,206
that she can hardly walk.

210
00:11:41,206 --> 00:11:42,367
I have to send her home now.

211
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:43,966
Dad, come on.

212
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:45,966
Let's see who reaches the peak first.

213
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:48,047
Don't run, or you'll fall.

214
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:49,326
- Okay.
- This kid...

215
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:50,686
How's Daqian?

216
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:52,487
Nothing. She has diarrhea.

217
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:53,326
She should be okay.

218
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,527
Should we go and check on her?

219
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:56,966
No need. Lizi is with her.

220
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,167
It's the perfect time to let them talk.

221
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:21,606
Dad,

222
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:23,566
I'm tired.

223
00:12:24,686 --> 00:12:25,846
I'm too tired to walk too.

224
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:28,767
There's a pavilion ahead.

225
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:30,326
Let's get some rest.

226
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,446
I'm so exhausted.

227
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:34,407
Don't fall behind.

228
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:01,287
Lan.

229
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,047
Have some to replenish your energy.

230
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:08,767
Mi Lan,

231
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:11,086
come to our house during the new year.

232
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:12,047
Okay.

233
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:14,367
Why aren't you inviting me?

234
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,206
Grandma always scolds my dad

235
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:18,206
for not bringing anyone home
during the new year.

236
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:20,767
Gosh, stop talking nonsense.

237
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:26,487
Zixi, come and eat something.

238
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:28,007
It's okay.

239
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,206
I want to go up and take a look.

240
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,007
We'll be resting here for a while.

241
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:32,887
You can go ahead first.

242
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:33,487
Okay.

243
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:34,407
Be careful.

244
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:36,767
It's good to be young.

245
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,400
(Holiday Fantasy)

246
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:47,367
Why did you bring me here?

247
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:49,767
To reminisce about our childhood days.

248
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:51,966
When are you going to grow up?

249
00:13:53,247 --> 00:13:54,127
Let's play with the capsule toy machine.

250
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,127
No, we don't even know what's inside.

251
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,566
It's better to play the claw machine.

252
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,846
What's so great about claw machines?

253
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:02,287
You already know what you'll get.

254
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:03,767
The capsule toy machine
gives more surprise.

255
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:04,726
Let's go.

256
00:14:04,726 --> 00:14:05,326
I...

257
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:42,007
Thanks.

258
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:57,247
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,887
It was my fault that Mr. Mi scolded you.

260
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:03,287
It's okay. It's in the past now.

261
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:11,767
Those sketches...

262
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,247
You were practicing sketching, right?

263
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:15,726
Yeah.

264
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:20,047
I couldn't find a suitable model,

265
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,287
so I chose you to practice my sketches.

266
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:27,806
Then you have to pay
for my portrait copyright.

267
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:34,487
Then

268
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:37,287
I'll take a photos of you.

269
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:41,247
Okay.

270
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:50,047
I took one extra.

271
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:02,167
Dad, can you see how fast my car goes?

272
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:12,926
Does Daqian

273
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:14,326
really have diarrhea?

274
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:18,566
Jeez,

275
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:20,606
you're always

276
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:22,007
so indifferent.

277
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,127
Dazhi,

278
00:16:29,726 --> 00:16:30,527
let me ask you this.

279
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:34,007
If we both like the same girl,

280
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,527
what would you do?

281
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:38,767
That would be impossible.

282
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:40,806
I'll never like Daqian.

283
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:42,007
Only Lizi

284
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:43,726
can handle someone like her.

285
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:45,287
I...

286
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,247
I mean

287
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:50,206
they're equal

288
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:51,566
when it comes to fights.

289
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:53,726
Listen, Yan.

290
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:56,367
We're already in our 30s.

291
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:58,287
If you like someone,

292
00:16:58,606 --> 00:17:00,887
you must remain clear-headed.

293
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,047
You should express your feelings
and pursue her

294
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:04,487
instead of wasting time

295
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:07,126
secretly admiring her
or making ambiguous gestures.

296
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,487
What nonsense are those?

297
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,326
Listen. Just confess to her

298
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,007
and leave the rest

299
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:14,487
to destiny.

300
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:15,767
Don't be troubled

301
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:16,727
by those kinds of things.

302
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:22,687
But do you know what I meant by destiny?

303
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:30,247
It's destiny

304
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:32,247
that I met him.

305
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:34,527
Dazhi,

306
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:36,646
it's been a while since we came back.

307
00:17:36,646 --> 00:17:38,927
You refused to say anything
when we asked about Niuniu.

308
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:40,687
What exactly happened?

309
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:50,326
For you.

310
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:51,447
Why?

311
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:55,086
Take it as a gift

312
00:17:55,606 --> 00:17:57,687
for Christmas, New Year's,
Spring Festival, and your birthday.

313
00:17:57,927 --> 00:17:59,927
I can't believe you're so stingy.

314
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,566
What's this? It looks beastly.

315
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,287
You're so clueless.

316
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:09,886
This is one of the best figurines

317
00:18:09,886 --> 00:18:11,527
among the capsule toys figurines

318
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:13,767
called "Stretching on Easter Day."

319
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:14,447
Go on.

320
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:15,886
Keep on making it up.

321
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:22,806
In 2018,

322
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:24,527
the capsule toy

323
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:26,566
Mu Zili and Zheng Daqian got
while they're unemployed at home

324
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:28,566
indicates they could change

325
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:29,806
the course of events.

326
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:32,927
Besides,

327
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:34,846
I don't know when we'll have the chance

328
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,166
to have fun again.

329
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:48,086
When are you leaving?

330
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:50,366
The day after tomorrow.

331
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:51,967
Why don't I see you off?

332
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:53,166
No need.

333
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:55,180
It scares me to see someone send me off.

334
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:57,247
I said all those things out of anger.

335
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:58,487
Don't take it seriously.

336
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:01,447
Really?

337
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:06,806
You want to start over again.

338
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:08,406
Of course, I'll wish you the best.

339
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:10,406
Let's make a toast.

340
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:14,406
I wish you success

341
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:16,007
in your next venture.

342
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,007
Niuniu isn't my son.

343
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,606
He's a gift from heaven.

344
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:42,366
I was on duty

345
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:44,166
one night

346
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:46,287
four years ago.

347
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,166
It was foggy,

348
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:50,727
and the road condition was bad.

349
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:56,047
I was driving on the highway

350
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:00,527
when I hit the guardrail.

351
00:20:03,366 --> 00:20:05,126
At that time,

352
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:06,687
I thought

353
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:09,566
that was it for me.

354
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:16,366
Guess what happened after that?

355
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:19,886
The car was wrecked,

356
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:21,927
but

357
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:24,287
I was completely fine.

358
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,086
I returned to the office that night.

359
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:33,366
I saw something

360
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:34,886
at the door

361
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:36,126
from a distance.

362
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:39,166
I walked up

363
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:41,366
to see

364
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,447
it's a baby.

365
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:48,247
So he's the baby, huh?

366
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:55,247
He may look strong now.

367
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:56,846
At that time,

368
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:00,727
his little feet

369
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:02,406
were this small,

370
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,406
wrapped in the swaddling clothes.

371
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:06,886
He wasn't crying.

372
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:09,646
He didn't cry or make any noise.

373
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:12,166
His eyes

374
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,487
were fixed on me.

375
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:19,767
He was looking at me.

376
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,767
I just want to say

377
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:24,886
that this may be the fate

378
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:26,967
of people.

379
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:32,207
So

380
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:34,166
things like love

381
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:37,927
are destined.

Dad.

383

When I grow up,

384
00:21:52,806 --> 00:21:54,406
I want to be a police officer too.

385
00:21:56,406 --> 00:21:57,007
Okay.

The final dish.

389
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:15,207
Braised shrimp.

390
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:15,967
It smells really good.

391
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:16,886
You must have worked hard on this.

392

Oh, not at all.

393

Uncle Yan, come

00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:22,927
and join us.

398
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,207
It's okay. I've already eaten.

399
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:29,927
You guys

400
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:30,927
should enjoy yourselves

401
00:22:30,927 --> 00:22:32,326
for Lizi's farewell.

402
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:33,886
Thank you, Uncle Yan.

403
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,527
I won't get in your way, then.

404
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:36,406
Call me if you need anything.

405
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,007
What are you looking at?

406
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:43,646
Let's start digging.

407
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,767
But what happened to you two?

408
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:54,727
Instead of joining us,

409
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:57,366
you guys went on doing your own things.

410
00:22:57,846 --> 00:22:59,566
It was her fault. She held me up.

411
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:02,047
How's your stomach feeling?

412
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:05,086
I...

413
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:07,646
She's fine after taking her medicine.

414

Worse comes to worst,

415

she can continue eating
after doing her business in the toilet.

She's as strong as a bull.

417
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:13,247
She'll be fine.

418
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:15,047
That's the end of the farewell dinner.

419
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:15,727
You can leave now.

420
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,727
Go.

421
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:19,086
It looks like you two have reconciled.

Guys,

423
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:24,846
I have something to say.

424
00:23:25,326 --> 00:23:27,646
Soon, I'll be stepping down from my post

425
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:29,126
as the accountant of the restaurant.

426
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,406
But don't worry,

427
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:32,326
I'm still the restaurant's shareholder.

428
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:33,846
Thank you

429
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:34,687
for your hard work.

and prosperous future

432
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:39,846
Lizi, let us send you off

433

on the day you leave.

434

It's okay.

435
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:44,166
I'm scared when people send me off.

436
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:46,406
It feels like I'm never coming back.

437
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:48,806
As you wished.

438

a weird figurine.

I'll ask the Lost and Found counter.

491

No need.

492
00:26:48,326 --> 00:26:49,687
They said they didn't see it.

Never mind.
I'll just keep looking for it.

your luggage is too small.

Do you want to use a bigger one?

There are still many things
you haven't packed.

Here.

506
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:16,846
Take these with you.

507
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:20,326
Bring a plastic bag

508
00:27:20,326 --> 00:27:22,166
so he can bring chicken ribs,

509
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:23,687
apples, or milk.

510
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:25,166
So he can eat on his way tomorrow.

511
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:26,687
Okay, I'll go and get it now.

512
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:28,287
Dad, it's okay.

513
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:30,007
Mom, it's enough.

514
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:31,646
It's already late.

515
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:32,927
You should go to bed now.

516
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:34,166
Then tomorrow...

517
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:36,287
Tomorrow, just do what we've decided.

518
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,927
I don't want anyone to see me off.

519
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,767
Go to bed now. Good night.

520
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:42,646
All right, then. Good night.

521
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:43,727
Good night.

522
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:00,166
Are you done packing?

523
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:03,007
Don't worry.

524
00:28:03,606 --> 00:28:05,447
I'll be back for the new year.

525
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:08,687
I don't care if you come back or not.

526
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:11,007
I'll take care of dad and mom.

527
00:28:11,687 --> 00:28:12,566
It doesn't concern you.

528
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,406
You left this in my room.

529
00:28:21,247 --> 00:28:22,166
Keep it yourself.

530
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:46,606
Daqian, are you hungry?

531
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:48,527
Why don't I buy you something to eat?

532
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:51,326
I'm not hungry.

533
00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:57,846
It's been a while
since I saw you like this.

534
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,166
I almost forgot

535
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:02,687
that Zheng Daqian

536
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:04,086
was a quiet person.

537
00:29:05,646 --> 00:29:07,927
I'm just a little tired today.

538
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:17,126
Are you going to see him off tomorrow?

539
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:19,487
Not anymore.

540
00:29:21,287 --> 00:29:22,007
Why?

541
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:27,047
I thought

542
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:29,126
if I could find that figurine,

543
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:30,207
I would see him off.

544
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:34,047
But I couldn't find it
after searching all day.

545
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:37,967
Maybe it's destiny.

546
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:41,646
How about we make a bet?

547
00:29:42,806 --> 00:29:44,166
If it snows tomorrow,

548
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:45,527
go and see him off.

549
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:48,886
You're already leaving it
to fate anyway.

550
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:53,086
It's not likely to snow these few days.

551
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:54,366
We'll just make a bet, then.

552
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:56,527
If it snows tomorrow,

553
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:58,166
go and see him off.

554
00:29:58,967 --> 00:30:00,207
If it doesn't snow,

555
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:02,166
just give me a gift.

556
00:30:06,886 --> 00:30:08,606
Yan, you don't have
to send me home anymore.

557
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:09,767
I can go home myself.

the person who started

is Mu Zili.

Why are you here?

582
00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:16,047
Didn't I say not to see me off?

583

I'm not here to see you off.

I'm here to make you stay
on Daqian's behalf.

Stop messing with me.

Why would she want me to stay?

I'm making you stay

588

because Zheng Daqian

589
00:32:30,287 --> 00:32:31,927
doesn't want
to just be friends with you.

590
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:39,406
Don't be ridiculous.

591
00:32:40,406 --> 00:32:41,927
She lost this yesterday.

592
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:45,606
She looked for it all day

593
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:47,326
at the restaurant and the supermarket.

594

What are you waiting for?

to fall right in front of you?

Good things don't always happen
in this world.

You have to grab

just to tell me this?

602

You're a fool.

I'm not the fool, but you are.

What about you?

606

What's this? It looks beastly.

You're so clueless.

608
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:37,967
This is one of the best figurines

Why did you break your promise?

611
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,287
Didn't you promise
to run the restaurant seriously?

612
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,886
Didn't you tell me to rely on you?

613

Look at what you're doing now.

614
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:47,406

to rely on me?

616

Well, you should keep your word.

Is it yours?

627

No, it's not mine.

628
00:34:33,086 --> 00:34:34,166
It belongs to Aunt Daqian.

629
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,447
Help me return it to her, then.

630

Niuniu, you're such a good boy.

I hope it snows tomorrow.

00:34:52,606 --> 00:34:54,606
Then I can build a huge one.

633
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:56,327
It'll snow tomorrow.

those two clouds?

639
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:07,927
It may be nighttime now.

640
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:10,606
But those two clouds
look specially dark.

641
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:13,007
They're called stratocumulus clouds.

- I'll come and find you.

670
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:45,766
Okay.

671
00:36:46,327 --> 00:36:47,566
See you at the swing in the park.

672
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:49,047
Okay, I'll wait for you.

673
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,086
Mister, go to Baihe Park.

674
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:04,927
Mister, can you drive a little faster?

675
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:06,126
The road is slippery.

676
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:07,367
I'll see what I can.

677
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:16,047
Watch out!

678
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:56,086
How's the patient?

679
00:37:56,286 --> 00:37:56,887
It was a car accident.

680
00:37:56,887 --> 00:37:57,887
He suffered head trauma.

681
00:37:57,887 --> 00:37:59,047
His heart rate
and blood pressure are normal.

682
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:00,286
Prepare him for an MRI.

683
00:38:39,286 --> 00:38:40,166
Hello, doctor.

684
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:42,206
We're Mu Zili's family.

685
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:43,566
Which ward is he in?

686
00:38:46,927 --> 00:38:47,847
It's 1220.

687
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:49,407
How is his condition?

688
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:51,166
It wasn't a serious car accident.

689
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:52,367
There was no trauma injury.

690
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:53,807
But he's still unconscious.

691
00:38:53,807 --> 00:38:54,646
If he has no trauma injury,

692
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:55,847
why is he still unconscious?

693
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:57,807
He may have suffered a huge blow

694
00:38:57,807 --> 00:38:58,686
or shock.

695
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:00,686
We still need to wait for the MRI result

696
00:39:00,686 --> 00:39:01,566
to know what's wrong with him.

697
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:04,447
Doctor, he had a head injury before.

698
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:06,686
Could it be a relapse?

699
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:07,726
That's possible.

700
00:39:07,726 --> 00:39:09,206
But it's better to wait for the result.

701
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:11,086
Mom.

702
00:39:11,086 --> 00:39:12,566
Don't worry.

703
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,300
(Baihe People's Hospital)

704
00:39:20,286 --> 00:39:21,047
Zixi,

705
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,441
where's your brother?

706
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:24,286
He's inside.

707
00:39:24,686 --> 00:39:25,646
How is he?

708
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:30,166
He's still unconscious.

709
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:37,246
Why don't you go home first?

710
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:39,166
I'll wait here.

711
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:41,726
It's okay. I can wait.

712
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,527
Go and keep Aunt Hui company.

713
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:45,007
I'll be here, so don't worry.

714
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:55,166
I'll leave him to you, then.

715
00:41:53,766 --> 00:41:55,527
His words were merely sweet talk.

716
00:41:55,527 --> 00:41:56,887
They're all sugarcoated bullets.

717
00:41:57,086 --> 00:41:58,126
Can you stop indulging

718
00:41:58,126 --> 00:41:58,847
in your fantasies?

719
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:00,166
Can you be more resolute?

720
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,166
Don't contact me anymore.

721
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:04,447
We've known each other for 29 years

722
00:42:04,447 --> 00:42:05,807
and fought that long.

723
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:07,686
But at the end of every fight,

724
00:42:07,686 --> 00:42:08,967
I still want to see you.

725
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:10,246
Daqian.

726
00:42:10,606 --> 00:42:12,487
Zheng Daqian, stop being so stubborn.

727
00:42:12,487 --> 00:42:14,327
Zheng Daqian, where are you going?

728
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:15,927
I'm going back to Baihe.

729
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:17,086
I'll find you in Baihe, then.

730
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:18,606
(I'll find you in Baihe, then.)

731
00:42:19,327 --> 00:42:20,566
(I'll find you in Baihe, then.)

732
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:47,286
According to the test result,

733
00:42:47,286 --> 00:42:48,487
there's no problem with him.

734
00:42:49,246 --> 00:42:51,487
The blood clot in his brain
from the previous car accident

735
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:52,807
is also disappearing.

736
00:42:52,807 --> 00:42:54,007
His loss of memories

737
00:42:54,007 --> 00:42:56,286
should be caused by a lack of oxygen
and nerve compression.

738
00:42:56,686 --> 00:42:58,166
He should be recovering
from his amnesia soon.

739
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:01,447
It doesn't matter if he remembers.

740
00:43:01,606 --> 00:43:04,566
The important thing
is that my son is fine.

741
00:43:05,487 --> 00:43:07,327
That means Zili passed out

742
00:43:07,327 --> 00:43:10,047
from shock, right?

743
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,527
His internal organs are all fine, right?

744
00:43:12,646 --> 00:43:15,007
Yes, what causes it is hard to explain.

745
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:17,047
But he's definitely fine.

746
00:43:17,206 --> 00:43:17,967
Thank you, doctor.

747
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:18,646
No problem.

748
00:43:18,646 --> 00:43:19,327
Thank you.

749
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:27,527
What's wrong?

750
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:31,086
You guys look at me as if I'm dying.

751
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:32,847
Stop talking nonsense.

752
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:34,927
Since you're okay,

753
00:43:34,927 --> 00:43:36,126
I'll go back to work.

754
00:43:36,286 --> 00:43:38,206
I'll go back to the station, then.

755
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:40,286
Then I'll go back to the restaurant.

756
00:43:40,606 --> 00:43:41,487
Stop looking.

757
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:43,206
Let's go.

758
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:43,887
I'll get going, then.

759
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:47,407
Okay.

760
00:43:47,887 --> 00:43:49,007
Since he's okay,

761
00:43:49,007 --> 00:43:50,246
you should go home and get some rest.

762
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:51,766
I'll take care
of his hospital discharge.

763
00:43:51,766 --> 00:43:52,447
Okay.

764
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:04,606
Are you thirsty?

765
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:05,887
I'll get you some water.

766
00:44:06,487 --> 00:44:07,807
It's okay. I'm not thirsty.

767
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:11,847
Do you want any fruit?

768
00:44:11,847 --> 00:44:13,086
I'll go and buy some.

769
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:14,327
No need.

770
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:33,646
Yesterday,

771
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:37,166
I waited for you at the park
for a long time.

772
00:44:38,286 --> 00:44:41,246
I found out you were in an accident
when it was getting dark.
