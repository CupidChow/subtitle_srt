(The Distant Him)

15
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,000
I waited for you all day
in the park yesterday.

16
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,400
I found out you were in an accident
when it was getting dark.

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,239
What did you want to tell me yesterday?

18
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,800
I...

19
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,159
I forgot.

20
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,240
It's okay.

21
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,159
I'm not in a hurry.

22
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,360
We can talk once you make
a full recovery.

23
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,439
Rest now.

24
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,879
I'll keep you company here.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
I'm fine.

26
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,199
I want to have some privacy.

27
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,000
You can go home.

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,840
Daqian.

29
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:13,919
Where are you going?

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,319
I'm heading back.

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay.

32
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,360
Bravo.

33
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,479
She waited for you outside
the entire night

34
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,240
And you dismissed her in a few words.

35
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,479
Zixi, sit down.

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,919
I need to ask you something.

37
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,599
What?

38
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,039
In my previous accident,

39
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,000
how is the other driver now?

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,719
Do you have any idea?

41
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,159
Who?

42
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,360
The driver who hit me.

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,919
What?

44
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,479
You crashed into a barrier.

45
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
But I remember there was another car.

46
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,240
Our parents have confirmed
with the traffic police.

47
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,840
There was only your car at the scene.

48
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,639
No trace of hit-and-run.

49
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,360
When we asked you whose car
you were driving,

50
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,400
you just said you couldn't remember.

51
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,040
Didn't I crash my car

52
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,439
on my way to Baihe?

53
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,680
What?

54
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,639
You crashed your car
when you were leaving Baihe.

55
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,879
You were so hellbent on
starting another business.

56
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,120
Our parents couldn't dissuade you.

57
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,319
I checked the accident you just told me.

58
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,319
There is no camera
on that particular stretch.

59
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,879
But judging from the camera before
and after that spot,

60
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,000
we can confirm your car was the only
vehicle during the time of the accident.

61
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,480
If there was another car involved,

62
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,680
we would have known.

63
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,560
How did I crash my car then?

64
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,240
We're wondering too.

65
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,639
Based on the clues on the ground,

66
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,160
everything seemed illogical.

67
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,000
However,

68
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,199
if you were truly hit by another car,

69
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,920
there is no way we wouldn't know
about it

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,160
unless it disappeared into thin air.

71
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,600
Thank you.

72
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,600
Where were you during the day?

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,519
You were discharged but we couldn't
find you back home.

74
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,759
Dad and mom were worried sick.

75
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,279
Where are they?

76
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,319
Asleep.

77
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,360
When you were in the hospital yesterday,

78
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,439
mom almost fainted.

79
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,319
What happened to her?

80
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,680
She worried too much about you.

81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,879
I see.

82
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,759
I made them worry.

83
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,399
You should go to bed early too.

84
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,560
What are you looking for?

85
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,000
Mom, as for my old phone,

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,240
do you know where it is?

87
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,399
What phone?

88
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,639
After the crash,

89
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,240
I got a new phone.

90
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Where's my old phone?

91
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,319
Here.

92
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,040
Is it this one?

93
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,639
Yes.

94
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,399
It's broken.

95
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,800
Why do you need it?

96
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,079
It's still useful for me.

97
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,319
I was thinking of giving

98
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,959
whatever you don't need here

99
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,399
to a scrap collector one day.

100
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,360
All right.

101
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,720
Mom, I'll go to bed now.

102
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,639
You should rest early too.

103
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,279
You...

104
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,639
You...

105
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,879
This son of mine.

106
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,800
Coming!

107
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,560
Daqian.

108
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,279
Aunt Hui.

109
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:02,959
Come in.

110
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,279
Daqian, do you need a drink?

111
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,319
I'll brew you a cup of coffee.

112
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,000
It's okay.

113
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,480
Aunt Hui, the fruits are for you.

114
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,199
Your mom just visited.

115
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,720
You and your mother

116
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
don't have to come with gifts, you know.

117
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,360
Great timing, Daqian.

118
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,600
Lizi

119
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,360
has been staying in his room
for the entire day.

120
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,720
I don't know what he was up to
these few days as well.

121
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,240
He looks distraught.

122
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,439
Talk to him, will you?

123
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,919
(This is different
from what I remember.)

127
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,720
Mi Lan was married too.

128
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,720
Yan's father didn't leave him.

129
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,279
The three of them
are living just fine now.

130
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,320
What have you been doing these days?

131
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,759
Why are you here?

132
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,360
I messaged you on WeChat.

133
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,240
You never replied

134
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,840
so I came to check on you.

135
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,360
I'm busy.

136
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,440
I didn't have the time.

137
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,360
You're avoiding me.

138
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,840
Am I?

139
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,440
I don't think so.

140
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,960
Why should I avoid you?

141
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,080
After you woke up, you turned
into another person.

142
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,000
The doctor said you would recall
your past.

143
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,879
But I think you intentionally

144
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,960
left out something.

145
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,519
Daqian, I...

146
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,600
Do you know you're still a shareholder
of Starry Sky?

147
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,559
It's so busy in the restaurant

148
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,200
but you're slacking here alone.

149
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,000
Why don't you find us

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,679
an accountant?

151
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,600
I'll find you one then.

152
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,399
Hurry up.

153
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,559
And don't come
to the restaurant anymore.

154
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,039
Daqian, you're leaving already?

155
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,320
Aunt Hui, the restaurant needs me.

156
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,480
What happened?

157
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,159
You pissed Daqian off?

158
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,600
I know how close you are

159
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
to Daqian.

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,519
Talk to her now.

161
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,120
All right, mom.

162
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,679

Where's Zili?

342
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,680
He said he wouldn't come.

343
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,119
Why?

344
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:26,599
He said he wasn't feeling well.

345
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,400
He's just lazy.

346
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,400
Let's not wait for him.

347

I realized I have something to do.

I'll join you guys once I'm done.

No.

How do you know I'm by the entrance?

It's not her fault.

Are you out of your mind?

Was it her who told you
to pursue drawing?

Was it her

who told you to pursue art?

No.

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,039
It has nothing to do with her.

475

You know what others would say?

479
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,559
They would say that as a teacher,

480
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,759
I fail to educate my own daughter.

481

She has no moral code

482
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,720
and is flirting with my student.

483

Tell me now. How am I supposed to face
others in Baihe?

Why did you turn out to be this way?

How can you do this?

488
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,359
How can you do this to your mom?

489
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,680
Mi, stop it.

490
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,440
Leave me!

491
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,000
I am honest with myself

You said you protected me.

494

But growing up,

Your protection

498
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,160
was all about belittling me
in front of others.

499
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,839
Your protection is manipulation.

500
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,720
Admit it. You resent me.

501

When I was upset,

508

he would give me this too.

509
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,880
Are you upset

510
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,839
about Mu Zili?

511
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,079
Daqian.

512

when you came back to Baihe?

It might be before that.

So much so that I lost track of when.

So

I didn't mean that.

you hurt Yan's feelings?

546

Maybe he needs time.

not to squander my youth and time away.

She told me to give up
on other trivial matters.

She almost ruined your study.

I don't owe her any apology.

Mi Lan never burdens anyone else

She endures everything on her own.

The victim of the entire incident

is her.

As her father,

608

you humiliated her in front of everyone

Don't worry, Mr. Mi.

Oh, this.

Yes, my laptop.

00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,320
Right. Have a seat.

621
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,119
What did the laptop do?

622
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:22,119
It switched off on its own when you
were using it?

623
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:23,760
Or perhaps you can't switch it on
after you switched it off?

624
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,719
When I was using the laptop,

625
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:25,960
it suddenly told me to scan
for any viruses.

626
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,199
After I did it,

627

I can't switch it on anymore.

628
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:30,719
This happened before.

629
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,320
I gave it a good shake

630
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,239
and it came back alive.

631
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:36,039
But now, nothing works.

632
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:36,639
I see.

633
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,480
Let me have a look.

634
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,199
Look.

635
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,239
Do you have its charger?

636
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:47,840
Yes.

637
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,679
Where's Daqian?

638
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:57,239
Sleeping upstairs.

639
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,239
The restaurant is open today, isn't it?

640
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,239
Why aren't you there?

641
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:02,920
Uncle Yan is there.

642
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,159
I won't be there

643
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
so that he has to manage
the restaurant alone.

644
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,239
That will make him learn.

645
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,000
Why didn't you go then?

646
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:12,679
I...

647
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,880
Why are you here?

648
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:21,280
Uncle Yingjun asked me
to help fix his laptop.

649
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,559
Yes, he's helping me.

650
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,840
Get him something to eat.

651
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,960
And a cup of coffee too.

652
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:27,400
What do you want to eat?

653
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:28,239
- No need.
- Why don't you

654
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,679
prepare an elaborate feast for him then?

655
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,920
You summoned him here to fix your laptop
during the day.

656
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,039
Did you pay him?

657
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,360
Seeing how close we are,
do I have to pay you,

658

659
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,079
Of course, not.

660
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,199
Exactly.

661
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:41,760
We're almost like a family.

662
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,960
The Zhengs and the Mus

663
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,519
can never be more different.

664

Don't flatter yourself now.

665
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,280
Someone woke up on the wrong side
of the bed today.

666

She woke up

667
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,039
and chose violence.

668
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:36,320
Your dad's laptop.

669
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:38,320
I fixed it.

670
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,119
Anything else?

671
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:53,000
I had a family emergency
