Why must he come back?

111

He abandoned his family
and owed money all over the place.

He's so shameless.

Can you stop being so narrow-minded?

Who are you calling narrow-minded?

Who should I settle this with?

You were deceived ten years ago.

You were beaten up ten years later.

120

He's a bastard

169
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:44,272
Both of us can catch up with each other.

170
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:45,672
Come, take a seat.

171
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:46,632
Make yourself at home.

172
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:47,193
Sure.

173
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:47,873
Have a seat.

174
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:48,473
Sure.

175
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:50,512
This room is quite nice.

176
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:50,993
It is.

177
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:51,912
It's new.

178
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:55,912
Go do your work.

179
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:57,272
Right.

180
00:09:57,392 --> 00:09:59,993
Thank you, kids. I appreciate it.

181
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:01,032
You're welcome, Uncle.

182
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,512
You guys get some rest.

183
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:03,233
We'll get going.

184
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:04,233
Bye bye.

185
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:06,713
Hey,

186
00:10:06,713 --> 00:10:08,272
why would your dad spend a night here?

187
00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:10,152
He must've had an argument with my mum.

188
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:12,593
You've worked hard today, Mi Lan.

189
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:14,113
You have to take care
of the two old men.

190
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:15,073
It's alright.

191
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:19,152
It's a good thing.

192
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:21,713
What is it?

193
00:10:24,353 --> 00:10:25,473
This is authentic.

194
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:27,073
I know you like Moutai.

195
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:28,552
So I brought it specially for you.

196
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:32,632
Yan Zhonghui,

197
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,392
how much exactly did you earn?

198
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:35,833
You even bought
such an expensive liquor.

199
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:42,473
If you returned a few months earlier,

200
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,912
I would've been able
to get drunk with you.

201
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:47,473
But now, it's too late.

202
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:48,833
Keep it.

203
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,233
No, what do you mean

204
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,473
by that?

205
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:54,152
Why does it sound like your last word?

206
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:56,713
It's never too late to get drunk.

207
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:58,672
You have no idea.

208
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:01,073
A while ago, I had

209
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:02,353
a heart surgery.

210
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:03,833
Death has knocked at my door.

211
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,233
I dare not to drink liquor again.

212
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,473
Zheng,

213
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:08,752
you're a good man.

214
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:10,432
You won't die easily.

215
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:14,833
When we had drinks back then,

216
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,833
you were the only one
who can drink me under the table.

217
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,233
What about me?

218
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:22,593
Mu?

219
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:23,953
Mu!

220
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,840
(Starry Sky Restaurant)

221
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,152
(Starry Sky Restaurant)
Come.

222
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:41,912
Who did that?

223
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,632
He hit you real hard.

224
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:46,752
I'm fine.

225
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:48,672
I didn't expect

226
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:50,752
to get beaten up by several young brats

227
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:52,873
at the public bathhouse today.

228
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:55,552
We're getting old.

229
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,233
If it's 20 years ago,

230
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,593
no one in Baihe would dare

231
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,953
to fight the three of us.

232
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:04,512
If it wasn't for Mu's son,

233
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:06,432
we wouldn't be able
to have drinks here tonight.

234
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:08,993
Mu,

235
00:12:09,873 --> 00:12:11,073
you've got a good son.

236
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:13,873
Didn't you also have a good son?

237
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:16,993
But he doesn't have a good father.

238
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:18,912
You're right.

239
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,752
Look what you've done all these years.

240
00:12:21,752 --> 00:12:23,073
You're inhuman.

241
00:12:23,073 --> 00:12:25,672
You abandoned your wife and son.

242
00:12:25,672 --> 00:12:27,193
Is it that serious?

243
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:28,873
Is it not serious?

244
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,632
Mu,

245
00:12:30,993 --> 00:12:32,833
am I wrong?

246
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:33,713
That's enough.

247
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:36,792
Zhonghui came back with money.

248
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:39,593
It's better than anything.

249
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:42,593
And he was beaten up.
It's not easy for him.

250
00:12:42,953 --> 00:12:44,272
Is it easy for his wife and son?

251
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:46,593
He didn't know that.
Did you not know it?

252
00:12:46,713 --> 00:12:49,313
What have his wife and son been
going through all these years?

253
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,953
They had a miserable life.

254
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:52,313
I shouldn't have had drinks with you.

255
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,313
I should've beaten you up.

256
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:54,032
Yingjun.

257
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,193
That's enough.

258
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:01,473
Right.

259
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,792
I was thinking about it
on the way back.

260
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:07,713
That if I got into an accident
on my way,

261
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:13,152
it would be a worthy death.

262
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:14,512
Death?

263
00:13:14,713 --> 00:13:16,032
That's an evasion.

264
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:17,752
What should your son do if you die?

265
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:19,152
Facing a body,

266
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:19,873
you seal off

267
00:13:19,873 --> 00:13:21,593
the channel where he can vent his anger.

268
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:22,392
Yan Zhonghui,

269
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,912
you should be punished.

270
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:24,713
You know that?

271
00:13:24,713 --> 00:13:25,833
If I knew I ended up this way,

272
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,752
I would've rather beaten myself to death

273
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:29,353
than running away.

274
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:30,272
When you decided to leave,

275
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:31,193
what did I tell you?

276
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:32,152
I told you never to come back

277
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:33,593
if you wanted to run away.

278
00:13:33,752 --> 00:13:34,713
If you came back,

279
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,193
your wife and son

280
00:13:36,193 --> 00:13:37,432
would either hate you forever

281
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:39,272
or cut ties with you.

282
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:39,912
Didn't I tell you that?

283
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:44,473
You did.

284
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:48,512
The past

285
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:50,912
Yan Zhonghui

286
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:53,432
has long gone.

287
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:57,353
Now, I ended up being

288
00:13:58,032 --> 00:13:59,392
an old man

289
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:01,953
who loses everything.

290
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:05,233
Zhonghui,

291
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:07,912
responsibility is what matters

292
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:10,672
the most in a man's life.

293
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:13,912
This is what you're missing.

294
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:18,672
I've come back now.

295
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:23,593
But I lost my family.

296
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:28,272
This is kind

297
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:30,593
of my retribution.

298
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:35,473
Zhonghui,

299
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:39,313
people of our age

300
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,073
should do our best
in handling the matters in our hands.

301
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:47,632
In this way,

302
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:52,193
we can get to the end

303
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,833
steadfastly.

304
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:05,512
Come.

305
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:06,752
Fill it up.

306
00:15:23,473 --> 00:15:24,152
What's wrong?

307
00:15:27,353 --> 00:15:29,392
We always play the same song.

308
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,713
Can we try something new?

309
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:32,713
It's boring.

310
00:15:32,873 --> 00:15:34,632
Yes, I feel the same.

311
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:35,353
Hey,

312
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,873
don't you think the form
of our performance

313
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,632
is too boring?

314
00:15:39,953 --> 00:15:40,632
No audience wants

315
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:42,032
to watch this kind of show.

316
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:43,193
They'll get tired of it.

317
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:44,392
They won't buy the tickets
if they're tired of it.

318
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:46,432
Then, we won't be able
to make money out of it.

319
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:50,672
What do you have in mind?

320
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:52,152
I'll get this straight.

321
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,792
From the first day I joined the troupe,

322
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:56,873
my dream is

323
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,353
to form our own band.

324
00:15:58,512 --> 00:15:59,713
I've thought of the name.

325
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:01,313
Northeast Magic Stone Triumvirate.

326
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:02,993
One day,

327
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:04,432
we'll fight our ways out of Baihe,

328
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,193
and go to Tieyuan,

329
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:07,113
to Harbin,

330
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,833
and to Beijing.
We'll hold concerts.

331
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,113
At last, we'll go to Musikverein.

332
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,272
Perfect.

333
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:12,953
My soulmate.

334
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,432
Calm down, both of you. Stay calm.

335
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,953
You've got a good idea.

336
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:19,353
After everything you said,
what song do you want to play?

337
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,792
Do you have a new song?

338
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,370
You are like a fire in winter.

339
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,160
Your love warms my heart.

340
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,520
Each time you come to me quietly,

341
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,490
you light up my life.

342
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,450
Your big eyes

343
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,490
are bright and twinkly,

344
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,320
like the brightest star in the sky.

345
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,513
You're like the fire.

346
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,730
Your love has warmed me,

347
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,840
just like the roaring flame.

348
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,800
Your love has warmed me.

349
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,440
I'm happy.

350
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,793
But I didn't tell you.

351
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,970
And I know that you really like me.

352
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:13,992
Good morning, Uncle.

353
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:17,313
You gave me a scare.

354
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:18,232
Good morning.

355
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:19,712
What are you doing?

356
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:20,793
I think

357
00:18:20,793 --> 00:18:22,513
I can't stay here for free.

358
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,273
I see that you've got

359
00:18:24,273 --> 00:18:25,353
all kinds of ingredients.

360
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:26,952
So I made breakfast for you guys.

361
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:35,712
What breakfast?

362
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:37,432
You'll know it afterwards.

363
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:41,432
Here's your breakfast.

364
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:43,513
Malatang.

365
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:49,033
What is this?

366
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,392
This?

367
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:52,593
This is the fried beancurd from Guangxi.

368
00:18:53,353 --> 00:18:55,873
I can tell this is not
the red sausage from Northeast.

369
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,593
This is the sausage from Sichuan.

370
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:58,992
I brought it back myself.

371
00:19:01,392 --> 00:19:02,952
Fried beancurd from Guangxi.

372
00:19:03,313 --> 00:19:04,432
Sausage from Sichuan.

373
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:06,432
Why don't you make Fried Pork in Scoop?

374
00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:08,152
Isn't it just a Malatang?

375
00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:09,672
Why did you make it so complicated?

376
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:10,952
Try it.

377
00:19:22,273 --> 00:19:23,632
Quick, try it.

378
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:24,553
It's delicious.

379
00:19:29,593 --> 00:19:31,273
Uncle, how did you make it
taste so good?

380
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:32,273
It's delicious.

381
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:35,152
I'm actually a foodie.

382
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:36,632
As I've travelled extensively for years,

383
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:38,073
I learned all kinds of things.

384
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:39,632
That's how I created this.

385
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,593
Uncle, can you teach us how to make it?

386
00:19:42,753 --> 00:19:43,952
Why bother learning it?

387
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:45,833
I can make it for you everyday
if you like.

388
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,192
We're enjoying the food.

389
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:50,472
Why are you acting surprised?

390
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:51,273
My friends,

391
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,113
from now on,

392
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:55,432
this will be
the development direction

393
00:19:55,432 --> 00:19:56,632
of Starry Sky Restaurant.

394
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,113
Only Malatang?

395
00:19:58,353 --> 00:19:59,632
Don't underestimate Malatang.

396
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:02,073
This is actually the stew
from Northeast.

397
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:04,152
It represents the spirit of Northeast.

398
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:06,513
You're thoughtful, Zheng.

399
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:09,793
Once you master this,

400
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:12,273
it'll become well-known. It has
meager profit but high turnover.

401
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:14,192
The point is it's simple and fast.

402
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:15,432
There are only three steps.

403
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:17,073
Wash the ingredients, put them in

404
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:18,553
and get them out.

405
00:20:18,873 --> 00:20:19,472
Done.

406
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:21,992
It's not that simple, Uncle.

407
00:20:22,232 --> 00:20:23,152
It's not complicated.

408
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:25,593
As long as you've got
the skill of Uncle Yan,

409
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:27,513
once this thing is launched,

410
00:20:27,513 --> 00:20:29,472
I'm sure it'll become
the top restaurant in Baihe.

411
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:30,232
I agree.

412
00:20:30,513 --> 00:20:31,952
Uncle Yan, why don't you stay here

413
00:20:31,952 --> 00:20:32,992
and be our chef?

414
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,392
I don't think it's appropriate.

415
00:20:37,392 --> 00:20:38,513
Don't worry, Uncle Yan.

416
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:39,793
We won't let you work for free.

417
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:40,793
We'll pay you.

418
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:42,392
I... It's not about money.

419
00:20:42,392 --> 00:20:43,632
Just stay, Uncle.

420
00:20:43,632 --> 00:20:45,113
We really need you now.

421
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:45,912
What about me?

422
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,353
Don't you need me?

423
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,873
We need you too.

424
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,273
You're the honored manager.

425
00:20:50,273 --> 00:20:51,912
Uncle Yan is our chef.

426
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:52,793
Mi Lan and I are the waitresses.

427
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,833
Mu Zili is the accountant.

428
00:20:54,273 --> 00:20:55,152
It's done.

429
00:20:58,073 --> 00:20:59,273
It's done!

430
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:02,632
Yan Zhonghui, you are
the appropriate person to be the chef.

431
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:03,472
Just say yes.

432
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:12,912
Okay, then.

Where should I put
the newly arrived grocery?

474

How could I let the manger do this?

Come, quick.

476
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,833
Give it to me.

477
00:23:24,313 --> 00:23:25,152
Does the manager

478
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:26,553
come to

479

make an inspection?

480
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:33,273
Not bad.

481
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:39,313
Yan Zhonghui,

482
00:23:40,192 --> 00:23:41,833
how long have you been in this industry?

483
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:44,273
Actually, I wasn't technically

484
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:45,313
a chef.

485
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:47,313
I cooked for my fellow workers back then

486
00:23:47,313 --> 00:23:48,392
when I worked out there.

487
00:23:48,392 --> 00:23:49,632
I learned this and that.

488
00:23:49,632 --> 00:23:50,672
That's how I worked on my cooking skill.

489
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:51,952
I'm no expert.

490
00:23:52,873 --> 00:23:55,392
With your cooking skill,

491
00:23:55,553 --> 00:23:56,632
you can get a job

492
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:58,912
that pays better.

493
00:23:58,912 --> 00:23:59,793
Consider about it.

494
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,432
How much do you think
we should pay you in a month?

495
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:03,753
Don't feel embarrassed.

496
00:24:03,753 --> 00:24:04,833
I'll talk to the kids.

497
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:06,113
I don't want money.

498
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:08,392
I just want to help you and the kids.

499
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:09,432
You don't want money?

500
00:24:10,152 --> 00:24:12,472
Yan Zhonghui,
who are you trying to fool?

501
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:15,232
Stop pretending to be a generous man.

502
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:16,192
Tell me.

503
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:21,793
I'll be honest with you, Zheng.

504
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:24,513
I don't want to work at another place.

505
00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:26,192
I have to stay here.

506
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:28,353
Because this is the place

507
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:29,873
where Junze often comes.

508
00:24:30,313 --> 00:24:31,472
This is the only place

509
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:33,392
where I can interact with him.

510
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:34,992
I don't want him to see

511
00:24:34,992 --> 00:24:36,073
me doing nothing here.

512
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:37,952
I need a good reason

513
00:24:37,952 --> 00:24:38,992
to stay here.

514
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,152
Zheng, if you have nothing to do,

515
00:24:43,152 --> 00:24:44,513
help me wash the vegetables.

516
00:24:44,513 --> 00:24:46,033
Let's wash it while chatting.

517
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:46,712
Okay?

518
00:24:48,392 --> 00:24:49,432
You ask me to wash vegetables?

519
00:24:50,873 --> 00:24:53,833
How can I do such a work
as the manager?

520
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,392
I have something more important to do.

521
00:24:55,392 --> 00:24:55,992
Yes, you're right.

522
00:24:55,992 --> 00:24:57,353
A manager can't do this job.

523
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:58,033
Okay.

524
00:24:58,472 --> 00:24:59,873
Go do your work.

525
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,232
Just rest assured.

526
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:02,313
I'll be sure to help the kids

527
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:03,753
make this restaurant well-known.

528
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:04,712
Keep it up.

529
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:06,833
A prodigal who returns is
more precious than gold.

530
00:25:06,992 --> 00:25:07,712
I'm leaving.

531
00:25:14,952 --> 00:25:15,632
Mum,

532
00:25:16,192 --> 00:25:17,833
we've paid off the debt.

533
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,392
Why do you keep sending them things?

534
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:21,912
We did pay off the debt,

535
00:25:22,073 --> 00:25:23,873
but we can't skip the courtesy.

536
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:25,952
The Spring Festival is approaching.

537
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,513
We should carry on

538
00:25:27,513 --> 00:25:28,553
door-to-door visits.

539
00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:30,353
Think about it.

540
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:31,753
All these years,

541
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:34,073
if it wasn't for their tolerance,

542
00:25:34,472 --> 00:25:35,632
how would we

543
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:37,753
be able to come this far?

544
00:25:39,392 --> 00:25:40,432
We should thank

545
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:42,513
all of them.

546
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:43,672
Okay.

547
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:46,353
I'll go with you.

548
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:47,632
You don't have to come with me.

549
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,073
I'll do it myself.

550
00:25:49,273 --> 00:25:50,952
I did this with you in previous years.

551
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:52,113
I'll do it this year as well.

552
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,873
That's in the past.

553
00:25:53,992 --> 00:25:55,353
It's different this year.

554
00:25:55,873 --> 00:25:57,392
Let's make a fresh start in New Year.

555
00:25:58,113 --> 00:25:59,432
From now on,

556
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:02,113
it'll be a brand new start.

557
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:05,553
I don't want my son to get involved

558
00:26:05,553 --> 00:26:06,152
in

559
00:26:06,152 --> 00:26:07,232
those bad things anymore.

560
00:26:13,712 --> 00:26:14,833
I heard that your dad

561
00:26:15,952 --> 00:26:17,273
is staying in Daqian's restaurant.

562
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:18,992
Did you see him?

563
00:26:20,432 --> 00:26:21,753
We're not related to him.

564
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:23,992
It's pointless to see him.

565
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:27,712
Son,

566
00:26:28,873 --> 00:26:30,073
no matter what,

567
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:32,192
he's your father.

568
00:26:32,432 --> 00:26:33,753
You won't exist without him.

569
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:38,073
You really shouldn't have beaten him.

570
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:43,593
Mum,

571
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:46,273
aren't you mad at him?

572
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:51,952
Let me be honest with you.

573
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:54,992
All these years,

574
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:58,392
it feels like a load has been
weighing on my mind.

575
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,632
Now that the load is

576
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:02,353
finally lifted off my mind.

577
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:06,273
We no longer have to live

578
00:27:06,273 --> 00:27:07,992
a life where we owe people money.

579
00:27:09,632 --> 00:27:11,833
The person
who we didn't know his whereabouts

580
00:27:12,513 --> 00:27:14,113
is still well and alive.

581
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:18,753
All those bad things

582
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:20,833
have to be ended

583
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,873
before the new year.

584
00:27:24,912 --> 00:27:26,073
I feel

585
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:28,593
relieved.

586
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:34,513
Put more in it.

587
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:01,432
Why are you here?

588
00:28:01,553 --> 00:28:03,113
Your colleague said
that you drove up the hill for a survey.

589
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:04,513
So I waited here for you.

590
00:28:04,632 --> 00:28:05,992
Quick, hop in. It's freezing out there.

591
00:28:14,873 --> 00:28:15,672
What's up?

592
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:17,113
You've got some nerve to ask me.

593
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,793
As a part-timer of Starry Sky,

594
00:28:18,793 --> 00:28:20,232
you've not showed up for several days.

595
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:21,753
I certainly have to come and see you.

596
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:23,952
Here.

597
00:28:26,593 --> 00:28:27,632
What is this?

598
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:36,152
It smells so good.

599
00:28:36,152 --> 00:28:36,793
Try it.

600
00:28:41,432 --> 00:28:42,033
Try it.

601
00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:43,873
How does it taste?

602
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:46,513
It's delicious.

603
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:51,353
You made it?

604
00:28:52,192 --> 00:28:52,873
It's made

605
00:28:52,873 --> 00:28:54,392
by the newly-hired chef
in our restaurant.

606
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:55,873
So I brought it for you to taste it.

607
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:00,432
It's based on Northeastern cooking.

608
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,232
But it's also like a combination

609
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:03,593
of the tastes across the country.

610
00:29:04,232 --> 00:29:06,192
It's sort of a Malatang-style stew.

611
00:29:08,353 --> 00:29:09,632
Your dad made it.

612
00:29:19,273 --> 00:29:21,672
Your dad is currently
the pillar of our restaurant.

613
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:23,472
We're getting more customers.

614
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:25,712
You can hire anyone.

615
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,753
Why must it be him?

616
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:29,753
Do you know how hard it is

617
00:29:29,753 --> 00:29:30,912
to find a good chef?

618
00:29:31,273 --> 00:29:32,313
Besides, your dad said

619
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:33,992
he doesn't want to stay
in our restaurant for free.

620
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:35,432
So he requested

621
00:29:35,432 --> 00:29:36,712
to cook Malatang for us.

622
00:29:41,632 --> 00:29:42,793
Are you here to be a lobbyist?

623
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:44,033
I'm here to ask

624
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:45,113
if you'll never come

625
00:29:45,113 --> 00:29:46,392
if your dad is in our restaurant?

626
00:29:48,273 --> 00:29:49,432
So it's him who asks you to come?

627
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:50,432
No.

628
00:29:51,113 --> 00:29:52,313
I came on my own free will.

629
00:29:53,873 --> 00:29:55,672
You said this is a stew.

630
00:29:56,232 --> 00:29:57,952
Do you know what a stew means?

631
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:01,513
In a bowl of Malatang,

632
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:03,753
its base can come in Sichuan flavor.

633
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:05,472
The ingredients can come

634
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,912
from Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei.

635
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:11,113
At last, we can cook it
in Northeastern style.

636
00:30:11,952 --> 00:30:13,553
We put all kinds of ingredients in there

637
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:14,632
and cook them together.

638
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:15,553
Anything you like

639
00:30:15,553 --> 00:30:17,073
can be put in it.

640
00:30:17,472 --> 00:30:20,033
A stew represents tolerance.

641
00:30:23,593 --> 00:30:26,313
Your dad said he's travelled everywhere.

642
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:28,192
He developed the cooking skill

643
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:29,553
from every street stall he has stayed.

644
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:31,873
After eating the dish your dad made,

645
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:33,113
you can tell

646
00:30:33,113 --> 00:30:35,113
that he's been working hard
to live his life.

647
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,753
Hello, who am I talking to?

648
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:49,392
It's me, Wang Ziqi.

649
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:51,553
Wang Ziqi?

650
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:53,912
Your partner, Wang Ziqi.

651
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:56,152
Enough. Stop acting.

652
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,553
I know you're still mad at me.

653
00:30:57,873 --> 00:30:59,073
I haven't contacted you for months,

654
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:01,113
because I've got
something important to do.

655
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:04,192
I've got a good news for you.

656
00:31:05,152 --> 00:31:06,793
I've found a new business partner.

657
00:31:07,353 --> 00:31:08,873
He's willing to invest in our project.

658
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:10,113
Once we get the funds,

659
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:11,593
the project will be reactivated
right away.

660
00:31:11,952 --> 00:31:14,192
Mu Zili, we're going to rise again.

661
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,313
Rise again?

662
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:18,992
Yes, the previous failure was
an accident.

663
00:31:18,992 --> 00:31:20,073
Hurry to Ningzhou.

664
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:21,033
I'll wait for you.

665
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:25,273
Ziqi,

666
00:31:25,712 --> 00:31:29,392
I... I'm a little confused now.

667
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,073
How about this?

668
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:32,513
Let me think about it.

669
00:31:32,513 --> 00:31:34,753
I'll give you an answer later, okay?

670
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:36,273

it's been a blank wall.

739

It's lack of decoration.

We can't afford an expensive painting.

741

So I'd like you
to paint a picture for us.

742
00:35:25,353 --> 00:35:26,233
I'll have it framed,

743
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:27,472
and use it as a decoration here.

744
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:30,233
Rest assured.
You won't paint it for nothing.

745
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:31,072
I'll pay you.

No.

753

We can't take your drawing for free.

754

I've thought about it.

755
00:35:44,313 --> 00:35:45,273
I'll pay RMB 2000 for each drawing.

756
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:46,392
That's the deal.

757

RMB 2000?

758
00:35:48,633 --> 00:35:50,032
It won't do. That's too much.

759
00:35:50,032 --> 00:35:51,313
It's not. It's worth it.

If you become a famous painter
in future,

761

what about the restaurant?

781

She can manage it well without me.

to pass your current work to the others.

787

But intrinsically,
you're giving up halfway.

788
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:23,512
Just like what you did back then.

789
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:25,992
You left your partner aside

00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:30,273
They are the same.

00:37:38,512 --> 00:37:39,592
Just leave early if you want.

795
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,713
I'm used to living a life without you.

796

The longer you stay,

Because I take your side,

00:38:33,873 --> 00:38:35,432
to give me the silent treatment.

00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:39,233
Look how cool she is now.

Dad,

do you really support me in leaving?

813

It's good that you've got
the courage to return

814
00:38:50,673 --> 00:38:51,592
to where you failed.

815
00:38:53,552 --> 00:38:55,273
This is what growing up is.

816
00:38:59,112 --> 00:39:00,353
As for your mum,

817
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:01,233
you don't have to worry.

818
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:02,233
She's got me.

819
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:04,273
I'll convince her.

820
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:06,512
She'll come around.

821
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:08,713
Dad,

822
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:12,833
actually, I haven't made up my mind.

Even if I go back,

824
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:21,072
I'm not trying to go on with the startup

825

or rise again.

826
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:24,873
I just want to figure out

827
00:39:24,873 --> 00:39:26,592
what kind of a man I am.

828
00:39:27,873 --> 00:39:29,833
Since I got into the car accident,

829
00:39:30,353 --> 00:39:32,072
I can't remember anything.

830
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:33,952
When I got the call,

831
00:39:33,952 --> 00:39:35,512
I was actually quite confused.

832
00:39:37,512 --> 00:39:38,552
For a moment,

00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:40,392
I was confused about who I was.

Calm down.

835
00:39:43,512 --> 00:39:45,233
It's not an easy task

836
00:39:45,512 --> 00:39:47,233
to find out about oneself.

837
00:39:48,432 --> 00:39:50,873

I was going to transfer
your money to him.

But he insisted on finishing
the painting before he got paid.

It's fine
as long as he didn't reject you.

a friend with you,

Anyway, it's not you.

859

What if you can only choose me?

860
00:41:09,793 --> 00:41:11,353
Then, I'll never go to that island.

Alright, then.
