Didn't you ever think of unblocking it?

172
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:19,393
No.

173
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,594
What were you thinking then?

174
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,474
I just thought

175
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:29,513
that the world was boring without you.

176
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:32,994
That's all?

177
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:34,714
Also,

178
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:38,033
I missed you a little bit.

179
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:39,994
Just a little bit.

180
00:16:39,994 --> 00:16:41,474
A little bit.

181
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:48,673
Will our next meeting

182
00:16:49,314 --> 00:16:51,834
be in 2080?

183
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:55,874
At that time,

184
00:16:56,553 --> 00:16:58,153
we'll be in our eighties then.

185
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:00,474
That's good.

186
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,513
Let's fall in love
in our twilight years then.

187
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:06,594
I've heard that some people commit
to getting married in their thirties.

188
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:08,594
but never in their eighties.

189
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:10,913
I could see that we'll be walking

190
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,673
to the Civil Affairs Bureau tremblingly.

191
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:14,874
That shows we're friends
of life and death.

192
00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:16,233
True.

193
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:20,594
We can skip the complicated process

194
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:22,473
of buying a house and a car,

195
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:23,633
and having a baby.

196
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:25,594
All we need to do

197
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:26,834
is to take care of each other.

198
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:30,913
I'll play mahjong with you

199
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:32,433
and you'll go fishing with me.

200
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,754
We can go outdoors
when the weather is good.

201
00:17:36,393 --> 00:17:39,034
And travel in the right season.

202
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:44,074
When winter arrives,

203
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:46,393
we'll come back here.

204
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:50,673
I must take good care of my health

205
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:52,913
to live longer so that I can see you.

206
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:56,713
That's the deal. Be there or be square.

207
00:17:58,274 --> 00:17:59,114
Be there or be square.

208
00:19:01,393 --> 00:19:01,993
It's for you.

209
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:04,754
Your birthday meal.

210
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:07,834
Are you really giving me this
for my birthday?

211
00:19:08,274 --> 00:19:10,114
I took it from here.

212
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:16,794
Are you alright?

213
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:20,274
Be careful.

214
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,433
Don't be careless.

215
00:19:24,274 --> 00:19:24,874
Give me.

216
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:27,074
Where's my birthday present?

217
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,393
Didn't I give it to you this morning?

218
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:31,633
It was drawn by Mu Zixi.

219
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:32,754
It has nothing to do with you.

220
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,433
Faster.

221
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:36,514
This.

222
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:38,314
This is for you.

223
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:41,314
An ornament?

224
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:55,754
What are you looking for?

225
00:19:57,514 --> 00:19:58,993
Just a strap?

226
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:04,314
I heard

227
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:08,153
that red strap can bond
a couple together.

228
00:20:08,393 --> 00:20:09,393
It's more effective than anything else.

229
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:21,233
Don't cut it
if you don't like it though.

230
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:39,993
It's done.

231
00:20:41,393 --> 00:20:42,834
This is our promise.

232
00:20:43,594 --> 00:20:44,754
What promise did we make?

233
00:20:45,314 --> 00:20:47,433
We promise to stay together.

234
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,594
What's your plan

235
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:53,913
after going back?

236
00:20:56,594 --> 00:20:57,673
I think

237
00:20:58,514 --> 00:20:59,913
I'll look for a job.

238
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:01,554
Then?

239
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,354
Then,

240
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:05,114
I want to visit Mi Lan,

241
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:06,874
Yan,

242
00:21:07,514 --> 00:21:08,794
and Gong Xiaoqin.

243
00:21:08,993 --> 00:21:09,794
What's the next step?

244
00:21:12,514 --> 00:21:15,433
Then, I'll wait for the bolide.

245
00:21:19,193 --> 00:21:19,953
Then?

246
00:21:20,794 --> 00:21:22,074
Stop asking already.

247
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:32,034
Let's make a deal.

248
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:35,514
If the bolide

249
00:21:35,514 --> 00:21:37,114
doesn't come,

250
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:40,274

I can stay here

00:44:53,354 --> 00:44:56,993
saying that he's bringing his parents
to visit me some days later.

505
00:44:57,473 --> 00:44:58,473
What a sensible kid.

506
00:44:58,473 --> 00:44:59,953
Right, he's so sensible.

507
00:45:00,794 --> 00:45:03,393
Yan, how are your parents doing now?

508
00:45:04,274 --> 00:45:05,033
My dad

509
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:07,073
runs a small eatery in Guangdong.

510
00:45:07,073 --> 00:45:07,874
He's doing good there.

511
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:10,473
My mum went on a trip with Uncle Song.

512
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,433
Oh, right.

513
00:45:12,874 --> 00:45:13,794
Dad and mum.

514
00:45:14,794 --> 00:45:15,794
I have something

515
00:45:15,794 --> 00:45:16,794
to tell you.

516
00:45:16,794 --> 00:45:17,714
What's it?

517
00:45:19,913 --> 00:45:20,553
You're going

518
00:45:20,553 --> 00:45:22,154
to be grandparents soon.

519
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:26,033
Daqian, when did you know about this?

520
00:45:26,033 --> 00:45:26,993
Give them a red packet.

521
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,834
- That's right.
- Congratulations, Daqian.

522
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:29,714
Thank you, Aunt Hui.

523
00:45:29,714 --> 00:45:31,634
Here, it's from your mother.

524
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:34,234
Thank you, dad and mum.

525
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,113
I'll give it to my wife.

526
00:45:37,993 --> 00:45:39,714
Let's dig in.

527
00:45:39,714 --> 00:45:41,033
Come on. Let's eat.

528
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:41,754
Well.

529
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:43,113
There's one more person here.

530
00:45:45,354 --> 00:45:47,274
Happy New Year.

531
00:45:47,674 --> 00:45:48,513
Zixi.

532
00:45:49,154 --> 00:45:51,113
I thought you're not coming back.

533
00:45:51,354 --> 00:45:52,714
Because

534
00:45:54,593 --> 00:45:55,754
I miss you all.

535
00:45:56,194 --> 00:45:57,194
Take a seat.

536
00:45:57,194 --> 00:45:58,314
Faster and sit.

537
00:46:00,513 --> 00:46:01,473
How's your work?

538
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:04,154
I've decided to come back here
and work as an art teacher.

539
00:46:06,314 --> 00:46:08,953
It seems every one of us is here
this time.

540
00:46:08,953 --> 00:46:10,354
Let's take a group photo.

541
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:11,993
Sure.

542
00:46:11,993 --> 00:46:12,834
Who's going to take the photo for us?

543
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:14,674
Where's the director?

544
00:46:14,674 --> 00:46:15,513
Go get him. Right.

545
00:46:15,513 --> 00:46:16,234
They are resting now.

546
00:46:16,433 --> 00:46:17,634
(Well, you've promised)

547
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:19,794
(to lend me your place
after taking the photo.)

548
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:20,754
Sure.

549
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,473
(Come on. Look into the camera.)

550
00:46:23,593 --> 00:46:25,634
