15
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,641
Junze, come and eat with us.

16
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,400
Come.

17
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,320
Aunt Qin, keep the money.

18
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,480
Yan Junze, what are you doing?

19
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,201
We're not living in a time when you can
ask my parents to marry me off.

20
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,200
Technically,

21
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,961
they are not my biological parents.

22
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:28,760
Even if you want to ask for my hands,

23
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,320
they are not supposed to receive
any bride price.

24
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,521
What are you two talking about?

25
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:33,281
What is wrong with you?

26
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:34,281
You can't have it.

27
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:34,800
Let it go.

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,121
- You can't have it.
- Let go of it.

29
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:36,800
Stop.

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,281
- Let go!
- Aunt Qin.

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,161
Daqian.

32
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:40,241
- Stop tearing it.
- Let go.

33
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:40,880
Stop tearing it.

34
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:42,040
- Daqian.
- Let go.

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,961
Stop tearing it.

36
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:44,080
- Stop it.
- Let go of it.

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,640
Daqian.

38
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,920
- You!
- Daqian.

39
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:48,161
You're mistaken.

40
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:49,640
My family

41
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,841
owes your family the money.

42
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,441
Give it to me.

43
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:03,001
Come eat with us.

44
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:09,281
We can talk

45
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,121
about our marriage later.

46
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,040
Yan.

47
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,121
I need to clarify something.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,080
Go ahead.

49
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:23,920
I'll put it like this.

50
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,841
The movie, Coherence,

51
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:26,040
have you watched it?

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,401
I am from another parallel universe.

53
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:31,521
On my way back to Baihe,

54
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:33,320
I ran into Zheng Daqian
from this universe.

55
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,760
And then, I arrived at Baihe.

56
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,920
I can't go back now.

57
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
What I mean is that

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,561
I swapped places with Zheng Daqian
in this universe.

59
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:40,880
I came to this parallel universe

60
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,561
while she went to mine.

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,401
You mean

62
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,880
two parallel universes

63
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,441
overlapped?

64
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,800
And you two swapped places?

65
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,920
Exactly.

66
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,841
I knew you're smart enough to get it.

67
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:55,121
Wonderful.

68
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,760
I think in this universe,

69
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,640
we should stay as friends.

70
00:03:58,681 --> 00:03:59,360
Okay?

71
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:02,880
Daqian.

72
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:05,681
If this is the excuse you came up with,

73
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,241
I'll take it.

74
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:08,760
I can wait.

75
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
No. No.

76
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:13,281
It's Dazhi.

77
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:15,961
Hey, Dazhi.

78
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,080
Now?

79
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,360
I'll come over now.

80
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Yan, you're still confused.

81
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,321
I'm not in a rush.

82
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:37,360
Yan is a

83
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:38,800
trustworthy man.

84
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:40,081
Tell me.

85
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,721
Why does Junze

86
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,721
like Daqian so much?

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,040
Mu, tell us.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,721
Daqian is a nice girl.

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,920
Indeed. She has always been a cute girl

90
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,401
and many people like her.

91
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,360
Junze has great taste.

92
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,120
Unlike someone I know.

93
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:59,521
He just can't appreciate the fine thing
before him.

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,281
What got into Yan's head?

95
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:06,521
And I thought no one would want her.

96
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,521
Having a backup plan before she finds
a better suitor. It's good.

97
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:11,761
Who's the backup plan?

98
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,360
Eat now, my dear.

99
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:25,161
Thank you.

100
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:33,360
Zheng Daqian.

101
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,560
Thinking about the bride price so much

102
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:37,040
that you forgot to eat?

103
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:39,120
Jealous?

104
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,600
How much are you going to ask?

105
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,480
Mu Zili, you can be a mute

106
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,961
and someone would want to marry you.

107
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,440
I wonder who invented

108
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,680
potato chips?

109
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,000
It's so convenient

110
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,281
when you're hungry.

111
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,440
I have a question.

112
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,120
When I wasn't there yesterday,

113
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,560
did you

114
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,600
gaslight Yan

115
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:24,961
until he took pity on you

116
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:26,600
and said yes?

117
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,040
Choke

118
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,800
on these potato chips.

119
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,161
So you two

120
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,560
are a thing?

121
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:41,600
Our friendship is a thing.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,800
Tell me.

123
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,721
What was my relationship with Yan?

124
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,040
How am I supposed to know?

125
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,321
I thought you should know it.

126
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:52,761
Have you two

127
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:55,081
been seeing each other

128
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,120
in secret?

129
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:59,440
Or your return to Baihe

130
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,081
rekindled the love between you two?

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,881
Mu Zili.

132
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:08,920
Which answer do you want to hear?

133
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,401
For the first scenario,

134
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,040
I unwittingly became a third wheel

135
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,761
and I don't like it.

136
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:22,641
For the second scenario,

137
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:24,961
someone within my circle is into you.

138
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:25,881
I can get behind that.

139
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:27,521
Also, at your age,

140
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm happy that someone still wants you.

141
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Before I turn violent...

142
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,480
One.

143
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:34,800
- Fine.
- Two.

144
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:36,641
Three.

145
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,260
(Police)

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,800
Yan.

147
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:47,961
Dazhi.

148
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:48,920
Why

149
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,321
do you need me this urgently?

150
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,641
There's this thing

151
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:54,000
and I figure

152
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,521
it's best if I talk to you in person.

153
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:00,961
I have a friend in Tieyuan.

154
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,401
He called me

155
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:04,161
and said

156
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:05,560
there was a burned patient

157
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,800
in the hospital last night.

158
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,521
His name

159
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,800
is Yan Zhonghui.

160
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,600
His height and weight are similar
to your father's.

161
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:15,920
The hospital

162
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,680
can't reach his family.

163
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:21,600
I wonder if you want

164
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,521
to go and see him.

165
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,281
Dazhi?

166
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,120
You look busy.

167
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,321
If there's nothing else,
I should get going.

168
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:40,161
That man is not long for this world.

169
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,800
The doctor said
he's seriously injured.

170
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:44,521
I feel bad for him.

171
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:51,920
I remember you like fortune cakes.

172
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:53,361
When my mother makes them in a few days,

173
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,521
I'll bring some for you.

174
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,601
Yan Junze, did you hear what I said?

175
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,320
What if he truly is your dad?

176
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,680
Yan Junze!

177
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,881
Thank you

178
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:25,361
for coming over this early to help out.

179
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:28,920
If you truly want to thank us,

180
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,121
just give us a red envelope.

181
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:32,920
Did you work?

182
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,361
How cheeky of you
to demand compensation.

183
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:36,241
If anything, I should be thanked first.

184
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,001
Sure.

185
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,440
Tell me. How can I repay you?

186
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:49,920
I need you

187
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,560
to accompany me
to Tieyuan for something.

188
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,281
I knew Liu Dazhi
can't keep his mouth shut.

189
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,761
Come on.

190
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:03,920
He cares about you.

191
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,920
Junze.

192
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:07,281
Let's go.

193
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:09,800
At least you can find out
what's going on.

194
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,481
Don't you think?

195
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,161
Just one look.

196
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,200
No, thanks.

197
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:21,080
I can sympathize with you now.

198
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,720
Emotions can be overpowering at times.

199
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:27,481
You should think twice.

200
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:29,560
Don't live with regrets.

201
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,001
I'll go to work later.

202
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:40,800
Enough painting for today.

203
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:44,281
Junze.

204
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:50,241
Give him some space.

205
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:52,761
He's all bottled up.

206
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,881
Why did you come back alone?
Where's Lizi?

207
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:09,001
He went to the photo studio.

208
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:15,320
Where's dad?

209
00:11:16,121 --> 00:11:17,320
He's on recon duty.

210
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,601
What?

211
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:21,320
You act dumb and won't tell us anything.

212
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,761
Your father invited Junze to have lunch

213
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:25,521
to find out what's happening
between you two.

214
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,481
What does he have to be so nosy?

215
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:32,320
Where are you going?

216
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:36,440
Your order has been served.

217
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,720
Thank you.

218
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,560
Junze.

219
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,161
I invited you to have lunch with me

220
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,320
and I'm sorry for ordering this much.

221
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:49,601
It's going to be expensive.

222
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,241
Eat.

223
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,560
It's okay, Mr. Zheng.

224
00:11:53,641 --> 00:11:54,281
Mr. Zheng,

225
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,680
why do you want to see me?

226
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,121
What else can it be?

227
00:11:58,641 --> 00:12:00,040
I just want both of us to talk

228
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:01,960
and to bond.

229
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,920
Should we get some

230
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:08,521
beer?

231
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,361
Right.

232
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,320
Mr. Zheng.

233
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,161
I'm sure soda

234
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:21,761
can do the job too.

235
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:24,281
Okay.

236
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,521
Enough.

237
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:30,361
Okay.

238
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:35,361
Junze.

239
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,761
I invited you here

240
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,881
to know more about you and Daqian.

241
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,601
What's going on between you two?

242
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:43,881
You two know each other for many years,

243
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:44,560
right?

244
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:46,521
This is so sudden.

245
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:47,601
What happened?

246
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,720
Mr. Zheng.

247
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:53,680
I have liked Daqian

248
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,281
for many years.

249
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,001
But Yan Zhonghui

250
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,560
kind of ruined a lot of things

251
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:06,401
and I feel...

252
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,440
Young man.

253
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,761
The adults have their constraints too.

254
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,800
Let bygone be bygone.

255
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:19,040
Don't dwell on it.

256
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,440
It's not good for your mental health.

257
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:22,361
Mr. Zheng.

258
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Sorry

259
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,840
for burdening all of you

260
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:29,440
all these years.

261
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:30,960
Come.

262
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:38,641
Your father

263
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
is a dishonest man.

264
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:43,361
He lied to everyone back then.

265
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,161
He takes shortcuts

266
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:47,560
and is spineless.

267
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:49,800
Back then, he abandoned you.

268
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:51,601
That's not what a man should do.

269
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:52,241
Don't you think so?

270
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,080
However,

271
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,161
your father is your father,

272
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:56,200
and you are you.

273
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,281
No need to apologize on his behalf.

274
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:01,761
Excuse me.

275
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:03,840
A bottle of Xiaodao wine, please.

276
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:08,161
Mr. Zheng.

277
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:11,361
You're right.

278
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:14,080
Yan Zhonghui

279
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:16,241
is a scum.

280
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,161
A liar.

281
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:22,920
Don't just drink alone.

282
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,161
Come.

283
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:26,161
Dad, what are you doing here?

284
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,241
Is that how you address your elderly?

285
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:31,200
Junze and I are having a men's talk.

286
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,560
Don't meddle in this.

287
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,361
Mom is looking for you.

288
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:36,040
What?

289
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,840
It's an emergency.

290
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,401
What emergency?

291
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:43,281
Junze.

292
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,401
I have an emergency apparently.

293
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:48,241
I'll let you two be.

294
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:49,920
Don't drink too much.

295
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,641
Careful, dad.

296
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,560
See you.

297
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,121
Yan.

298
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:09,361
My father doesn't mince his words.

299
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:11,320
Please don't take it to heart.

300
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:13,680
It's fine.

301
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:15,881
Saying it out loud

302
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,960
makes me feel better.

303
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:23,840
You won't tell your mom?

304
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,481
My mom is the last person

305
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
who needs to know this.

306
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,960
I want her to forget Yan Zhonghui
forever.

307
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,560
Yan Zhonghui

308
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,440
should leave us alone too.

309
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:50,121
I found this from an old photo album
in my house.

310
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:04,601
Tieyuan is just a few hours away
from here.

311
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:08,040
Meeting with him will only take
several minutes at most.

312
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,720
If he's on his final breath,

313
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:13,361
it might even be just a few seconds.

314
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:15,521
After these few seconds,

315
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:18,040
he'll disappear forever from your world.

316
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,080
I know you're hesitating,

317
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,281
aren't you?

318
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,001
Police officer.

319
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,601
We're friends of Liu Dazhi.

320
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:04,121
Who is the patient's next of kin?

321
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:04,761
It's me.

322
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,001
Police officer.

323
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:07,840
May I know what happened?

324
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:09,881
The patient's organs are failing

325
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:10,881
due to severe burns.

326
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:12,601
He might not live past tonight.

327
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,121
How did he get burned?

328
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:16,081
The patient

329
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:17,121
is suspected to have been involved
in a crime.

330
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:18,000
During our investigation,

331
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,881
we found that a fire broke out
in his home

332
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:21,121
so we sent him to the hospital.

333
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,121
Police officer.

334
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:23,561
What did he commit?

335
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:24,280
A scam.

336
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:25,321
We couldn't find

337
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:27,321
anything useful to prove his identity,

338
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,881
so we asked for a photo
of his identity card

339
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,041
from the landlord when he rented
the apartment.

340
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,041
You can have a look.

341
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,220
(Name: Yan Zhonghui)

342
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:38,280
We have been apprised

343
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,401
of the patient's situation.

344
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:40,801
At least you're here now.

345
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,280
Do you want to pay him a visit?

346
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,041
Thank you.

347
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:49,801
Yan, you...

348
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:50,841
- It's this side.
- Yan.

349
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,121
Sorry, please give us a moment.

350
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:54,920
Thank you.

351
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:57,200
Yan.

352
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,680
- It's here.
- Hello?

353
00:17:58,841 --> 00:18:00,041
Okay. I'm on the third floor.

354
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,680
I'll be there.

355
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:03,601
You heard it.

356
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,960
A suspect of a scam.

357
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,561
He scammed so many people in Baihe

358
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:11,561
and he's not done with it.

359
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,680
He continues to be a con artist.

360
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,680
Why should I see him?

361
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,920
You're right, Yan.

362
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:18,240
But the officer has said

363
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,841
that he wouldn't live past tonight.

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,680
He only has a few hours left.

365
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:23,321
Lying alone on the bed,

366
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:24,960
maybe his last wish

367
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,401
is to see you.

368
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,801
If he wanted to see me,

369
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,200
he would have done it already.

370
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,520
Yan Junze, now is not the time

371
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,760
to dwell in the past.

372
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,601
- Why are you hesitating?
- Lizi.

373
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:35,920
Buy some snacks for us, can you?

374
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,720
- I...
- We're all hungry.

375
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:38,680
Go.

376
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,240
Yan.

377
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:56,361
I have a friend.

378
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,321
She's in the exact same situation.

379
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:02,121
During her final year in high school,

380
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,561
her father was mire in debt

381
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
and he couldn't pay up.

382
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,920
And so, he ran away.

383
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,680
She then went to work in a metropolis.

384
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,240
One day,

385
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,081
her missing father

386
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:22,601
appeared in the city out of a sudden.

387
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:39,720
He followed her across

388
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:43,280
several streets on her way back home.

389
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,881
She had many chances to stop

390
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:49,680
and look back,

391
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:52,840
to listen to what he wanted to say.

392
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,420
(Block 1)
Daqian.

393
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,720
But she never turned back

394
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,240
even until she arrived at her home.

395
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:13,361
And then?

396
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:15,601
And then,

397
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:19,960
she heard from someone else

398
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,561
that her father
went back to his hometown.

399
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
The next time they met,

400
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:32,240
the father was under a white sheet.

401
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:34,480
She said

402
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,920
when she signed the death certificate,

403
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:40,440
the

404
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:42,280
rage,

405
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,000
the pain,

406
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,520
the resentment, and the disappointment,

407
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,280
all disappeared

408
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,680
alongside her father's peaceful look.

409
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:55,081
She kept wondering

410
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:56,161
what her father

411
00:20:56,161 --> 00:20:58,121
wanted to tell her that night,

412
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,440
but she could never know.

413
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,081
Yan.

414
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:14,081
Don't live with regrets.

415
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:08,321
Sir.

416
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,401
Sorry.

417
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:11,321
There has been a mistake.

418
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:13,161
The person inside is not Yan Zhonghui.

419
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,920
Not Yan Zhonghui?

420
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,200
Yes.

421
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,361
My colleague in charge of this case
called me just now.

422
00:22:18,361 --> 00:22:19,561
I just learned it too.

423
00:22:19,561 --> 00:22:21,680
The man used
someone else's identity card.

424
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,000
Why does he have

425
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,440
Yan Zhonghui's identity card?

426
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,000
Scammers like him

427
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,480
can procure others' identity cards

428
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,641
via illegal channels

429
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:30,841
to cover their track.

430
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Yan Zhonghui might have
lost his identity card,

431
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,280
and someone else picked it up
and used it.

432
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:36,081
Or perhaps he might have sold
his identity card

433
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:37,000
to some illegal buyers.

434
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,121
I'm sorry

435
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,321
for making you come here for nothing.

436
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,480
Sunrise.

437
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,000
Stop the car.

438
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:25,200
- Stop the car.
- Okay.

439
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,140
♪Departure, drunkenness, regrets♪

440
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,100
♪Time never freezes for anyone♪

441
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:37,760
Here.

442
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:41,720
Majestic.

443
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,500
♪Flying like you know how it's done♪

444
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,121
It's been a while

445
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:50,561
since I last saw a beautiful sunrise.

446
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,121
Of course. You always sleep

447
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:54,321
until noon.

448
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:56,520
You're ruining the mood.

449
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,660
♪Wrong, right, remorse♪

450
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,280
What do you two want to do
once you're back in Baihe?

451
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:04,081
Me?

452
00:24:04,081 --> 00:24:05,760
I'll lie down.

453
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,680
It's a serious question.

454
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:11,401
I want to be happy.

455
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:12,920
And you, Yan?

456
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:15,641
I want to have a trouble-free year.

457
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,401
What is this? Chinese New Year wishes?

458
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,240
What about you, Daqian?

459
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,801
I got back what was lost.

460
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:28,480
Long live the friendship!

461
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:30,240
I don't want to do anything.

462
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,041
I just want to lie down and eat.

463
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:34,361
Lie down

464
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:34,641
then?

465
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:35,801
Just like my wish.

466
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:37,601
Mine is superior to yours.

467
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:58,801
What movie is this?

468
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:00,720
They keep arguing.

469
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,960
Just break up already.

470
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:05,000
And what do you know?

471
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,601
This is what I call
a romantic love story.

472
00:25:13,081 --> 00:25:14,401
If you want to eat it, cook it yourself.

473
00:25:14,401 --> 00:25:15,601
This is already not enough for me.

474
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:19,841
Tell me.

475
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:22,401
What do you plan to do with Yan?

476
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,161
What do you think of him?

477
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,641
He's nice.

478
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,321
He's

479
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,321
decently good-looking.

480
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:31,960
He has a good educational background
and a good job.

481
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,480
Although he can't be filthy rich,

482
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,680
he won't starve either.

483
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,280
In the matchmaking market,

484
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,000
he will be in high demand.

485
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Look at you

486
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,000
and your analysis.

487
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:45,881
What is this?

488
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,240
Mating criteria?

489
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,321
What do you mean?

490
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:51,520
The mate choice of an animal

491
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,881
is often risk-averse.

492
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:54,161
It's calculated.

493
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:56,520
I'm too old to get smitten.

494
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,960
But that is the nature of love.

495
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,920
Love is abstract.

496
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,280
Only by setting practical criteria

497
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,680
that you can know
what you truly want.

498
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,240
Zheng Daqian, tell me then.

499
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:09,440
You're a practical person.

500
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,121
Why did you run away from home
after a bad breakup?

501
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,641
Mind your own business.

502
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,920
If you can stop being

503
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,801
a hopeless romantic,

504
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:18,081
maybe you won't have to be a single man
who lives with his parents.

505
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:20,000
I am single by choice.

506
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,401
But you can't toy
with someone's feelings.

507
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:22,561
Whose feelings did I toy with?

508
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:24,041
Your mom said Junze
is your backup plan.

509
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,520
Then you're a playboy.

510
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,801
No way. I'm a responsible man.

511
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:31,121
The hell you are.

512
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:33,240
You can only be responsible
for washing the dishes.

513
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,361
You didn't come back last night.

514
00:26:49,361 --> 00:26:50,280
Where did you go?

515
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,480
I went to Tieyuan

516
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,841
with Daqian and Lizi for something.

517
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,361
We were in a hurry

518
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:56,361
and we forgot to tell you.

519
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,361
You lot

520
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:02,000
grew up together.

521
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,041
When you're all grown up,

522
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
you went separate ways.

523
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,000
But in the end,

524
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,280
all of you came back together.

525
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,561
The sentiments
from the previous generation

526
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:17,801
flow within you again.

527
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,041
I find it reassuring.

528
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,121
Mom.

529
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:31,000
It will get better.

530
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,440
It will.

531
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,200
Why does Zheng Daqian

532
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:54,000
have to cross me every day?

533
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,980
(I want to be rich in the future.)

534
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:21,440
She and I...

535
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,720
Zixi.

536
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,720
What was my relationship
with Zheng Daqian

537
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,200
in high school?

538
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,720
Just classmates.

539
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:35,361
Why did I take a photo of her
in secret then?

540
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:37,161
Classmates?

541
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:41,561
You confessed to her
and you were rejected.

542
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:42,401
Did you forget?

543
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,680
I

544
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,401
confessed to Zheng Daqian

545
00:28:45,401 --> 00:28:46,280
and was rejected?

546
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,920
Yes.

547
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,960
What are you talking about?

548
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
I couldn't have possibly done that.

549
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:53,760
Daqian might be dumb

550
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,081
but she is shrewd.

551
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,480
She knows who's good and who's not.

552
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,480
She knows some people are unreliable.

553
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,561
Nonsense.

554
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,041
You're just making fun of me
because I'm amnesiac.

555
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,440
Suit yourself then.

556
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:07,000
Goodnight.

557
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:17,161
Impossible.

558
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,460
(I want to be rich in the future.)

559
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,520
Something's wrong with this photo.

560
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:32,401
Zixi.

561
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,200
Zixi.

562
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,240
A decent sketch.

563
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,361
Why does she look so familiar?

564
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:17,520
Who said you could go through my things?

565
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,401
Zixi.

566
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,760
I'm sorry.

567
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,760
I'll buy you a new one, okay?

568
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,200
It's just a toy.

569
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:05,641
It's already broken.

570
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,440
Stop throwing tantrums. Eat now.

571
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:11,361
Lizi.

572
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,561
Help me take care of the studio
for few hours later.

573
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:14,760
Okay.

574
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:18,881
Do you have enough pocket money?

575
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,200
Not enough.

576
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:23,240
Enough is enough.

577
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,280
The doctor said he's cured.

578
00:32:28,561 --> 00:32:30,401
How much longer
do you want to pamper him?

579
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:33,760
He's jobless and is leeching

580
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:35,240
off you two.

581
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,801
Do you want him to stay here forever?

582
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:38,561
This is his home.

583
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:41,000
He can stay here forever.

584
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:45,480
Zixi.

585
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:48,361
You misunderstood your brother.

586
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:49,881
I did not.

587
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,200
If you want to indulge in his idling,

588
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,000
be my guest.

589
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:01,641
I'll apply to stay at the dorm.

590
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:17,960
Zixi.

591
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:20,680
You're still mad about the Iron Man?

592
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:27,280
I didn't do it on purpose.

593
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:28,280
Besides,

594
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:30,041
it's as if I broke
all the bad luck for you.

595
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:34,361
That's my birthday present
when I was ten years old.

596
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:37,081
Dad made it with me.

597
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,601
Your amnesia stunt

598
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,960
might work on our parents

599
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:49,720
but not on me.

600
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:53,480
You never regard
this place as your home.

601
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,561
Now that you failed out there,
you came back to leech off them.

602
00:33:57,881 --> 00:33:59,081
Dad and mom are fine with it.

603
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:00,641
I'm not.

604
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,921
You didn't hear that?

605
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:20,320
The brothers fought.

606
00:34:21,121 --> 00:34:22,880
Zixi said he would stay at the dorm now.

607
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,641
I guess after all,

608
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:27,041
we did cause their family to fall apart.

609
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:29,481
It's not our fault.

610
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,200
No two roosters

611
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
can stay in the same coop.

612
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,481
That's because we came

613
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:35,521
and we occupied their place

614
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:37,800
and they had to share a room.

615
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,240
Ask Mr. Liu

616
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,400
to fix the boiler now.

617
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,880
It's been so long.

618
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,680
You're paying him

619
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:46,121
little by little.

620
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:47,320
Of course,
he's not going to prioritize it.

621
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,521
Little by little, you said?

622
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:51,680
Why don't you transfer him
the money yourself?

623
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,001
Mom.

624
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,840
When can we go home?

625
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,961
Mu Zili has had enough of me already.

626
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,001
So am I.

627
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:01,001
Stop complaining.

628
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,961
Mom.

629
00:35:07,081 --> 00:35:08,601
Send me some money too.

630
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:10,081
I want to go shopping.

631
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:11,680
When I'm gone, you won't have
to put up with me.

632
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,961
I want to slap you.

633
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:16,441
Be frugal.

634
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,400
What did I do in my last life?

635
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,041
Where are you going?

636
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,200
Shopping without you.

637
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:30,121
Can you buy me something?

638
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:31,360
Grab me my jacket.

639
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:33,481
Grab it yourself.

640
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,880
Give me the money then.

641
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,860
(Railway, Stop)

642
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,680
Daqian.

643
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,481
How are you, Daqian?

644
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
I'm good.

645
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,041
You heard I ran away from home,
didn't you?

646
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:53,161
It's just a rumor. I'm fine.

647
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:54,521
When I'm back here

648
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:55,680
I don't have to worry about anything.

649
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,441
I feel amazing.

650
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:00,840
I'm glad to have run into you
the moment I came back.

651
00:37:03,441 --> 00:37:04,800
Likewise.

652
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:07,360
You just arrived? You haven't gone home?

653
00:37:07,481 --> 00:37:08,400
I have

654
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,720
but I argued with my father again.

655
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,760
So I left.

656
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:13,760
Mr. Mi loves you so much.

657
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:15,601
I can't imagine him chastising you.

658
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,601
My dad and I have always been like this.

659
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:20,041
Have you forgotten?

660
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:22,400
Whenever I argued with him,
I would seek refuge in your home.

661
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:25,521
Right.

662
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:28,001
Where do you plan to stay now?

663
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:32,081
I'll find a hotel. I'll be fine.

664
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,240
Mi Lan.

665
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,760
How have you been?

666
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,001
Where do you work?

667
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,800
I sell stuff all over the country.

668
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:42,720
I can feed myself. Don't worry.

669
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,320
You're single?

670
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:45,921
Yes, I am.

671
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:47,720
My circle isn't huge

672
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,680
and I don't have a lot of friends.

673
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,641
What marriage?

674
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,041
I like being single. I'm used to it.

675
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,481
Hurry up, you two.

676
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,441
Break up if it doesn't work then.

677
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:02,521
I can introduce you to other men.

678
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:03,360
My husband

679
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,720
has a few cute male friends.

680
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,001
They are all successful.

681
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,400
What's the matter, Daqian?

682
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,601
Nothing.

683
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,840
Mi Lan.

684
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,561
I just realized I have something to do.

685
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:16,921
I have to go.

686
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:17,840
See you later.

687
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,200
- Go ahead.
- Bye.

688
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,840
Bye.

689
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,660
(Station: Baihe No. 1 Middle School)

690
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:16,041
Where are you going?

691
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,161
Help me sweep it.

692
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:50,660
(H.X Photo Studio)

693
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,001
Mi Lan, have a seat.

694
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,840
I ran into Mi Lan
in the photo studio today.

695
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,240
She came back?

696
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:00,760
What a coincidence.

697
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,161
All the kids are reunited.

698
00:41:03,481 --> 00:41:04,400
When they were young,

699
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,921
we hoped they would leave
the house soon.

700
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,041
Now, we can only hope that
we can take a few more glimpses of them.

701
00:41:08,121 --> 00:41:09,880
We were idiots.

702
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,240
We should have kept them around forever.

703
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,161
Right?

704
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:16,961
Let me tell you something.

705
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:17,641
What?

706
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,840
I heard

707
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:23,240
Mr. Mi and Ms. Liu from their school

708
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,041
have been married for a few years.

709
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,760
They told no one.

710
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,041
Mr. Mi and Ms. Liu are married?

711
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,601
For a few years?

712
00:41:34,481 --> 00:41:35,601
A secret marriage?

713
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:38,240
What a surprise.

714
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:40,161
Daqian.

715
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,601
Do you know Mi Lan's father remarried?

716
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,641
No, I don't.

717
00:41:44,521 --> 00:41:46,840
He married your chemistry teacher,
Ms. Liu.

718
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,161
They are together?

719
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:48,840
Yes.

720
00:41:49,121 --> 00:41:50,641
- Daqian.
- You know nothing.

721
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,360
Invite Mi Lan back home.

722
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,001
Everyone can dine together.

723
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:55,360
All of you

724
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,921
used to hang out together all the time.

725
00:41:56,921 --> 00:41:59,320
Aunt Hui, our family already
imposed ourselves on you.

726
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,280
I can't possibly bring friends over.

727
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,601
Come on.

728
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:03,760
Your family

729
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,001
is no stranger.

730
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:08,840
Truth be told,

731
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:11,121
I feel sorry for Mi Lan.

732
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,720
It's not easy for Mr. Mi

733
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,041
to raise a daughter as a single father.

734
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:18,121
He can't possibly understand
his daughter well.

735
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:21,280
I heard they always argue.

736
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,041
And Mi Lan
couldn't get into a university.

737
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,641
She didn't go to a university?

738
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:27,240
You forgot that too?

739
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:28,720
What's wrong with you?

740
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:29,641
Right.

741
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:31,561
God knows what's on her mind.

742
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,481
Xiaoqin.

743
00:42:34,961 --> 00:42:36,441
You're having chilblains again.

744
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:37,200
I'm fine.

745
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,760
I have them every winter.

746
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,081
Nothing can cure it.

747
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,521
