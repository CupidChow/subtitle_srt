(Become A Brand New Person)

15
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,102
Daqian.

16
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:12,182
Why do you call us here?

17
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,262
Since we're all at Baihe,

18
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:15,582
it's so nice to get together.

19
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:16,862
We should have such gatherings

20
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:17,862
on a weekly basis.

21
00:02:19,862 --> 00:02:21,462
Do you mean to gather at my house
every week?

22
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,781
Because you have a big house.

23
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:30,501
I'll get the door.

24
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:34,501
Pass me the sunflower seeds.

25
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:35,541
Can't you take it yourself?

26
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,661
It's for your own good.

27
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:39,422
You need more exercise.

28
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:42,221
Thank you.

29
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:44,501
Look who's here.

30
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,061
Welcome...

31
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:50,341
Daqian.

32
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:52,142
Mi Lan, what brings you here?

33
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:53,422
Hello.

34
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:54,182
Hi, Lizi.

35
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:58,262
I ran into her outside just now.

36
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,781
How fortuitous. Right?

37
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:01,422
Since it's a school reunion,

38
00:03:01,422 --> 00:03:03,541
we must invite Mi Lan too.

39
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:04,982
This is fated.

40
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:06,381
Welcome.

41
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:07,862
Have a seat. Welcome.

42
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:08,541
Let's sit.

43
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,142
Sure.

44
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:10,101
Please sit.

45
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,702
Come on. Let's drink.

46
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,182
It's for you, Mi Lan.

47
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:32,781
Sure.

48
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:33,462
Dazhi.

49
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:39,541
What's the purpose of this gathering?

50
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,262
The purpose of today's gathering

51
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,101
is to help Mu Zili
to get back his memory.

52
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:45,982
I don't know about this though.

53
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:46,742
Quiet.

54
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,541
Let's talk about
what you think of each other.

55
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,462
Perhaps this might help
with Lizi's memory loss.

56
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,661
Alright.

57
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:54,702
Let's start with me.

58
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:55,902
Good. Start now.

59
00:03:58,262 --> 00:03:59,101
Zheng Daqian.

60
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:00,101
Speaking of you,

61
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,781
you have a devil-may-care attitude.

62
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:03,422
You're too bold now.

63
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,781
Previously, you even shivered
when you sat in the front seat.

64
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:08,262
You were so timid.

65
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:09,582
Look at you now.

66
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,061
You could even drive the car
to Tieyuan alone.

67
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,941
If it wasn't for me,

68
00:04:14,582 --> 00:04:16,142
you wouldn't have sat here in one piece.

69
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:20,381
What do you think of me, Yan?

70
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:21,781
I think you're more

71
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:23,421
courageous,

72
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:25,462
and persistent.

73
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:27,822
You talk more now.

74
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,062
However,

75
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:31,981
you're not as gentle as before.

76
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:41,301
I think

77
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,181
I can sense a distance between us

78
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:44,981
when we meet this time.

79
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,702
Back then,

80
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:50,262
we used to spend the night
at each other's place,

81
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:52,181
and we shared

82
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:53,741
a lot of secrets.

83
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:55,942
That's it.

84
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,702
What about you, Lizi?

85
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:04,421
You're just the same as before.

86
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:06,221
Don't you always behave like this?

87
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:10,942
Alright. I got it.

88
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:14,781
I have caused so much trouble to you all

89
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,582
since I came back to Baihe.

90
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,181
Therefore, I'm going
to turn over a new leaf.

91
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,142
From tomorrow on,

92
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:21,661
I'll become a brand new person.

93
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,421
No matter what I've done,

94
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:25,221
I'm always your Zheng Daqian.

95
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:28,981
Come on. Let's have a toast.

96
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:36,101
Cheers.

97
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,181
Drink slowly.

98
00:05:42,382 --> 00:05:43,181
This session has ended.

99
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,382
Now, let's proceed to the next session.

100
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,301
I haven't learnt much
about the three of them.

101
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:48,741
You can't digest so much information
at once.

102
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:49,421
I...

103
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:50,861
To celebrate the reunion

104
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:51,822
of Team Baihe here,

105
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:53,902
I suggest that we take a group photo.

106
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:55,101
Lizi, go get the camera.

107
00:05:55,582 --> 00:05:56,822
Objection.

108
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:04,702
Faster, Mu Zili.

109
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:09,221
Quick.

110
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:13,541
Three, two, one.

111
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,741
Team Baihe.

112
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,142
- Go!
- Go!

113
00:06:23,502 --> 00:06:24,142
It's nippy out here.

114
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:25,541
Go in. No need to see us off.

115
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:26,661
Glad to hear that.

116
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,142
I'm not going to see you off then. Bye.

117
00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:30,942
You two send Mi Lan
back to the hotel safely.

118
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:33,022
No worries. I'll take care of her.

119
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:34,582
Good. I'll go inside then.

120
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,341
Be careful.

121
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:36,062
Bye-bye.

122
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:42,661
Mi Zili, open the door.

123
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:44,822
Aunt Hui, why are you so late?

124
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:46,942
I got held up at the photo studio.

125
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:48,262
Are you leaving now?

126
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:49,942
Why are you carrying luggage?

127
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:52,062
I'm going to send Mi Lan to the hotel.

128
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:53,462
Why don't you go home?

129
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:55,781
She fought with Mr. Mi again.

130
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:57,661
You can stay at my home.

131
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:58,902
Don't go to the hotel.

132
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:00,541
No, I'll bother you.

133
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:01,622
I can just stay at the hotel.

134
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:02,622
Not at all.

135
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,861
You can sleep with me.

136
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:05,262
Since Aunt Hui has invited you,

137
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:06,582
we welcome you.

138
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:07,702
Right, we welcome you.

139
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:11,101
All of us welcome you.

140
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:12,822
Open the door.

141
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:23,622
Mi Lan.

142
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:24,902
Mi Lan.

143
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:25,902
Come here.

144
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:27,421
Come here.

145
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:29,741
Look at this.

146
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:32,142
Mu Zili looked like a crookneck pumpkin
when he was a baby.

147
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:33,221
So ugly.

148
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:36,262
Normally, ugly babies grow up

149
00:07:36,262 --> 00:07:37,661
looking beautiful.

150
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:39,142
He's an exception.

151
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:45,822
We even had bob cut together.

152
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:47,781
Yes. Don't you remember this?

153
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:50,462
Why did we get bob cut?

154
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:53,062
Good morning.

155
00:07:53,062 --> 00:07:53,661
Sure.

156
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:54,781
Good morning.

157
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:55,902
Good morning.

158
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:56,582
Good morning.

159
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:58,142
Dad.

160
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:00,942
Good morning, Mr. Mi.

161
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:04,702
I've asked you to cut your hair short.

162
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:06,341
Why haven't you done it yet?

163
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:09,022
All of us have long hair.

164
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,221
Long hair looks prettier.

165
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:12,181
You're a student
and you should behave like one.

166
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:14,582
Just do what I said.

167
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:16,741
Mr. Mi.

168
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:19,062
Please allow Mi Lan to have long hair.

169
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:21,101
Her study won't be affected.

170

Go now.

I don't want to.

172

Come with me.

173
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:26,902
Cut your hair now.

I don't want to. Let go of me.

Hurry up. You must go.

You're back. Mi Lan.

178

Mi Lan.

179
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:44,701
Actually, you look beautiful
with short hair.

180
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:46,862
Mi Lan.

181
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:04,781
Why are we coming here?

182
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:05,661
Sit down.

183
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:08,102
Sit here and wait for me.

184
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:16,262
Madam, I want a haircut, please.

185
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:28,781
Good. It's done.

186
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:29,262
Thank you.

187
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:29,941
You're welcome.

188

What are you doing?

189
00:09:39,102 --> 00:09:40,701
I want the same hairstyle as you.

190
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:47,102
It turns out there is a touching story

191
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:48,661
behind this bob cut.

192
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:52,982
Therefore, I swore to myself

193
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:54,022
that I want to be

Where's your mum? How's she?

199
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:11,102
My mum passed away

200
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:12,181
when I was in grade six.

201
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:13,821
Did you forget about this too?

202
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:19,061
I remember it now.

This is a new pair of pajamas.

206
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:31,222
You can wear it.

207
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,222
I'm fine with old pajamas.

208
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:36,502
Since you're home,
you should wear new pajamas.

Don't stay up late

for your girl talks.

212
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,222
Otherwise, you'll wake up with
panda eyes tomorrow.

213

You can continue tomorrow.

Sure.

Good night, Aunt Hui.

Good night.

217

I'm so happy to meet you all

218
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:05,502
after I come back.

219
00:11:05,862 --> 00:11:07,661
You can stay here then.

220
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:13,222
I'm going back home tomorrow.

221
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:15,581
Are you not worried
that you'll fight with Mr. Mi?

222
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,502
I've come back now.

223
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:20,581
It's not appropriate if I stay outside.

224

Please help me
to tell Aunt Hui tomorrow.

225
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:26,142
Well.

226
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:29,742
If so, we're going to talk all night.

227

Sure.

228
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:33,342
Tell me more about

229

our funny stories.

230
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:52,421
I bought a new one for you.

and worrying about family affairs.

236

You have no time to cherish yourself.

Don't waste it on me.

238

Not at all.

239

I can't take this.

Take it.

Listen, you just take it.

I don't want it.
You know me well, right?

244

No need to feel bad.

Wait. This is such a good thing.

You should use it yourself.

248

Women must cherish
and care about themself.

249

Let me smell it.

Feeling dewy, right?

This is the feeling of being rich.

You're lucky.

254

I'm jealous of you.

255

Did Mu give you this?

Yes.

Is it nice?

What are you referring to?

Everything.

268

You didn't even lay your eyes on me.

269

This is Huixian's
birthday present from Mu.

270

Look at you.

271
00:14:34,142 --> 00:14:35,941
You only gave me a bouquet of roses
before we got married.

272
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,581
What have you given me after that?

273
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:39,461
It's so heavy wearing it.

274

Also, it's disturbing

while you work.

I always feel

277

that my hands are bare.

278

Without any jewelry on them.

If you want some jewelry,

get something red.

281

Red color brings luck. It'll rise.

What's wrong with you?

Go home now.

What a terrible mood swing.

It's late now.

Can I invite Mi Lan
to stay at our house?

298

Okay. As long as she's willing to come.

Fix your hair.

Be quick.

Why are you so grumpy since morning?

00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,142
You can stay here longer.

338
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:19,221
That's right.

339
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:22,461
How fun when the kids are here together.

340
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:25,021
We're going to move in here
if we're not leaving.

341
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,382
We'll bother you.

342
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:29,501
Where's Yingjun?

343
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,062
I asked him to go home
and heat the boiler.

344
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:32,981
What's the hurry?

345
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:40,741
Whose house is on fire?

346
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:51,782
Xiaoqin. Gong Xiaoqin.

347
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:54,021
Xiaoqin.

348
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:55,062
Your house!

349
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:56,902
Gong Xiaoqin. Something has happened
to your house.

350
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:58,102
Something has happened?

351
00:18:58,302 --> 00:18:59,142
What's it?

352
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:00,542
What has happened?

353
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:02,542
Your house is on fire.
Go back and check it now.

354
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:05,582
Hold on. Wear your jacket.

355
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,542
The fire is serious

356
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,102
and firefighters have arrived
at the scene.

357
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:17,021
Get out of my way.

358
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:18,261
- Get out of my way. This is my house.
- Shoot this.

359
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:19,741
Get out of my way.

360
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:20,941
Get the devices ready

361
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:21,981
and proceed.

362
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:24,542
- Don't come near here.
- Don't pull me. It's my house.

363
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:25,142
This is my house.

364
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:26,941
Smoke came out of that window.
Enter the scene now.

365
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:28,941
Don't stop me. My dad is inside.

366
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:30,582
Back off.

367
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:31,221
- No.
- Zheng Yingjun.

368
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:32,902
- It's dangerous.
- My dad is inside there.

369
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:34,501
- Mum.
- Zheng Yingjun is inside.

370
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:35,181
It's Uncle Yingjun.

371
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:36,981
- Don't pull me. I can run fast.
- Zheng Yingjun.

372
00:19:36,981 --> 00:19:38,501
- Zheng Yingjun.
- Uncle Yingjun is here.

373
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:40,342
- Come out.
- Hey, Uncle Yingjun.

374
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:41,542
He's here.

375
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,142
Faster.

376
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:47,741
- What has happened?
- Go upstairs.

377
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:50,102
Where did you go?

378
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:55,342
Good. Let's watch

379
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:57,941
the drawing process of the lottery ball.

380
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:00,741
The first red ball is out.

381
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:03,542
The first red ball of this episode is

382
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:05,261
number twenty-nine.

383
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:06,902
Number twenty-nine.

384
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:09,782
Fifteen.

385
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:11,302
The second red ball is

386
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,461
number fifteen.

387
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:14,102
Number fifteen.

388
00:20:14,142 --> 00:20:15,902
The third red ball is

389
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:17,981
number twenty.

390
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,941
- The fourth red ball...
- Sixteen.

391
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,461
Number sixteen.

392
00:20:22,102 --> 00:20:23,181
Number sixteen.

393
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:24,181
Twenty-seven.

394
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,622
The fifth red ball is

395
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:27,782
number twenty-seven.

396
00:20:28,221 --> 00:20:29,622
- Number twenty-seven.
- Seven.

397
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:31,302
Seven, please.

398
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:32,461
It's seven!

399
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:34,941
Good. The sixth red ball goes to

400
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:37,142
number seven.

401
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:43,822
A residence in Baihe caught fire

402
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:45,902
due to the ignored stove.

403
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:47,461
Luckily, the owner went out
to redeem the lottery

404
00:20:47,461 --> 00:20:48,102
in the welfare lottery centre
and managed to survive the fire.

405
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:49,582
Right behind me is the family
of the burning house.

406
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:52,941
Stop beating him.

407
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:53,542
Mum.

408
00:20:53,622 --> 00:20:54,902
What have you done at home?

409
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:55,661
Mum.

410
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:56,902
Let go of me.

411
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:57,782
- Xiaoqin.
- Mum.

412
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:01,461
Enough.

413
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:05,302
Xianqin.

414
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:08,142
Luckily, he's fine.

415
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:10,382
Indeed, he's lucky.

416
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,822
But I'm so ill-fated.

417
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:15,622
Why would I marry such a man?

418
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,661
Don't say that.

419
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:18,941
Isn't it an accident?

420
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:20,661
No one could've expected this to happen.

421
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:22,382
You called it an accident?

422
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:23,661
You can smell alcohol

423
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:25,981
on him now.

424
00:21:26,342 --> 00:21:27,261
Why did you

425
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:28,661
go out to redeem the lottery

426
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:30,622
after you turned on the stove?

427
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:32,021
The prize is merely worth
less than 250 yuan.

428
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:34,542
Yet my double-storey house

429
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:37,501
burned down.

430
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:41,741
Stop crying.

431
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:43,102
You know what?

432
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:45,981
He only cares about drinking

433
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:47,582
and is not clear-headed every day.

434
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:49,142
You don't work a proper job

435
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:51,021
and wager your money on games.

436
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:53,302
Why don't you go to jail instead?

437
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:54,021
Enough.

438
00:21:57,261 --> 00:21:58,342
Enough said.

439
00:22:00,342 --> 00:22:02,142
If I didn't go out to redeem the prize,

440
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:04,501
I'd have turned into ashes

441
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:05,862
and reposed in a cremation urn now.

442
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:07,902
Stop nagging.

443
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:10,661
Are you afraid of being revealed?

444
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:11,701
Good for you now.

445
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:13,181
You and your family are now famous

446
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:14,461
in Baihe town.

447
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:16,981
Dad, you're such a sluggard.

448
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:18,062
Serve you right.

449
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:20,062
You're no better than him.

450
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:23,461
The two of you are
such a nuisance to me.

451
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:24,741
Tell me.

452
00:22:24,822 --> 00:22:26,862
Why is the layabout gene
from Zheng Yingjun

453
00:22:26,902 --> 00:22:29,461
so powerful?

454
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:32,221
Gong Xiaoqin, enough already.

455
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:33,062
You better stop now.

456
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:33,782
Why?

457
00:22:33,862 --> 00:22:34,902
You tore me off a strip

458
00:22:34,902 --> 00:22:36,342
in front of them

459
00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:37,342
which I accepted.

460
00:22:37,582 --> 00:22:39,142
But why did you pick on her too?

461
00:22:39,142 --> 00:22:41,542
You said that she takes after me
instead you.

462
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:43,622
Why? Are you not her mother?

463
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:44,941
She believed in the wrong man.
She takes that after me.

464
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,021
- Look at him.
- Xiaoqin.

465
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:49,941
Is it sensible for a fifty-year-old man

466
00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:52,582
jumping up and down like a monkey?

467
00:22:52,582 --> 00:22:54,221
If you were me, can you tolerate him?

468
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:56,021
You must've gone to Shenzhen.

469
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:57,902
Since we can't carry on
life together, let's get a divorce.

470
00:22:58,302 --> 00:22:59,501
Let's get a divorce.

471
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:00,142
Mu.

472
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:01,782
Bring me your Royal Salute brew.

473
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:02,701
- Right now.
- Calm down.

474
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:04,062
Let's celebrate this moment.

475
00:23:04,062 --> 00:23:05,542
Dad, stop talking already.

476
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:07,782
You all have heard what he said.

477
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:10,661
Don't leave. Don't go until
we're done with the divorce.

478
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:11,261
Dad.

479
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:12,382
Mum.

480
00:23:12,622 --> 00:23:14,302
- Mum.
- Stop spouting nonsense.

481
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:16,302
You've bent Xiaoqin out of shape.

482
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:18,661
Did she really go?

483
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:23,261
Where are you going, mum?

484
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:24,021
Leave me alone.

485
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:25,221
Even if Zheng Yingjun is a sluggard,

486
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:26,701
he's still your husband, right?

487
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:28,981
Please don't leave.

488
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:31,302
I was thinking

489
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:33,701
to hold in my emotion

490
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:34,902
and act nice in front of you

491
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:35,862
since you've come back home.

492
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:37,701
I don't want you

493
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:38,981
to think that I always

494
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:40,701
disapprove of your dad and despise him.

495
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:41,661
I hate to sadden you.

496
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:42,741
But look at him.

497
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:44,021
There, there.

498
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:45,701
Calm down, mum.

499
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:47,622
You know him well.

500
00:23:47,622 --> 00:23:49,302
He does care about you.

501
00:23:49,782 --> 00:23:51,261
It's just that he likes
to run his mouth.

502
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:53,221
Look at your useless dad.

503
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:55,542
Unemployed and weak.

504
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:57,302
He never behaves well and muddles along.

505
00:23:57,741 --> 00:23:58,741
He's a hopeless man

506
00:23:58,741 --> 00:23:59,981
who can't stand on his own feet.

507
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,622
He should be sensible at this age.

508
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:04,741
But he always ignores

509
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,461
others' sincerity and
his responsibility.

510
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:09,062
He only cares about drinking

511
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:10,542
and himself.

512
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:15,622
I'm telling you,

513
00:24:17,862 --> 00:24:18,862
my feelings for him

514
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:21,902
isn't sad,

515
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:24,622
but disappointment.

516
00:24:26,302 --> 00:24:27,542
Disappointment

517
00:24:27,622 --> 00:24:28,382
that has been accumulated for decades.

518
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:30,822
Fine. You go back now.

519
00:24:30,822 --> 00:24:31,741
You don't understand this, anyway.

520
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:33,941
Where are you going?

521
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:34,701
I have night shift.

522
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:33,542
Take action if you care about her.

523
00:25:36,382 --> 00:25:37,941
You've taken me wrong, dad.

524
00:25:41,302 --> 00:25:43,021
This is the new product
from the factory.

525
00:25:43,062 --> 00:25:44,021
Do you want to try it?

526
00:25:44,782 --> 00:25:45,981
I've grown up now.
I'm not playing this anymore...

527
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:48,261
Even so, you're still my son.

528
00:25:53,782 --> 00:25:54,741
My son.

529
00:26:24,902 --> 00:26:25,822
My dad gave me this.

530
00:26:26,582 --> 00:26:27,221
Do you want to try it?

531
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:30,701
I don't feel like playing it.

532
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:39,302
Uncle Zheng and Aunt Qin

533
00:26:39,302 --> 00:26:41,302
were just having a small fight.

534
00:26:41,941 --> 00:26:43,102
They won't divorce.

535
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,941
Is it fated?

536
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:48,501
No one can alter

537
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:50,261
their destiny.

538
00:26:51,062 --> 00:26:51,822
Yes.

539
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:53,542
It's destiny

540
00:26:54,021 --> 00:26:55,582
that led us back to Baihe.

541
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:56,221
I

542
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:57,501
failed to start up my business.

543
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:57,941
While you

544
00:26:58,302 --> 00:26:59,261
failed in your love relationship.

545
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:02,181
Are we the losers league?

546
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,102
Failure

547
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:06,461
isn't just bad at times.

548
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:08,342
We can start everything anew.

549
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:09,902
Just take Zixi and me as an example.

550
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:12,461
We made up

551
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:14,021
after I bought him a new Iron Man.

552
00:27:15,221 --> 00:27:16,582
But there are many things

553
00:27:17,142 --> 00:27:18,782
that can't be changed.

554
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:22,701
So, since we've returned to Baihe,

555
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:24,421
we need to make some changes.

556
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,342
You're the variable.

557
00:27:57,941 --> 00:27:59,461
So, I'm going to
become a brand new person

558
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:00,701
from tomorrow onwards.

559
00:28:00,741 --> 00:28:01,701
From tomorrow on,

560
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:03,181
I'll become a brand new person.

561

563
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:09,701
I want to be the variable.

00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,740
♪Time never freezes for anyone♪

567
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:27,902
Is my dad here?

568
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:35,701
Why are you drinking again?

569
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:36,622
Don't you care about your health?

570
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,542
I feel tightness in my chest.

571
00:28:42,981 --> 00:28:44,501
I drink to relieve the pain.

572
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:46,021
Zheng Daqian, listen up.

573
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:48,302
I can put up with all your mum's flaws

574
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:49,622
except for her wit.

575
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:52,062
She's so mean

576
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:53,862
and hurts others with her words.

577
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:55,342
I'm more likely to end up
being pissed off by her

578
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:56,501
than dying in the fire.

579
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:57,382
What do you want then?

580
00:28:58,221 --> 00:28:59,342
Do you really want a divorce?

581
00:29:03,862 --> 00:29:04,582
Dad, listen.

582
00:29:04,622 --> 00:29:05,542
If this keeps on going,

583
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:06,902
not only will you divorce,

584
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:08,941
but you will never
meet each other again.

585
00:29:11,302 --> 00:29:12,622
Are you really here to console me?

586
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:18,782
Why did you talk about divorce instead?

587
00:29:18,862 --> 00:29:20,701
It's just a small quarrel.

588
00:29:20,782 --> 00:29:22,461
We won't divorce.

589
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:23,102
Besides,

590
00:29:23,102 --> 00:29:24,741
we still have you between us.

591
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:28,822
Let me ask you this.

592
00:29:29,261 --> 00:29:31,142
If Gong Xiaoqin wants to divorce you,

593
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:32,661
do you know what her reason is?

594
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:33,661
I can tell that easily.

595
00:29:34,142 --> 00:29:34,941
Because she despises me

596
00:29:36,582 --> 00:29:37,782
for being useless

597
00:29:37,822 --> 00:29:38,902
and earning little money.

598
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:40,062
I can't offer a good life to her

599
00:29:40,102 --> 00:29:41,221
and you.

600
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:43,822
No. Because you neglect her.

601
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:47,062
Think about when you were young
back then.

602
00:29:47,142 --> 00:29:48,941
You would share everything with her.

603
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:51,181
You tended to share delicious food

604
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:53,902
and fun stuff with her eagerly

605
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:55,542
back then.

606
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:58,941
You're right.

607
00:30:00,862 --> 00:30:02,622
When we just got married,

608
00:30:02,782 --> 00:30:03,862
I rushed hotfoot

609
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:06,062
to Harbin with your mother

610
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:07,661
on the day when I heard of

611
00:30:07,701 --> 00:30:08,782
the Russian-style wedding photoshoot

612
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:10,221
that was popular in Harbin.

613
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:13,542
Mum told me

614
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:15,941
that both of you got together
because of love

615
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:17,941
which's a romantic memory.

616
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:20,862
However, as time goes by,

617
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,021
you started to ignore

618
00:30:22,302 --> 00:30:24,542
what she wears,

619
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:26,302
talks and thinks.

620
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:28,542
At first,

621
00:30:28,582 --> 00:30:31,142
she felt the cold when you were eating,

622
00:30:31,981 --> 00:30:34,142
from the daily life

623
00:30:34,142 --> 00:30:35,142
and then
when you're sleeping on the same bed.

624
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:36,941
Lastly, the heart cooled off.

625
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,421
When a couple has no common topic

626
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,981
or things to share,

627
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,822
it means their marriage
has come to an end.

628
00:30:44,421 --> 00:30:45,902
Is this what she said?

629
00:30:47,661 --> 00:30:49,701
It's Gong Xiaoqin
from another universe.

630
00:30:49,902 --> 00:30:51,181
I'm serious about this.

631
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,221
The front part is said by her,

632
00:30:53,622 --> 00:30:56,221
while the second part is by me.

633
00:30:57,501 --> 00:30:59,741
I knew it was you talking nonsense.

634
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:05,342
I knew it wasn't your mum

635
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:06,822
when you said something
like hearts cooling off.

636
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:11,822
Speaking of which,

637
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:14,701
I can feel some changes

638
00:31:15,021 --> 00:31:16,221
about us.

639
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:19,021
Our relationship has changed too.

640
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:20,741
We're getting

641
00:31:22,582 --> 00:31:23,661
closer

642
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,741
yet farther.

643
00:31:27,021 --> 00:31:29,302
It's peaceful if we don't talk.

644
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,582
However, things got messed up
whenever we talk.

645
00:31:33,582 --> 00:31:34,741
The marriage life is just...

646
00:31:42,382 --> 00:31:43,221
What's the date today?

647
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:47,822
How could I forget
such an important thing?

648
00:31:48,382 --> 00:31:49,342
What's it?

649
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:27,421
What's this?

650
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:33,782

00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:28,741

Come to the window.

Mum, eat the noodles.

670
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:03,101
It's not midnight yet.

671
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:04,902
Let's eat the cake
after you finish the noodles.

672
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:06,262
Dad bought you this cake.

673
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:08,222
I'm not going to eat at this late hour.

674
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:10,141
Taste it. I cooked it for you.

675
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:26,382
After your granny has passed away,

676
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:29,382
I've almost forgotten my birthday.

677
00:35:32,141 --> 00:35:33,662
I'll celebrate your birthday with you
every year.

678
00:35:37,822 --> 00:35:38,461
Mum.

679
00:35:40,262 --> 00:35:42,382
Dad and I have let you down.

680
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:45,742
We're sorry.

681
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:49,941
But, I can tell

682
00:35:50,902 --> 00:35:51,941
that you still love me,

683
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:53,302
him,

684
00:35:53,822 --> 00:35:55,782
and our family.

685
00:35:58,262 --> 00:36:00,222
Dad and I still have a chance,

686
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:01,662
right?

687
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:04,021
We're one family.

688
00:36:04,302 --> 00:36:05,581
There's nothing to do
with giving someone chances.

689
00:36:06,782 --> 00:36:08,061
We've been together for so many years.

690
00:36:10,662 --> 00:36:11,262
Mum,

691
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:13,862
I feel so blessed

692
00:36:13,862 --> 00:36:15,501
when you said we're one family.

693
00:36:18,222 --> 00:36:19,981
Previously, this only happened

694
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:23,702
in my dream.

695
00:36:28,822 --> 00:36:30,021
So,

696
00:36:31,342 --> 00:36:32,862
don't be disappointed.

697
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:35,061
Please be patient

698
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:37,981
and give more time to Zheng Yingjun

699
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:42,702
and me, okay?

700
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:45,382
Silly girl.

701
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:02,461
It tastes good.

702
00:37:21,101 --> 00:37:23,541
(If this is a chance
to start everything anew,)

703

to change himself)

704

be happy.)

705
00:37:44,421 --> 00:37:45,021
Dad.

706
00:37:45,702 --> 00:37:47,421
What else are you good at

707
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:48,822
besides playing the accordion?

708
00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:51,101
Does stock trading count?

709
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,822
You don't even make money from that.

710
00:37:54,461 --> 00:37:55,222
And this too.

711
00:37:55,662 --> 00:37:57,141
Stop playing with these useless things.

712
00:37:57,222 --> 00:37:59,581
Let's go to the park and exercise.

713
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:00,822
It's chilly outside.

714
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:01,902
Do you want to get beaten by the wind?

715
00:38:02,461 --> 00:38:04,621
Uncle, the temperature rises.

716
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:06,822
It's suitable
for outdoor activities now.

717
00:38:06,941 --> 00:38:09,101
Do you want to have fatty liver disease?

718
00:38:09,182 --> 00:38:10,061
Hurry up. Let's go.

719
00:38:10,302 --> 00:38:11,662
Yesterday, you promised me

720
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,382
to go exercising.

721
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:16,382
Indeed. You need more exercise
after being discharged from hospital.

722
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:17,742
Dear.

723
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,461
You're right.

724
00:38:19,662 --> 00:38:20,902
Let's go out together.

725
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:23,621
No, thanks.

726
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,941
I have a clogged nose.

727
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:29,421
I think I caught a cold.

728
00:38:30,662 --> 00:38:31,342
I need a rest now.

729
00:38:31,382 --> 00:38:32,581
Don't rest.

730
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:33,501
It's good to go exercise

731
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:34,941
and sweat if you have a cold.

732
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:35,662
True.

733
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:37,702
Mu Zili is lazy to move.

734
00:38:37,702 --> 00:38:38,941
You need to exercise too.

735
00:38:39,141 --> 00:38:39,742
Dad.

736
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:44,981
- Move.
- Get up.

737
00:38:45,302 --> 00:38:46,262
Where's my food?

738
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:48,742
What does she mean?

739
00:38:51,702 --> 00:38:54,061
Didn't I ask you
to keep some food for me?

740
00:38:55,941 --> 00:38:56,981
You inconsiderate daughter.

741
00:38:57,021 --> 00:38:58,421
Didn't I ask you
to keep some food for your mum?

742
00:38:58,421 --> 00:38:58,981
I...

743
00:38:58,981 --> 00:38:59,902
What now?

744
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:02,581
Do you think I don't need to eat
but just do work?

745
00:39:03,782 --> 00:39:04,541
It's you.

746
00:39:04,941 --> 00:39:05,981
I didn't.

747
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:09,421
What are you saying?

748
00:39:09,621 --> 00:39:10,222
I...

749
00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:14,621
The pair of you.

750
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:16,822
Go home and clean the house now.

751
00:39:22,262 --> 00:39:23,061
Sorry.

752
00:39:25,182 --> 00:39:26,182
I love you, Aunt Qin.

753
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:41,101
Mum, when can we finish
cleaning up the house?

754
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:43,382
I want to move back home.

755
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:45,581
It'll take half a month to clean.

756
00:39:48,141 --> 00:39:48,941
Where's your dad?

757
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:50,541
Where has that fellow gone again?

758
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:51,862
He went to the toilet.

759
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:53,662
Come out now.

760
00:39:53,822 --> 00:39:55,141
Wear your pants and do the work.

761
00:39:56,581 --> 00:39:59,141
I, Zheng Yingjun am so smart.

762
00:39:59,461 --> 00:40:01,302
Luckily, I put the accordion
in the room.

763
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:03,382
Look at this.

764
00:40:03,382 --> 00:40:04,742
Have you done cleaning your part yet?

765
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:06,621
Good as new.

766
00:40:06,902 --> 00:40:07,501
Dad.

767
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:09,501
Play some songs for us.

768
00:40:09,662 --> 00:40:10,581
Sure.

769
00:40:10,902 --> 00:40:11,941
Geez.

770
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:14,141
You only laze around

771
00:40:14,262 --> 00:40:15,501
and do nonsense all day.

772
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:17,662
You better get a job later.

773
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:19,382
Stop idling at home.

774
00:40:19,382 --> 00:40:20,302
And you too.

775
00:40:22,662 --> 00:40:23,782
Any song you prefer, dear?

776
00:40:23,941 --> 00:40:25,382
Stop playing. Go and change the water.

777
00:40:26,702 --> 00:40:27,461
I'm talking to you!

778
00:40:28,702 --> 00:40:29,662
Oh, I just remember

779
00:40:29,662 --> 00:40:31,061
that Mi Lan invited me
to eat lunch with her.

780

I need to go now.

781

I'm off then.
Please enjoy your time together.

782
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:35,941
I never enjoy spending time with him.

783
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,302
Dad, please stay home
and calm mum's anger.

784
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,101
Got it?

785
