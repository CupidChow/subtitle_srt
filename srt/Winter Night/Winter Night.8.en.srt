Don't you feel ashamed

16
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:13,051
for running away from home at this age?

17
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:15,092
I didn't run away from home.

18
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,291
I just want to be alone.

19
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:23,532
We said you can't drink wine
and you're drinking cooking wine?

You're unbelievable.

00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:27,451
Are you even my daughter?

00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:29,171
Don't you know it's cold in here?

23
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:30,731
I drank it to keep myself warm.

24
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:31,972
Fine.

25
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,492
So you wanted to be alone.

26
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:34,851
Have you figured out anything yet?

27
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:41,252
Daqian,

28
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:42,932
tell me.

29
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:44,972
Do you hate piano

30
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:46,492
because I forced you to practice it

31
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:48,532
when you were a kid?

32
00:02:48,932 --> 00:02:50,171
Of course, not.

33
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:53,451
Playing the piano was my dream.

34
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,772
Every time I passed the piano store,

35
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,011
I always wondered

36
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,772
when I could have my own piano.

37
00:02:58,972 --> 00:02:59,972
Exactly.

38
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:02,252
That's what you told me
when you were a kid.

39
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:03,812
I thought

40
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:05,812
since I can't give you
the stars and the moon,

41
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:07,131
I could definitely buy a piano

42
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:08,571
for you.

43
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:09,652
Anyone can feel bitter,

44
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:11,691
but not my daughter.

45
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:16,812
You sacrificed so much back then.

46
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:18,812
You even sold your motorcycle.

47
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:20,691
Do you regret it?

48
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:22,332
Not at all.

49
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:24,332
So long I can make my daughter happy,

50
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:26,171
I won't regret anything.

51
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:28,372
With you and Gong Xiaoqin around,

52
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:31,332
Zheng Daqian feels happy.

53
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:35,332
After Zhang Yingjun and Gong Xiaoqin

54
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:37,092
had you,

55
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:39,252
they're happy too.

56
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,291
Dad,

57
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:47,492
let's make a deal.

58
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:49,492
Neither of us can sell that piano.

59
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:51,171
We'll compete for the favor
of Gong Xiaoqin fair and square.

60
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,492
Are you serious?

61
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,652
It's a deal.

62
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,372
We'll compete fairly
with our own ability.

63
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,731
Didn't you have dinner?

64
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:07,252
I didn't have time to eat

65
00:04:07,252 --> 00:04:08,492
because I was searching for you
all night.

66
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:09,171
Fret not.

67
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:11,052
I'll make you

68
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:13,691
a bowl of instant noodles.

69
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:14,851
Wait here.

70
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,772
Daqian, come with me.

71
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:31,851
Don't open your eyes.

72
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:33,251
What is it?

73
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:35,491
There's a bench here.

74
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:36,972
Careful.

75
00:04:37,012 --> 00:04:38,731
Okay, sit down.

76
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,371
See, what's this?

77
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:41,652
A piano!

78
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:42,731
Do you like it?

79
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:43,452
I like it!

80
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:45,132
Thank you, Dad!

81
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,332
Who else should
you thank other than me?

82
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:48,772
Thank you, Mom!

83
00:04:58,611 --> 00:04:59,532
Stop recording.

84
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,851
Sit here and let me record instead.

85
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,092
Let me see.

86
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:17,212
Stop recording me. Record her.

87
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:39,491
I'm going to bed.

88
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:41,611
Remember, we had a deal.

89
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:42,652
You must go to the Children's Palace.

90
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:43,411
Okay.

91
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,851
I'll tell mum you drank if you don't go.

92
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:45,611
Fine.

93
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:46,652
Dad,

94
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:49,012
you didn't play for more than ten years.

95
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:49,851
Can you still play?

96
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:51,092
Are you doubting me now?

97
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:53,332
I'll play it tomorrow.

98
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,731
Uncle Yingjun plays really well.

99
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:30,171
His skills are still good.

100
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:31,291
Of course.

101
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,251
That's my dad.

102
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:36,652
Did you see that?

103
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:38,692
Your dad has found

104
00:06:38,851 --> 00:06:40,251
all those feelings back.

105
00:06:41,171 --> 00:06:42,532
I don't know about the rest.

106
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:44,452
But your dad

107
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:45,692
is the top accordion player

What's there to be scared of?

I've faced many obstacles

147

Do you think a small classroom like that

148

can scare me?

149

That's great, then. Let's go back.

Uncle, I thought you're going
to the toilet.

We can go together.

Come on, Uncle.

Uncle, you're scared

166
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,292
of playing in front of the youngsters

167
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:23,412
and shaming them.

00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:36,251
on finding you a job
at Children's Palace?

173
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:40,771
I'm sure she wants to keep me busy

174
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:42,052
because I'm idling at home.

175
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,332
Well, that's one of the reasons.

176
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:46,891
But it's not the main reason.

177
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:49,251
Do you know

178
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:51,251
who Daqian worships the most?

179
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:53,052
It's you.

180
00:10:53,972 --> 00:10:57,011
Daqian always tells me

181
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:00,011
about her favorite place to go.

182
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:01,011
Do you know where it is?

183
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:02,932
She likes to go to your troupe

184
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:04,251
to see your practice.

185
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:07,172
She thinks

186
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:09,371
you're the most handsome person
in the world

187
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:12,531
when you play the accordion
on the stage.

188
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:14,531
With lights shining around you.

189
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:21,011
You can do this.

190
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,771
What did you tell my dad?

191
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:44,172
Some secrets

192
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,692
between men.

193
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:48,052
Stop asking
and just enjoy your dad's performance.

194
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:16,851
There was only silence

195
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:19,611
after I ended my performance.

196
00:12:21,092 --> 00:12:23,572
The judges and I were staring
at each other

197
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:25,251
without making a sound.

198
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,011
I thought I ruined the performance.

199
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:31,932
After five seconds...

200
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,052
Mu, it was five seconds.

201
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:35,452
Everyone stood up
and started applauding.

202
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:37,611
It was absolutely amazing.

203
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:42,531
Daqian, I didn't exaggerate, right?

204
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:45,052
Yes, it was a huge applause.

205
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:45,651
Lizi.

206
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:48,332
You can say he surprised
those present with novelty.

207
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:50,052
You're flattering me.

208
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:51,212
Dad,

209
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:53,092
when did the Children's Palace
reply us?

210
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:54,572
They said by 5 p.m. today.

211
00:12:57,891 --> 00:12:58,531
They're calling.

212
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,412
They're calling.

213
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:00,491
It's a call from Children's Palace.

214
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:09,371
Hello, Mr. Li.

215
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,452
(Hello.)

216
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:14,371
Yes, I'm Zheng Yingjun.

217
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,292
You're too kind.

218
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:20,452
I feel embarrassed

219
00:13:20,452 --> 00:13:22,172
to hear you compliment me.

220
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:25,572
Yes.

221
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:27,932
You're right.

222
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:31,332
I understand.

223
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,932
I had no choice too.

224
00:13:34,131 --> 00:13:36,052
My daughter insisted on taking me there.

225
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:37,251
Why would an old guy like me

226
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:39,212
compete with the youngsters?

227
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,332
Yes.

228
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:41,611
I understand.

229
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:42,812
Li.

230
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:45,292
Since you addressed me politely,

231
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,651
we're friends from now on.

232
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:48,891
We can have a drink when you're free.

233
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:51,292
All right.

234
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:54,011
Bye-bye.

235
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:06,371
Daqian,

236
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:08,172
it's okay.

237
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:09,812
Don't despair.

238
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:12,572
There are other opportunities
in the future.

239
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:16,812
I'll go out and take a stroll.

240

(Baihe First Middle School Library,
Tieyuan)

241
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:40,812
Hey, guess what?

242
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,651
She got the job

243
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:44,812
after Mr. Mi begged the principal.

244
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:46,332
Really?

245
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:50,251
Mi Lihua may look proud and pompous.

246
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:52,011
His weakness is his daughter.

247
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:54,491
The children of other teachers
are outstanding.

248
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:55,292
Only his daughter came

249
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:56,851
to our school

250
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:58,292
and was given a temporary position.

251
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:59,572
No one can see that coming.

252
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:02,292
Excuse me.

253
00:15:02,812 --> 00:15:04,292
Where's Mi Lan?

254
00:15:06,412 --> 00:15:07,131
Mi Lan?

255
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:11,052
She's over there.

256
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:12,172
Thanks.

257
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:16,491
Who's that?

258
00:15:16,972 --> 00:15:17,771
I have no idea.

259
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:25,052
Mi Lan.

260
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,052
What are you doing here?

261
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:31,572
Borrow some books.

262
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:32,851
Isn't it lunchtime?

263
00:15:32,851 --> 00:15:33,771
Why are you here borrowing some books?

264
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:36,332
In that case, let's have lunch together.

265
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:38,851
Okay.

266
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:50,251
What's going on there?

267
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:53,011
Stewed chicken with mushroom,

268
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:54,932
herbal pork ribs,

269
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:56,212
stir-fried eggplants,

and air-fried yellow croaker.

271
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:00,891
Are you reporting the menu?

272
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:03,292
It's today's menu at the cafeteria.

273
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:04,572
I've made some observations.

274
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:05,611
The cafeteria prepared the best menu

275
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:06,891
every Friday.

276
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:08,891
Just tell me what you want to eat.

277
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:14,771
What's wrong?

278
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:16,572
My dad is there.

279
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:19,452
Mr. Mi?

280
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,452
Why?

281
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:23,212
Zixi, I'll get back to work first.

282
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:25,692
You're not eating?

283
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:26,491
I'm not hungry.

284
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:29,212
I don't have a self-study class
in the evening.

285
00:16:29,212 --> 00:16:30,292
Let's go back together.

286
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:41,891
Are you really going
to swap your bike with mine?

287
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:43,692
Are you sure?

288
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:44,771
You better don't regret it.

289
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,412
If you keep asking,
we're not going to swap.

290
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,292
Okay, I'll stop.

291
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:50,212
Are you not going to wait for me?

292
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:51,972
You can go home by yourself.

293
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:54,651
- I'll get going now.
- Bye.

When was this photo taken?

You were in a band too?

You weren't born yet at the time.

what was your dream when you were young?

Was it music?

It was my dream before you were born.

305

After you were born, it was...

306

What is it?

Make a fortune.

Me?

309
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:11,172
The Children's Palace
didn't know what they're missing.

310
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:13,172
They didn't know
the sound of nature at all.

Daqian,

312

my own capabilities.

But no one gets back to you, right?

316
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:26,291
Who says no one got back to me?

317
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,612
Dad, be patient.

318

that shop?

Trust me.
We'll make a profit and not losses.

When the relocation compensation
is paid out,

328
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,852
our family will be rich.

Are you still thinking about that shop?

330

I've asked several of my friends.

331

They said

332
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:51,212
that area is a low-lying land

333
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:52,692
that won't increase in value.

334

Dad, listen.

From now on, just believe me.

00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:04,692
Okay.

341
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:23,372
Why are you so happy?

342
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:25,172
What did you get?

343
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:27,972
I gave you the chance to be
a shareholder, but you rejected me.

344
00:19:27,972 --> 00:19:29,531
Don't envy me after this.

345
00:19:29,531 --> 00:19:31,731
Are you serious about buying that shop?

346
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:33,771
Why are you so proud

347
00:19:33,771 --> 00:19:35,132
when nothing is set in stone?

348
00:19:35,452 --> 00:19:36,291
Besides,

349
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,692
some people

350
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:40,091
go bankrupt after opening
for three days.

351
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:41,811
Wasn't that you?

352
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,331
I'm being serious here.

353
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,612
Why do you fancy that shop?

354
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:54,811
The shop's cost performance.

355
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:56,291
The value will increase in the future.

356
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:57,612
What?

357
00:19:57,612 --> 00:20:00,011
Do you even know
what cost performance is?

358
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,172
Cost performance

359
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:03,251
should be based on the product's ability

360
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:05,091
to deliver performance.

361
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:06,212
I'll put it this way.

362
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:08,531
You have to meet
the performance requirements

363
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:10,531
before you discuss
whether the price is appropriate.

364
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:12,612
That place obviously

365
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:14,972
can't meet the basic performance.

366
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:17,491
You're just desperate to try anything
even if it doesn't help.

They already showed it in the beginning.

It's Mr. Chen.

No.

He's more good-looking.

Do you know why the female lead
doesn't choose him in the end?

381

Because you're both ugly.

382

Stop your gibberish.

383

You're distracting me from watching TV.

I'll tell you one last thing.

Mister, this is a great shop.

But I was also the first person

to see the value of this shop,

do you have a hygiene license
for this place?

What about a pollutant discharge permit?

Put aside making money.

00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:18,132
where they'll compensate you
one to two million yuan

507
00:25:18,132 --> 00:25:19,612
for relocation?

508
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:20,972
Just wait and see.

509
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:22,731
Wait.

510
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:25,011
Look at the location.

511
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:27,412
Why are you more stubborn
about this than choosing a man?

512
00:25:27,412 --> 00:25:28,412
You have no experience.

513
00:25:28,412 --> 00:25:29,571
How can you make money?

514
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:30,452
Besides,

515
00:25:30,452 --> 00:25:32,251
I thought you wanted
to find a decent job.

516
00:25:32,412 --> 00:25:33,811
Why do you daydream all the time?

517
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:35,132
Stop looking down on me.

518
00:25:35,132 --> 00:25:36,811
Do you think I'm a fool
who's easy to cheat,

519
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:37,612
can't succeed in anything,

520
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:39,011
only uses brute force, and is impulsive?

521
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:41,452
That's too much.
You only use brute force.

522
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:44,251
Wait.

523
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:48,251
If you want to do a decent job,

524
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,491
I can help you.

525
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:51,652
At least you won't lose money
if you count on me.

526
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:52,491
Count on you?

527
00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:56,932
If we didn't grow up together,

528
00:25:56,932 --> 00:25:58,372
I wouldn't bother to stop you at all.

529
00:25:58,372 --> 00:25:59,331
If we didn't return to Baihe,

530
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:00,652
we wouldn't keep in touch anymore.

531
00:26:00,652 --> 00:26:01,412
It's hard for us to be friends
most of the time

532
00:26:01,412 --> 00:26:03,132
with our personalities.

533
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:04,011
I agree.

534
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:05,612
What's wrong?

535
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:06,972
We're all friends here.

536
00:26:06,972 --> 00:26:08,251
- I'm not his friend!
- I'm not her friend!

537
00:26:47,091 --> 00:26:48,771
You're still awake?

538
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:50,771
You're back.

539
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:52,852
I can't sleep.

540
00:26:53,051 --> 00:26:54,011
Why don't you go to bed first?

541
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:11,212
Aren't you going to bed?

542
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,091
I'll go to bed after drinking this milk.

543
00:27:34,692 --> 00:27:36,692
Did you fight with Mr. Li?

544
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:38,972
I saw you avoiding him yesterday.

545
00:27:43,652 --> 00:27:44,452
It was nothing.

546
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:47,091
We always fight
whenever we see each other.

547
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:49,172
He always scolds me when we do.

548
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:50,652
I thought

549
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:52,412
Mr. Mi found the job for you.

550
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:54,251
Yes.

551
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:56,091
But it's not what I want.

552
00:27:57,491 --> 00:27:59,491
Why did you accept it?

553
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:02,091
When you grow up,

554
00:28:03,731 --> 00:28:04,892
you have to do

555
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,452
what everyone expects you to do.

556
00:28:07,331 --> 00:28:08,212
I don't agree with that.

557
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:11,932
I think it's better

558
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:13,892
to be yourself.

559
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:18,412
But in the adult world,

560
00:28:19,652 --> 00:28:21,692
you should keep adjusting yourself

561
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:24,251
to adapt to the environment and people.

562
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,571
You'll know when you grow up.

563
00:28:28,612 --> 00:28:30,132
Have you played Tetris before?

564
00:28:33,372 --> 00:28:34,091
You see.

565
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:37,132
The pieces keep adjusting themselves

566
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,612
to fit into the space.

567
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,291
In the end, it'll disappear.

568
00:28:42,491 --> 00:28:43,731
So I think

569
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:46,011
no matter how old you are,

570
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:48,251
you have to do what you like.

571
00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:51,291
You don't have to care
what other people think.

572
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:06,412
I'll go to bed now.

573
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:07,412
You should get some rest too.

574
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:30,892
Why are you still awake?

575
00:29:34,412 --> 00:29:35,892
Stop being upset.

576
00:29:36,051 --> 00:29:38,132
Why do you have to be upset with Lizi?

577
00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:39,892
That's because you didn't hear
what he said about me.

578
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:41,731
He's just looking down on me.

579
00:29:42,372 --> 00:29:43,892
I think he cares about you.

580
00:29:43,892 --> 00:29:45,612
That's not caring.
He was trying to knock me down.

581
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:47,172
He'd rub salt in my wound.

582
00:29:49,452 --> 00:29:51,652
Then between Yan and Lizi,

583
00:29:51,652 --> 00:29:52,852
who's more important

584
00:29:52,852 --> 00:29:53,692
in your heart?

585
00:29:57,811 --> 00:29:59,251
Of course, it's Yan.

586
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,612
Yan is nicer

587
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:01,771
and more likable than him.

588
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:05,331
What about you?

589
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:07,491
How's work at school?

590
00:30:07,531 --> 00:30:09,491
Is it exhausting?

591
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:10,972
It's nothing special.

592
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,051
No one talks to me at work anyway.

593
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:17,091
But I always hear them say

594
00:30:17,172 --> 00:30:18,892
Mi Lihua's biggest weakness

595
00:30:18,892 --> 00:30:20,731
is to have a daughter like me.

596
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:21,412
They can just buzz off.

597
00:30:21,412 --> 00:30:22,091
Bring me to school tomorrow.

598
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:23,291
I want to see who spouts that nonsense.

599
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,132
So you really don't plan

600
00:30:29,132 --> 00:30:30,571
on continuing working
at school anymore?

601
00:30:31,972 --> 00:30:33,212
You knew

602
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:34,852
I hated school

603
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:36,051
and sitting for exams since I was young.

604
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:39,132
What about you?

605
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:41,212
How did it go with the shop?

606
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:43,652
I haven't raised enough money.

607
00:30:44,331 --> 00:30:45,892
I wanted to ask Mu Zili to join.

608
00:30:45,892 --> 00:30:46,932
Not wanting to join is one thing.

609
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:47,852
He said I'm stupid.

610
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:49,612
He said it'll be a complete loss.

611
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:51,331
So this is the reason you fought.

612
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:56,771
No matter how old you are,

613
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:58,972
you should do what you like.

614
00:31:00,612 --> 00:31:01,972
You don't have to care
what other people think.

615
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:09,011
Daqian,

616
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:11,331
I'll join you.

617
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:12,331
Let's do this together.

618
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:13,372
Really?

619
00:31:14,692 --> 00:31:17,011
I'm preparing to resign anyway.

620
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:18,571
Even if my dad wouldn't let me go home,

621
00:31:18,571 --> 00:31:19,212
I'll resign anyway.

622
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:20,652
Are you sure about this?

623
00:31:21,652 --> 00:31:22,331
Yes.

624
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,412
I can only rely on you
at a critical moment like this.

625
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:28,932
I've saved up

626
00:31:28,932 --> 00:31:30,571
almost 50,000 yuan.

627
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:31,811
I'll invest all of it.

628
00:31:31,852 --> 00:31:33,972
I'll meet the landlord to sign
the contract tomorrow.

629
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:34,811
We'll go together.

630
00:31:36,091 --> 00:31:37,412
But is 50,000 yuan enough?

631
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,011
I went through
my transaction records lately

632
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:41,571
and noticed one thing.

633
00:31:42,811 --> 00:31:44,972
My ex-boyfriend owes me 60,000 yuan.

634
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:45,932
I'm going to get it back.

635
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:48,892
I thought you didn't want

636
00:31:48,892 --> 00:31:50,132
to have anything to do
with him anymore.

637
00:31:50,652 --> 00:31:51,771
I don't care about the rest,

638
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:53,491
but I'll make him pay back

639
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:54,932
every single cent he owes me.

640
00:31:55,132 --> 00:31:55,731
Come on, let's sleep.

641
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:04,571
You've changed a lot.

642
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:07,692
Okay, let's sleep.

643
00:32:43,692 --> 00:32:44,771
Morning, Zixi.

644
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:45,372
Morning.

645
00:32:45,652 --> 00:32:46,811
Did you change your bike?

646
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,811
I lent mine to my classmate.

647
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:53,011
Hop on.

648
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:54,011
I'll give you a ride to school.

649
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:56,731
It's okay. I can take the bus.

650
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:58,172
You should go now, or you'll be late.

651
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:01,011
Excuse me.

652
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:02,571
Do you know someone
by the name of Mi Lan?

653
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:03,491
She's about my height

654
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:04,491
with long hair.

655
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:05,692
I don't know anyone like that.

656
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:06,811
Thanks.

657
00:33:09,331 --> 00:33:09,972
Mi Lan,

658
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:11,852
where are you going?

659
00:33:12,452 --> 00:33:14,011
You'll be late.

660
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,300
(Baihe First Middle School Library,
Tieyuan)

661
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:32,972
Mi Lan, someone's looking for you.

662
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:34,771
Mi Lan,

663
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:36,452
I've finally found you.

664
00:33:36,452 --> 00:33:37,692
Why are you here?

665
00:33:37,692 --> 00:33:38,811
How did you come in?

666
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,491
Ms. Xia showed me the way here.

667
00:33:40,892 --> 00:33:42,051
It's nothing difficult.

668
00:33:43,692 --> 00:33:44,811
Mi Lan,

669
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:46,491
you've already changed your looks

670
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,051

Keep it down.

Sorry, Ms. Xia.

674

It's okay.

675
00:33:58,051 --> 00:33:59,531
Dahua, what do you want?

676
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:01,531
- What do I want?
- Keep it down.

What do you think I can do?

678
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:03,612
We'll talk outside.

Didn't you leave

without telling me too?

684
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,651
I want to start a new life.

685
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:17,491
I don't want to go back
to that kind of life.

686
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:19,091
What kind of life?

687
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:20,491
We didn't steal or rob anyone.

688
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,171
Yes, we got caught.

689
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:22,491
But that was because of bad luck.

690
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:23,211
What's wrong

691
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:25,091
with selling things to make a living?

692

Is that wrong?

696
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:33,011
Fine.

697
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:34,651
It's okay if you don't want them
to know your past

698

or admit that I'm your friend.

Today is the last day.

I have no one else to turn to.

I really don't.

I really have no money.

781

Even our crabs missed you.

Dahua.

Baihe is not a small place.

787
00:39:06,531 --> 00:39:07,932
But we run into each other
in the street.

788
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:09,171
What are the odds, right?

789
00:39:09,171 --> 00:39:09,812
You're right.

790
00:39:09,812 --> 00:39:10,732
You said you're hungry.

791
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:11,531
I'll take you for a midnight snack.

792

Let's go.

793
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:13,531
Wait.

794
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:15,211
You see, I came all the way here.

795
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:17,252
Besides, it's better to meet by chance.

796
00:39:17,372 --> 00:39:18,772
I'll leave after I buy you a meal.

797
00:39:18,772 --> 00:39:20,812
I can't let you treat me
when you're a visitor.

798
00:39:20,812 --> 00:39:22,252
What do you want to eat? It's on me.

799
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:25,011
You're sensible.

800
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:41,611
Why aren't you two eating?

801
00:39:42,252 --> 00:39:44,051
You look frail because you don't eat.

802
00:39:44,211 --> 00:39:44,852
Eat more.

803
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:50,372
Dahua,

00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:52,892
how did you meet Mi Lan

in Ningzhou?

806
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:56,131
We were housemates

807
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:57,892
and business partners.

808
00:39:58,292 --> 00:39:59,812
Did you start a business in Ningzhou?

809
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:02,171
What is it that you do?

810
00:40:02,812 --> 00:40:04,332
We've done so many things.

811
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:05,852
We were in fashion.

812
00:40:05,852 --> 00:40:06,972
We opened a clothing company.

813
00:40:07,292 --> 00:40:08,852
Ningzhou has a lot of garment factories.

814
00:40:08,852 --> 00:40:10,131
We would also order

815
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:11,651
some stocks from the wholesalers

816
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:13,051
and sell them

817
00:40:13,051 --> 00:40:13,932
in our online stores.

818
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:16,292
How is the shop doing now?

819
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:17,412
It went well at first.

820
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:18,852
I had a friend

821
00:40:18,852 --> 00:40:19,892
who wanted to invest in her

822
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:21,691
to turn her into a model.

823
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:23,292
He wanted to help her be
a popular influencer

824
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:24,051
and set up a company.

825
00:40:24,332 --> 00:40:25,412
What's the name of the shop?

826
00:40:25,412 --> 00:40:26,292
Let me search.

827
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:27,531
- Mi and Hua Exclusive Store.
- Don't search for it.

828
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:29,011
Daqian, stop.

829
00:40:29,372 --> 00:40:30,452
It's closed down.

830
00:40:31,171 --> 00:40:33,972
We didn't make enough money

831
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:35,332
because the competition was too fierce.

832
00:40:35,571 --> 00:40:37,051
After that, we went into sales.

833
00:40:37,932 --> 00:40:39,491
What did you sell, then?

834
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:41,412
Electronic products.

835
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:43,171
Yes.

836
00:40:43,812 --> 00:40:46,051
Something high-tech like blockchain.

837
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:47,171

838
00:40:48,852 --> 00:40:50,252
Sir, two servings
of pork belly, please.

839
00:40:50,252 --> 00:40:51,011
Coming right up.

840
00:40:55,772 --> 00:40:56,611
Dahua, keep on eating.

841
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:57,611
We're going to the toilet.

842
00:40:57,611 --> 00:40:58,651
Yes, keep eating.

843
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:05,011
You guys didn't even eat anything.

844
00:41:15,691 --> 00:41:16,491
Mi Lan,

845
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:18,691
do you know Dahua very well?

846
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:21,732
Don't worry. That's what she's like.

847
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:23,171
She's not that articulate.

848
00:41:25,932 --> 00:41:27,011
Why did she come to Baihe

to see you?

She...

851
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:34,892
She's pretty pitiful.

852
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:37,691
Her parents passed away
when she was a kid.

853
00:41:37,691 --> 00:41:39,211
She doesn't have many friends.

854
00:41:39,211 --> 00:41:40,772
She came to find me
because she had no choice.

Excuse me.
