00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:01,457
Your mom would show up.

172
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:02,736
We were just talking about you.

173
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:05,057
Mom, I won't be going back today.

174
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:06,177
I'll stay with Dad here tonight.

175
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:06,817
You should go home.

176
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:07,736
He seems to enjoy

177
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:08,616
his time here.

178
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,057
He can eat and drink all he wants.

179
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:11,656
Xiaoqin,

180
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:13,376
I

181
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,016
almost died.

182
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:17,697
Can't you be a little compassionate?

183
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,937
Zheng Yingjun, I think you should

184
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:22,457
give serious thought

185
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:23,577
to your issues.

186
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:25,136
How did you end up here?

187
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,616
Mom, it's not Dad's fault.

188
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:29,616
It's my fault.

189
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:30,656
Stay out of this.

190
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:32,937
We're talking
about Zheng Yingjun's problem.

191
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:35,256
If you listened to me,

192
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:36,457
would you be hospitalized?

193
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:38,177
Go on eating.

194
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:40,656
I'm not eating anymore.

195
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,496
There's no more hope.

196
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,376
All that's left is pain.

197
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:49,016
Dad, do you feel pain anywhere?

198
00:13:50,136 --> 00:13:51,016
My heart.

199
00:13:51,616 --> 00:13:53,097
I can't help but lose heart.

200
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:53,776
I'm leaving.

201
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,457
Dad, I can buy you something else

202
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:00,577
if you don't want to eat these.

203
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:01,297
How about oden

204
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:02,697
to warm you up?

205
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:04,776
What do you want in your oden?

206
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:06,736
Konjac, fish balls.

207
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:07,577
Okay.

208
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:08,496
Kelp.

209
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:10,136
I'll be back.

210
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:20,697
Daqian!

211
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:23,496
Yan?

212
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:25,736
I'm back.

213
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:28,136
I'm so happy to see you!

214
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:29,577
I missed you so much!

215
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:30,457
Really?

216
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:32,776
I missed you too.

217
00:14:32,776 --> 00:14:33,736
I thought I would never see you again

218
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:35,457
after you went abroad.

219
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,297
Abroad?

220
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:37,776
When did I go abroad?

221
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:38,856
I've always been in Beijing.

222
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:50,457
(He's not the Yan I know too.)

223
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:51,217
Daqian,

224
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:52,937
how are you?

225
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:54,776
I'm pretty worried about you.

226
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:58,496
I just feel a little tired

227
00:14:58,496 --> 00:14:59,496
from taking care of my dad.

228
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:01,896
How's Uncle Yingjun now?

229
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:03,016
Is he okay?

230
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:04,856
He's fine and pretty energetic.

231
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:06,297
The doctor said he's recovering well

232
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:07,577
and would be discharged soon.

233
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:09,817
I'm glad that Uncle Yingjun is okay.

234
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:11,496
Yan,

235
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:13,776
why are you back in Baihe?

236
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:15,177
I came back

237
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:16,656
because...

238
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:20,057
Lizi?

239
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:22,097
When did you start wearing glasses?

240
00:15:22,457 --> 00:15:24,457
I've always been wearing glasses
because I'm nearsighted.

241
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:25,656
He's nearsighted?

242
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:27,177
Just ignore him. He lost his memories.

243
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,536
Let's go and visit my dad.

244
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:29,097
I'll take these for you.

245
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:29,776
Lizi,

246
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:31,217
help Yan carry them.

247
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:32,057
Okay.

248
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:33,656
Yan,

249
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:35,736
where are you working now?

250
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:38,136
I'm working
at Baihe Meteorological Administration.

251
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:40,536
It's great to have everyone back home.

252
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,776
I remember you like wearing a scarf.

253
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,457
Mom, you're home.

254
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:53,616
It smells good.

255
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:54,896
Get ready for dinner.

256
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:55,896
Come.

257
00:15:58,577 --> 00:15:59,776
Oh, my.

258
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:01,937
Look at all these dishes.

259
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:04,016
Not bad, son.

260
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:07,417
Why did you cook so many?

261
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:09,656
We still have many leftovers
in the fridge.

262
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:11,136
It'll be such a waste.

263
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:13,417
I already threw out the leftovers.

264
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:14,736
You threw it all out?

265
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,376
You're so wasteful.

266
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:18,736
When you come home,

267
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,136
I'll prepare food for you every day.

268
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:21,097
Stop eating those leftovers.

269
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:21,656
Have a seat.

270
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:22,256
Okay.

271
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:24,776
Try them.

272
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:27,297
See if it's good.

273
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:29,177
As long as you prepare them,

274
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:30,297
they'll taste good.

275
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:36,217
When are you going back?

276
00:16:37,217 --> 00:16:38,097
I won't be going back temporarily.

277
00:16:38,937 --> 00:16:39,776
You'll stay longer?

278
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:40,937
Why?

279
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:43,977
My institute and
the Baihe Meteorological Administration

280
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,016
have an exchange program.

281
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:47,856
So I took the initiative
to submit my request.

282
00:16:48,016 --> 00:16:49,016
Are you serious?

283
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:49,736
Yes.

284
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:55,256
Mom,

285
00:16:55,697 --> 00:16:57,217
aren't you happy that I'm home?

286
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:58,616
Of course, I'm happy.

287
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:01,097
I just find it

288
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,097
too sudden.

289
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:04,376
How is it too sudden?

290
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:06,496
As long as you're happy,

291
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:07,896
I'll stay with you forever.

292
00:17:08,697 --> 00:17:10,137
I don't want you to stay with me.

293
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:12,336
You have a great job in Beijing.

294
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,177
I don't want you to stay
in a small place like this.

295
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:18,576
Mom, I'm no longer a kid.

296
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:19,937
That's nothing to feel unhappy about.

297
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:20,897
Besides,

298
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:23,576
I don't feel unhappy
being with you at all.

299
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:26,736
Eat up.

300
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:28,377
Try this.

301
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:32,576
By the way,

302
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:34,697
didn't you visit Yingjun today?

303
00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:36,217
How is his recovery?

304
00:17:36,217 --> 00:17:38,137
The doctor said he's recovering well

305
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:39,256
and will be discharged
in a couple of days.

306
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:40,457
I'm glad to hear that.

307
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:41,457
If you have the time,

308
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:43,536
you should visit him more often
at the hospital these two days.

309
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,377
Daqian is a young lady.

310
00:17:45,536 --> 00:17:47,296
Some things are not convenient
for her to do.

311
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:49,417
Don't worry about it.

312
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:52,217
Mom, tell me what you want

313
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:52,776
to eat tomorrow.

314
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:53,776
I'll cook for you again.

315
00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:55,776
Anything will do.

316
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:21,457
You're home.

317
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:27,776
What are you doing in my bed?

318
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,657
Sleeping.

319
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:33,377
Who said you could sleep in my room?

320
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:38,417
Zixi, Uncle Zheng
will be discharged tomorrow.

321
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,336
Your dad and I talked

322
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,177
about letting Daqian sleep

323
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:43,657
in your brother's room.

324
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:46,657
So both of you will sleep
in the same room.

325
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:48,937
And your brother recently
was discharged from the hospital.

326
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,336
You can take care of him.

327
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:51,776
He doesn't need anyone
to take care of him.

328
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:54,096
I can't share the room with him.

329
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:55,736
Worse comes to worst,
I'll move to the school dorm.

330
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:57,016
That'll work too.

331
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:59,657
It's better for a Grade 12 student
to stay at the school.

332
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:00,937
The one who's mooching off his parents

333
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:02,617
should sleep in the storeroom upstairs.

334
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:03,897
Zixi,

335
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:06,816
that store room is never meant
to be a bedroom.

336
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:08,576
If your Aunt Qin sees

337
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:09,697
either of you sleeps in that room,

338
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:11,977
how can she stay at our house
without worries?

339
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:14,657
Besides, you're not strangers.

340
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:16,736
Can't you just get along?

341
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:18,697
It's only for several days.

342
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:20,536
Don't be so stingy.

343
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:21,977
If you're that generous,
why don't you pay

344
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:23,776
for the family's expenses and rentals?

345
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:27,617
Why do I have to pay to stay at home?

346
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:29,256
That would be treating our home
like a hotel.

347
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:30,857
When you started your business,

348
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:32,256
the house wasn't even a hotel to you.

349
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,617
Now that your business has failed,

350
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:34,937
only then did you remember
this is your home.

351
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:36,496
Dad and Mom may accept you. But I don't.

352
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:39,177
Mu Zixi, are you my brother?

353
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:41,937
Be nice.

354
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:46,417
If this is how you two are going to be,

355
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,296
your dad and I will sleep
in the storeroom

356
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:50,697
to empty the master bedroom.

357
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:53,016
It's just sleeping in the store room.

358
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:54,336
Mu,

359
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,496
our joints

360
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,617
are still pretty strong, right?

361
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,056
Going up and down the stairs
is not a problem?

362
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:01,617
Okay.

363
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,377
In that case, let's start packing.

364
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:04,776
Stop, Mom.

365
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:06,417
Fine.

366
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:09,016
Both of us will sleep in the same room.

367
00:20:34,096 --> 00:20:34,937
How sweet.

368
00:20:49,736 --> 00:20:50,657
Yingjun.

369
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:54,496
you should cover yourself

370
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:56,657
since you just came home
from the hospital.

371
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:57,536
Mu,

372
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,056
you're the only one who's nice to me.

373
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:01,137
Nonsense.

374
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:02,736
Remember.

375
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:05,016
This is also your home.

376
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:16,217
Can you be more gentle?

377
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,457
Can you keep it down?

378
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:18,056
Yes.

379
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:23,336
Dad, what song do you want to listen to?

380
00:21:23,336 --> 00:21:24,256
I'll sing it for you.

381
00:21:24,857 --> 00:21:26,617
Sing something gentle.

382
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:27,617
Okay.

383
00:21:29,377 --> 00:21:29,977

you better stash them away.

let you have my room.

You can leave if there's nothing else.

a few things clear first.

Whatever you say, okay?

457
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:49,496
I'm only here to sleep

458
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:50,536

What?

If I lie in this area,

won't it look like a crime scene?

466

Isn't that perfect

467
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:19,457
since all you do is lie down
like a corpse at home?

Now, this is Zixi.

506
00:28:12,137 --> 00:28:13,217
Look how adorable he was.

507
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:16,457
Little baby.

508
00:28:20,937 --> 00:28:22,776
Why didn't I look at the camera?

509
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:26,177
Did you take this secretly?

510
00:28:26,177 --> 00:28:27,697
Don't be ridiculous.

511
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:29,977
I would never sneak around like this.

512
00:28:31,937 --> 00:28:32,977
Caught you lying.

513
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,096
Didn't you write this?

514
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,400
(I want to make a fortune
in the future.)

515
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:43,256
I actually did something like this?

516
00:28:47,496 --> 00:28:49,137
Where was this taken?

517
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:51,457
Was this taken inside the tram?

518
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:53,736
Is the tram still running?

519
00:28:54,137 --> 00:28:55,137
Why don't we go and check it out?

520
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,736
Come on.

521
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:27,457
Just sit still.

522
00:29:27,536 --> 00:29:29,496
- Can you stop taking pictures?
- Let's take a selfie.

523
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:32,736
You press the button.

524
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:37,776
Nice.

525
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:40,296
What's so exciting about this tram?

526
00:29:40,296 --> 00:29:41,776
It's not like you never rode it before.

527
00:29:41,977 --> 00:29:42,617
At my place,

528
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:44,137
the tram is no longer running.

529
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:47,736
Your place?

530
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:51,096
Have you forgotten

531
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,217
we always commuted to school

532
00:29:52,217 --> 00:29:53,857
by tram when we were in high school?

533
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:56,177
Really?

534
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:11,377
How about arithmetic progression?

535
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:20,096
You did pretty well in solid geometry.

536
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:21,377
At least,
you answered several correctly.

537
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:24,617
Okay, tell me how you solved them.

538
00:30:31,217 --> 00:30:32,816
I measured all the angles

539
00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:34,016
on the paper.

540
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:37,576
Zheng Daqian,

541
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:39,736
can you be more serious?

542
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:42,177
I quit. I give up on mathematics.

543
00:30:42,496 --> 00:30:43,536
You're quitting?

544
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:45,697
What are you going to do if you quit?

545
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:46,857
Do you want to join Dazhi

546
00:30:46,857 --> 00:30:48,776
and be in the lowest rank
in the whole grade?

547
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:50,776
There's also a criterion
if you want to repeat your studies.

548
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:52,296
You're so annoying.

549
00:30:52,296 --> 00:30:53,736
Your tutoring is the same as nagging,

550
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:54,857
which is making me livid.

551
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:55,857
Just leave me alone.

552
00:30:58,576 --> 00:31:00,377
Which university do you plan
to go to in the future?

553
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:01,697
You must at least have a target, right?

554
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:03,657
Why should I tell you
which university I want to go to?

555
00:31:05,576 --> 00:31:06,937
I'm being serious here.

556
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,016
Where do you want
to further your studies?

557
00:31:13,977 --> 00:31:14,776
Why?

558
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:17,857
Do you want to go with me?

559
00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:21,576
Do you have a crush on me?

560
00:31:22,977 --> 00:31:24,457
You should confess your feelings now.

561
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:25,736
After I reject you,

562
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:27,177
you'll study even harder.

563
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,536
You might never know
that you'll exceed your capabilities

564
00:31:28,536 --> 00:31:29,576
and enter Peking University.

565
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:32,137
In any cases,

566
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:33,256
we'll be like two parallel lines

567
00:31:33,576 --> 00:31:35,617
that never cross each other

568
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:37,657
after the College Entrance Examination.

569
00:31:57,336 --> 00:31:58,177
Zheng Daqian,

570
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:01,217
I like...

571
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:05,937
I get it now.

572
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:09,977
The key to arithmetic progression
is arithmetic.

573
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,336
Mr. Mu,

574
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:13,056
he needs you more than I do.

575
00:32:13,977 --> 00:32:15,056
Can you tell me

576
00:32:15,056 --> 00:32:16,576
what's geometric progression again?

577
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:19,137
What sequence are we talking about here?

578
00:32:49,897 --> 00:32:51,897
What are you thinking?
We're already here.

579
00:32:51,897 --> 00:32:52,617
Nothing.

580
00:32:58,417 --> 00:32:59,736
There are so many things to eat.

581
00:33:00,096 --> 00:33:01,736
Let's buy from every stall.

582
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:06,056
Our funds are limited.
Just buy from one stall.

583
00:33:17,736 --> 00:33:19,697
Sir, how much is your sweet potato?

584
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,657
It's eight yuan per 500gm.

585
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:22,177
Eight yuan per 500gm?

586
00:33:22,536 --> 00:33:23,496
That's too expensive. Let's go.

587
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:25,977
Daqian! Lizi!

588
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:28,296
Yan!

589
00:33:29,016 --> 00:33:30,056
Where are you going?

590
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:32,137
The walls at home are peeling.

591
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:33,657
I'm going back to repaint the wall.

592
00:33:33,776 --> 00:33:34,776
Great timing.

593
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:36,457
Let's go and help him.

594
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:39,576
My mom is calling.

595
00:33:39,576 --> 00:33:40,536
She may need my help at the studio.

596
00:33:40,536 --> 00:33:41,217
I'll have to go.

597
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:42,056
Yes, Mom?

598
00:33:42,496 --> 00:33:43,137
Okay.

599
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:51,937
Mu Zili really likes to slack off.

600
00:33:51,937 --> 00:33:53,377
He always runs off
when work is involved.

601
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:55,897
Idling all day instead of working.

602
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:58,816
Just leave it there. I can do it myself.

603
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:00,977
How can you finish painting
all of this by yourself?

604
00:34:00,977 --> 00:34:02,576
I must help you.

605
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:06,096
I think

606
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:07,977
Lizi is different from before.

607
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,457
How different?

608
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,217
After he started working,

609
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,897
he became so uptight.

610
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:15,857
He became more and more reserved

611
00:34:16,216 --> 00:34:17,656
and focused on his career.

612
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:21,337
Now, he laughs and messes around more.

613
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:23,576
It felt like
he returned to his childhood.

614
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:25,737
I hope he can be

615
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:27,337
as reserved as before.

616
00:34:29,576 --> 00:34:31,136
You've changed too, Daqian.

617
00:34:31,857 --> 00:34:32,897
You became...

618
00:34:33,457 --> 00:34:35,417
It was as if I never knew you before.

619
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:40,817
Maybe

620
00:34:41,216 --> 00:34:42,616
it's because I've come around

621
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:43,616
and decided to start over

622
00:34:43,616 --> 00:34:44,937
after I ran away from home.

623
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:49,216
Seeing how close you're with Lizi

624
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,857
makes me happy too.

625
00:34:51,616 --> 00:34:52,576
I just felt

626
00:34:52,576 --> 00:34:54,257
your relationship
with him is also different now.

627
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,417
It was a feud between us.

628
00:34:56,777 --> 00:34:57,897
Having him around me

629
00:34:57,897 --> 00:34:59,176
from morning to night

630
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,777
is killing me.

631
00:35:05,777 --> 00:35:07,176
The heating system
at my house broke down.

632
00:35:07,297 --> 00:35:09,216
So my parents and I
are staying at Lizi's place.

633
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:12,176
Yan,

634
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:16,056
has my dad paid off the money
he owes your family?

635
00:35:16,696 --> 00:35:18,297
Your dad didn't owe us any money.

636
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:20,297
My dad was the one who owes your family.

637
00:35:20,297 --> 00:35:21,297
Your dad?

638
00:35:21,817 --> 00:35:23,897
Your dad owes my family money?

639
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:27,417
Yeah, have you forgotten?

640
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:29,417
When we were in Grade 12,

641
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,176
my dad took part in illegal fund-raising

642
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,937
and ran away with everyone's money.

643
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:35,937
After that,

644
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:37,616
my mom and I would pay back every year.

645
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:40,337
By this year, it'll all be paid off.

646
00:35:43,337 --> 00:35:45,377
In this parallel world,

647
00:35:45,616 --> 00:35:47,377
it was your dad.

648
00:35:49,136 --> 00:35:51,056
No wonder Zheng Yingjun
doesn't look like

649
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:53,176
he owes people a lot of money.

650
00:35:54,297 --> 00:35:55,457
Daqian, what are you muttering about?

651
00:35:56,897 --> 00:35:57,616
Nothing.

652
00:35:59,777 --> 00:36:00,377
Let me help you.

653
00:36:04,337 --> 00:36:05,016
Be careful.

654
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:09,457
Don't move.

655
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:16,576
Yan,

656
00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:20,216
are you single now?

657
00:36:26,857 --> 00:36:27,616
Daqian.

658
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:30,096
I want to tell you

659
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:31,857
I'm back this time

660
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:35,897
to fulfill our promise.

661
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:37,616
What promise?

662
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:47,297
Daqian, happy birthday.

663
00:36:53,857 --> 00:36:54,977
What did you wish for?

664
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:57,417
I wish

665
00:36:59,297 --> 00:37:00,817
we're not just friends.

666
00:37:02,257 --> 00:37:03,216
I want us

667
00:37:04,777 --> 00:37:06,056
to be together.

668
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:16,977
Daqian, I...

669
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:21,857
How about 30 years old?

670
00:37:22,817 --> 00:37:23,937
If you're still single

671
00:37:23,937 --> 00:37:24,897
when you're 30,

672
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:29,176
we won't be friends anymore. Okay?

673
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:33,417
Then

674
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:35,656
we'll just get married

675
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:37,737
when that time comes.

676
00:37:39,937 --> 00:37:40,817
Get married?

677
00:37:42,297 --> 00:37:43,016
You two?

678
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:46,377
I mean us?

679
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:50,777
Wait a minute.

680
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,337
Based on what you said,

681
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,937
you turned me down at the time.

682
00:37:57,897 --> 00:37:58,937
I didn't turn you down.

683
00:37:59,897 --> 00:38:01,337
At that time,

684
00:38:01,576 --> 00:38:02,977
I was buying time.

685
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:04,817
You know

686
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:06,257
my family

687
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:08,257
was still in huge debt.

688
00:38:09,656 --> 00:38:12,216
My family was in a mess at the time.

689
00:38:12,696 --> 00:38:14,857
Not to mention
being financially independent.

690
00:38:18,937 --> 00:38:19,737
After that,

691
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:21,937
I heard you ran away from home.

692
00:38:22,457 --> 00:38:23,696
I was really worried about you.

693
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:25,937
If I had chosen

694
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:27,216
to stay by your side,

695
00:38:27,817 --> 00:38:29,656
none of those would have happened.

696
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:31,737
So the moment I saw you

697
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:33,056
when I came back,

698
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:34,656
I thought

699
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:36,176
this might be a chance to start over.

700
00:38:36,176 --> 00:38:36,857
Stop.

701
00:38:38,977 --> 00:38:39,737
You?

702
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:41,977
Of all people,

703
00:38:41,977 --> 00:38:44,096
why would you like me?

704
00:38:44,297 --> 00:38:46,377
Why wouldn't I?

705
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,216
It's...

706
00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:49,337
It's because you would never

707
00:38:49,337 --> 00:38:51,176
like me.

708
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:52,937
We're...

709
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:54,937
We're best friends.

710
00:39:04,536 --> 00:39:05,257
Daqian,

711
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:08,056
I knew you

712
00:39:08,777 --> 00:39:10,297
had feelings for me since young.

713
00:39:10,977 --> 00:39:12,297
I didn't have the courage,

714
00:39:12,496 --> 00:39:13,496
and I regretted it so much.

715
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:17,056
I'm serious.

716
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:20,496
I want to fulfill our promise.

717
00:39:23,857 --> 00:39:25,297
No, you don't get it.

718
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:27,777
You won't get any benefits
from dating me.

719
00:39:28,337 --> 00:39:30,937
Are you certain

720
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,656
we were talking about getting...

721
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:34,817
Married.

722
00:39:36,696 --> 00:39:38,616
Your story took a turn too suddenly.

723
00:39:38,616 --> 00:39:40,337
You need to let me think about this.

724
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:42,257
I have to think about this.

725
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:42,977
I need to think.

726
00:39:42,977 --> 00:39:43,817
Daqian.

727
00:39:44,496 --> 00:39:45,297
Daqian.

728
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:41,176
This Zheng Daqian

729
00:40:41,176 --> 00:40:43,176
is completely different from me.

730
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:16,096
It's a diary.

731
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:21,536
Today is my 25th birthday.

732
00:41:21,536 --> 00:41:24,136
Junze prepared a birthday cake for me.

733
00:41:24,656 --> 00:41:25,857
My love confession didn't go well.

734
00:41:25,857 --> 00:41:27,817
He politely turned me down.

735
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,056
The plot turned into
such a twist too quickly.

736
00:41:33,016 --> 00:41:34,216
In this parallel world,

737
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:36,576
I like Yan,

738
00:41:37,297 --> 00:41:39,056
and he likes me too?

739
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:43,616
If I reject him,

740
00:41:44,176 --> 00:41:46,417
won't I be ruining
a good thing for them?

741
00:41:46,777 --> 00:41:48,417
If I accept him...

742
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:49,737
No. No way.

743
00:41:50,016 --> 00:41:51,016
I'm not her.

744
00:41:51,016 --> 00:41:53,616
Doing this would mean
I'm toying with his feelings.
