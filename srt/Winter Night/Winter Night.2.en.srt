Leave home to get some fresh air?

The kid left home.

Yet, all you do is
having drinks at home.

You're such an alcoholic.

Our daughter just came back.

And you got violent
without warning.

79
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,370
I would've run away
if I were your daughter.

Go ahead. Just leave.

81

If you leave,

82
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,840
I'll go out and light firecrackers.

83
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
I'll take the rocket and go to Shenzhen.

84

What did I tell you?

85
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,930
I've told you
that something's wrong with the boiler.

86
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,810
And I asked you to get it repaired.

87
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,130
What did you do?

88
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,960
I met

89

my colleagues
of the troupe halfway.

90
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,370
They wanted to have drinks with me.

91
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,200
I rejected them but they insisted.

92
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,520
And I forgot about it.

93
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,050
I can't use the boiler now. What to do?

94
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,520
Why do you raise your voice?

95
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,760
It's just a boiler. No big deal.

96
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,370
I could repair it by myself.

97
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,840
Stop messing around.

98
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,610
You might damage it,
if you keep doing this.

99
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,930
Well, just go in there.

100
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,930
It's just a glitch. Leave it to me.

101
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,200
All of my savings and assets,
RMB 50,000

102
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,320
will be divided in this way
on my own free will...

103
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,960
My mum is here.

104
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
And my dad is still alive.

105
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,880
Yes.

106
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,690
This must be a dream, right.

107
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,130
This is a dream.

108
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
You must bring it along.

109
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Keep it on round the clock.

110
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,370
Your dad is tinkering with it.
Just wait for it.

111
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,840
What's wrong with you?

112
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,570
You don't have a fever.

113
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,010
Why are you murmuring?

114
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,810
You've changed your hairstyles.

115
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,250
Where are your specs?

116
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,880
You switched it to contact lens?

117
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,200
There are a good news and a bad news.

118
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,050
Tell me the bad news.

119
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,680
The tools we have are not handy.

120
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,450
What about your skills?

121
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,610
I've called Technician Guo just now.

122
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,730
But he can't make it here anytime soon.

123
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,730
What are we going to do now?

124
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,450
We've got a good news.

125
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Mu gave me a call.

126
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,250
He invited us over for dinner.

127
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,250
Since we've got to wait
for the technician,

128
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,400
we should just have dinner
at his house while we wait.

129
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,760
Well,

130
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,040
how could you be so clueless?

131
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,880
Daqian, you must be hungry.

132
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,130
Just clean up the things.

133
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,970
Let's go to Mu's house and have drinks.

134
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,640
His son was just discharged
from hospital.

135
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,760
It's inappropriate to disturb them.

136
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,450
What do you mean?

137
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,920
Guoliang is in a good mood today.

138
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,730
Both of our families
can celebrate it together.

139
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,250
It's exciting.

140
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,450
He just came back from hospital.

141
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,680
His condition is still unknown.

142
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,680
Mind your words when we go there.

143
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,520
Uncle, Aunt.

you're back.

148
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,850
Zixi, how's your brother doing?

149
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,130
He's perfectly fine.

150
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,330
My parents are very happy.

151
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,400
That's great.

152
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:30,970
Let's go inside.

153
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,010
Let's go.

154
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,370
What are you staring at?

155
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,490
Today is a big day.

156
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,040
Our son narrowly escaped the danger.

157
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,130
Also Daqian,

158
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,130
has repented.

159
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,970
I'm really happy.

160
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,880
So I must...

161
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,680
I must propose a toast.

162
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,850
What are you doing?
What has it got to do with you?

163
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,010
Right.

164
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,210
I'm happy
that our families' sufferings are over.

165
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,640
Come.

166
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,610
You just came.

167
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,040
And here you go again.

168
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,730
You've worked hard, Guoliang.

169
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,850
Thanks for the hard work, Huixian.

170
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,850
You just returned from hospital.

171
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,850
And you've prepared
a table full of dishes.

172
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,010
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

173
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,680
Is the kid alright?

174
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,330
He's done a full body check-up.

175
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,760
He's completely fine.

176
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,280
Mu and I are glad about that.

177
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,250
It's great that he's fine.

178
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,800
So I have to give
these two kids my blessing.

179
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,090
The hardships they go through are
their fortunes in future.

180
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,370
Zixi, what had happened to your brother?

181
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,010
Daqian,

182
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,610
don't be disheartened. You hear me?

183
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,280
Look.

184
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,970
A thousand hills crimsoned through.

185
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,640
By their serried woods deep-dyed.

186
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
And a hundred barges vying,
over crystal blue waters.

187
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,610
Eagles cleave the air.
Fish glide in the limpid deep.

188
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,040
Under freezing skies
a million creatures contend in freedom.

189
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,280
I ask this boundless land,
who rules over man's destiny?

190
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,400
Are you done?

191
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,280
Calm down.

192
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,680
I'm cutting to the chase now.

193
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,250
Where was I?

194
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,520
Zixi,

195
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,880
your dad seemed to have said

196
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,400
the food is still on the stove.

197
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,680
- Yes.
- Right.

198
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,400
Right.

199
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,850
I forgot about it.

200
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,800
You guys eat first.

201
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,520
Thanks, Aunt.

202
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:19,800
Don't forget

203
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,560
to ask your brother
to come down and eat.

204
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,490
He's not hungry.

205
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,010
Forget about it.
Let him sleep a little longer.

206
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,760
Let's cook for him when he wakes up.

207
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,680
Okay.

208
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,880
What's wrong with Mu Zili?

209
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,560
Isn't he starting
a business in Ningzhou?

210
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,760
Start a business?

211
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,450
He has long failed
and returned to be a neet.

212
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,450
A neet?

213
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,640
Your Uncle Mu was afraid
he'd be greatly affected.

214
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,280
He was trying to talk to Zili.

215
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,210
Yet, he threw a tantrum.

216
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,850
Then, he packed his stuff and left.

217
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,400
He got into a car accident

218
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
on the highway
before he reached Tieyuan.

219
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,010
He ended up suffering a concussion.

220
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,610
He has trouble remembering many things.

221
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,450
He has lost his memories?

222
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,640
It's not that case.

223
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,920
He remembers us.

224
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,560
Just that there's something

225
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,010
he can't remember.

226
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,760
How's he doing now?

227
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,280
He can't remember everything?

228
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,490
Where is he now?

229
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,450
It won't do. I've got to see him.

230
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,520
Where are you going?

231
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,760
You haven't even sorted out
your own problems.

232
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,280
Don't trouble him.

233
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,210
Come back and eat your food.

234
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,370
Right.

235
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,760
I haven't sorted out my own problems.

236
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,330
Zheng Yingjun is still alive.

237
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,090
Gong Xiaoqin didn't go to Shenzhen.

238
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,370
Mu Zili got into a car accident.

239
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,040
I almost forget that this is a dream.

240
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,730
All of this is fake.

241
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,490
I'm back to get
the relocation compensation.

242
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,330
Yes.

243
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,760
It won't do.

244
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,450
I have to wake up and take my money.

245
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,640
Xiaoqin,

246
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,520
what's gotten into Daqian?

247
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,130
She has made a lot of scenes
after returning from Ningzhou.

248
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,520
Should we take her to hospital?

249
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,680
Can we eat now?

250
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:33,730
Mum,

251
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,010
don't always lose your temper.

252
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,210
Dad,

253
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,130
drink less.

254
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,330
It's alright.

255
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,090
Aunt Hui,

256
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,880
take care of yourself.

257
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,640
Zixi,

258
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,800
say hello to your brother for me.

259
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,250
Uncle Mu,

260
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,730
thanks for your treat.

261
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,040
I'm really happy to see you guys.

262
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,090
Just that I should wake up

263
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,490
from this dream.

264
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,490
My fishes.

265
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,370
Why am I still here?

266
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:53,970
Are you thirsty?

267
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,680
Lizi?

268
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,850
Why haven't I sobered up?

269
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,610
Isn't this supposed to be a dream?

270
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,250
Don't hit me,
I was just discharged from hospital.

271
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,850
You were really admitted to hospital?

272
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,800
I got it.

273
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,610
You must be pulling

274
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,040
a prank on me, right?

275
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,640
It's not right.

276
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,210
But, why is my dad here?

277
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,850
Why are you still alive?

278
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,090
Does it hurt?

279
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:55,800
It hurts.

280
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,880
How dare you talk nonsense?
You're so rude.

281
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,040
You've passed away for a few years.

282
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,880
Aunt,

283
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,680
I think something's wrong with her head.

284
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,090
Let's take her to hospital now.

285
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,280
I think so.

286
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,800
Go on. Let's go now.

287
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,010
No, I'm not going to hospital.

288
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,370
From now on,

289
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,680
just leave me alone.

290
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:18,970
I've got to get my head around this.

291
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,970
I need to get this straight.

292
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,520
Lizi,

293
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,280
go get Daqian a dry cloth. Quick.

294
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,850
Okay.

295
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,330
The washroom is over here.

296
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,730
This is not a dream.

297
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Where am I?

298
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,130
Zheng Yingjun hasn't died.

299
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,850
Gong Xiaoqin hasn't divorced him.

300
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,760
I've returned to the past.

301
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,450
It's not right.

302
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,010
Mu Zili and I are still at the same age.

303
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,080
We didn't go back to age 18.

304
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,280
I've got you some clean clothes.

305
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,600
Get yourself changed.

306
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Let me ask you this, Mu Zili.

307
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,800
Were you at Ningzhou yesterday?

308
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,520
You just returned to Baihe
from Ningzhou?

309
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,360
What are you talking about?

310
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,250
When did I go to Ningzhou?

311
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,120
What is

312
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,930
the date today?

313
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,840
Those who ask this kind of question

314
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,210
are normally mentally ill.

315
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,320
I don't seem to know it as well.

316
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,560
The first of November 2018.

317
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,120
Even if we went back three months
in time,

318
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,040
there's no way
that Zheng Yingjun would still be alive.

319
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,890
Can you think
about Uncle Yingjun's goodness?

320
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,280
Let me ask you this, Mu Zili.

321
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,730
What had happened to you?

322
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,600
What made your startup fail?

323
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,250
I...

324
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,360
How did you get into the accident?

325
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,890
I just got into it.

326
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,890
I was lucky to have God's blessing.

327
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,410
I only injured my head.

328
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,560
Besides that, I'm fine.

329
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,760
I just woke up this morning.

330
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,490
I heard it from my parents.

331
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,600
They said my business failed
a few months ago.

332
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,930
Your business failed a few months ago?

333
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,120
You were in Baihe this whole time?

334
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,320
You were in the hospital yesterday?

335
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,250
No. How is that possible?

336
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:02,760
Mu Zili,

337
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,520
I'm asking you a very serious question.

338
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,010
You have to be honest with me.

339
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,010
You

340
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,360
and I,

341
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,840
over the past period,

342
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,360
have we

343
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,210
ever slept

344
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,010
with each other?

345
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,800
Slept?

346
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,600
How? What does it mean?

347
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,490
Like

348
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,600
having sex.

349
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,320
Are you crazy? Of course not.

350
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,250
Think it over.

351
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:43,800
- No.
- Well.

352
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,410
How can you forget about such a thing?

353
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,970
Mu Zili,

354
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,800
what are you doing?

355
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,210
Mu Zili,

356
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,730
what are you doing?

357
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,760
Open the door.

358
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,080
Are you nuts? Open the door!

359
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,650
Lizi, what's wrong? What happened?

360
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,840
What's gotten into you, Mu Zili?

361
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,690
- Are you insane?
- Aunt.

362
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,360
Open the door!

363
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,560
All aspects of her body

364
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,840
look quite normal.

365
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,490
Let's say she might be mentally ill,

366
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,320
but her enunciation

367
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,520
is clear.

368
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,360
I guess

369
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,040
she's experienced an emotional shock.

370
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,040
Then, it's not a mild shock.

371
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,760
I can tell that the way

372
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,010
Daqian looks at us,

373
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,010
the way she talks and her movement

374
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,840
are different from before.

375
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,450
She's in shock
as she was jilted in Ningzhou.

376
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,450
Didn't she leave home
because of this?

377
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,360
Did our daughter go
to Ningzhou for that jerk?

378
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,490
Cut the nonsense.

379
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,210
Let's wait and see.

380
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,410
Maybe she'll be fine after she has

381
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,360
calmed down.

382
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,010
Yes, let's wait and see.

383
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,560
Dinner is ready. Come and eat up.

384
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,970
Look at this, Guoliang.

385
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,040
We kept making fuss
as soon as we came here.

386
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,800
Don't be so polite. Eat up.

387
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,490
Yes, food is what matters the most.

388
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,280
- Let me out!
- Mu works hard to cook it.

389
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,210
- Don't waste it.
- Mu Zili!

390
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,650
Calm down.

391
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,490
Just give me a sign if you're hungry.

392
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,800
I'll save some for her.

393
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,450
Let's go.

394
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,690
Let me out!

395
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,840

No way. It's impossible.

Something is wrong
with Zheng Daqian's head.

She finally quiets down.

Everything in Mu's house is good.

409
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,800
Just that their guest room is small.

You're so annoying.

Just get the boiler fixed.

How can our family sleep in their house?

413

The bed

414
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,800
is not as warm as ours.

415
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,010
What's wrong? Why aren't you sleeping?

416

it wasn't an illusion

Hey!

I'm sorry.

This is our first day here.

But we've made the place so lively.

452
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,360
It's making us restless.

453
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,120
How can you put it that way?

454

Yes.

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,560
But yesterday,

459
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,490
I heard from Lizi

460
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,410
that Daqian had asked him
a lot of strange questions.

461
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,250
What did she ask him?

462
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,280
I wonder what has happened

463
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
to this kid.

464
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,250
She kept asking me

465
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,800
when the demolition will start.

466
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,840
- Yes.
- It's like we're not her parents.

467
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,800
What kind of shock has she experienced?

468
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,760
- Yes, gosh.
- It's killing us.

469
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,080
Here.

470
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,410
Try this.

471
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,450
This is the bird nest from Malaysia.

472

I'll help myself.

473
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,690
It was sold

474
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,970
in my supermarket.

475
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,800
But no one bought it. It's expensive.

476
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,930
It's just the saliva of the swallows.

477

This is what they said.

478
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,970
I bought it once before.

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
And I tried it.

480
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,730
It was tasteless.

I didn't mean it, Guoliang.

484
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,410
How does it taste?

485
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,930
Indeed, it's tasteless.

00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,970
Your brother will come and help me.

500
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,010
Get a good rest.

501
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,080
Get some rest.

502
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,210
I'll be in the studio.

503
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,560
Lizi, be sure
to eat more during breakfast.

504
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,120
What else do you need?

505
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,280
Is the pocket money enough for you?

506
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,410
I'll give you more.

507
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,650
That would be wonderful.

508
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,560
Thanks, Mum.

509
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,410
I'm full.

510
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:39,890
Zixi,

511
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,250
what's the rush?

512
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,760
It's rare
that your brother woke up early.

513
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,120
Just sit here and eat with your brother.

514
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,010
I'm not an idle man.

515
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,450
I don't have the time.

516
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,250
You...

517
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,360
He's talking about your uncle.

518
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,490
I just heated up the milk.
Why did he leave?

519
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,210
I've got osteoporosis.

520
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,410
I need extra calcium.
I'll drink it for him.

521
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,280
What's wrong?

522
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,800
He's pouting.

523
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,320
He's talking about me.

524
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,690
Lizi, I've transferred
the pocket money to you.

525
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:18,840
Well received, Mum.

526
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,490
Good.

527
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,560
I'm going to the studio.

528
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,040
Mum, I think I should go with you.

529
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,890
It's not necessary. Just lie down.

530
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,520
Okay.

531
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,650
Yingjun,

532
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,010
I'm talking to you.

533
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,040
I'm talking to you.

534
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,280
Don't act like an idle man.

535
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Guard her for me.

536
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,080
If it won't work,
I'll take the afternoon off

537
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,080
and take her to hospital with you.

538
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,080
You hear me?

539
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,040
Stop nagging.

540
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,970
You've said it a hundred times.
She's a living person.

541
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:40,650
How could I let her

542
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,520
sneak out right under my nose?

543
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,970
This is not your house.

544
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,520
Have some sense.

545
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,080
Do the cleaning with Mu. You hear me?

546
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,760
I'm here as a guest.

547
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,280
Let my buddy do the honors.

548
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,970
What's wrong with that?

549
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,320
You're right.

550
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,490
I'm glad that you're here.

551
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,320
Here, have some fruits.

552
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,800
Mu, there's always some blabbermouths

553
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,690
trying to sow discord among us buddies.

554
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,120
How is that possible?

555
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,840
She wasn't even here when we first met.

556
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,010
That's right.

557
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,320
There's something
I've got to handle in the factory.

558
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,690
Go on.

559
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,450
I haven't seen this.

560
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,690
Dear Zili,

561
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,730
you grew up with Daqian.

562
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,760
You know her well.

563
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,690
What's gotten into her?

564
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,120
I think

565
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,520
she was traumatized due to her breakup.

566
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,560
It's no big deal.

567
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,650
Then, let me ask you.

568
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,280
What do you think
about my daughter, Zheng Daqian?

569
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,320
She's quite nice.

570
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,320
How nice is she?

571
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,010
Well,

572
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,890
I can say
that she has precisely inherited

573
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,120
the good genes from you and Aunt Qin.

574
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,890
Yes.

575
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,650
I think you and Daqian share
a lot of common grounds

576
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,800
and have the same personality.

577
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,930
But the appearance...

578
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,010
Right.

579
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,210
Uncle, I'm not good enough for her.

580
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,170
No.

581
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,760
You two grew up together.

582
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,650
You're her childhood friend.
You're perfect for each other.

583
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,170
Both of us?

584
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,650
Hello?

585
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,520
What's wrong?

586
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,970
They have a fight.

587
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:34,970
What is it about?

588
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,280
Okay, I got it.

589
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,170
Calm down. Don't do anything rash.

590
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,690
I'm coming over.

591
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,690
Or it'll become a crime scene soon.

592
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,760
I'll be right there.

593
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,450
What happened, Uncle?

594
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,360
Dear Zili,

595
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
the two buddies of mine

596
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,320
are having a fight
because of some small matters.

597
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,690
It can't be settled if I don't go now.

598
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,280
Watch over Daqian for me.

599
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,010
I'll be right back.

600
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:57,690
No problem.

601
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,690
Go on, Uncle.

602
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,320
Okay.

603
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,650
Dad?

604
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,520
Mum?

605
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,490
Are you there?

606
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,930
Let me out, Dad, Mum!

607
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,690
I'm the only one left here.

608
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:14,890
Just save it.

609
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,410
Mu Zili, it's really an emergency.

610
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,930
Let me out, will you?

611
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,800
Get more sleep
if something's wrong with your head.

612
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,250
What's the hurry?

613
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,560
I need to pee.

614
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,930
It's my grandfather's.

615
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,840
Serve your purpose.

616
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,320
How dare you, Mu Zili.

617
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,520
That's more like it.

618
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,730
As your buddy,

619
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,840
it breaks my heart
when I see you two turn

620
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,450
against each other
and bear harsh feelings

621
00:30:58,930 --> 00:30:59,760
on one another,

622
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,520
because of a little money.

623
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,560
Today,

624
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,520
I want all the buddies here
to bear witness.

625
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,170
We'll move on

626
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,490
after drinking this wine.

627
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,360
Agree?

628
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,080
Agree.

629

Mu Zili, I'm not feeling well.

636
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,970
Mu Zili, my stomach aches.

637

It's real.

How do you feel?

Can you make it up?

645
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,930
I'm fine. It's stomach cramps.

It's a chronic problem.

I think I should call your parents.

I can't handle you alone.

Ma'am, I'll take this.

668
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,600
I'll go get a cup of water

Sure.

Nothing else?

It's just the stomach pill.

No, young man.

Yes, I'm paying for it now.

empty accusations in plain sight?

Why did you steal
the lubricating oil, then?

Why would I steal it?
