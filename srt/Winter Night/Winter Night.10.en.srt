I'm so sorry

17
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,630
about Uncle Yingjun.

18
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,670
If I knew Dahua targeted Uncle Yingjun,

19
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,950
I'd stop her

20
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,550
however I could.

21
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,590
Actually, Dahua was my roommate.

22
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,670
We previously worked in retailing,

Our longest job

00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,910
was doing a live stream.

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,710
Good day, Mr. Li.

28
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,350
Mi Lan, please stop the live stream
for a while.

29
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,870
We've been observing you
for the past month

30
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,790
and found that you don't have
much of a speciality,

31
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,990
and your performance
on-stream is lacklustre.

32
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,710
This

33
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,630
is the public persona
we crafted for you.

We're crafting your image

in terms of educational background,
life experience and family.

36
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,430
But I can't do the sexy type.

37
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,270
Mi Lan.

38
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,390
Do you think you have other values

There, there.

It's alright.

50

Dahua was always by my side

during my toughest days.

52
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,710
Afterwards, we began

53
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,430
to sell unqualified products

54
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,870
until we were taken into custody
by police.

55
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,750
Then, I came back to Baihe.

I'm really happy

when I met you all.

58
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,990
Hence, I wanted to hide my past
from you.

59
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,350
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,670
Where are you going?

61
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,150
Are you leaving secretly

62
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,790
before you pay for the room?

63
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,350
Are you going to abandon
the friends you invited?

64
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,470
Grandma.

65
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,670
I'm your granddaughter, right?

66
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,310
It's ridiculous when you ask me
to pay for the room.

67
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,230
The other grandmas hold
their grandchildren dear,

68
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,270
yet you always treat me indifferently.

69
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,630
Are you really my grandma?

70
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,910
I've called Mi Lihua already.

71
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,070
Where are you going this time?

72
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,030
Are you going to the ends of the earth

73
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,550
and avoid us all your life?

74
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,750
You're such a coward.

75
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,470
Don't make a fuss about past mistakes.

76
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,510
The sky would never collapse.

77
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,270
If you made a mistake,

78
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,990
you have to accept the punishment.

79
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,470
And you should keep your tail up

80
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,270
for the rest of your life.

81
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,830
Live your life

82
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,310
without shame.

83
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,150
Stop escaping.

84
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,230
Do you live up

85
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,150
to your mum's audacity?

86
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,750
She passed away years.

87
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,630
Why do you bring her up suddenly?

88
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,550
Do you know what kind of person
your mum is?

89
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,470
When she was young,

90
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,310
she worked at the crop field

91
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,190
with me.

92
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,870
When she got tired,

93
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,990
she'd rest at the ridge waiting for me.

94
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,110
She wouldn't make a noise

95
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,990
even if she got bitten by mosquitoes
all over her body.

96
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,870
After she grew up, she was drawn
to trendy things

97
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,070
like dancing. She would go downtown

98
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,910
in Tieyuan or Harbin

99
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,670
to join others for break dancing.

100
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,150
She never fell behind others.

101
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,870
After she was pregnant with you,

102
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,670
she went to work during the day

103
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,070
and then sold lunch boxes on the street

104
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,070
to give you better living conditions.

105
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,070
She never thought it'd be embarrassing.

106
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,470
Your mum

107
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,070
was passionate about her life

108
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,790
and she has given it

109
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,310
all her life.

110
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,910
You're her daughter.

111
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,910
Her soul continues through you.

112
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,270
She breathes every breath you take.

113
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,110
She smiles when you smile.

114
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,670
If you bend your brow
and collapse,

115
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,590
her

116
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,910
her soul

117
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,950
will then perish.

118
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,030
This is the bond
between mother and daughter.

119
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,630
Lan.

120
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,870
Listen.

121
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,550
Your mum

122
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,030
always sticks with you
no matter what.

123
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,310
Eat up.

124
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,950
And then leave here.

125
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,230
Don't hang around here.

126
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,550
Grandma, don't you eat with us?

127
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,830
I've eaten already.

128
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,270
Lanzi.

129
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,190
Grandma cooks good food.

130
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,990
But her temper

131
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,430
isn't as good.

132
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,830
Shut your mouth.

133
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,790
Mi Lan, you didn't mention
your grandma before.

134
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,070
I'm not close to her.

135
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,670
And she doesn't often go to Baihe.

136
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,310
Why doesn't she go to Baihe often?

137
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,710
After my mum passed away,

138
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,310
we stopped being in close contact

139
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,310
and she doesn't come back to Baihe.

140
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,990
Why?

141
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,470
Just eat your food, okay?

142
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,310
Stop asking.

143
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,270
Dig in.

144
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,670
What does grandma make a living
here alone?

145
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,470
She runs

146
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,870
a chess room here

147
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,150
and sells meal boxes.

148
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,590
She's faring well.

149
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,470
Let's visit grandma more often

150
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,390
afterwards.

151
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,430
Sure.

152
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,630
Mi Lan, eat some more.

153
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,350
We'll go home together after eating.

154
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,110
Sure.

155
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,590
Gosh.

156
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,750
We can't go back today.

157
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,630
Why?

158
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,790
It snowed heavily yesterday

159
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,950
and the roads were blocked.

160
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,590
Don't tell me we're going to stay here
one more night.

161
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,630
I'm okay with it though.

162
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,910
I'm fine with this.

163
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,230
I have no class at weekends.

164
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,710
Well, I'll request

165
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,990
from grandma then.

166
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,990
Get yourself together, please.

167
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,390
Enough of that sleepy faces.

168
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,670
You, don't pretend
that you're listening.

169
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,070
Since you hang around here,

170
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,310
you have to work.

171
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,190
The two of you

172
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,270
sweep snow

173
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,710
at the gate.

174
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,070
You two

175
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,190
catch the goose.

176
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,830
Why, grandma?

177
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,430
Silly.

178
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,590
I'm going to cook it.

179
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,190
Geez.

180
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,030
Come with me.

181
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,390
I prefer you.

182
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,070
Come to the chess room with me

183
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,070
to sell meal boxes.

184
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,230
Do your work well.

185
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,870
If you do it well,

186
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,110
your accommodation fees
can be cancelled.

187
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:10,910
Go now.

188
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,630
What does she like about him?

189
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,870
Who knows.

190
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,950
Let's go and catch the goose.

191
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,790
Have you caught gooses before?

192
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,310
Speaking of catching gooses,

193
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,230
it's not easy.

194
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,430
I know a thing or two about that.

195
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,030
You can't catch it without techniques.

196
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,990
You have to build a bond with the goose

197
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,190
and show your passion for it.

198
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,750
- As you give it a chance...
- Enough.

199
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,350
- it'll...
- Stop it.

200
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,510
Cut your nonsense.

201
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,070
Just say it. Which one are we catching?

202
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,390
The fatter one.

203
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,630
Later,

204
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,510
I go to the left
and you go to the right.

205
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,110
We flank the goose.

206
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:58,870
No problem.

207
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,430
Come on.

208
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,070
Go.

209
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,190
Close the door.

210
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,990
The fatter goose.

211
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,670
Dude.

212
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,830
I missed it.

213
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,430
What happened?

214
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,790
I sprained my leg.

215
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,030
Can you still walk?

216
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,910
My leg can't move.

217
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,150
Get up.

218
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,150
I'm sorry

219
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,470
that you have to work
as I invited you here.

220
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,630
It's fine.

221
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,150
Erm...

222
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,750
Well...

223
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,190
Are you still leaving?

224
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,470
Can you move your leg?

225
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,510
Yes.

226
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,710
Wait for me here.

227
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,470
Where are you going?

228
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,470
Endure it. Ice it for a while.

229
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,350
Why are you so careless

230
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,950
as to sprain your leg
while catching the goose?

231
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,670
The goose is really wild.

232
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,870
It kept chasing after me.

233
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,350
Where have you gone?

234
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,990
Yan, why are you back?

235
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,070
Grandma asked me
to get the equipment ready.

236
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,030
She's bringing us ice fishing later.

237
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,070
Ice fishing?

238
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,470
Ice fishing? Is your leg okay?

239
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,550
No problem. Look.

240
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,710
Let's go.

241
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,990
- Ice your leg first.
- Let's go ice fishing.

242
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,110
Ice your leg for a while more.
Let me hold on to you.

243
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,870
Faster.

244
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,310
Don't dawdle.

245
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,910
Hurry up.

246
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:40,750
Grandma.

247
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,870
Why do we need to bring so much
for ice fishing?

248
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,190
Faster and hop in.

249
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,110
Talk less.

250
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,590
Be quick.

251
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,710
- I'm going to move.
- Have you done yet?

252
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,070
Yes.

253
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,430
I'm so tired.

254
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,910
Mu Zili, help me.

255
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,430
Faster.

256
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,110
Grandma, we can't fit in the cart.

257
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,630
I didn't ask the men to get on.

258
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,750
Go down and push the cart.

259
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,350
Okay. Go down and push the cart, Daqian.

260
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,630
I'm a girl.

261
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,790
Are you?

262
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,310
Your inactive limbs

263
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,950
need some exercise.

264
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,910
Hurry.

265
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,270
Come on, push harder.

266
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,990
Push harder.

267
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,230
Come on, three, two, one.

268
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:25,990
Push.

269
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,790
One, two, three.

270
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,470
Push harder.

271
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,550
Mu Zili, you're so weak.

272
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,030
I've tried my best.

273
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,590
Grandma, we haven't hopped in yet.

274
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,630
Grandma.

275
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,430
When are we arriving at the place?

276
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,190
We've been walking for twenty minutes.

277
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,710
We're reaching soon.

278
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,430
Grandma, can you catch fishes

279
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,150
on such a cold day?

280
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,550
Shut your mouth if you want to eat.

281
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,910
Move.

282
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,270
Honestly, I'm not very hungry.

283
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,070
Alright.

284
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,190
We'll do it here.

285
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,870
You look so worn out.

286
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,990
You need more exercise for sure.

287
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,990
Careful.

288
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,350
Get up.

289
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,110
Look at you.

290
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,990
Faster and get up.

291
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,910
Are you alright?

292
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,070
The three of you.

293
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,550
Set up the tent.

294
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,750
You.

295
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,590
The two of you, drill holes.

296
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,870
Chop-chop.

297
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,030
Alright, Grandma.

298
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:03,990
Quick.

299
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,590
You'll get used to this
if you move more.

300
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,630
Let's go back home.

301
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,390
Let's go.

302
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,150
Right.

303
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,350
Pull harder.

304
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,110
The two of you, pull harder.

305
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,310
Right, pull harder.

306
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,110
You, pull harder.

307
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,670
Very good.

308
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,670
It's open, Lizi.

309
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,310
Faster.

310
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:53,990
Yan.

311
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,750
Come here. This hole is opend.

312
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,950
Grandma, the holes have been opened already.

313
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,430
Well done. Come here.

314
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,230
Move the tent over there.

315
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,150
Come on.

316
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,750
One, two, three. Lift.

317
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,110
Good.

318
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,590
Well, walk slowly.

319
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,950
Move the tent over here.

320
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,030
Come on.

321
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,910
Good.

322
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,710
Very good.

323
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,510
Put it over the holes.

324
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,790
Lift higher.

325
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,190
Lift.

326
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,470
Come over there.

327
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,070
Have we reached the holes?

328
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,190
Good.

329
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,550
Good. Put the tent down.

330
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,710
Cover the lower part of the fly sheet well.

331
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,070
Good. Cover the fly sheet
over there well.

332
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,550
Are you done?

333
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,150
Yes.

334
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,150
Let's go inside and ice fishing.

335
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,230
Come on, Daqian.

336
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,150
Let's go.

337
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,350
It's chilly outside.

338
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,430
Grandma.

339
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,310
- Come on in.
- Be careful.

340
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,950
Grandma.

341
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,510
Is there any fish down there?

342
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,750
When can we catch one?

343
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,870
The hole is too small.

344
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,430
Big fishes can't pass through it, right?

345
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,110
I'm going to pass out from starvation.

346
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,470
My blood sugar has dropped.

347
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,070
What are we going to eat
without the fish?

348
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,510
Zixi. Is the sweet potato done yet?

349
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,310
I have no idea

350
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,670
how long it'd take.

351
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,910
One just isn't enough for us.

352
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,070
Enough.

353
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,430
Stop complaining. You've affected me.

354
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,710
Leave.

355
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,870
Get out of here.

356
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,950
All of them have gone out.

357
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,470
Don't you join them?

358
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,670
Grandma.

359
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,590
You'll be alone here

360
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,230
if I leave too.

361
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,350
I enjoy fishing too.

362
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,390
I'll stay here with you.

363
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,190
Daqian.

364
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,710
Daqian, look what I found.

365
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,830
You're so childish playing this.

366
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,230
It's really fun. Sit on it.

367
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,950
What's so fun about this? Boring.

368
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,870
Sit on it.

369
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,550
Don't make me fall.

370
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,190
I won't.

371
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,310
My goodness.

372
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,910
Good. Sit tight.

373
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,350
Don't be too fast.

374
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,030
Three, two, one.

375
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,230
I didn't know you were so heavy.

376
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,310
It's fun.

377
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,470
Zixi.

378
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,910
Did you hear that sound?

379
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,790
The 'dong-dong' sound.

380
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:37,990
Listen.

381
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,870
It's from the sound of
the cracking ice layer.

382
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,070
Will it be dangerous?

383
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,310
No.

384
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,910
The ice layer cracks
because of the change

385
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,310
in its density and volume.

386
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,070
You're amazing.

387
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,470
The temperature at noon is higher.

388
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,470
Fishes will be more active
and swim up higher.

389
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,510
In other words,

390
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,270
one must seize the right moment.

391
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,510
It's the same principle

392
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,630
when fishing the fish and someone.

393
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,030
Got it?

394
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,590
Fishing someone?

395
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,150
Since we share a hobby in common,

396
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,670
you can easily fathom what I meant.

397
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:35,830
Now,

398
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,430
I'll tell you something about Lanzi

399
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,630
so that you can learn more about her.

400
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,870
Grandma, you've misunderstood me.

401
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,950
You've taken me wrong.

402
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,070
Watch your fishing rod.

403
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,510
You've misunderstood me.

404
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,710
I mean it.

405
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,270
There's nothing can hide

406
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,710
from my sharp eyes.

407
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,350
My Mi Lan

408
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,670
is pretty and elegant.

409
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,950
When she was little,

410
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,270
people always said
she could become a superstar.

411
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,630
Do you agree?

412
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,190
Yes.

413
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,270
But, Grandma...

414
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,830
Just tell me. Do you think she's pretty?

415
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,750
Yes...she's.

416
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,470
It seems we share the same thought.

417
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,710
Well, I'll tell you about her

418
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,070
from her childhood times.

419
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,270
She stood out from others

420
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,470
when she was in kindergarten.

421
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,030
After she grew up,

422
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,430
she has rosy cheeks

423
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,470
and dazzling big eyes.

424
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,870
Everyone praises

425
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,350
her beauty.

426
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,880
♪There are flowers, a river, and you♪

427
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:58,920
♪In my dream♪

428
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:05,880
♪It breaks the convention♪

429
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,620
♪When the wind blows into the heart♪

430
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,430
It's my turn.

431
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,830
What?

432
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,750
You should pull me now. Faster.

433
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,550
How can I pull you?

434
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,750
You can. Quick.

435
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,470
Take this.

436
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,150
I'm going to start now.

437
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,150
Sit tight.

438
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,950
Lizi.

439
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,910
- Faster.
- Alright.

440
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,550
Go.

441
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,830
What's wrong?

442
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,910
Are you fine?

443
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,030
Look. The fish is frozen.

444
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,830
Little fish.

445
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,430
Little fish.

446
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,590
Little fish.

447
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,670
Little fish, I'm above you.

448
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,710
I'm above you.

449
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,230
Look, it's moving. It's alive.

450
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,910
It moves. It's swimming.

451
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,230
It's still alive.

452
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,600
♪Can I be sad and escape
for a little while?♪

453
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:33,280
♪Remember my problems
and the secret we shared♪

454
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,110
It smells so nice.

455
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,830
Grandma.

456
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,390
You really got the fish.

457
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,910
Grandma, you're amazing.
It smells so great.

458
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,150
You can eat now.

459
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,190
Grandma.

460
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,470
What about us?

461
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,870
Do you think you can eat

462
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,630
even if you didn't work for this?

463
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,150
The fish isn't for you.

464
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,910
Grandma, you're the best.

465
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,350
Thank you for taking us here

466
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,430
to enjoy the great view
of our nation.

467
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,310
Since we've been indulging ourselves
with the view the whole day,

468
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,310
- Yes.
- isn't it not good

469
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,830
if we feel hungry now, Grandma?

470
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,430
Grandma, you're my best grandma.

471
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,430
- That's right, Grandma.
- Dear grandma.

472
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,350
We'll treat you to a feast

473
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,750
when you go to Baihe.

474
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,030
- Grandma, please.
- Grandma, please.

475
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,270
Alright.

476
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,270
What a honey-tongued you have.

477
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,550
Let's eat.

478
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you, grandma.

479
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,910
You enjoy the food now.

480
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,950
After this, you need to do some work.

481
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,790
- Sure.
- You have to carry everything back.

482
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,590
Sure, no problem.

483
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,150
Ten.

484
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,630
Jack.

485
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,550
Jack.

486
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,150
Hold on. Let me count this.

487
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,550
Cut that out. Two from me.

488
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,310
Do you want some supper?

489
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,230
Where did you get those?

490
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,430
I stole them

491
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,270
from grandma's kitchen.

492
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,150
- Come on, let's eat.
- Come over, Mi Lan.

493
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:06,990
- Hurry.
- Delicious.

494
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,590
Faster.

495
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,190
Keep your voice down.
Don't wake grandma up.

496
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,830
So nice.

497
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,030
Whose turn?

498
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,030
Pass.

499
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,350
Take that for me.

500
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,750
Don't you want two?

501
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,750
- No.
- No.

502
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,030
I'm sorry, dude.

503
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,670
- Two jokers.
- He has a gin.

504
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,150
I knew he has the cards.

505
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,430
I thought you have one of the aces.

506
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,270
I didn't.

507
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,990
Faster. Stop arguing.

508
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,990
One more round.

509
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,310
No. We have to drive back tomorrow.

510
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,910
Can't we stay here for more days?

511
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,510
I'm okay with that.

512
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,750
I'll go

513
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,510
and request from grandma then.

514
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,390
Forget it.

515
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,430
We've come out for days.

516
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,590
Our family might be worried about us.

517
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,510
Since this is the last night,

518
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,550
Let's keep it

519
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,910
going all night.

520
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,870
Quiet.

521
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,950
Go to bed now.

522
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,110
Grandma has left, right?

523
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,270
I think so.

524
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,470
Continue. Come on.

525
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,630
I'm warning you,

526
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,230
keep quiet

527
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,590
and don't force my hand.

528
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,150
Good night, grandma.

529
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,270
Go to sleep.

530
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,470
We haven't finished this yesterday.
It'll be wasted.

531
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,470
Do you want some?

532
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,270
I...I...

533
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,270
I want to go to the toilet.

534
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,310
Feeling hot?

535
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,870
Join me?

536
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,310
No, thanks.

537
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,150
I'm going to the toilet.

538
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,910
The toilet.

539
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,670
We're leaving then, Grandma.

540
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,270
Do you still want to hang around here?

541
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,750
Why not you go back to Baihe with us?

542
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,750
No, I'm not going.

543
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,590
I'm representing Tiexi Village

544
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,710
in the sword dance competition
in Zhangjiatun next month.

545
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,710
I'm busy.

546
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,990
You've bothered

547
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,830
my practice

548
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,710
these days.

549
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,510
Take it

550
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,030
and leave now.

551
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,630
See you, Grandma.

552
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,430
- Go.
- See you, Grandma.

553
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,350
See you, Grandma.

554
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,310
It's sticky bean buns.

555
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,230
Supper.

556
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,870
One set of baked sweet potatoes,

557
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,270
one set of braised chicken feet,

558
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,950
one set of purple raisins,

559
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,350
and one set of green raisins.

560
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,790
Twenty yuan per person.

561
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,670
What's this?

562
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,470
Perhaps it's grandma's
bank account number.

563
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,230
- General.
- Put here.

564
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,190
You're going to lose, Mu.

565
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,950
Quiet.

566
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,230
General.

567
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,830
This move...

568
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,470
Is that a good move?

569
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,670
Well, what about here?

570
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,750
My chariot is here.

571
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,510
Dad, we're back.

572
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,070
Hey. How's your trip?

573
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,630
It was fun. We went ice fishing.

574
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,830
My nails fold are in pain
because of the cold.

575
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,430
Come over, harm them
with the thermos flask.

576
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,550
How's the game going, Uncle Mu and Dad?

577
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,310
Uncle Mu is just not my component.

578
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,510
Uncle Guoliang.

579
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,990
Uncle Yingjun.

580
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,870
It's you, Mi Lan.

581
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,150
I didn't expect this from her.

582
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,670
What do you mean?

583
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,550
It was you who found
such an unreliable project.

584
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,390
You were so anxious to make money
and didn't check it carefully.

585
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,270
Do you think you had the luck
for such an insanely lucrative business?

586
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,510
So, you're saying

587
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,390
that it's my own fault.

588
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,190
Mi Lan wanted to stop you.

589
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,350
She has totally no idea
that you were the target.

590
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,790
Did she stop you
from signing the contract, didn't she?

591
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,510
You were so anxious

592
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,670
thinking that you'd lose such benefits

593
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,430
and you gave your money away.

594
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,150
Uncle.

595
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,870
Mi Lan is innocent in this matter.

596
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,190
You're right.

597
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,310
She's innocent. What about me?

598
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,750
You deserved this.

599
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,830
Uncle Mu is right.

600
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,670
Uncle Yingjun,

601
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,750
Wang Dahua and I

602
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,830
did sell Ginseng Elixir before

603
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,510
and we were punished for that.

604
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,030
However, I had no idea

605
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,150
about she came to Baihe to meet you

606
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,150
for the product distributorship.

607
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,510
Please believe me.

608
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,950
After I was released,

609
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,070
I've determined

610
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,710
to live my life rightfully.

611
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,190
This time, I came to apologise to you.

612
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,390
I hope that you can forgive me,
Uncle Yingjun.

613
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,830
I'm so sorry.

614
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,270
She's an honest girl.

615
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,870
It's so precious
for a prodigal one to return.

616
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:21,870
Yingjun.

617
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,270
Give her your response.

618
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,390
Well.

619
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,030
I'm willing to let it slide, girl.

620
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,830
And I'll forgo

621
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,030
our past grievances.

622
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,390
But this is the last time.

623
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,710
You're generous, dad.

624
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,910
Whose turn?

625
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,670
It's me.

626
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,310
Are you sure you can play?

627
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,190
No, it's my turn.

628
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,790
Dazhi.

629
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,830
- Not you.
- It's my turn.

630
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:48,750
Which pawn?

631
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,590
Come, Daqian. Sit here.

632
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,470
I'll show you

633
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,830
- Sure.
- how I bring down...

634
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,270
your dad.

635
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,590
Dazhi.

636
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,870
Well.

637
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,710
When will Dahua be released?

638
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,990
Lanzi.

639
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,830
Is she your close friend?

640
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,550
Why are you still worrying about her?

641
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:16,990
She has come out.

642
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,910
Did she?

643
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,030
When?

644
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,430
Yesterday.

645
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,070
She signed the letter of guarantee
in the detention centre.

646
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,110
Besides, I've looked into the case.

647
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,830
She isn't related to the swindling case

648
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,870
that happened in some places

649
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,910
of the northeast side.

650
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,830
So, I released her.

651
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,830
Didn't she contact you?

652
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,150
She was silver-tongued

653
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,470
when she just came here.

654
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,950
But yesterday when I asked her
if she had enough money

655
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,950
and how was she going to leave here,

656
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,630
she kept silent.

657
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,550
She's good.

658
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,230
And you should cut ties with her.

659
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,230
Lanzi.

660
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,350
Please listen to me.

661
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,870
There's only one thing

662
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,390
you need to do now.

663
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,950
What's it?

664
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,310
How to cherish yourself well.

665
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,870
Hello, Ms. Liu.

666
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,230
Coming.

667
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,510
Lanzi's back.

668
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,470
Come on in.

669
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:24,830
Ms. Liu.

670
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,670
Your dad kept asking about you

671
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,070
when you were away these days.

672
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,350
Mi, Lanzi's back.

673
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:35,750
Dad.

674
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,790
I'd explained to you what I have to.

675
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,510
And I'd told you what I meant.

676
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,070
This time, I came back to tell you

677
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,870
that I've resigned from the library.

678
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,110
Hey, Mi.

679
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,350
This job isn't suitable for me.

680
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,150
I'll find a job I like.

681
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:03,790
Lanzi.

682
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,510
The meal is ready.
You can eat before you leave.

683
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,430
I'll get going, Ms. Liu.

684
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,110
Lanzi.

685
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,870
Leave her alone.

686
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,030
I didn't cook for her.

687
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,630
Don't throw your tantrum.

688
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,230
Lanzi.

689
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,430
It's rare that she came back home.

690
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,710
Why did you do this to her?

691
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,950
I thought you went back for lunch.

692
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,310
Why are you back so early?

693
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,710
Did you quarrel with your dad again?

694
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,790
Is it because of Dahua?

695
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,510
No.

696
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,110
I've resigned from the library.

697
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,710
Any problem with that?

698
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,150
You can look for a better job later.

699
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,510
Your dad will stop scolding you

700
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,950
when you make big money later.

701
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,070
It's difficult though.

702
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:13,950
Hua.

703
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,230
Bill, please.

704
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,590
By the way, Mr. Wang.

705
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,230
Is your shop sold yet?

706
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,390
Not yet. It's not easy though.

707
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,150
Take your time.

708
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,510
- Okay, done.
- Sure.

709
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,070
- Thanks.
- It's fine.

710
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,510
Son.

711
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,350
Do you want to work in
the sales department at dad's factory?

712
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,110
No.

713
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,310
Your aunt said she's going
to run a milk tea shop.

714
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,030
Your dad and I were considering

715
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,550
investing in the shop

716
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,110
so that you can manage the shop.

717
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,670
I'm not going anywhere.

718
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,150
I'll stay here with you.

719
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,390
Aunt Hui.

720
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,470
I came to talk to Lizi.

721
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,190
Well. I'll step out.

722
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:03,910
What's up?

723
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,150
Mu Zili.

724
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,030
We're friends,

725
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:12,950
right?

726
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,630
I have no money.

727
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,390
Was Aunt Hui talking about
the shop with you just now?

728
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,350
You can ask your parents
to invest in us.

729
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,510
Why are you persisting in that shop?

730
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,350
Isn't that you asked me to rely on you

731
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,950
so that I won't lose all my money?

732
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,790
Are you taking back your word now?

733
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,110
You can bluff...

734
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,590
You can encourage your dad to invest
in the shop.

735
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,270
After the building is demolished,

736
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,590
we share the profit.

737
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,550
Six for you and four for me.

738
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,950
Alright?

739
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,950
But, we can't bluff
without any preparation, right?

740
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,070
Speaking of business investment,

741
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,830
we should at least
come out with a project plan.

742
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,630
Sounds reasonable.

743
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,310
(Thank you for watching.)
This is our project plan.

744
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,790
Geez.

745
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,270
You're making this
as it's something serious.

746
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:12,990
Why?

747
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:14,590
Have you made up your mind

748
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,710
to take this shop?

749
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,470
That's right.

750
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,070
No one will seek food
at the Old Street though.

751
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,750
Nonsense.

752
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,390
That's right.

753
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,670
My idea of the hotpot karaoke centre
is more feasible than this.

754
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,350
Shut up.

755
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,790
What's the advantage of the investment

756
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,350
you saw in that place?

757
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,750
The price of the shophouses
at Old Street

758
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,590
is three thousand yuan per square metre

759
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,270
which is way lower than
the market price.

760
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,590
The development of Baihe tourism
in the next two years

761
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,790
will drive the rise
of the real estate industry.

762
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,190
Even if our business fails,

763
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,830
when the forest park is completed

764
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,350
in February next year,

765
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,470
which's the location
marked in the picture,

766
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,950
(Business Location Analysis)
the selling price of the shophouses

767
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,150
(Business Location Analysis)
won't be lower than the current price.

768
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,390
Plus, the government is likely

769
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,630
to turn the area of Old Street
into a forest park.

770
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,830
Once they do so,

771
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,910
we might get paid handsomely

772
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,550
for the demolition.

773
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,950
How do you know
the place will be demolished?

774
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,030
What if it doesn't?

775
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,270
Next, please listen to
the analysis from Mu Zili.

776
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,990
It works the same way as the stock.

777
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,310
Currently, the price-earning ratio
of this stock is good

778
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,870
and the price-to-book return is high.

779
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,590
There's a technique for investing

780
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,070
that's to investment purchase.

781
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,870
In other words,

782
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,670
you buy a stock

783
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,190
- after knowing its investment value...
- Very good, Zili.

784
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,110
Point take. It'll work.

785
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,150
I'll invest.

786
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,350
How much?

787
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,670
Five per cent.

788
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,550
Thank you so much, shareholder.

789
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,830
Where do you get that five per cent?

790
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,430
Isn't that we're on the same side?

791
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,550
Cut it out.

792
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,790
Well, as for the rest of the money,

793
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,230
I'll pay.

794
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,470
Congratulations

795
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:51,110
on becoming the first major shareholder
of our Old Street store

796
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,030
which possesses 49 per cent
of the controlling stake.

797
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,150
Congratulations.

798
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,230
Hold on.

799
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,110
As you know,

800
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,310
the real boss of our family is your mum.

801
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:07,430
I have one request.

802
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:10,110
Mu Zili must involve in the management
of the store practically.

803
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,590
Don't laze around at home.

804
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,030
Deal.

805
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,790
Let's have a toast for taking
the first step successfully.

806
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:24,510
Cheers.

807
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,230
Cheers.

808
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,390
Should you

809
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,150
inform the owner now?

810
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,150
You're right.

811
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,910
Hello, sir.

812
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,150
I have funds now.

813
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,590
We can sign the contract
as soon as possible.

814
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,590
Knock it off.

815
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,030
Never call me again.

816
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,710
Wait, I'm serious about...

817
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,830
