(I'm going to get rich.)

15
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,840
Coming!

16
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,840
Daqian is here.

17
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,920
Greetings to you, Ms. Liu.

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,360
I've brought you fruits and milk.

19
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,160
Where should I put them?

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Over here. Put them here.

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,840
This is too much.

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,760
Where is Mi Lan?

23
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,000
She's in her room.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,080
You guys talk first.

25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,480
I'll tell you when dinner is ready.

26
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,320
Mi Lan.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,280
What are you looking at?

28
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,400
Why is there no photo?

29
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,000
It used to be our family photo.

30
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,400
When did Mr. Mi and Ms. Liu get married?

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,080
Why didn't my mum know about that?

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,560
It's been three to four years.

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,520
That time,

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,560
they only applied
for a marriage certificate

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,040
and had a simple meal.

36
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,280
Why are there many books on the bed?

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,120
I haven't come back for several years.

38
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,960
So my dad used it as a study room.

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,680
How are you going to sleep here tonight?

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,080
I'll help you clean it up.

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
Never mind. I'm not going
to stay here, anyway.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,600
Lan, it's time for dinner.

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,360
Stop cleaning up, you two.

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,560
I'll clean it up after meal.

45
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,320
Let's go and eat.

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Come, let's eat.

47
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,360
Daqian, as we knew
you're stopping by today,

48
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,160
Mi personally made

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,840
a table full of dishes.

50
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,440
Try it. Eat more.

51
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,640
Thank you, Mr. Mi.

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,680
Eat up.

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,680
Try every dish.

54
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,560
We haven't seen Daqian for a long time.

55
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Daqian has achieved more than Mi Lan.

56
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,760
You've got into a renowned college.

57
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,320
You fought your way out of Baihe.

58
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,840
But I've returned to Baihe.
We end up the same.

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,680
It's good that you are back.

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,800
All of you have grown up.

61
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,440
We, as parents,

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,160
always wish you well.

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
It doesn't matter where you are.

64
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,800
Let's eat up.

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,640
Daqian,

66
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,320
what kind of job are you looking for?

67
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,120
I'm still in search of a job.

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,240
What about you?

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,600
I haven't decided it yet either.

70
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,040
Perfect, then.

71
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,720
I've found you a job.

72
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,320
What is it?

73
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,480
Our school library

74
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,240
is recruiting a librarian.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,240
It's an easy job.

76
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,400
You can take the offer first.

77
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
No, Dad. Can you discuss it with me

78
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,360
before you made the decision?

79
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,520
I don't like being a librarian.

80
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,240
Look.

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
You're getting old.

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,880
And you don't have any expertise.

83
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Why are you so picky?

84
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,880
Does it really matter
if you like it or not?

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
Don't you think so, Daqian?

86
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,560
I think one's own preference

87
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,840
does matter.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,480
It's highly possible to do it better

89
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,560
when you like it.

90
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,840
Yes.

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,360
Just do the job you like.

92
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,960
Lan,

93
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,240
don't stay in the hotel today.

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,600
Just move back here.

95
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,560
After the meal,

96
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
I'll clean the room, okay?

97
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,000
It's not necessary, Ms. Liu.

98
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,200
Well,

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,080
I'd like to stay with Daqian
for a few more days.

100
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:48,960
Yes.

101
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,200
I haven't been with Mi Lan for so long.

102
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
Let her stay with me.

103
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,640
Aren't you a little too old

104
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,040
for a sleepover?

105
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,760
You're causing troubles to her.

106
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
They're good friends.

107
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,760
Just let her be.

108
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,280
Eat more.

109
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,160
Let me help you.

110
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,080
It's not necessary.

111
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,760
Let me do it.

112
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,640
Go home, Daqian.

113
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,720
Stay safe.

114
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,240
I'll return to the hotel.

115
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Come home with me.
Why would you stay in hotel?

116
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,680
Aren't we staying in Lizi's house?

117
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,280
It'll cause troubles to them.

118
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,240
It won't do. I've promised your dad.

119
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,520
I've got to be responsible for you.

120
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,240
- But I...
- No buts.

121
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,320
Uncle Mu and Aunt Hui won't
overthink it.

122
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,080
Moreover, if they were afraid
of troubles,

123
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,200
why would they persistently offer you
a place in their home?

124
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,520
Okay, then.

125
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,640
Go house hunting
with me tomorrow.

126
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,560
No problem.

127
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,520
Let's go home.

128
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,160
Why don't we go somewhere else?

129
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,440
The buildings here feel old.

130
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,760
It's alright.

131
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,080
Aren't the rents cheap in Old Street?

132

(It's signed over.)

133
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,560

The owner has signed it over.

134
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,240
(It's signed over.)

135
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,400

What is this place?

136
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,960
(It's signed over.)

137
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,640

Did you forget about it?

138
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,760
(It's signed over.)
When we were in high school,

139
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,000
(It's signed over.)
we always ate here.

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,160
(It's signed over.)

141
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,800
(It's signed over.)
Right, yes, it rings a bell.

142
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,240
(It's signed over.)

143
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,840
(It's signed over.)
Their business was quite good back then.

144
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,480
(It's signed over.)
I didn't expect they signed it over.

145
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,840
(It's signed over.)

146
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,520
Mi... Mi Lan.

147
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,040
Mi Lan.

148
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,800
Mister.

149
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,000
You're back.

150
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm back.

151
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,520
That's great.

152
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,880
Mister, do you remember her?

153
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,200
She is Daqian.

154
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,240
The girl who used
to buy you a lot of candy.

155
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,960
She... She is not Daqian.

156
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,480
No.

157
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,480
She's not. She's not Daqian.

158
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,680
No! She's not Daqian.

159
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,520
No!

160
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,440
She's not Daqian.

161
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,320
Mi Lan,

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,960
who is he?

163
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,160
He's the younger brother
of the store's owner.

164
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,000
Have you forgotten?

165
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,120
I didn't expect him to remember me

166
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
after over ten years.

167
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,160
Hello, Yan.

168
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,640
Tell me about it.
Stop eating. This is a big deal.

169
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
- Come on.
- I can't.

170
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,800
Dazhi,

171
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,000
why are you so kind to treat us a meal?

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,600
Just take a seat.

173
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Because today is Niuniu's birthday.

174
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,480
I...

175
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,600
Who's Niuniu?

176
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,600
My son.

177
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,880
When did you get married?

178
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,360
When did you have a son?

179
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,800
I had the same reaction.

180
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,480
Who's the mother?

181
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,760
Why did you not speak of it before?

182
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,000
It's a long story.

183
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,400
I'll tell you next time.

184
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,200
Dad.

185
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,760
Come, son.

186
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,640
Greet them.

187
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,840
You must be Aunt Mi Lan.

188
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,800
My dad said Aunt Mi Lan is a goddess.

189
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,760
You're so sweet.

190
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,960
What about me?

191
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,080
Did your dad say I'm the second goddess?

192
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,080
My dad said Aunt Daqian is a Neet.

193
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,480
So you're not rich.

194
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,440
Little brat, do you know
what a Neet means?

195
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Aunt Mi Lan is pretty.

196
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,000
I suppose you could get
a boyfriend in future.

197
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,280
As for Aunt Daqian,

198
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,240
you need to get a job.

199
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,920
You've got to be independent.

200
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,800
Liu Dazhi, did you teach him that?

201
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Let me tell you this.
Take no offense at child's babble.

202
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,080
Dad, I'd like to have a beverage.

203
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,960
Let me see your teeth.

204
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,560
They're super strong.

205
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,440
Go get your beverage.

206
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,040
What's going on?

207
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,960
I have no idea. I'm perplexed as well.

208
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,160
Dazhi said he's not married.

209
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,880
I asked him just now
but he didn't say anything.

210
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,280
It'd be inappropriate to push further.

211
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,520
By the way, Daqian,

212
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,240
I've got an answer for your inquiry.

213
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,800
The logistics department
of my office is staffed up.

214
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,440
I'll help you ask the other departments.

215
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,920
I feel like a back-seat driver.

216
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,280
I sent his resume to various companies.

217
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,240
But he always plays cards
in the game room.

218
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,840
You're helping your father find a job?

219
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,400
I'm afraid my family will be torn apart

220
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,320
if this goes on.

221
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,000
What kind of job is suitable for my dad?

222
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,440
Or what job can I get for my dad?

223
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,040
Tourism is the primary industry
in Baihe in future.

224
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,040
Why don't we try to start in tourism?

225
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,360
Like starting a homestay?

226
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,920
But we need start-up funds

227
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,000
and a store.

228
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,880
I suppose the rent of those stores

229
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,200
in Old Street we saw is cheap.

230
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,040
Old Street?

231
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,520
The buildings in Old Street are
being demolished soon.

232
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,320
It's said to be built

233
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,960
into a museum or a forest park.

234
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
It'll become a new tourist site.

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,080
Demolish?

236
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,920
How much is the compensation?

237
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,080
RMB Two million!

238
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,880
Yan,

239
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,560
who said that?

240
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,720
I heard it from my colleagues.

241
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,560
No, this is not necessarily true.

242
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,680
So that is the place
which is going to be demolished.

243
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,800
I'm going to look for funding

244
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,600
and a store now.

245
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,720
You haven't eaten yet, Daqian.

246
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,640
Forget it. I'm leaving.

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,800
Mind your step.

248
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,320
Do you think Yingjun

249
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,120
can understand this romantic film?

250
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,240
Everyone was young once.

251
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,880
Why are you worried?

252
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,240
I mean

253
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,240
Yingjun has got no zest for life.

254
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,760
Xiaoqin is not as tolerant as me.

255
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
Uncle, Aunt, where's my mum?

256
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,520
Well, your dad took
your mum out for a movie.

257
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,440
My dad will fall asleep in less than
ten minutes while sitting still.

258
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,440
He can even take my mum out for a movie?

259
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,080
Why didn't you close the door?

260
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,320
Dad, Mum,

261
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,880
you guys went out for a movie?

262
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
What's wrong with my mum?

263
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,400
She's having menopause.

264
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,600
Dad.

265
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,040
What's gotten into you?

266
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,120
Your mum has worked hard
selling stuff all day long.

267
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,360
It's tough for her.

268
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,400
What are you staring at?

269
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,000
You're insensible.

270
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,760
You've worked hard, Mum.

271
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,480
Come, let me massage your legs.

272
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,840
Just say it.

273
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,240
What are you up to?

274
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,040
I have my eye on a store in Old Street.

275
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,000
The location is perfect
and the price is low.

276
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,640
Don't miss the chance.

277
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,080
Maybe we'll become rich

278
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,200
after the demolition.

279
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,800
It's being demolished.
Why would they sell it?

280
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,480
You're insensible.

281
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,240
Are you a fool?

282
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,240
Besides,

283
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,760
Old Street is a nondescript place.

284
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,800
It's a sparsely-populated area.

285
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Open a store there?

286
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,080
Self-marketing?

287
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,200
Do you think it's for my own sake?

288
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,680
This is for the sake of our family.

289
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,640
If we purchase the storefront,

290
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,840
you'll be the store manager.

291
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,600
So you're thinking of me.

292
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,320
Thank you. It's not necessary.

293
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,280
I've found a way out, right?

294
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,440
What is he up to again?

295
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,760
Your dad said
he wants to find a tourist spot

296
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,320
and starts a Karaoke Bar.

297
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,200
And he'll set up a frachise business.

298
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,080
When the customers come,

299
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,760
they could sing while eating hotpot.

300
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,840
Do you think
we can make money in that way?

301
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,840
Won't it hurt the throat?

302
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,400
Won't it?

303
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,480
What do you mean?

304
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,200
I've served you all day long,
aren't you satisfied?

305
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,080
Just tell me if you agree it or not.

306
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,720
Singing while eating hotpot.

307
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,680
Isn't that silly?

308
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,160
I'm sure it won't work.

309
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,440
Mum, you must not give Dad the money.

310
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,680
You're such an ungrateful wrench.

311
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,040
I thought my family was a haven,

312
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,120
that it was a shelter for me.

313
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,760
It turns out

314
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,160
that both of you leave me no option.

315
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,280
You're the cause

316
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,600
of the hardships of our family.

317
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,760
Go on.

318
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,160
Mum, my idea is more reliable.

319
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,560
To be honest with you two.

320
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,200
We don't have much money left.

321
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,400
Don't ever think of spending it.

322
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,480
Just forget about it.

323
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,360
I know you two well.

324
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,920
(H.X Photo Studio)
If you two

325
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,600
(H.X Photo Studio)
register a card in our studio,

326
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,040
(H.X Photo Studio)
that will be once and for all.

327
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,560
From one to six, in each year,

328
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,040
- your baby...
- Mu Zili, I need to talk to you.

329
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,960
Hang on.

330
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,720
The baby
will get a free set of portraits.

331
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,440
You can tell me if you've got anything

332
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,240
in mind.

333
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,200
We can discuss about it.

334
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,880
I have to talk to you. Come.

335
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,840
Excuse us.

336
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,400
You can take a look first.

337
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,920
What are you doing?
I'm serving the customers.

338
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,160
Let me tell you a good news.

339
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,560
What is it?

340
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,720
I have my eye on a store in Old Street.

341
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,880
The price of the building is cheap.

342
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,560
It might be demolished in future.

343
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,200
After all, we've been friends for years.

344
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,520
I've got to share this with you.

345
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,400
How about this? You fund it.

346
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,760
I'll make you a minority shareholder.

347
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,320
You still have some savings, don't you?

348
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,960
What savings?

349
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,400
- I don't have money.
- After so many years.

350
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,920
- I...
- Just a little money.

351
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,320
Sir, we'll take a look
at other places.

352
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,320
Don't do this. No, bro,

353
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,920
there's no other photo studio nearby.

354
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
Do you understand what I say to you?

355
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,520
I finally got an order for my mum.

356
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,320
But you ruined it.

357
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,920
I really think you're a talent.

358
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,800
You shouldn't waste it.

359
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,880
Zheng Daqian,

360
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,920
can you stop daydreaming?

361
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,480
Just be down-to-earth.

362
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,760
This suits you more. Take a look.

363
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,440
(Idiot, Boost Your Intelligence)

364
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,000
Untangle it.

365
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,880
No, how could you hit it with your head?

366
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,320
Are you practising iron head?

367
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,360
Both of you.

368
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,720
- Yan.
- Yan.

369
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,760
What are you two doing?

370
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,760
Her hair got caught in my button.
It can't be untangled.

371
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,440
Why are you here?

372
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,400
I'm here for Aunt Hui

373
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,800
to take an one inch certificate photo.

374
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,880
I'll take the photo.

375
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,840
Can you do it?

376
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't worry. I've practised this
since I was a kid.

377
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,280
Just untangle it first.

378
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,840
Daqian,

379
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,000
are you really going
to purchase that store?

380
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,880
Rather than letting my dad make
bad investments,

381
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,760
I might as well save
the welfare money for him.

382
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,760
It's hard for our parents to make money.

383
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,840
You haven't found a job.

384
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,640
Yet, you always ask them for money.

385
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Who are you to say that?

386
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,360
You always stay at home and do nothing.

387
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,680
How dare you lecture me?

388
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,160
Are you afraid to start a business?

389
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,760
Transportation fee and meal fee,

390
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,040
it'll cost at least RMB 100
a day for each person.

391
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,280
I spend less than RMB 50
while staying at home.

392
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,560
I'll get a fifty percent profit
in return.

393
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,000
It's an economic way to be a neet.

394
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,280
You're making excuses for your laziness.

395
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,840
Daqian, if you want to make investment

396
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,240
and help Uncle Yingjun,

397
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,080
I'll support you and take a stake in it.

398
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,400
Really?

399
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,680
As a friendly reminder,

400
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,840
it takes a lot of risk
to make an investment for love.

401
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,640
Forget it, Yan.

402
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,720
You just clear your family's debt.

403
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,880
I can't drag you down.

404
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,600
Then, why did you drag me down?

405
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,040
Yan got a job.

406
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,400
But you're a lazy loafer.

407
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm getting you out of the plight, okay?

408
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,360
Yan,

409
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,520
what have you bought?

410
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,080
Your favourite braised chicken feet
and duck wings.

411
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,680
I don't like to eat chicken feet.

412
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
Look at the camera.
I'm taking it.

413
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,200
This credit card limit is RMB 20,000.

414
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,040
As for this, it's RMB 10,000.

415
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,600
It's not this.

416
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,840
Daqian, you're really going to rent it?

417
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,480
No, I'm purchasing it.

418
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,800
Purchasing it?

419
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,600
Purchasing a store is a big deal.

420
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,880
Why do you purchase it?

421
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,200
We can make money if we purchase it.

422
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,840
But I have to pay a deposit
of RMB 100,000 on it.

423
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,400
I only have RMB 38,000.

424
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,840
Hello, Ms. Liu.

425
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Lan, you haven't slept, have you?

426
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,320
Well,

427
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,800
your dad has been thinking

428
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,680
about your job these two days.

429
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,800
What's your decision on it?

430
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
Ms. Liu,

431
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,160
can you please convince my dad?

432
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,600
He doesn't have to worry about it.

433
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,800
You can't say that.

434
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,160
You're his daughter.

435
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,600
How can he not worry about you?

436
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,360
As for the librarian job

437
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,000
that we mentioned last time,

438
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,760
the school officials have read
your resume,

439
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,120
they're quite satisfied with it.

440
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,520
You can start working right away.

441
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,360
What do you think?

442
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,120
Don't waste Liu's effort.

443
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,760
Be quiet.

444
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,720
Lan?

445
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,240
Okay, Ms. Liu.

446
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
That's great.

447
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,360
Let's report duty at school

448
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,720
at eight tomorrow morning.

449
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,520
Okay, get some rest.

450
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,680
What is it?

451
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,120
My dad

452
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,640
wants me to be a librarian

453
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,680
in the school library.

454
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,480
You don't want to go?

455
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,920
Then, just don't go.

456
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,040
My dad must've asked

457
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,440
Ms. Liu to do this.

458
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,120
Actually, Ms. Liu is quite nice.

459
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,200
She always takes my side
when I have a fight

460
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,640
with my dad since childhood.

461
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,760
Let's see.

462
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,640
I'll go report duty tomorrow.

463
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,680
Just give up.

464
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,240
You've studied hard for over ten years.

465
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,440
What for?

466
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,680
Just fill it now.

467
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,640
Anyway, I'm not going
to Peking University.

468
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,400
Hurry up. Just fill it.

469
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,200
Don't make your mum mad.

470
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,880
You're not going to fill it, are you?

471
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,440
Well, then. I'll fill it for you.

472
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
Would you stop, Mum?

473
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,120
No.

474
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,200
Tomorrow,

475
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,240
I'll personally hand it to Mr. Mi.

476
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,240
Whatever the outcome is,
you have to give it a try.

477
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,240
I won't let you waste yourself.

478
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,240
When your brother got accepted
by the university,

479
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,560
many people worshipped and admired him.

480
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,400
There was a banner hanging up here.

481
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,000
And we proudly celebrated it.

482
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,160
So what?

483
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,960
There are scoundrels as well.

484
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,800
Brat!

485
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,040
You're not allowed
to insult my alma mater.

486
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,600
I'm not talking about your school.

487
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,800
I'm talking about you.

488
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,680
I dare you to say it again.

489
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,720
What if I say it again?

490
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,120
Scoundrel.

491
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,120
What are you two doing?

492
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
You start getting into it, don't you?

493
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,840
I've got to teach you a lesson.

494
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,280
- What are you doing?
- I... I...

495
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,880
Say it again.

496
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,760
- They're fighting.
- So what if I insult you?

497
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,840
No, don't go.

498
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,600
This is their family affair.

499
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,760
Give them some space.

500
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,120
You're right.

501
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,360
Here comes the slipper attack.

502
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,000
I'll beat you to death.

503
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,320
Stop fighting, the two of you!

504
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,240
Say it again if you dare.

505
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,320
So what if I say it again?

506
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,520
So are you.

507
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,560
You're not a scoundrel

508
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,960
as you don't get into my university.

509
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,320
Daqian.

510
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,160
Is it not convenient
for me to stay here?

511
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,240
Nonsense.

512
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,080
Quarrels often happen in each family.

513
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,280
It's not your fault.

514
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,240
The brothers always act like this.

515
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,640
Don't worry.

516
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
You won't look pretty if you feel worry.

517
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,720
What's wrong with the two brothers?

518
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,440
Gosh, this Zixi.

519
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Why does he refuse
to go to Peking University?

520
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,560
At this stage of life,

521
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,960
it makes sense for a kid
to have his own idea.

522
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,280
We've been through this.

523
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,560
But he has been insisting

524
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,640
on getting into the top university.

525
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,920
There are many top universities.

526
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,720
Why must it be Peking University?

527
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,600
Besides,

528
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,600
we should respect

529
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,520
his decision, don't you think?

530
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,280
Did he tell you

531
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,520
which university he has chosen?

532
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,960
I'm heating up the milk.

533
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
I'll go check it out.

534
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,240
How's your blood sugar level?

535
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,680
It's fine.

536
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,200
It's a bit high.

537
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,680
Mu,

538
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,080
adjust your diet tomorrow.

539
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,160
Your blood sugar level is a little high.

540
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,920
What are you doing, Daqian?

541
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,760
Hi, Zixi. Hello.

542
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,880
Why are you here?

543
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,640
Well, I'm starving.

544
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,880
I'd like to cook something for myself.

545
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,520
I mean why you're in my house.

546
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,000
I came here to stay with Daqian.

547
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,960
Are you hungry too?

548
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,040
I can make more.

549
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,120
We can put the noodle in it
when the water is boiled.

550
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,160
It can be served soon.

551
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,280
It's alright, I...

552
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,520
No rush.

553
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,320
Zixi, what grade are you in?

554
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,640
12th grade.

555
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,360
Have you decided
which university you're joining?

556
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,040
Not yet.

557
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,000
It won't do.

558
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,720
You have to study hard
and get a good grade.

559
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,240
So that you can make
your way in society.

560
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,080
Your capability is
what makes your way in society.

561
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,520
The certificate has nothing
to do with it.

562
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,120
You're just a kid.

563
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,680
You'll figure it out in future.

564
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,360
I guess the water is boiled.

565
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,680
Are you alright?

566
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,320
- I'm alright.
- Let me see.

567
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,680
I'll just apply some toothpaste.

568
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,400
No, it's useless.

569
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,280
You have to rinse it with cold water.

570
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,840
Gong Xiaoqin always collects
useless things.

571
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,560
None of them are valuable.

572
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,000
What are you looking for?

573
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,360
Are you trying to steal
our family's stuff?

574
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,080
What do you mean?

575
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm rummaging through my family's stuff.

576
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,640
I finally found it.

577
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,720
What is this?

578
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,840
It's just a shabby plate.

579
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,520
It's said to be left by my grandmother.

580
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,120
My mum treasured it a lot
when it was in our house.

581
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,280
All of you refuse to fund in my store.

582
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,240
I have no choice

583
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,240
but to see what I can sell for money.

584
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,280
Is this authentic?

585
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,280
You're looking down
on my family, aren't you?

586
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,360
I tell you what.

587
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,480
Up to three generations
of my family are of royal blood.

588
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,160
My ancestors' surname is Guwalgiya.

589
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,600
One of the eight largest aristocracies
in Qing Dynasty.

590
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,040
You don't understand even if I tell you.

591
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,880
Look at this colour,

592
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,640
and this pattern,

593
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,440
I'm sure it can be sold at a high price.

594
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,200
Let me tell you this.

595
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,560
That store of yours is sketchy.

596
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,960
You might as well find a job
for Uncle Yingjun.

597
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,680
Or I can tell my dad

598
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,120
to let Uncle Yingjun to work
at his factory.

599
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,880
If he accepted your dad's help,

600
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,760
he wouldn't have been jobless until now.

601
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,840
My dad cares about his dignity
more than his life.

602
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,720
So I've got to start a business for him.

603
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,840
I have to save a large amount
of welfare money for him.

604
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,320
So that I won't have regrets
when I leave.

605
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,760
You're leaving?

606
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,320
I don't know when it'll be.

607
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Maybe one day,

608
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,520
I'll be like that day
when I first returned.

609
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,960
Watch out!

610
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,160
That was close.

611
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,440
Princess,

612
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,000
your ancestors even carved something

613
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,400
on the back of the plate.

614
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,640
What did they carve?

615
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,000
Microwave safe.

616
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,280
Here, Zixi.

617
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,320
This is the organic milk
that your mum specially made for you.

618
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,160
Drink up.

619
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,520
I'll have diarrhea if I drink milk.

620
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,000
This kid.

621
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,880
Well, Aunt, Uncle,

622
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,520
you've taken good care
of me these two days.

623
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,240
I feel really bad about that.

624
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,640
It's alright, Mi Lan.

625
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,840
I like being around people. It's lively.

626
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,160
Yes, let's eat.

627
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,600
What are we having?

628
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,080
Hurry up, both of you.

629
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,280
It's getting cold.

630
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,240
Geez.

631
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,120
Eat up.

632
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,640
Here, Daqian.

633
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,240
Thank you, Uncle Mu.

634
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,400
- Thanks, Dad.
- Careful, it's hot.

635
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,840
Mi Lan, just get comfortable

636
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,680
like Daqian does.

637
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,240
Make yourself at home, you hear me?

638
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,160
She does make herself at home.

639
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Uncle Mu, Aunt Hui,

640
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,880
would you mind taking me
as your goddaughter?

641
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,680
Of course.

642
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,560
That's good.

643
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,160
Let's hold a ceremony for that.

644
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,160
I'll tell your parents about it.

645
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,080
Objection.

646
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,640
I don't want to take
a lazy loafer as my sister.

647
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,720
I want her.

648
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,800
I've always wanted a daughter.

649
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,760
I'm totally against it.

650
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,200
Overruled.

651
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,200
Lan,

652
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,840
look, isn't it fun to be around people?

653
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,040
But I think it's troubling you.

654
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,880
It's alright.

655
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
Daqian occupies the room alone.

656
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,000
If you stay with her,

657
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,480
it'll improve the space efficiency.

658
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,840
Well said.

659
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,800
Look, Mi Lan, you're staying here.

660
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,920
Zixi is staying at the dorm.

661
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,920
What does it call?

662
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,760
This is so-called hostage exchange.

663
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,360
I... I'm not going to live at the dorm.

664
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,440
Why?

665
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,640
I think it's more convenient
to stay at home.

666
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,920
I can study a little longer at night.

667
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,920
Of course.

668
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,360
Home is always the best.

669
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,280
Kids are always fickle.

670
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,840
Hello?

671
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,200
You're almost there?

672
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,800
Okay, I'll be right there.

673
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,240
You guys eat first.

674
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,080
I've got something to do.

675
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,840
Daqian, you haven't eaten yet.

676
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,760
I've got the bun.

677
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,600
It's alright, Mum.

678
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,840
I'll eat them.

679
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,480
I can finish it for her.

680
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,040
I'll give it to you.

681
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,760
Thanks, Mum.

682
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,900
(Baihe First Middle School Library,
Tieyuan)

683
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,680
Guys, stop what you're doing.

684
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,200
Let me introduce our new colleague.

685
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,280
This is Mi Lan, Mr. Mi's daughter.

686
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,720
She also graduated
from our school.

687
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,960
She's an excellent lady.

688
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,560
Hello, nice to meet you all.

689
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,600
Okay, Mi Lan.

690
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,200
Well, I'll show you

691
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,520
around first.

692
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,200
Come, take a look here.

693
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,920
This is Natural Science section.

694
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,800
The books are all here.

695
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,240
Which Mr. Mi?

696
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,160
Mi Lihua.

697
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,280
What had happened, Zheng?

698
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,640
We accidentally started a small fire.

699
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,120
You just have to make

700
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,000
minor refurbishment to this floor.

701
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,200
Zheng, you're underpaying us.

702
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,400
You knew that it's my wife,

703
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,400
who manages the money in my family.

704
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,720
It's not my call.

705
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,480
We'll come again
after you two get this ironed out.

706
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,480
Let's go.

707
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,360
Don't go.

708
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,200
My tool box.

709
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,960
Is there any problem with this piano?

710
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
No problem.

711
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,440
Okay, let's make the transfer now.

712
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,120
Through Wechat.

713
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
Okay, Wechat.

714
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,080
How about this?

715
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,280
I'll find you a mover for free.

716
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,680
I guarantee that this piano will
be delivered to your house safely.

717
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,600
Thank you.

718
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,080
Where are you going
to deliver this piano?

719
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,960
This is my dad.

720
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,400
Here, scan this.

721
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,800
What are you doing?

722
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,880
This piano is wasted
as we're not using it.

723
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,440
Why don't we sell it
to the people who need it?

724
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,400
This is not for sale.

725
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,520
Are you going to sell it?

726
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,200
Of course, just ignore him.

727
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,440
This is my piano. I call the shot.

728
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,160
It's not for sale.

729
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,360
I personally bought it

730
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,840
from the piano shop in 1998.

731
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,200
RMB 18,000, full payment.

732
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,440
I even kept the receipt.

733
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,240
Who are you to sell it?

734
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,120
This is my piano.

735
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,720
- I call the shot.
- Forget it.

736
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,160
We're not going to buy it for now.

737
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,640
Don't go. This is my piano.

738
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,080
Don't ever come here again.

739
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,280
What's gotten into you?

740
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,920
Gong Xiaoqin refuses to make investment
and you come to ruin my plan.

741
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,840
I got it.

742
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,840
You're also going to sell
this piano, aren't you?

743
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,040
Let me tell you this.

744
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,800
That hotpot KTV idea of yours

745
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,960
is ridiculous.

746
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,600
It won't work. That's a no-go.

747
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,360
It's a yes-go.

748
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,240
I tell you what.

749
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,680
My capability of studying the market

750
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,880
is way more detailed than yours.

751
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,640
As long as we manage it well,

752
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,000
you and your mum only have to do
one thing in the rest of your lives.

753
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,080
Which is to count money.

754
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,440
You can't tell right from wrong.

755
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,320
You're such a prodigal kid.

756
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,480
Zheng Yingjun,

757
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
stop dreaming to get rich, will you?

758
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,400
Can't you just be down-to-earth?

759
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,040
Your phone.

760
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,760
It's not for sale.

761
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,600
Your phone!

762
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,600
See?

763
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,800
There are many people taking stakes
in it these two days.

764
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,240
Hello.

765
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,880
Dazhi.

766
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,200
What's wrong?

767
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,240
That brat was trying to escape.

768
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,920
I pinned him to the ground.

769
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,640
Only then, he told me the truth.

770
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,480
And I realised
that you nearly got conned.

771
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,600
Uncle,

772
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,240
we've got to keep our eyes open
while making investments.

773
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,560
Ask around more often.

774
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,200
We can't blindly follow the trend.

775
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,320
Dazhi is right. Come, Dazhi.

776
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,320
Look, luckily you haven't paid him.

777
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,600
Yingjun,

778
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,320
you should be prim and proper.

779
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,640
Just get a job.

780
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,280
Why are you so bad
at looking for projects?

781
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,960
Didn't you say
you'll get rich with that?

782
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,600
Daqian,

783
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,440
Yan asked me to pass this to you.

784
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,560
Dad,

785
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,120
look.

786
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,320
Yan contacted them for you.

787
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,920
They need an accordionist
at the Children's Palace.

788
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,840
(The Children's Palace in Baihe)
So I sent them your resume.

789
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,640
As they knew

790
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,520
you were from Baihe Cultural Troupe,

791
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,600
they said it shouldn't be a problem.

792
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,920
They want you to give it try.

793
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,480
This is a reliable choice.

794
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,560
Yingjun,

795
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,200
you're the master of accordion
in our troupe.

796
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm sure this won't be a problem.

797
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,080
Mu.

798
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,640
The Children's Palace.

799
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,240
What's wrong?

800
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,240
That's quite nice.

801
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Dad, you're good at
playing the accordion.

802
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,000
Give it a try. We'll go there with you.

803
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,200
Listen to me, Yingjun.

804
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,320
As soon as you play it,

805
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,480
I'm sure it'll surprise them.

806
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,800
Play a song.

807
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,800
Play a song.

808
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,280
I can do anything

809
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,240
but play the accordion.

810
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,440
Look at him.

811
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,840
He's hopeless.

812
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,840
Yingjun, this is the Children's Palace.

813
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,760
The future of our country.

814
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,800
We should fulfill our duty.

815
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,640
I'm a city slicker.

816
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,560
I don't deserve to be a teacher.

817
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,360
I can't talk to him anymore.

818
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,280
Goodbye.

819
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,280
Zheng Yingjun,
can you be more productive?

820
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,080
- Besides being opportunistic...
- Daqian.

821
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,160
- what else can you do?
- Don't.

822
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,320
- His waist!
- You do more harm...

823
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,120
- Waist!
- than good.

824
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,040
You have grandiose aims
but puny abilities. You're frivolous.

825
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,600
No wonder Gong Xiaoqin despises you.

826
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,560
What are you two doing?

827
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,680
What's wrong?

828
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,480
Nothing.

829
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,560
If you're upset,

830
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,840
just wipe the photo album for me.

831
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,360
It's been a long time.
It's about to rot away.

832
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,640
He's too old

833
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,840
to be jobless.

834
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,200
He didn't even let me sell the piano.

835
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,400
Mum, believe it or not,

836
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,200
he's planning to sell the piano as well.

837
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,320
Look at this.

838
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,680
My dad liked to ride a motorcycle
when he was young?

839
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,360
Your dad tried everything

840
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,760
to buy that motorcycle back then.

841
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,840
As he threw the money away,

842
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,600
it took him a year to earn that money.

843
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,520
And he finally bought it.

844
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,680
It was gone in several months.

845
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,080
Was it stolen?

846
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,360
He sold it.

847
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,760
Why did he sell it?

848
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,920
Because his daughter wanted
to learn playing the piano.

849
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,280
Your dad sold his motorcycle just to buy

850
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,080
the piano for you.

851
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,520
I was mad when I knew that.

852
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,320
I scolded him
and asked him to return it.

853
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,240
But then, I let him off the hook
as I saw you two

854
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,400
having fun playing it.

855
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,520
Your dad

856
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,720
intented on using the money we've left.

857
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,020
But that piano,

858
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,360
he will never sell it.

859
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,880
(It's not for sale.)

860

(I personally bought it)

861

(from the piano shop in 1998.)

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,680
(I even kept the receipt.)

864
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,320
(You're also going to sell the piano,
aren't you?)

865
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,320
Let me tell you this.

866
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,000
That

867
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
hotpot KTV idea of yours

868
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,240
is ridiculous.

869

(It won't work. That's a no-go.)

870
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,640
(It's a yes-go.)

871
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,680
You can't tell right from wrong.

872
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,360
You're such a prodigal kid.

873
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,920
Here.

874
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
Where did Yingjun go?

875
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,280
When is he coming back?

876
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,960
We don't need to wait for him.

877
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,480
I have no idea where he went.

878
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,120
Uncle Yingjun

879
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,200
is usually so active in eating.

880
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,800
What's wrong with him today?

881
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,000
Never mind. Let's eat first.

882
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,720
I'll cook for him when he comes back.

883
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,280
You guys eat first. I'm going out.

Mr. Zheng?

887
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,200
I didn't see him.

Thank you.

Don't mention it.

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,280
Hello, how many people?

891
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,920
I'm not here for meal.

892
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,160
Excuse me.

893
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,080
I'd like to ask if you've seen

894
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,480
a fifty-year-old man

895
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,080
with short hair, about this tall.

896
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,920
It doesn't ring a bell.

897
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,760
Thank you.

(Just choose a cheaper one.)

903
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,200
The seller has said

904
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,400
that she's got talent.

905
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,680
Why don't we buy a better one?

906
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,320
The seller was roping you
into buying a piano.

907
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,480
Can you keep it down?

908
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,000
This is how I usually sound.

Besides,

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,240
our salaries are

911

only enough to keep us alive.

912
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,120
We're not a rich family.

913
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,640
There's no point
in keeping up appearances.

914
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,440
I make money by myself.

915
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,120
I'm going to buy it.

916

Doesn't your money belong to us?

917

What are you looking at?

918
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,120
Have you never seen a couple fighting?

919
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,240
Why are you so petty?

920
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,880
I insist on buying it.

921
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,080
I'm against it.

922
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,800
I insist.

I'm going to buy it today.
