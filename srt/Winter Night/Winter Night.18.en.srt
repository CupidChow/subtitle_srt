It's safe though,

170
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:33,482
as real-name authentication
is implemented.

171

(Identification Card)

172
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:38,163
This identification card is fake.

173
00:10:38,163 --> 00:10:39,122
There's no chip inside.

174
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:40,522
I can't scan it.

175
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,522
Fake?

176
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:48,642
Yan Zhonghui.

177
00:10:49,843 --> 00:10:51,843
Please explain this.

178
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:53,602
This...

179
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:56,283
Isn't this my identification card?

180
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:58,323
Are you pretending

181
00:10:58,323 --> 00:10:59,163
to be young?

182
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:01,482
The age is changed to be younger.

183
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:02,722
What's going on?

184
00:11:06,163 --> 00:11:06,803
Zheng.

185
00:11:07,122 --> 00:11:09,122
It's not something serious.

186
00:11:09,122 --> 00:11:10,083
Previously,

187
00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:11,722
I lost my identification card

188
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:13,283
when I was working in Thailand.

189
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:14,882
Since I've come back now,

190
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,163
I had no choice

191
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:17,963
but to have a fake one.

192
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:20,683
Thailand?

193
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:23,203
Stop talking gibberish

194
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:24,683
and being someone
that you're obviously not.

195
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,283
Tell me.

196
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,002
What's wrong with
your identification card?

197
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:28,242
You better come clear.

198
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:29,002
I tell you what...

199
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,843
What's the matter, Uncle Yingjun?

200
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:34,642
Junze, you came at the right time.

201
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:36,443
Your dad uses
a fake identification card.

202
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:38,122
Don't worry, Yan.

203
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:39,122
My dad likes to make a fuss.

204
00:11:39,122 --> 00:11:40,402
He might be wrong.

205
00:11:40,402 --> 00:11:41,722
I like to make a fuss?

206
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:44,203
The deliveryman has scanned it
with a machine.

207
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,283
But there's no chip in it.

208
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:49,002
Yan Zhonghui.

209
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,522
What are you up to
with a fake identification card?

210
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,402
Do you know this is illegal?

211
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:53,803
Well, Junze.

212
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:55,083
It's not easy to explain clearly
in a few words...

213
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:55,843
Tell me then.

214
00:11:56,163 --> 00:11:57,242
Where did you get the money from

215
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:58,323
that you brought back home?

216
00:11:58,323 --> 00:11:59,563
Nothing's wrong with the money.

217
00:11:59,563 --> 00:12:01,242
They are clean.

218
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:03,203
Fine, whether the money is clean or not,

219
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:04,843
you can explain to the cop later.

220
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:05,443
Let's go.

221
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:06,843
- Junze, what are you doing?
- Yan.

222
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:07,683
- Let go of me.
- Yan.

223
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:08,402
Junze.

224
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:09,563
Please don't drag your dad like this.

225
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:10,882
Where are you taking him?

226
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:11,882
What are you going to do him?

227
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:19,163
Oh my, can you
please quit making a scene?

228
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:21,083
Why do you come here

229
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,803
like visiting a guest house?

230
00:12:26,602 --> 00:12:28,843
Uncle Yan, I don't mean to be rude.

231
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:30,602
But don't you know it's illegal

232
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:31,762
using a fake identification card?

233
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:33,722
If something serious happens,
you'll be charged with a crime.

234
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:34,362
Dazhi.

235
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:36,122
You should scrutinize him

236
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:37,563
and do what you should do
as per the laws.

237
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:38,482
Uncle Yan.

238
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:40,563
Hurry up and clarify yourself.

239
00:12:40,563 --> 00:12:42,362
Why do you
possess a fake identification card?

240
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:48,362
I bought it

241
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:49,362
when I was working out there,

242
00:12:50,163 --> 00:12:51,882
so that I could find a suitable job.

243
00:12:51,882 --> 00:12:54,283
Wait, why would you need a fake one
to look for a job?

244
00:12:54,362 --> 00:12:56,242
Uncle Yan, you shouldn't
do something illegal anyhow.

245
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,522
No, I didn't. I've never been involved
with illegal events.

246
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:04,122
I just altered my age.

247
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:05,122
Nowadays,

248
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:07,122
it's troublesome
for a 55-year-old man

249
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:09,283
to make a living outside.

250
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:11,683
They won't hire you due to your old age.

251
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:12,963
Even though you can work harder,

252
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:14,563
they prefer youngsters.

253
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:15,923
You can't get a job

254
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:17,683
once you're over 55 years old.

255
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:20,242
I had no choice

256
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:21,683
but to buy a fake one.

257
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:27,043
Where have you been over those years?

258
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:28,122
What have you done?

259
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:30,522
At first,

260
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:32,323
I went to Inner Mongolia

261
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:34,002
and worked in a mine.

262
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:35,163
However, the pay was chicken feed.

263
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:36,482
Later,

264
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:39,362
I went to Gansu, Shaanxi, Sichuan,

265
00:13:40,043 --> 00:13:41,522
Hunan and Guangxi.

266
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:43,083
Anyway, I've been to

267
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,083
most of the places in China.

268
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,642
The farthest place I went to
was Bangkok.

269
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:47,722
To make more money,

270
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:49,283
I almost became a ladyboy.

271
00:13:49,882 --> 00:13:50,882
However, I've never done

272
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:52,283
anything illegal.

273
00:13:53,803 --> 00:13:55,762
I've got the short end
of the stick once.

274
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,242
I'd never dupe others again

275
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:59,163
even at the cost of my life.

276
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:01,482
All the money I made

277
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:02,882
is hard-earned.

278
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:04,323
They are clean.

279
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,620
(Hedong Police Station of Baihe Branch
of Tieyuan Public Security Bureau)

280
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:11,642
Uncle Yan,

281
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:14,923
although you've done nothing bad,

282
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,043
using a fake identification card

283
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:19,242
is illegal.

284
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:21,043
We'll confiscate this.

285
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,563
Besides, we'll punish you.

286
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,362
Dazhi, I accept the punishment.

287
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:28,122
Yan, you've taken him wrong.

288
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:29,882
Actually, Uncle Yan
has been through hard times.

289
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:38,242
Dazhi.

290
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:41,843
Sorry to trouble you.

291
00:14:42,843 --> 00:14:45,043
Something came up in my office.
I need to go.

292
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,283
Uncle Yan, I'll check him out.

293
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:52,882
Alright.

294
00:15:14,323 --> 00:15:15,923
Are you going to keep following me?

295
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:18,402
If you feel better after taking a walk,

296
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:20,443
I'll walk with you.

297
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:24,122
Will you always walk with me?

298
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:39,402
Daqian.

299
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:42,803
The day before Lizi left,

300
00:15:43,283 --> 00:15:44,443
I bet on myself

301
00:15:47,443 --> 00:15:48,602
that I'd let go of you

302
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,602
if it snowed.

303
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:53,563
If not,

304
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:56,843
I'd keep waiting for you.

305
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:12,803
But, you're not the one
you used to be.

306
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:16,002
Please go back.

307
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:44,963
Whenever I'm down,

308
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,122
you'd go skiing with me.

309
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:51,882
So, the secret between them is
to go skiing together.

310
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:53,402
Let's go skiing

311
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:54,642
some times later.

312
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:55,362
No.

313
00:16:55,563 --> 00:16:57,203
It's more relaxing staying at home.

314
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:59,002
Besides, I can't stand on the ice
for more than a second.

315
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:07,362
Now it explains
why Yan was with that face.

316
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:12,402
I've messed up your love relationship

317
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:15,083
with your identity.

318
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:19,642
I must figure out some plans

319
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:21,442
to make Yan feel better.

320
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:31,882
Yan.

321
00:17:32,323 --> 00:17:34,362
Let's go skiing at the park tomorrow,
alright?

You are good at skiing.

327
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:15,922
You did better than me previously.

328
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:19,323
It's been a while since I last skied.

329
00:18:19,323 --> 00:18:20,803
I need some time to practice.

330
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:22,843
Perhaps we can leave.

331
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:25,003
It's fine. Give me some time.

332
00:18:25,283 --> 00:18:26,483
I'll try.

333
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:58,202
Look.

334
00:18:58,202 --> 00:18:59,043
I'm moving, right?

335
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:04,083
Let's get up.

336
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:06,162
Be careful.

337
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,723
You can't ski, right?

338
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:21,962
Mu Zili.

339
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:23,723
You're back.

340
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:28,523
How did you know we're here?

341
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,483
I went to the restaurant just now

342
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:33,563
and Mi Lan told me.

343
00:19:34,162 --> 00:19:35,362
How's Uncle Mu?

344
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:36,682
He's good. Nothing big happened.

345
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:38,442
Stop trying. You're just bad at skiing.

346
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:39,283
It's dangerous.

347
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:41,362
Lizi, come join us.

348
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:42,483
Come on. Let's ski.

349
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:43,162
Come on.

350
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:43,922
Faster.

351
00:19:43,922 --> 00:19:44,323
Well.

352
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:45,602
I'll master this very soon.

353
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,442
I tell you what,

354
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,882
I'm amazing.

355
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:50,602
By the way, Yan.

356
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:52,083
I heard

357
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,843
that you took your dad
to the police station.

358
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:56,962
It was a misunderstanding.

359
00:19:57,642 --> 00:19:58,962
We people

360
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:00,962
always cause trouble to Dazhi.

361
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:03,122
Because we don't want
his work to be easy.

362
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:06,202
Yan.

363
00:20:07,043 --> 00:20:09,523
Uncle Yan stayed in the restaurant

364
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,323
because he wants to see you more.

365
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:14,563
I know.

366
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:17,642
Look, I think I can ski.

367
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:19,763
How's it?

368
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:20,602
Quick.

369
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:21,483
Let's go skiing together.

370
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:22,283
Let's go.

371
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:23,003
Come on.

372
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,780
♪Can we not mention the date of return?♪

373
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:37,820
♪Let's take a photo with the stars
and snow as the background♪

374
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:43,740
♪Can sadness and loss of contact
be a type of ordeal♪

375
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:50,580
♪Until we finally come around
when we meet again?♪

376
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,700
♪Can we always stay together?♪

377
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,060
♪So we can laugh and behave
willfully every day♪

378
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,900
♪To close the gap for warmth♪

379
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,900
♪Can I be sad and escape
for a little while?♪

380
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:18,460
♪Remember my problems
and the secret we had together♪

381
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:31,682
Skiing is so exhausting.

382
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:32,682
You see, Yan.

383
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:34,083
I told you I could ski.

384
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:35,083
Impressive.

385
00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:41,362
Hello, mum.

386
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,083
We're skiing in the park.

387
00:21:47,843 --> 00:21:48,843
Why did he come?

388
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:52,083
Okay, I'll be right back.

389
00:21:54,323 --> 00:21:55,122
You can enjoy your time here.

390
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:57,083
I need to go back now.

391
00:21:57,202 --> 00:21:58,642
Yan Zhonghui came to my house.

392
00:21:59,283 --> 00:21:59,882
I'm off.

393
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,162
Yan, play nice.

394
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,202
Do you want to continue?

395
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:20,682
No.

396
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:23,043
Let's find a place to rest.

397
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:25,003
Sure.

398
00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:27,003
Let's go.

399
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:46,682
Let's invite Mi Lan and Dazhi

400
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:48,083
next time

401
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,202
for skiing.

402
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:51,402
Alright.

403
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:00,763
Daqian.

404
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:07,723
Previously,

405
00:23:08,682 --> 00:23:09,803
I promised

406
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,483
we'd have a serious talk
after I came back.

407
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:24,122
Daqian.

408
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:30,642
In this universe,

409
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,362
we can only be friends.

410
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:44,083
What do you mean?

411
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:47,763
In this universe?

412
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,602
Don't beat around the bush.

413
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,723
Previously, it was because

414
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:04,402
I'd forgotten

415
00:24:05,723 --> 00:24:07,642
someone I've been loving
for a long time.

416
00:24:11,003 --> 00:24:12,922
I'm truly sorry.

417
00:24:17,043 --> 00:24:18,962
I can't fall for someone else.

418
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:24,563
So, your memory has recovered?

419
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:31,523
And you realized
that you still love her?

420
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:35,323
I...

421
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:40,323
To be frank, I've been confused

422
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:41,723
about my feelings for you. I...

423
00:24:41,723 --> 00:24:43,202
Are you going to find her?

424
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:55,803
Perhaps when the time comes,

425
00:24:58,442 --> 00:24:59,323
I'll leave.

426
00:25:09,723 --> 00:25:10,642
Well, then.

427
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,803
Cheers to our friendship.

428
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,083
Cheers to our friendship.

429
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:29,003
I need to go home now.

430
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:30,323
I'll get going.

431
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:52,243
You're back, son.

432
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:05,243
Where's he?

433
00:26:06,283 --> 00:26:07,362
In the bathroom.

434
00:26:07,843 --> 00:26:10,283
He bought half of a sheep
and made it into dumpling fillings.

435
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:11,763
Besides, he cooks sheep's trotters

436
00:26:11,763 --> 00:26:13,602
in the kitchen now.

437
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:15,243
They are all your favorite.

438
00:26:15,602 --> 00:26:16,362
I don't like them.

439
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:18,483
Ask him to take them back.

440
00:26:24,003 --> 00:26:25,243
Today is his birthday.

441
00:26:25,642 --> 00:26:26,843
He said he wanted to come home.

442
00:26:28,402 --> 00:26:30,483
No, I mean he wanted to come home

443
00:26:31,162 --> 00:26:32,283
to eat dumplings.

444
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,763
You're back, son.

445
00:26:49,122 --> 00:26:50,882
Son, I know

446
00:26:51,283 --> 00:26:53,962
you can't get past it.

447
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:54,922
- Mum.
- But...

448
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:56,003
Sit.

449
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:02,962
I'll take off my jacket. It's hot.

450
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:06,442
I think

451
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:07,962
you can't cook the sheep's trotters.

452
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:09,083
That's why I cooked it for you.

453
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:11,202
Give it to me.

454
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:12,882
It's fine. I'll put it here.

455
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,162
I'll go back to the restaurant then.

456
00:27:22,803 --> 00:27:23,442
Have a sit.

457
00:27:26,442 --> 00:27:28,083
Someone has to finish the dumplings
anyhow.

458
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:32,083
Sure.

459
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:40,602
Dad, what are you doing?

460
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:42,122
Are you going somewhere?

461
00:27:43,323 --> 00:27:44,523
It's your mum's luggage.

462
00:27:44,922 --> 00:27:46,523
Where's she going?

463
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:49,723
Shenzhen.

464
00:27:50,323 --> 00:27:51,362
She wants to leave.

465
00:27:56,563 --> 00:27:57,162
Mum.

466
00:27:57,283 --> 00:27:58,003
Please don't go.

467
00:27:58,003 --> 00:27:59,202
What has happened?

468
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:01,642
You can't leave the house
even though you quarreled with him.

469
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:03,402
Mum, you have promised me, right?

470
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,003
This is a saving card.

471
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:08,122
Take it.

472
00:28:08,642 --> 00:28:10,642
It includes your endowment insurance.

473
00:28:11,362 --> 00:28:12,362
Keep it.

474
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:14,043
This is the only money that is left.

475
00:28:15,122 --> 00:28:15,922
I'm incapable.

476
00:28:15,922 --> 00:28:17,003
I can't leave more money for you.

477
00:28:17,243 --> 00:28:19,003
Never give the money to anyone.

478
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:19,882
Not a single cent.

479
00:28:19,882 --> 00:28:20,803
No matter who asks for it.

480
00:28:20,922 --> 00:28:21,563
Alright?

481
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,202
What's going on, dad?

482
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:25,962
Mum.

483
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:33,523
Say something.

484
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:36,202
Why are you quiet?

485
00:28:37,043 --> 00:28:38,483
Why do you stay silent now?

486
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:40,962
Just tell your daughter

487
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:41,922
what you've done.

488
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:43,922
No?

489
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:45,122
I'll tell her then.

490
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:46,442
Your dad

491
00:28:46,962 --> 00:28:48,202
used to invest in stocks.

492
00:28:48,202 --> 00:28:49,202
But now he goes to

493
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:50,162
something fancier.

494
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,523
He invests in futures

495
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,523
with all the money we have.

496
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,323
He invested 600,000 yuan

497
00:28:54,323 --> 00:28:55,362
and lost all of them.

498
00:28:55,362 --> 00:28:57,162
Then, he told me that we're broke now.

499
00:28:58,602 --> 00:28:59,962
I was thinking to make money from that.

500
00:29:00,442 --> 00:29:02,362
I didn't know I'd lose money
by buying the futures.

501
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:04,162
I'll be careful next time.

502
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:05,682
Zheng Yingjun.

503
00:29:06,723 --> 00:29:08,523
Didn't you promise me

504
00:29:10,003 --> 00:29:11,882
that you'd operate
the restaurant with me?

505
00:29:12,642 --> 00:29:13,682
How could you believe him?

506
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:18,083
It's been years.

507
00:29:22,442 --> 00:29:24,122
I've been suffering so much.

508
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,882
I've had enough of him.

509
00:29:29,442 --> 00:29:30,523
I worked finger to bone

510
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:32,162
to sustain our family.

511
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:33,523
Let's not talk about the house affairs
I dealt with

512
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:35,362
which are because of my bad luck
and I deserve this.

513
00:29:35,362 --> 00:29:36,402
What about the supermarket?

514
00:29:36,402 --> 00:29:38,122
I work there.

515
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:40,602
Whenever there were promotions
and discounts,

516
00:29:40,922 --> 00:29:42,003
I'd get anything I could

517
00:29:42,003 --> 00:29:44,043
shamelessly.

518
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:46,003
I took whatever free gifts.

519
00:29:46,602 --> 00:29:48,642
Yet, I was just filling up
a bottomless pit

520
00:29:49,323 --> 00:29:51,763
with every single cent I made.

521
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:54,043
If he had a conscience,

522
00:29:54,243 --> 00:29:57,043
he would never let my efforts
go to waste

523
00:29:57,523 --> 00:29:59,882
and keep taking money out

524
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:02,362
from the house,
which I've shamelessly sustained.

525
00:30:02,882 --> 00:30:04,083
I didn't expect that.

526
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:09,162
Mum.

527
00:30:09,162 --> 00:30:10,323
Mum, please don't go.

528
00:30:10,323 --> 00:30:11,763
- Mum.
- Let me go.

529
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:23,723
How dare you break my accordion!

530
00:30:30,843 --> 00:30:32,243
Just leave however you want.

531
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:12,003
Please stop it.

532
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:16,483
What are you doing, dad?

533
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:26,043
Zheng Yingjun.

534
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:43,882
Why do you come out?

535
00:31:43,882 --> 00:31:44,723
Stop following me.

536
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:50,043
Stop it.

537
00:31:50,043 --> 00:31:51,962
It's chilly outside. Don't follow me.

538
00:31:52,283 --> 00:31:53,162
I fear that you'll abandon us

539
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,122
and go to Shenzhen

540
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:56,523
as you're too upset.

541
00:31:59,642 --> 00:32:00,523
Daqian.

542
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:02,563
I'll give you a piece of advice

543
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:04,642
from the experience of half my life.

544
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:07,283
Never believe in men.

545
00:32:07,682 --> 00:32:09,763
Never believe in what they say.

546
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,523
You have to judge by his action instead.

547
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,922
Never believe

548
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:14,202
that he'll change for you.

549
00:32:14,202 --> 00:32:15,483
That's impossible.

550
00:32:16,723 --> 00:32:18,243
I only wish

551
00:32:18,523 --> 00:32:21,362
you can cherish yourself, alright?

552
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:22,962
Don't follow in my steps

553
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:24,362
no matter what.

554
00:32:24,563 --> 00:32:26,402
Regardless of whether
you get divorced, married,

555
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,402
or you're living alone,

556
00:32:27,402 --> 00:32:28,003
that's fine.

557
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:29,402
Just leading a happy life will do.

558
00:32:29,402 --> 00:32:30,602
Understood?

559
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,442
Mum, I know dad has saddened you.

560
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:38,243
Go inside.

561
00:32:53,803 --> 00:32:54,523
Please eat.

562
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:04,803
It's been years
since I last had dumplings at home.

563
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:06,642
Your mum made the best dumplings

564
00:33:06,642 --> 00:33:08,162
with cabbage and celery fillings.

565
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:13,243
I'll leave

566
00:33:13,402 --> 00:33:14,803
the sheep trotter for you.

567
00:33:14,803 --> 00:33:16,323
When the new year approaches,

568
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:18,362
I'll build a grill rack downstairs

569
00:33:18,523 --> 00:33:20,483
so that you can
have grilled sheep trotter.

570
00:33:21,882 --> 00:33:22,922
I learnt this

571
00:33:22,922 --> 00:33:24,122
when I worked at the restaurant.

572
00:33:24,122 --> 00:33:26,323
I'm really good at this.

573
00:33:26,323 --> 00:33:27,682
All these years, mum gave sheep trotters

574
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:30,602
to your creditors
during Chinese New Year.

575
00:33:40,763 --> 00:33:42,243
I'm sorry to make you suffer.

576
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,402
It's already passed.

577
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,602
This new year

578
00:33:49,723 --> 00:33:51,122
is a new start.

579
00:33:57,483 --> 00:33:58,323
When are you

580
00:33:59,563 --> 00:34:00,602
leaving?

581
00:34:02,922 --> 00:34:04,083
I have yet to decide.

582
00:34:04,563 --> 00:34:06,362
Daqian needs someone
to help out at her restaurant.

583
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:08,803
But Yingjun can't do heavy work.

584
00:34:09,602 --> 00:34:10,682
I need to help them.

585
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:11,763
That's good.

586
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:15,163
At least you make a living
with your skills.

587
00:34:15,723 --> 00:34:16,402
Yes.

588
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,203
After venturing outside,

589
00:34:19,922 --> 00:34:21,163
I know much

590
00:34:21,882 --> 00:34:22,723
about cooking.

591
00:34:25,843 --> 00:34:26,482
Coming.

592
00:34:30,643 --> 00:34:32,522
It's you, Song. Come on in.

593
00:34:33,683 --> 00:34:34,763
I went to the market

594
00:34:34,763 --> 00:34:36,362
this morning.

595
00:34:36,362 --> 00:34:38,283
I've got you

596
00:34:38,562 --> 00:34:39,643
some fresh groceries.

597
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:40,482
I've washed

598
00:34:40,803 --> 00:34:42,042
the trotters for you.

599
00:34:42,362 --> 00:34:44,763
You don't have to go to the market
and compete with others.

600
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:46,042
It's too crowded.

601
00:34:46,643 --> 00:34:47,603
Thank you, Uncle Song.

602
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:49,683
Don't be so courteous.

603
00:34:51,203 --> 00:34:53,163
Song, this is his father.

604
00:34:55,482 --> 00:34:56,362
Nice to meet you.

605
00:34:56,482 --> 00:34:59,042
I'm Tongying's colleague

606
00:34:59,283 --> 00:35:01,323
and we live in the same neighborhood.

607
00:35:01,323 --> 00:35:03,402
So I helped them with some groceries
they might need

608
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:05,522
for the coming new year.

609
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:07,123
Thank you.

610
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:10,123
Then, I...

611
00:35:12,763 --> 00:35:14,683
Do you mind joining us?

612
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:16,362
No, thanks.

613
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:18,203
I came to send them the groceries.

614
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:20,442
You've finally come back home.

615
00:35:20,882 --> 00:35:22,723
You should eat with your family.

616
00:35:23,002 --> 00:35:24,402
I'll get going.

617
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:25,522
Alright.

618
00:35:26,763 --> 00:35:27,922
Get home safely.

619
00:36:01,603 --> 00:36:03,402
When you were away,

620
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:06,163
Uncle Song treated mum very well.

621
00:36:09,082 --> 00:36:09,843
I understood.

622
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:14,402
Uncle Song just takes care of her

623
00:36:16,882 --> 00:36:18,123
without mentioning anything.

624
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:20,002
Only he concerns mum

625
00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:22,843
over the years.

626
00:36:28,723 --> 00:36:29,603
Junze.

627
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,643
I'm going to tell your mum

628
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,562
to get a divorce

629
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:37,243
some days later.

630
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:40,723
I can't cause her more trouble.

631
00:36:41,643 --> 00:36:42,243
Son.

632
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:44,482
Go back home. It's nippy outside.

633
00:36:45,362 --> 00:36:46,803
I'd like to take a walk myself.

634
00:36:53,323 --> 00:36:54,283
Happy Birthday.

635
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,100
(Starry Sky Restaurant)

636
00:37:26,123 --> 00:37:27,882
Why are you still here at this hour?

637
00:37:32,323 --> 00:37:33,763
My parents fought again.

638
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:36,922
Don't they quarrel often?

639
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:39,803
It's different this time.

640
00:37:40,442 --> 00:37:41,922
I think their marriage
has come to an end.

641
00:37:43,882 --> 00:37:44,843
I thought

642
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,562
I could change many things.

643
00:37:49,482 --> 00:37:51,002
Eventually, I realized

644
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:53,803
that nothing has changed.

645
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:55,882
How could that be?

646
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:57,803
Look.

647
00:37:58,163 --> 00:38:00,042
This is the old sofa

648
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:02,042
brought back by you and Lizi.

649
00:38:03,163 --> 00:38:05,603
The new menu prepared by Uncle Yan.

650
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:08,082
And Zixi's drawing on the wall.

651
00:38:08,283 --> 00:38:09,643
These are all changes and the result
of your hard work

652
00:38:09,922 --> 00:38:12,002
after you came back here.

653
00:38:12,562 --> 00:38:14,082
But, there are many things

654
00:38:16,482 --> 00:38:18,482
that couldn't be worked out
no matter how hard I've tried.

655
00:38:19,763 --> 00:38:21,243
Do you mean you and Lizi?

656
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:25,763
We...

657
00:38:29,402 --> 00:38:31,082
We have made a clean break.

658
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,683
Previously,

659
00:38:34,922 --> 00:38:36,922
I made a mistake.

660
00:38:39,603 --> 00:38:40,922
Being friends

661
00:38:41,843 --> 00:38:45,042
is the most comfortable relationship
for us.

662
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:20,042
Get up if you're awake.

663
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,042
Go upstairs to sleep.

664
00:39:48,882 --> 00:39:49,803
Eat something.

665
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:51,562
So that you will
have something in your stomach.

666
00:40:02,882 --> 00:40:03,763
Let's share this.

667
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,442
The accordion is broken?

668
00:40:22,522 --> 00:40:24,283
Whatever.

669
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:26,643
I'm not playing it anymore.

670
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:29,843
It's good though.

671
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,402
I've given it some thought.

672
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:35,763
I'll stop supervising you from now on.

673
00:40:37,723 --> 00:40:38,723
I think

674
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:40,402
it was me who forced you

675
00:40:40,402 --> 00:40:42,082
from the get-go.

676
00:40:42,082 --> 00:40:43,362
From now on,

677
00:40:43,362 --> 00:40:44,763
you can do whatever you like.

678
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:46,323
You don't have to go to the restaurant.

679
00:40:46,323 --> 00:40:48,042
You can go to the mahjong parlor
as much as you want

680
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:49,042
and you don't have to look for a job.

681
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:51,562
Just continue investing in futures.

682
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:52,723
If you make a profit,
spend the money yourself.

683
00:40:52,723 --> 00:40:53,603
If not, it's fine.

684
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:54,962
The money is too less to lose anyway.

685
00:40:55,082 --> 00:40:57,163
Keep on drinking if you like.

686
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,803
It's your body, after all.

687
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:00,962
Today, I came back to pack my luggage.

688
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:02,283
I'm going to stay at the restaurant.

689
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:06,002
Are you leaving?

690
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:09,402
Zheng Daqian,

691
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:12,603
are you going to abandon me,

692
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,243
aren't you?

693
00:41:15,165 --> 00:41:16,002
Understandable.

694
00:41:17,123 --> 00:41:18,562
No one would stay with me.

695
00:41:20,082 --> 00:41:21,082
I won't blame you.

696
00:41:22,002 --> 00:41:22,882
I'm to be blamed.

697
00:41:23,803 --> 00:41:25,082
I, Zheng Yingjun

698
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:28,002
have let the two of you down.

699
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:29,882
Why are you saying such nonsense?

700
00:41:29,882 --> 00:41:30,843
If you do feel

701
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:31,922
sorry for us,

702
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,362
you should put in your effort
and do something

703
00:41:33,362 --> 00:41:34,962
to make mum stay.

704
00:41:35,163 --> 00:41:36,442
But

705
00:41:36,442 --> 00:41:37,843
what can I do now?

706
00:41:40,243 --> 00:41:41,362
What should I do?

707
00:41:54,683 --> 00:41:56,203
These are the jobs I found

708
00:41:56,402 --> 00:41:58,163
that are related to your previous job.

709
00:41:58,163 --> 00:41:59,482
It's related to music.

710
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,203
Please cooperate with me

711
00:42:01,442 --> 00:42:02,723
and go for the interview.

712
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:03,522
Is that okay?

713
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:07,002
Are they good?

714
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:08,603
Alright.

715
00:42:10,683 --> 00:42:11,723
I'll cooperate with you.

716
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:24,882
Drink some tea, please.

717
00:42:24,882 --> 00:42:26,082
Thank you.

718
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:31,163
Sir, this is my father's resume.

719
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,243
My father was

720
00:42:33,243 --> 00:42:35,123
the lead accordionist in the Art Troupe

721
00:42:35,123 --> 00:42:36,442
and conductor of the orchestra.

722
00:42:36,442 --> 00:42:38,243
He has over twenty years
of performing experience.

723
00:42:42,683 --> 00:42:45,002
It's said that having a daughter
is a blessing.

724
00:42:45,002 --> 00:42:46,562
Daughters are the fathers' sweethearts.

725
00:42:48,203 --> 00:42:50,002
How considerate of her.

726
00:42:53,562 --> 00:42:54,323
Zheng.

727
00:42:55,362 --> 00:42:56,843
I have no problem

728
00:42:57,163 --> 00:42:58,323
with you joining us.

729
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:00,922
Wait.

730
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:03,843
Do you have restrictions

731
00:43:03,843 --> 00:43:05,042
on age?

732
00:43:05,522 --> 00:43:07,843
The more living experience you have,
the better it is.

733
00:43:08,723 --> 00:43:10,442
Since you're a real music person,

734
00:43:10,562 --> 00:43:11,723
you'll definitely help us

735
00:43:11,843 --> 00:43:13,603
to improve.

736
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:16,643
There's only one condition.

737
00:43:17,482 --> 00:43:19,163
You have to take care
of the customers' feelings

738
00:43:19,603 --> 00:43:21,243
and empathize with them.

739
00:43:21,562 --> 00:43:22,323
Why?

740
00:43:22,882 --> 00:43:25,123
Do the performers on stage

741
00:43:25,123 --> 00:43:27,922
need to interact with the audience?

742
00:43:28,323 --> 00:43:29,082
Exactly.

743
00:43:30,002 --> 00:43:31,603
Shout when you need to shout.

744
00:43:31,603 --> 00:43:32,803
Cry together with others

745
00:43:32,803 --> 00:43:34,723
when you need to cry.

746
00:43:34,723 --> 00:43:35,882
Do I need to cry too?

747
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:39,123
Wait, what actually is the job about?

748
00:43:44,002 --> 00:43:44,882
Please have this, Zheng.

749
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,723
(Jinxi)
Our company

750
00:43:49,723 --> 00:43:52,002
is the Joyful Melody Funeral Dirge
Service Centre.

751
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:00,402
Are you kidding me?

752
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:01,683
Joyful Melody, my foot.

753
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:03,522
Dad.

754
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:04,962
Sir, I'm sorry.

755
00:44:04,962 --> 00:44:06,042
Please give us a second.

756
00:44:06,203 --> 00:44:06,922
Dad.

757
00:44:07,163 --> 00:44:07,843
Zheng.

758
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:09,763
I think you're a great fit for us.

759
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:11,243
Calm down.

760
00:44:11,243 --> 00:44:12,683
Listen to him first.

761
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:13,402
For what?

762
00:44:13,962 --> 00:44:14,763
I'm telling you.

763
00:44:14,763 --> 00:44:17,082
I'd rather watch the door

764
00:44:17,603 --> 00:44:18,683
than cry at someone's wake.

765
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:19,922
Please don't say that.

766
00:44:19,922 --> 00:44:21,522
They make a living
with their effort though.

767
00:44:22,002 --> 00:44:22,843
Zheng Daqian.

768
00:44:23,323 --> 00:44:25,482
Did you do this on purpose?

769
00:44:25,482 --> 00:44:26,763
Why would I?

770
00:44:26,763 --> 00:44:27,922
The recruitment information

771
00:44:27,922 --> 00:44:29,562
showed that it's Joyful Melody Band.

772
00:44:29,562 --> 00:44:31,323
Besides, I think he's a nice person.

773
00:44:31,323 --> 00:44:32,562
He treated you respectfully.

774
00:44:32,562 --> 00:44:34,042
Respect?

775
00:44:34,283 --> 00:44:35,962
I don't do this no matter what you say.

776
00:44:35,962 --> 00:44:36,522
I will never do this.

777
00:44:36,522 --> 00:44:37,763
Enough.

778
00:44:37,882 --> 00:44:39,362
You promised to stop drinking,
but you failed.

779
00:44:39,362 --> 00:44:40,562
You promised to look for a job,
but you failed.

780
00:44:40,562 --> 00:44:41,882
And you promised to look after
the restaurant, but you failed again.

781
00:44:41,882 --> 00:44:43,442
What have you done all this time?

782
00:44:43,442 --> 00:44:45,042
Indeed, I did nothing.

783
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:47,603
Your mum was being sarcastic to me,

784
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:48,603
and now you do the same.

785
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:49,203
Why?

786
00:44:49,203 --> 00:44:50,163
Are you forcing me

787
00:44:50,163 --> 00:44:51,283
to find a place to bury myself?

788
00:44:51,283 --> 00:44:52,123
True, you should actually
look for a place

789
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:53,082
and bury yourself.

790
00:44:54,362 --> 00:44:55,962
