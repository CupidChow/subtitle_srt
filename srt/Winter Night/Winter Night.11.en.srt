(You already knew the answer)

15
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,850
Hello, Boss.

16
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,010
I got the money now.

17
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,450
We can sign the contract right now.

18
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,450
Forget it.

19
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,890
Don't ever call me again.

20
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,290
No, I really got it this time.

21
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,370
What should I do now?

22
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,450
(To sale, contact me if you're interested.
No Sincerity, No Bother!)

23
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,890
Look, there're a lot of windows here,
it's very bright.

24
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,490
It has a high ceiling as well.

25
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,370
Right, look.

26
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,650
I have two storage rooms over there.

27
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,530
If you rent this store,

28
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,410
you can do any business
you like in here.

29
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,290
- Boss.
- Right?

30
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,530
Boss.

31
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,730
No, why do you come again?

32
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,850
Aren't you tired of it?

33
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,130
I'm here to sign the contract.

34
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,930
Look, I even brought the contract over.

35
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,730
Are you for real?

36
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,610
It's too late. He has reserved it.

37
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,930
Let me tell you this.

38
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,890
- Get ready to...
- Zheng Daqian!

39
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,730
Didn't you promise me
you won't rent this shop?

40
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,570
Why do you come here again?

41
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,970
Just mind your own business.

42
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,650
I've done some research on it.

43
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,410
This place will suffer
from a price depression in future.

44
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,810
It'll be economically devalued
as soon as you purchase it.

45
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,450
Do you think
you've found a treasure land?

46
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,450
It might become

47
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,690
a toxic asset.

48
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,970
- A toxic asset?
- No.

49
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,530
- No, listen to me.
- It's a toxic asset.

50
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,650
- Forget it.
- He... No...

51
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,250
- Let me tell you this, listen to me.
- Forget it.

52
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,850
Forget it.

53
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,530
No, are you insane?

54
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,210
Do I have a beef with you?

55
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,170
How could this place of mine be
a toxic asset?

56
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,450
And that thing you mentioned.

57
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,490
Economically devaluation.

58
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,810
Economically devaluation

59
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,010
is a deterioration of value
caused by external factors.

60
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,010
A deterioration of value

61
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,170
will also affect
the bank's valuation of your asset.

62
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,050
Then, the valuation

63
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,810
will affect your loan in future.

64
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,890
So it'll cause a domino effect.

65
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,210
In short, once it's devalued,

66
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,370
everything will be devalued.

67
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,730
I don't understand it.

68
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,410
Right.

69
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,970
Anyway, I think this is a nice store.

70
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,010
Yes, well...

71
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,290
You are

72
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,130
lacking in knowledge.

73
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,170
Let me put it this way.

74
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,130
There's no prospects
for development in Old Street

75
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,530
in the following ten years.

76
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,530
Everyone will buy the property
in New Urban District.

77
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,330
If you purchase an underpriced land,

78
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,370
you'll be stuck

79
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,450
with a toxic asset.

80
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,050
Right?

81
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,050
Let's go.

82
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,410
You've got a point.

83
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,890
Beijing University graduate is
indeed different.

84
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,530
Let's go.

85
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,410
Well said, Bro.

86
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,570
You're such a literate.

87
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:16,890
Well,

88
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,090
how about this? About the price,

89
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,530
we can negotiate it.

90
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,890
Come, bro, look.

91
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,010
Tell me about it.

92
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,570
What's going on with Old Street?

93
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,770
I'm impressed, Mu Zili.

94
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,690
You've put on a good show.

95
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,770
So do you.

96
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,210
As we're good at acting,

97
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,890
why is no one inviting us to audition?

98
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,130
With our appearances?

99
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,010
They only care about the look now.

100
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,170
No one cares about the acting.

101
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,810
Sometimes, it feels like I've known you
for a long time.

102
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,250
What are you talking about?

103
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,010
We grew up together.

104
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,690
We certainly have known
each other for a long time.

105
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,210
Then, tell me.
What kind of a person am I to you?

106
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,370
Well, you are

107
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,930
impulsive but passionate.

108
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,970
You're sharp-tongued but tender-hearted.

109
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,370
When you're mad,

110
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,770
you'll muddle along.

111
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,370
When you cool off,
you'll be wildly optimistic.

112
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:21,890
Anyway...

113
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,810
Just shut it if you can't summarise it.

114
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,610
We're friends.

115
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,850
Everything I said is truth.

116
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,770
Well, do you want to hear

117
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,090
my summarisation of you?

118
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,530
No.

119
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,810
You are

120
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,450
a gluttonous

121
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,490
and lazy loafer.

122
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,570
You've got small eyes.

123
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,090
You're narrow-minded.

124
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,570
I tell you what. I've got large eyes.

125
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,170
I'll have double eyelids
when I open my eyes wide.

126
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:47,610
Believe it or not.

127
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,170
Come, open it wide, show it to me.

128
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,210
I... Look.

129
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,570
I'm not doing too well today.

130
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,410
Mi Lan, come on in.

131
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,450
Look.

132
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,530
Look at our store. It's well-lit.

133
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,970
It's quite nice.

134
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,410
Then, what are you going to use it for?

135
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,170
To start a restaurant or a homestay?

136
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,650
Calm down.

137
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,170
Wait until it's demolished,

138
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,290
it'll be a no-lose deal.

139
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,530
Are you certain
that it'll be demolished?

140
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,010
Mi Lan,

141
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,410
just believe
that I've got such good luck.

142
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,730
Pretty soon,

143
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,450
you'll know

144
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,290
that this is a brilliant decision.

145
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,370
Yan! Yan!

146
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,290
Come, Yan.

147
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,650
Come over here, take a look.

148
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,930
What do you think about this store?

149
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,090
Did you see these huge windows?

150
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,130
It's quite nice.

151
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,330
Daqian,

152
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,330
I've got

153
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,610
the deconstruction planning.

154
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,010
So soon? How is it?

155
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,610
It's going to be demolished.

156
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,650
I told you.

157
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:51,970
But,

158
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,970
it's not here.

159
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,930
What do you mean?

160
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,130
The deconstruction planning is

161
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,730
bordered by the street
in front of this store.

162
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,810
The building across the street
will be demolished.

163
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,250
Daqian.

164
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,130
How do you feel? Are you feeling better?

165
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,450
It's just across the street,

166
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,730
but they are worlds apart.

167
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,210
Daqian.

168
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,130
I'm to blame for this.

169
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,930
I shouldn't have

170
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,250
told you that this place might be

171
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,970
demolished that time.

172
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,410
It's not your fault.

173
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,970
Just blame...

174
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,050
...her for being greedy.

175
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,730
She's trying to cut corners
and make a fortune.

176
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,250
It's a quirk of fate.

177
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,650
I guess there's no hope in getting

178
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,370
the demolition compensation.

179
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,170
Why am I always  so unlucky?

180
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,610
Let's just sell the store.

181
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,770
Only she will purchase

182
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,730
this broken store.

183
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,930
Who would buy it?

184
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,610
The money I owe you,

185
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,410
I'll be sure to pay you back.

186
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,970
Anyway, since you've purchased it,

187
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,410
you should start a business.

188
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,810
What business can she do?

189
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,770
Start a homestay?

190
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,610
It's sparsely populated.

191
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,810
Who would come to stay here?

192
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,010
Well,

193
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,290
open a game room.

194
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,370
It's too competitive.

195
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,250
Then, what do you suggest?

196
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,170
I've looked around.

197
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,570
The kitchen is
the only part of this store

198
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,250
that can be used.

199
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,690
We can continue the restaurant business

200
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,890
due to the local condition.

201
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,210
You've got it all figured?

202
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,410
Of course.

203
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,770
I must plan ahead
while being your business partner.

204
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:56,970
Mi Lan,

205
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,530
let's do this together.

206
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,090
I can do it, no problem.

207
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,890
There's no turning back, after all.

208
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,490
Let's make money!

209
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,850
I can't do this anymore, I'm exhausted.

210
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,650
Let's...

211
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,330
Let's just continue tomorrow.

212
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,930
It's okay, leave it there.

213
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:32,730
I'll do it later.

214
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,370
Sure.

215
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,770
Look at Yan.

216
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,970
As a man, you should shoulder
the burden at a time like this.

217
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,330
We have to hurry.

218
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,650
We haven't cleaned up the second floor.

219
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,330
Yes, come on, hurry up.

220
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,130
Let's start!

221
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,770
Something came up at my home.

222
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,370
Stop there.

223
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,210
The space of the second floor is
quite large.

224
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,330
We have to fully use the space.

225
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,650
Let's build

226
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,170
a staff dormitory here.

227
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,330
We'll stay up here

228
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,370
and open up the store down there.

229
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,330
I think it'll do.

230
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,490
Perfect. Quickly move out of my house.

231
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,290
I'll move after packing up my stuff.

232
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,090
I don't like to live with you either.

233
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,770
I've made up my mind.

234
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,570
Look.

235
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,530
Let's build a wall here.

236
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,850
There will be the staff dormitory.

237
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,250
We'll live in there.

238
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,210
And here.

239
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,210
We'll build a small storage room.

240
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,130
The ingredients
of our restaurant and groceries

241
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,370
will be put in here.

242
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,410
Look, there are several
huge windows here.

243
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,450
We'll build a sunroom here.

244
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,250
So we can drink coffee
while basking in the sun.

245
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,170
What do you think?

246
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,050
Do you have budget for that?

247
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,570
A sunroom?

248
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,050
Daqian,

249
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,410
if you really like it,

250
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,050
I'll pay for the cost
of building the sunroom.

251
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,050
You're so nice, Yan.

252
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,130
I hereby declare

253
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,850
Yan to be our new shareholder.

254
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,090
How about this?

255
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,610
Let's call Dazhi over.

256
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,450
We'll hold a housewarming party tonight.

257
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,610
Sure.

258
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,490
- Okay.
- Sure.

259
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,290
Let's do it!

260
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,650
To our new store
which will be opened soon.

261
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,930
Cheers!

262
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,170
- Cheers!
- Come, cheers!

263
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:31,770
Drink up.

264
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,490
Daqian,

265
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,930
we must implement
the fire safety responsible

266
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,970
to prevent the safety risks.

267
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,530
If there's an outbreak of fire,

268
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,010
you must calm down.

269
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,370
Escape in an orderly manner.

270
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,290
Liu Dazhi, can you say
something auspicious?

271
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,290
It's my treat but you spoil my fun.

272
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,210
Don't eat it.

273
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,890
Come, spit

274
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,450
that liquor you drank out.

275
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:51,970
Don't eat it.

276
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,250
It's just a safety advice.

277
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,410
I have the duty to remind you guys.

278
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,890
We have to reinstall the floor, repaint
the walls and rebuild the water

279
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,210
and power utilities.

280
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,890
We don't have much budget for that.

281
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,970
I can do the millwork.

282
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,810
I can also handle
the floor and wall work.

283
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,570
Then, we're on painting
and decoration duty.

284
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,770
Sure, we're on it.

285
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,010
I've got a question.

286
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:16,970
Since

287
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,810
we're planning to open a restaurant,

288
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,170
who'll be the chef?

289
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,210
Why are you looking at me?

290
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,450
I've inherited my mum's cooking skill.

291
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,730
I can at most be an accountant.

292
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,530
Don't worry, this is not a problem.

293
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,610
There are so many of us.

294
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,650
Let's create it together.

295
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,050
Uncle and Aunt,
are you becoming bankrupt?

296
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,850
I hope that you won't borrow money

297
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,730
from my dad when you're bankrupt.

298
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,930
What's on that tiny mind of yours?

299
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,570
I didn't teach him that.
He said it himself.

300
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,970
Well, anyway,

301
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,690
Daqian, I'm sure Niuniu and I

302
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,250
are the strongest foodies here.

303
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,280
(Guan Zhe)
are the strongest foodies here.

304
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,290
Don't come here by yourselves.

305
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,490
Invite your friends over.

306
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,010
Invite all your colleagues over.

307
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,810
Sure, they'll be here.

308
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,410
- I'll take care of it.
- Come!

309
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,090
I wish we can make a fortune!

310
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,290
Make a fortune!

311
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,410
No bankruptcy.

312
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,970
What do you mean?

313
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,770
We'll make a lot of money.

314
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,930
♪You're just like the fire♪

315
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,130
♪The raging flames lit me up♪

316
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,690
♪Your large eyes are brightly shining♪

317
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,490
♪Just like the brightest star
in the sky♪

318
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,650
You've sung along the way.

319
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,130
Can you be quiet for a while?

320
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,650
It's been a long time
since I saw a lot of stars.

321
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,090
Let's sit here and enjoy the view.

322
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,090
It's freezing cold.

323
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,770
Did you notice

324
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,050
that there are fewer stars
in winter than in summer?

325
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,330
That's because

326
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,290
the stars in winter know
that it's cold out here.

327
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,370
That they have to go home.

328
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,570
Have you ever thought
of owning a restaurant one day?

329
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,010
No.

330
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:27,890
Then, have you thought

331
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,330
that one day you'd be able

00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,010
a creative western restaurant.

500
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,090
I don't think I'm eligible
for this position.

501
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,090
I think you're well qualified

502
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,290
for this job.

503
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,890
But,

504
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,010
do the people in Baihe like

505
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,170
to eat western food?

506
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,330
Just eat up.

507
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,490
We got to go buy furniture afterwards.

508
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,330
I want to try it too.

509
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,130
Mu Zili.

510
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,370
Have we met before?

511
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,410
We met at Daqian's birthday party
a few years ago.

512
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,610
You're her childhood friend, right?

513
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,450
My name is Guan Zhe.

514
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,650
You're Guan Zhe?

515
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,210
What are you doing here in Baihe?

516
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,690
Of course I'm here for Daqian.

517
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,850
Do you know where she is?

518
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,050
She doesn't tell you

519
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,170
because she finds no reason
to contact you.

520
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,210
There's some misunderstanding
between us.

521
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,810
I came to explain it.

522
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,730
It's not necessary.

523
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,410
You better don't bother her.

524
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,690
Where's Daqian?

525
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,010
You're back so soon.

526
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,450
Where's Daqian?

527
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,290
She's upstairs, cleaning up.
What's wrong?

528
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,490
Guan Zhe is here.

529
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,210
But he doesn't know where Daqian is now.

530
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,890
I guess if he asks around,

531
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,810
he'll soon find our store or my house.

532
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,170
How dare he come here?

533
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,050
I think we should keep them apart.

534
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,930
Who knows what he'll say
to sweet-talk her.

535
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,130
Who's sweet-talking?

536
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,490
The furniture shop's owner.

537
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,330
What's wrong with him?

538
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,850
He...

539
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,570
priced them up terribly.

540
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,730
I think

541
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,890
we can't make purchase
in Baihe Furniture Shop.

542
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,090
We've got to go to Tieyuan.

543
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,730
It's possible.

544
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,890
The stuff in big city is cheaper
than that in small town.

545
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:19,970
Go ahead.

546
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,210
You come with me.

547
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,250
Why would I go with you?

548
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,530
I've got many works to do.

549
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:26,850
I...

550
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,690
Can you trust me

551
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,090
to make purchase

552
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,010
when you're not around?

553
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:31,570
Yes.

554
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,290
He's right.

555
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,770
Indeed.

556
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,850
Who knows what you'll buy,
how much you'll spend,

557
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,330
if you'll get kickbacks from it.

558
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,210
Yes, yes.

559
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,130
Come on, let's go.

560
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,730
Mu Zili, you're acting strange today.

561
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,130
Am I?

562
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:45,930
I'm not.

563
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,890
The store will be closed if you're late.

564
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:48,970
- Go on.
- Hurry up.

565
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,170
- I'll get you your coat.
- Okay.

566
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,330
Choose wisely.

567
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,770
It's rare to see you being so active.

568
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,050
- Yes.
- Wait, put your coat on.

569
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,570
Okay, we'll get going.

570
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,610
Okay, choose carefully.

571
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,490
Okay.

572
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,890
Well, let me ask you something.

573
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,210
What is it?

574
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,330
Is Guan Zhe still bothering you?

575
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,450
I've blocked his phone number
and blacklisted him on Wechat.

576
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,690
Except his Alipay.

577
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,050
I want him to pay me back.

578
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,130
Great, then.

579
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,890
Why do you care so much about him?

580
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:29,850
I don't know.

581
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,090
It makes me mad when I hear his name.

582
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,570
What has he got to do with you?

583
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,690
What has he got...

584
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,130
Just drive.

585
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,650
I'm going to take a nap.

586
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,530
What style of furniture do you think
we should buy?

587
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,610
Whatever, anything will do.

588
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,090
That won't do.

589
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,290
What do you think about this chair?

590
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,170
Which one?

591
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,690
This one which costs RMB 899.

592
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,690
RMB 899?

593
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,610
Look at its legs.

594
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,370
It's made of metal, it's modern.

595
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,130
I think this chair which costs

596
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,410
RMB 369 is quite nice.

597
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,330
It's not nice.

598
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,690
It's made by wood, it's so tacky.

599
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,570
The one which costs RMB 899 is better.
Our store...

600
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,050
Let me think, two, four, six...

601
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,690
Ten. We only need ten of it.

602
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,010
That's it. I'll buy ten of it.

603
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,810
Ten? RMB 89...

604
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,770
Lizi, Lizi, quick.

605
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,930
What do you think about this table?

606
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,850
This is quite good, it's simple.

607
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,650
Right?

608
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,050
But the price is

609
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,930
not affordable.

610
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,890
Ten chairs with five tables.

611
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,250
They cost about RMB 5,000,
it's not that expensive.

612
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,930
I think

613
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,130
we should return
to the furniture store in Baihe.

614
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,730
Baihe's furnitures are not that bad.

615
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,330
Didn't you say the owner priced them up?

616
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,810
This is nice,
each of them has a price tag.

617
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,610
That's it.

618
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,530
Ten chairs and five tables.

619
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,890
Let's see what else they have.

620
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,130
This sofa looks cute.

621
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,410
It's white and fluffy.

622
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,770
Let's buy a sofa.

623
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,290
We're opening a restaurant.

624
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,010
What do you need a sofa for?

625
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,970
Are you a fool?
I'll put it on the second floor.

626
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,690
Drinking a small cup of coffee
while sitting on the sofa.

627
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,490
Basking in the sun,
how nice would it be?

628
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,370
Basking in the sun?

629
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,330
Don't you know how much budget you have?

630
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,330
The spending on all those have
exceeded our budget.

631
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,610
We're opening a creative restaurant.

632
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,090
Can you have some corporate culture?

633
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,210
Besides, look at this.

634
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,570
RMB 1999, 70 percent off.

635
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,450
Its original price was
over RMB 7000, it's perfect.

636
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,930
If you have that money,

637
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,250
why don't you spend it
on the cooking utensils?

638
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,010
And

639
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,090
buy a new pressure cooker to replace

640
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:38,930
the one you destroyed.

641
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:39,690
If I knew you were so petty,

642
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,770
I wouldn't have let you manage
the money.

643
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,810
If I didn't manage the money,

644
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,610
the store would've gone bust long ago.

645
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,690
Dear customers,

646
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,690
stop quarreling.

647
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,570
Bro, listen to my advice.

648
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,050
Your wife didn't ask you
for some sort of jewelry.

649
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:50,970
She's not my...

650
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,410
She only asks for this small sofa.

651
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,330
Come, take a seat.

652
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,170
Feel it.

653
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,290
If you bring it home,

654
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,850
imagine sitting side by side on it

655
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,650
while eating and drinking.

656
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,650
It's needless to say or ask anything,

657
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,610
you'll know the answer.

658
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,970
We're not like what you think.

659
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,010
He and I are just neighbours.

660
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:13,850
Neighbours.

661
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,650
Neighbours?

662
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,170
You used to be neighbours.

663
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,890
After bringing it home,

664
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,010
you're no longer neighbours.

665
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,490
- Think about it.
- No, you...

666
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,170
This is the receipt for your purchase.

667
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,370
Okay, have a look.

668
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,890
Then, I'll pay you first.

669
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,650
Okay, sure.

670
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,490
Where should I put the sofa?

671
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,810
Put it in the trunk.

672
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,370
Okay.

673
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,450
Done, I've made the payment.

674
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,450
Okay, thank you.

675
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,490
Thank you.

676
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,530
Why are you looking at me?

677
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:53,850
Get in the car.

678
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,570
Slow down, slow down.

679
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,570
Please come again next time.

680
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,250
Okay, let's go, Yan.

681
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,450
You go first.

682
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,090
I'll wait a little longer.

683
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,210
What are you waiting for?

684
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,610
If Guan Zhe comes here,

685
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,010
I can deal with him.

686
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,850
Don't act anything rash, Yan.

687
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,970
Besides, Daqian has changed a lot

688
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,330
since she returned.

689
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,690
I'm sure that she can handle him alone.

690
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,050
She has become

691
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,450
a completely different person
since she returned.

692
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,730
It feels like I've met a brand new her.

693
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,850
Then, who do you like?

694
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,450
Is it the present Daqian?

695
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,370
Well, I'll get going.

696
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,810
Text me on Wechat if there's anything.

697
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,890
What's wrong?

698
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,690
I have no idea either.

699
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,450
I guess the engine is worn out.

700
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,490
I suffer worse luck
everytime when I come out with you.

701
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,650
We ran out of gas last time
and now, the car is broken down.

702
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,130
Why don't you get off
and check it out?

703
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,370
How could I repair a car?

704
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,210
What should we do then?

705
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,290
It's late, we can't make it home.

706
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,370
We should call for a tow.

707
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,250
Hello, Sir.

708
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:44,730
Our car is broken down

709
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,570
on the country road back to Baihe.

710
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,090
It's 33 kilometers away from Baihe.

711
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,370
(Baihe 33km)
It's 33 kilometers away from Baihe.

712
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,170
How long does it take you to reach here?

713
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,250
Huh? Three hours?

714
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,570
Okay, then.

715
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,250
Give me a call when you reach.

716
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,170
I'll wait for you.

717
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:06,970
Okay.

718
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,090
Gosh, we have to wait
for another three hours.

719
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,450
I can't take it, I'm freezing.

720
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,290
If you're dead, I'll have to pay
worker's insurance compensation.

721
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,170
Yes.

722
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,850
This is a business trip.

723
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,090
There's a petrol station not far ahead.

724
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,890
Why don't we go there and wait?

725
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,930
Let's go, hurry up.

726
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,490
Which direction? This way?

727
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,170
There.

728
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,490
(Sinochem Petrol)

729
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,890
Eat some noodles to warm ourselves.

730
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,570
I'll never come out with you again.

731
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,530
This is an accident.

732
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,890
I notice

733
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,170
that we're incompatible.

734
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,210
Then, who are you compatible with?

735
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,650
Are you compatible with Guan Zhe?

736
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,250
Why do you mention him for no reason?

737
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,210
Let me ask you this.

738
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:10,090
If Guan Zhe

739
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,010
suddenly comes for you,

740
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,410
what will you do?

741
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,410
Well, I'll have to see

742
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,250
why he comes for me.

743
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,250
What?

744
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,730
Are you going to get back together
with him if he asks?

745
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,130
Rest assured, I know what to do.

746
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,090
I will have nothing more to do with him.

747
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,770
What about Yan?

748
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,890
What do you think about Yan?

749
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:45,650
Yan and I are just friends.

750
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,170
I can tell the difference

751
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,570
between friendship and love.

752
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,770
Then, what kind of a man do you like?

753
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,250
- I don't know what kind of a man he is.
- He?

754
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,410
You do have someone you like?

755
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,330
No, he, what does he look like?

756
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:30,730
He

757
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,650
looks exactly like you.

758
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,370
Both of you are completely different.

759
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,370
I thought he treated me badly.

760
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,650
But after I returned to this place,

761
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,770
I found

762
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,930
that everything he said is right.

763
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,050
The way he made me mad was

764
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,730
actually his way of caring about me.

765
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,770
Well,

766
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,090
why didn't he come for you?

767
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,810
Because of some

768
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,050
particular reasons,

769
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,930
he can't come for me for now.

770
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,490
But I'll be sure to look for him.

771
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,810
Hello, Sir.

772
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,090
You're here.

773
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,170
Your car is broken down as well?

774
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,290
Button up.

775
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,450
Both of you stayed out all night.

776
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,370
Where have you been?

777
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,450
Uncle, we went to Tieyuan
to buy furnitures.

778
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,370
Where did you stay at night?

779
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,890
Our car was broken down.

780
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,930
We waited at the petrol station
all night.

781
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,250
It's something you'll do.

782
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,290
It's freezing out there.

783
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,210
Hurry up, go upstairs.

784
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,050
Wash up and sleep.

785
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,330
Did you catch a cold?

786
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,570
Daqian, I'm fine.

787
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,130
I'm sleepy, I'll go to bed first.

788
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,090
What are you looking at?

789
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:44,130
I'm quite optimistic about them,
they're a perfect match.

790
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,930
As long as he can make a move,
anyone will do.

791
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,810
Let's go.

792
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,930

(But I'll be sure to look for him.)

799

(Starry Sky Restaurant)

800
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,090
Let's put it next to the window.

801
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,210
- Over here?
- Yes.

802
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,210
What about this?

803
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,210
Put it over there.

804
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:38,810
Okay.

805
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,850
Don't break it.

806
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,250
I can't do it anymore.

807
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,370
It's exhausting.

808
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,770
Let me take a break.

809
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,730
Hey, Lizi,
you don't get enough exercise.

810
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,570
If someone comes to make troubles,

811
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,330
what will you do?

812
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,730
We still have Zheng Daqian.

813
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,610
Yan,

814
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,970
did Guan Zhe come here yesterday?

815
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,410
He didn't.

816
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,210
Lizi,

817
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,690
where were you guys last night?

818
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,650
We stayed
at the petrol station all night.

819
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,690
To wait for the tow truck.

820
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,370
You knew

821
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,290
the low efficiency of Baihe.

822
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:19,890
Lizi,

823
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:21,890
why

824
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,210
do you care so much about Guan Zhe?

825
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,090
I'm afraid
that Zheng Daqian would be so silly

826
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,210
