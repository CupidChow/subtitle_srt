What Daqian did today

24
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:27,777
was indeed too much.

25
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:29,537
But I'm sure

26

she didn't mean it.

Don't stay mad at her.

that we shouldn't hold grudges, right?

00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:43,018
I'll go upstairs and check on her.

I'll give her an earful

How can it be all smooth sailing, right?

117

Our hearts

118

before it can hold
all the fillings in it.

I can't do much for you,

What's the matter, Dad?

131
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:18,698
I strained my back.

I'm fine.

133
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:23,177
Did you get arrested
for being drunk and fighting in public?

134
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:26,138
You're too old
to get involved in a fight.

Not too hard.

136
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:28,578
I don't mind if others misunderstand me,

137
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,058
but don't you know what your dad's like?

138
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:31,498
I'm too old

139
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:32,818
to get violent.

However,

about what happened to Daqian.

146
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:51,498
They said she ran away from home
because she broke up with her boyfriend.

147
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:52,737
Ran away from home?

148
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:53,938
She was trying to kill herself.

149
00:07:54,498 --> 00:07:55,938
I always knew it.

150
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:57,297
Your daughter doesn't look like someone

151
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:59,417
who could survive away from home.

152
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:00,217
Zheng.

153
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,857
I heard that
they even moved in together.

154
00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:05,578
She has lost
both money and her love life.

155
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:06,777
She even has
to depend on you financially now.

156
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:08,417
I think raising this daughter

157
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:09,898
is like a loss-making business for you.

158
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:12,297
I don't mind spending all my money
on my daughter.

159
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:13,818
You have no room to talk.

160
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:16,058
How dare you criticize my daughter
before me?

161
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:18,777
Zheng, I'm just worried
about your family.

162
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,378
Don't you have anything better to do?

163
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:22,977
You're old, but you are a good fighter.

164
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:23,777
Real man.

165
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:26,018
Bring me along
if you're doing this again.

166
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:27,297
We are
the perfect father-and-daughter duo.

00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:33,417
Dad, I'm hungry.

169
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,297
Make me some food.

170
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:35,097
Wait.

171
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:36,537
Let me tell you.

172
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:38,858
You really made
your mom's blood boil today.

173
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,898
I've never seen her this upset before.

174
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:42,777
I know.

175
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:45,297
I regretted it
immediately after I said those words.

176
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:47,098
What happened to her later?

177
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:48,378
Don't you know what your mom's like?

178
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:49,898
No matter how serious the issue is,

179
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:51,138
she'll be fine in a while.

180
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,498
When we get back later,

181
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:54,177
you should just apologize to your mom.

182
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:55,738
Make sure
you smooth her ruffled feathers.

183
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:57,577
Fine. I got it.

184
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:13,697
It's late at night.
Who are you cooking for?

185
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:17,297
Where did you go?

186
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:20,618
I brought our daughter out for a walk.

187
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,138
Zheng Yingjun, do whatever you like.

188
00:09:22,338 --> 00:09:23,417
Zheng Daqian, stay here.

189
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:24,498
I need to talk to you.

190
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:34,738
I'll hit the sack then.

191
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:35,537
Up to you.

192
00:09:51,297 --> 00:09:52,057
Eat.

193
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:55,457
I'll give you a proper lecture
after you're done.

194
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:00,338
Eat.

195
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,378
The cold noodles taste really good.

196
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:15,657
Did you make this?

197
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,577
Keep eating.

198
00:10:16,937 --> 00:10:18,057
There's no need to force a conversation.

199
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:20,057
I mean it.

200
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:24,417
Why wasn't my mom as good?

201
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:25,138
What did you say?

202
00:10:30,657 --> 00:10:31,858
I want to apologize to you.

203
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:35,898
I shouldn't have slapped you
in front of the crowd.

204
00:10:38,858 --> 00:10:39,898
It's fine, Mom.

205
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:43,817
I spoke before I thought.

206
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:48,417
Why happened to you before coming home?

207
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:50,537
Did anyone bully you?

208
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:52,777
Tell me what happened.
You can always rant to me.

209
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:54,577
It'll at least put both of us at ease.

210
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:57,177
I'm fine.

211
00:10:57,577 --> 00:10:59,057
Is it because of Guan Zhe?

212
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:01,098
It has nothing to do with him.

213
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:03,618
It must have been him.

214
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:05,338
Are you sure you're fine?

215
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:06,417
Yes, I am.

216
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:12,098
Why are you not eating the pork ribs?

217
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:13,018
It's your favorite, right?

218
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:14,457
I made a vow

219
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:16,498
to never eat pork ribs in my life again.

220

00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:11,298
Just a sip.

335
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:13,217
I've recovered.

336
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:14,417
I've recovered.

337
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:15,457
I...

338
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,058
I am... I am Zheng Daqian.

339
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:18,578
I really am Zheng Daqian.

340
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:21,257
She's back.

341
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:23,257
She's back.

342
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:26,138
I'm back.

343
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:27,937
I'm back.

344
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,720
(Guarantee Statement)

345
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,657
After reflecting upon myself,
I've come to a realization.

346
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:37,858
In order to build...

347
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:43,177
To build a harmonious family,

348
00:17:43,257 --> 00:17:48,457
I suggest Gong Xiaoqin
return my ID card to me

349
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:51,217
and give me back my right to freedom.

350
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:52,017
Zheng Daqian.

351
00:17:52,497 --> 00:17:54,058
You spelled this word wrongly.

352
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,618
Mom, Dad. I'm sorry.

353
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:04,538
I ran away from home

354
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:06,378
because I was feeling depressed.

355
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:08,697
I had nowhere to vent my emotions.
I was weak and sensitive.

356
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:11,138
It's normal to run into challenges
when we're working away from home.

357
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,697
However, I wasn't determined enough
to overcome the difficulties.

358
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,497
I get it now.

359
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,017
Scars on our bodies
will only turn into medals

360
00:18:18,017 --> 00:18:19,538
after we conquer these challenges.

361
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:21,177
From tomorrow on,

362
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:22,457
I'll turn over a new leave.

363
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:23,098
Zheng Daqian.

364
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,298
You finally figure out

365
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:26,338
who you are?

366
00:18:26,697 --> 00:18:28,058
Of course.

367
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:30,657
I'm Zheng Daqian, the daughter
of Gong Xiaoqin and Zheng Yingjun.

368
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:32,538
I live at No. 3,
Xinhua Street, Baihe Town.

369
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:34,177
I used to live here
before I turned 18 years old.

370
00:18:34,257 --> 00:18:34,937
After I graduated from university,

371
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:36,417
I moved to Ningzhou
and started working there.

372
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,778
When I was 28 years old,
I started dating a jerk.

373
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:38,778
His name is Guan Zhe.

374
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:40,298
He cheated my feelings
and took away my money.

375
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:41,778
Now, I came home, looking like trash,
hoping to kill myself.

376
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:43,017
I have no job and no savings now.

377
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:44,497
All I know is to bring troubles
to my family.

378
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,417
When I first saw the guy in the photo,

379
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,898
I thought he looked like a sly man
and was unworthy of you.

380
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:49,818
However, your mom insisted

381
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:51,538
that you had hit the age
and should grab whoever you met.

382
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:52,818
You said she could always find
a nicer guy while holding onto this one.

383
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:55,737
You can't blame her.

384
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:57,618
I have only myself to blame.

385
00:18:58,937 --> 00:18:59,818
Well said.

386
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:01,898
It seems like
our daughter is wiser than you.

387
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:05,977
Mom. Can you return my ID card?

388
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:07,177
You took it yesterday.

389
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:10,058
I can give you back your freedom,

390
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:11,257
but not your ID card.

391
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:12,977
How can you do that?

392
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:14,937
Why not? I'm your mom.

393
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:16,257
Don't even think
about going back to Ningzhou.

394
00:19:16,578 --> 00:19:17,697
Stay at home.

395
00:19:18,697 --> 00:19:19,417
Sure.

396
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:21,657
Then, I won't do anything at all.

397
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:23,298
I'll stay here forever.

398
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:24,417
You'll need to feed me.

399
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:25,457
I'm fine with that.

400
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:27,778
Me too.

401
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:28,858
Daqian,

402
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:30,298
just stay at home

403
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:31,298
and keep us company.

404
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:34,098
Breakfast is ready.

405
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:36,378
It's mealtime.

406
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:37,457
Zheng Yingjun.

407
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:39,378
There must be something wrong with you

408
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,657
if you're not excited about food.

409
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:42,657
Don't act like everything is all right.

410
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,378
How is the house?

411
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:45,697
They're fixing it.

412
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:46,298
Let's go.

413
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:17,578
I didn't go back yesterday.

414
00:20:19,538 --> 00:20:21,417
It seems like the problem wasn't
with the train station.

415
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:25,217
Then, it must be the train.

416
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:31,697
Which train was it?

417
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:34,538
K...

418
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:36,538
K...

419
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:39,058
K268. Yes. K.

420
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:43,177
268.

421
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,257
What is this?

422
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:46,497
They're terminating
their service tomorrow.

423
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:47,818
The train is doing its final trip today.

424
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:49,578
How is that possible?

425
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:56,417
No way.

426
00:20:57,338 --> 00:20:58,858
I need to leave today.

427
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:25,177
Daqian.

428
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:27,378
Aunt Hui.

429
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:31,138
Where are you going?

430
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,538
The weather seems pretty good today.

431
00:21:34,657 --> 00:21:36,257
I want to take a breath outside.

432
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:39,578
Lizi can go with you.

433
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:40,778
He's free now.

434
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,937
- I don't want to bother him, Aunt Hui.
- Let's go.

435
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:44,017
- I'm fine on my own.
- Don't worry. You won't bother him.

436
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:44,937
- Come on.
- It's fine.

437
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,138
He's in the living room.

438
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:46,977
I don't want to bother him.

439
00:21:46,977 --> 00:21:48,737
It's fine. Trust me.

440
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:50,338
Zili,

441
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:53,257
go out for a walk with Daqian.

442
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:54,657
You need to exercise

443
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:55,977
and clear your brain fog too.

444
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:57,177
I'm not going.

445
00:21:57,338 --> 00:21:59,138
I've had enough in the past two days.

446
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:07,138
Go out for a walk with Daqian.

447
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:09,858
Help me keep an eye on her.

448
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:13,098
She's an adult.
Why do I need to keep an eye on her?

449
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:15,898
I'll give you 1,000 yuan.

450
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:20,338
Mom, you're right.

451
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:21,697
I'll keep a good watch on her.

452
00:22:24,457 --> 00:22:25,098
Zheng Daqian.

453
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:28,898
My mom

454
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:31,257
just gave me a 500-yuan budget.

455
00:22:31,257 --> 00:22:32,697
Let's go and have some fun.

456
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:34,058
She gave you 1,000 yuan,
but we're left with 500 yuan.

457
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:35,778
You will be a great scammer.

458
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:38,417
Your brain is not working,

459
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:39,578
but your ears definitely are.

460
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:41,298
Where are we going?

461
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:44,058
I'll bring you to a luxury place.

(Baihe No. 1 Middle School)

463
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:52,977
I spent my whole morning
giving lectures.

464
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:54,417
My throat is dry.

465
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:56,138
Yes.

466
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:58,138
I got it.

467
00:22:58,257 --> 00:22:59,378
It's never easy.

468
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:02,578
Till the end of life
a silkworm keeps spinning silk;

till burning itself out

470
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,417
It does get dry easily here.

Mu,

472
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:15,578
it's less than eight months
from College Entrance Examination.

473
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:16,217
Yes.

474
00:23:16,618 --> 00:23:19,778
Other parents visit the school
very frequently

475
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:21,697
to discuss with teachers
about their kids.

476
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:25,257
It's time you get serious about this.

477
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:27,778
Make sure you prepare well enough
for the exam.

478
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:28,898
Mr. Mi,

479
00:23:29,378 --> 00:23:30,417
you're right.

480
00:23:30,858 --> 00:23:32,017
We're all ready

481
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:34,058
for it.

482
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:36,217
I am ready, and his mom is ready too.

483
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:39,257
I'm glad I decided to speak to you.

484
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:40,977
Your attitude

485
00:23:41,257 --> 00:23:43,058
will decide your kid's attitude.

486
00:23:43,937 --> 00:23:45,937
Zixi is now

487
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:47,818
at a very important crossroad
in his life.

488
00:23:47,898 --> 00:23:50,298
He must make the right choice.

489
00:23:50,657 --> 00:23:51,457
Mr. Mi.

490
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:54,017
What actually happened?

491
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,497
I'm still quite confused.

492
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:01,417
Zixi is a good kid.

493
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:03,257
He shouldn't give up the chance

494
00:24:03,257 --> 00:24:05,378
to take part in Peking University's
independent recruitments so soon.

495
00:24:06,177 --> 00:24:08,298
It wasn't easy for the school
to secure this opportunity.

496
00:24:08,497 --> 00:24:10,937
I kept pushing him,
but he remained unmoved.

497
00:24:11,177 --> 00:24:13,578
I gave him the registration form,

498
00:24:13,737 --> 00:24:14,737
and guess what he did.

499
00:24:15,338 --> 00:24:17,338
I stopped hearing from him
one week later.

500
00:24:17,618 --> 00:24:19,138
I asked him what happened,

501
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:20,578
and guess what he said.

502
00:24:21,017 --> 00:24:23,138
He said he didn't need to go to college.

503
00:24:23,138 --> 00:24:24,497
I was enraged.

504
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:26,657
Mr. Mi, calm down.

505
00:24:28,098 --> 00:24:29,338
He shouldn't have done that.

506
00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:34,578
You're too stingy, Mu Zili.

507
00:24:34,858 --> 00:24:36,618
You brought me to a park where
you don't need to spend a penny.

508
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,818
Is money all you care about?

509
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:41,737
Can money buy you happiness?

510
00:24:41,737 --> 00:24:42,538
Look at this place.

511
00:24:42,937 --> 00:24:45,098
It's a place of joy,

512
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,138
especially this spot.

513
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:49,017
Do you know what this place is?

514
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:50,257
It's the Love Bridge.

515
00:24:51,378 --> 00:24:53,177
Do people actually believe in this?

516
00:24:53,778 --> 00:24:54,737
Look at you.

517
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:57,457
As the saying goes,
"The belief in a thing makes it happen."

518
00:24:57,457 --> 00:24:58,177
This is the perfect place

Let's go boat-paddling.

It's too cold to paddle a boat today.

533

We've traveled all the way here.
Let's go.

Wait. I'm feeling a little giddy.

(Baihe First Middle School)

537
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:24,898
Dad.

538
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,378
Why are you here?

539
00:26:28,177 --> 00:26:29,937
Mr. Mi spoke to me today.

540
00:26:35,497 --> 00:26:36,298
Come here, kid.

541
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:42,578
Tell me

542
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:45,457
why you don't

543
00:26:46,298 --> 00:26:48,697
want to apply for Peking University?

544
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:54,737
I don't know why I should apply
for Peking University.

545
00:26:58,657 --> 00:27:00,058
I don't like the university.

546
00:27:02,017 --> 00:27:03,138
Mom said I had to apply for it

547
00:27:03,737 --> 00:27:05,217
because it's a good university.

548
00:27:07,497 --> 00:27:08,618
Mr. Mi said

549
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:11,098
my brother managed
to get into the university.

550
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,338
The leaders of the school said

551
00:27:14,177 --> 00:27:16,098
it would make our school proud.

552
00:27:17,298 --> 00:27:18,618
They said
it would prove my worth too.

553
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:25,257
But I studied so hard

554
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:28,818
only because I wanted
to decide for myself.

555
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:36,058
Dad, I need to go to class now.

556
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:45,217
Kid.

557
00:27:45,818 --> 00:27:47,138
I understand

558
00:27:48,457 --> 00:27:49,657
what you think.

559
00:27:51,257 --> 00:27:51,937
Go ahead.

560
00:27:57,497 --> 00:27:58,818
Sure. Then, I'll get going.

561
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:10,417
- This one.
- Do we really have to do this?

562
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:15,657
Here.

563
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,818
Lizi, you'll go first.

564
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,578
Check if the boat is sturdy enough.

565
00:28:22,858 --> 00:28:24,098
You should get in first.

566
00:28:24,378 --> 00:28:26,898
Check if the boat
is sturdy enough first.

567
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:28,737
I'm sure it is. Get in there.

568
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:30,818
I'm feeling sick.

569
00:28:31,697 --> 00:28:33,098
You are feeling sick?

570
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,098
Then, why did you want to paddle a boat?

571
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:36,977
I've already paid for the ticket.
Get in there.

572
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:39,138
You go first. I'm scared.

573
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:40,338
You go first.

574
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:41,457
I don't want to get in there alone.

575
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:42,818
- Get in there.
- I'm scared.

576
00:28:53,538 --> 00:28:56,457
Don't you think us being in the lake

577
00:28:56,657 --> 00:29:00,138
resembles the romantic scene
in "The Notebook"?

578
00:29:00,257 --> 00:29:02,017
"The Notebook"?

579
00:29:02,017 --> 00:29:03,497
I don't even see a swan here.

580
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:06,257
The ticket only cost us 20 yuan.

581
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:06,898
What do you expect?

582
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:08,457
Do you think we can get
an Oscar-winning film set?

583
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:09,657
Keep paddling.

584
00:29:09,657 --> 00:29:11,298
Talk less, work more.

585
00:29:15,818 --> 00:29:16,457
Daqian.

586
00:29:17,378 --> 00:29:18,697
What's bothering you?

587
00:29:18,697 --> 00:29:19,818
You can tell me.

588
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:21,858
It's just a breakup.

589
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:23,778
Why did it affect you so much?

590
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:25,898
You live with your parents.

591
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:27,898
How dare you stick your nose
into my business?

592
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:30,298
I am just returning to my family.

593
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:33,017
Moreover, I didn't try to kill myself.

594
00:29:43,138 --> 00:29:44,657
You really forgot everything?

595
00:29:45,138 --> 00:29:46,497
That's not true.

596
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,138
I remember their names,

597
00:29:48,217 --> 00:29:50,977
but I only vaguely remember
the incident.

598
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:54,378
Are you not going back
to continue your business?

599
00:29:55,858 --> 00:29:57,898
What's wrong with staying at home?

600
00:29:58,098 --> 00:29:59,618
I can stay with my parents,

601
00:29:59,618 --> 00:30:00,898
and it's happier this way.

602
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:03,217
If that's the case,

603
00:30:03,257 --> 00:30:06,017
let's forget all the bad things

604
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:07,657
in the past.

605
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:10,138
What's the point of keeping

606
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:11,538
all these unhappy memories?

607
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:13,138
Right?

608
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:19,858
This Mu Zili is quite different
from the other one.

609
00:30:19,937 --> 00:30:20,538
What?

610
00:30:21,338 --> 00:30:23,618
I'm feeling a little sick.

611
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:24,818
Let's go back.

612
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:29,217
Hurry up.

613
00:30:29,657 --> 00:30:30,497
Quick.

614
00:30:56,217 --> 00:30:56,858
Careful.

615
00:30:57,818 --> 00:30:59,338
What are you doing, Mu Zili?

616
00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:00,257
Careful.

617
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:01,017
Thank you.

618
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:06,417
You're quite persistent, Zheng Daqian.

619
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:07,578
Do I look so gullible?

620
00:31:07,898 --> 00:31:09,257
What did I do?

621
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:12,017
Give me back my car key,

622
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:13,098
and I'll help you get off the boat.

623
00:31:13,217 --> 00:31:14,697
Do you think I can't do this myself?

624
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:26,257
Go.

625
00:31:33,697 --> 00:31:35,058
Go.

626
00:31:37,657 --> 00:31:38,338
Fine.

627
00:31:38,818 --> 00:31:40,818
It's my fault. All right?

628
00:31:42,017 --> 00:31:44,058
You don't sound sincere at all.

629
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:46,778
I'm sorry.

630
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:52,017
Car key.

631
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:11,378
Cell phone.

632
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:12,217
What is this for?

633
00:32:12,257 --> 00:32:13,338
Pawns.

634
00:32:13,338 --> 00:32:14,378
Do you think I will believe you?

635
00:32:14,378 --> 00:32:15,058
I'm not giving you anything.

636
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,058
You don't want to give me, huh?

637
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:19,098
Fine.

638
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:26,417
Welcome ashore.

639
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:30,737
Daqian.

640
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:32,298
Don't be mad.

641
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:33,257
Where do you want to go next?

642
00:32:33,257 --> 00:32:34,298
Let's go spend some more money.

643
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:35,338
Give me back my phone.

644
00:32:35,697 --> 00:32:36,657
I can't.

645
00:32:36,697 --> 00:32:38,697
I have already informed
Uncle Yingjun about this.

646
00:32:39,937 --> 00:32:40,657
Yes.

647
00:32:41,257 --> 00:32:42,417
He's waiting for you at home now.

648
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:44,257
I'm in charge of sending you home.

649
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,378
Mu Zili.

650
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:48,977
What did I do to you?

651
00:32:49,618 --> 00:32:50,378
Daqian.

652
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:53,217
A kid can run away from home.

653
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,618
We're too old. And if we do it now,

654
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:56,138
they call it escaping from reality.

655
00:32:58,457 --> 00:33:00,017
Anyway,
I've already given uncle my word.

656
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:01,697
I'll bring you back no matter what.

657
00:33:05,298 --> 00:33:06,338
What about this?

658
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:09,538
Let's go for a ride.

659
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:14,818
I'm a pretty good driver.

660
00:33:23,457 --> 00:33:25,138
I've come home with you.

661
00:33:25,697 --> 00:33:26,538
Give me back my phone.

It's money again.
That's all you care about.

Thank you.

672
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:01,417
Don't worry.
I'll go and find my mom at the studio.

Uncle, I want to make a report.

675

She tried to run away again today.

676
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:15,338
Dad, I never intended to run away.

677
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:17,218
I simply didn't want
to spend time with Mu Zili.

678

Why are you cooking?

681
00:34:25,698 --> 00:34:27,457
Look. I went to the market this morning

682
00:34:27,497 --> 00:34:28,937
and bought some fresh ingredients.

683

I have something urgent to attend to.
I need to go now.

What's the hurry?

685
00:34:32,298 --> 00:34:33,258
I'll cook

686
00:34:33,258 --> 00:34:34,977
your favorite braised pork ribs.

687
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:36,818
I don't like pork ribs.

688
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:38,818
Have you changed your taste?

689

What do you like?

690
00:34:41,298 --> 00:34:43,658
I like grilled meat.

691
00:34:46,137 --> 00:34:46,858
Try this.

692
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:53,898
How is it?

693
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:58,017
It's been a while
since we last had grilled meat together.

694
00:34:58,778 --> 00:34:59,537
It's good.

695
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:01,298
Eat more, then.

Do you want some drinks?

698

I don't think so.

Since you were little,

I've always thought
you were different from others.

706
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:49,898
You were very ambitious.

707
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:52,097
Of course, you would leave Baihe

to pursue your dream, right?

709

No one had foreseen

that you would run into
such difficulties.

You shouldn't blame yourself.

712

If you must,
you should blame me and your mom.

713
00:36:02,218 --> 00:36:04,338
Why did we let a girl

714

leave home on her own?

715

Why did you have to work hard alone
away from home?

716
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:08,818
Yes. It's your fault.

717
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:12,097
How could you agree with me?

718
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:14,898
You have been
too protective of Zheng Daqian.

719
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:17,218
You are always worried about her,

720

whether she was in college, at work,
or searching for her life partner.

721
00:36:19,537 --> 00:36:20,937
If you could, you would've shielded her
from this universe

722
00:36:20,937 --> 00:36:21,977
and protected her from all harm.

723
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:24,097
Deep down, she is really fragile.

724
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:26,417
She gets hurt very easily.

725
00:36:26,658 --> 00:36:28,858
Tell me. Who bullied you?

I'll kill him for you.

No one's here. Who can you kill?

728

Moreover, she's an adult now.

729
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:38,057
She should learn
how to take care of herself.

How long can you keep protecting her?

I'm not a capable man.

But when I see
all the other kids settling down,

733
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:51,258
I worry about you.

734

I can't rest my mind.

But...

738

As long as I'm alive,

739
00:37:02,617 --> 00:37:04,298
I'll always protect my daughter.

740

Even if I'm dead,
my spirit will protect her too.

741
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:08,858
I'm only doing this
because you're my daughter.

742
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:11,298
It's my job to take care of you, right?

743
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:17,577
Dad, I'm really running out of time.

744
00:37:17,577 --> 00:37:19,378
I need to leave tonight.

745
00:37:19,778 --> 00:37:22,378
Why?
Are you running away from home again?

746
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:23,818
I'm not running away from home.

747
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:25,417
I'm going to start over.

748

749
00:37:31,497 --> 00:37:32,457
In another universe,

750

our family is no longer like this.

751

You left me

752
00:37:37,178 --> 00:37:38,818
a long time ago.

753
00:37:47,778 --> 00:37:49,617
Another universe?

754
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:50,898
I don't get this.

755
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:53,017
Just take this as an analogy.

756
00:37:53,658 --> 00:37:56,017
Anyway, when you're not with me,

757
00:37:56,497 --> 00:37:58,858
I have learned how
to handle many things on my own.

758
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:01,178
I'm not as weak as you think.

759

Whenever I think

760
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:05,017
I'm on the verge of breaking down,

761
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,778
I would grit my teeth and look back.

762
00:38:08,818 --> 00:38:10,497
Then, I would realize
I've actually come a long way.

763

You know what.

764
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:16,218
You will come across
many paths in your life.

765
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:18,417
But the journey home

766
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:20,258
will always be the most comfortable one.

767

Without Guan Zhe, there will still be
Song Zhe or Li Zhe.

769

Someone broke my heart today.

770
00:38:25,457 --> 00:38:27,057
And I might even lose my job tomorrow.

771
