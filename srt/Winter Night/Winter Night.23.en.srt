You look down lately.

146
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,039
Is it because your dad and I

147
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,000
were displaying our affection

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,919
publicly and you got embarrassed?

149
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,279
No, I couldn't be happier about it.

150
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,919
Then what happened?

If one day, I go missing,

Of course I will.

Don't you underestimate your dad and me.

159
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,120
Those few days
when you ran away from home,

160
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,840
I was worried sick.

161

You had no idea.

162
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,720
If you went missing,

163
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,320
I would leave everything behind.

164
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,000
I would pack up

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,279
and search for you everywhere.

166
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,840
What if you can't find me?

167

I won't do anything else

170
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,639
other than looking for you.

171
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,480
I made you.

172
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,559
Don't you get it?

173
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,279
When a mother

174
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,399
loses her child,

175
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,480
it's as if a part of her soul has left.

176
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,080
You'll know when you have kids.

177
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,320
Your nails are long now.

178
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,879
Let me fix them for you.

179
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,720
No.

180
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,120
You cut them very short.

181
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,919
It hurts.

182
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,679
Whatever.

183
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,679
Great manicure you did there.

184
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,399
Needless to say.

185
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,759
I can't go to Shenzhen to work

186
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,279
without picking up a trick or two
beforehand.

187
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,919
Mum, come.

188
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,559
Paint my nails too.

189
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,960
I'm going to Hainan

190
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,519
and I can flaunt my nails.

191
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,879
You're staying indoors
during the winter.

192
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:25,919
No one will see your nails.

193
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,639
Just paint them.

194
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,519
When I miss you, I'll look
at my toenails.

195
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,159
Then you have to promise me

196
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,159
that wherever you go,

197
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,240
you have to let me know.

198
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,919
You hear me?

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,799
Give me your foot.

200
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,679
Apply several layers then.

201
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,720
Thick layers.

202
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,840
So thick that it won't fade
after several months.

203
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,759
It will be there forever, all right?

Zixi.

205
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,159
I don't want to be in the hospital.

206

Let's go home.

207
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,320
Mum, we'll go home

208
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,240
after we consult a doctor.

There's nothing wrong.

That condition only appears

on those who are traumatized

their loved ones.

Is there any treatment available?

Let her rest. We'll observe for a while.

219

If this persists

220

or even a few months,

then it's pathological.

223
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,320
You might need to bring her
to a neurologist.

224
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,919
Are there no other alternatives?

Family company

226
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,720
is the best solution.

227
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,440
Surround her with optimism,

228
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,759
vim and vigor.

229
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,039
Guide her out of the grief.

Mum, I made you bird's nest soup.

231
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,159
I'll put it here.

232
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,039
Mum, what else do you want to eat?

233
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,039
I'll make them for you.

I'm not hungry.

235

You can eat it.

All right.
Let me know when you're hungry.

It seems like today's dinner

Nothing too serious.

Go home when you're tired.

Let's have the cake.

276
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,480
I just realized

277
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,039
you can celebrate your 29th birthday
again.

Indeed.

279

Who would have thought

280
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,759
that I could celebrate my
29th birthday twice.

281

Last time we celebrated your birthday,

00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,799
I hit Guan Zhe.

And you ran after me.

And then...

285
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,200
It was...

286
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,119
It was quite fun.

- Then you...

288

- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

289
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,640
You said you wanted to tell me something

290

when you came back to Baihe.

291

What is it?

292
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:14,759
We're already here.

I'm serious.

It's not

299
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:35,920
a slip of the tongue.

how do you plan

304

to spend your second 29th birthday?

305
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,640
No idea.

After that day,

307
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,880
we have to go back.

You worry about Aunt Hui, don't you?

310
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,559
I have been here for a few months.

311
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,759
This is like my home.

312
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,039
I'll do my best

313
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,640
to make my mum recover sooner,

314
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
before I leave, ideally.

315
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,920
If, I mean

316
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,480
if we don't go back,

317
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,599
we forfeit our original universe

318

and stay here,

319
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,400
will you do it?

320
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:57,839
Of course.

321
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,400
As long as we can be together,

322

I don't care which universe we're in.

But I know that's not right.

324

It's not fair to us
in the other universe.

325

It's not fair to Yan either.

Besides,

327

it's selfish of me

00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,559
When you're preparing

339
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,079
the condiments,

340
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
do not mess up the order.

341
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,240
If you do,

342
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,960
it will affect how it tastes.

343
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
When I'm gone,

344
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,839
it'll count on you.

345
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,920
Okay. Let me show you the dishes.

346
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,319
Bill, please.

347
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:04,960
36 yuan.

348
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,759
Yan, you're early.

349
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,279
The dinner is tonight.

350
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,319
I came to help.

351
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,440
Lizi isn't here?

352
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,640
He's keeping Aunt Hui company.

353
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:32,720
What did he say?

354
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,920
I haven't told him.

355
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,319
I plan

356
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:43,359
to tell him after the dinner

357
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,440
tonight.

358
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,359
If Lizi plans to stay,

359
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,880
what do you do?

360
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,079
I have to tell him the truth

361
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,319
no matter what.

362
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,440
You know me.

363
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,200
I can't keep a secret.

364
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,240
If I lie to him

365
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,480
and ask him to come back with me,

366
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,720
sooner or later,

367
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,000
we will become

368
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,400
two different individuals.

369
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,000
I see.

370
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,839
A few months pass by so quickly.

371
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,200
A few months ago,

372
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,400
there was nothing here.

373
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,359
Now, it's all good.

374
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,440
Indeed.

375
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,880
If it wasn't

376
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,119
for the relocation compensation,

377
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,960
I wouldn't have been able
to open a restaurant here.

378
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,240
My money wasn't enough as well.

379
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,920
It's thanks to everyone
that we have this place.

380
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,680
I owe everyone so many things.

381
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,519
No.

382
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
It's all thanks to the Zheng Daqian
who likes to stir up trouble.

383
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,359
She came to Baihe.

384
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,839
She changed a lot of people,

385
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,160
and a lot of things here,

386
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,359
including me.

387
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,720
When I go back,

388
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,480
I'll have my relocation compensation.

389
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,000
I'll be rich.

390
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,759
I can make a fortune for real this time.

391
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:10,839
Daqian.

392
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,480
Serve some beers to this table, please.

393
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,440
I'll do it.

394
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,558
(Starry Sky Restaurant)

395
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:36,720
- Don't pour him that much.
- This kid.

396
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,920
He loves sweet drinks.

397
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,559
- Coming through.
- Fried oyster mushrooms.

398
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,319
Let me have a look.

399
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,039
Niuniu must be hungry.

400
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,079
Your teeth have broken off.
Stop drinking.

401
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,160
Daqian, don't worry about this.

402
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,960
Sit here, you two.

403
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,000
I'll handle the rest.

404
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,200
- Sit.
- Okay.

405
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:50,720
I'll peel the prawns for him.

406
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,960
Sorry, I'm late.

407
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,440
Where are your mum and Zixi?

408
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,440
Mum took her meds and is sleeping.

409
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,640
Zixi is doing his revision.

410
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,680
He'll look after her.

411
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,039
Coming.

412
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,359
- Coming.
- It has arrived.

413
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,119
The food is ready.

414
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,240
The last dish.

415
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,960
Did you miss me?

416
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,400
Everything is here.

417
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,640
Thank you.

418
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,400
Don't worry about it.

419
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,400
Eat.

420
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,240
Let's eat.

421
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,880
Zheng.

422
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Drink with me.

423
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,799
Sure.

424
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,559
I'm not good with words.

425
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,680
I don't know

426
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,880
what to say now.

427
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,000
If Mu was here...

428
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,400
If he was here,

429
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,079
he would be talking

430
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,720
about the sky and the moon.

431
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,920
All sorts of things.

432
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,240
As if we are all into them.

433
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,000
If my dad was still here,

434
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,880
we wouldn't be able to eat

435
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,880
for another 30 minutes.

436
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,839
Right.

437
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,799
I'll keep it brief.

438
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,119
The kids are all here.

439
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,680
I came back this time.

440
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,400
I have met

441
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,119
all I have to meet,

442
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,480
and done all

443
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,440
I have to do.

444
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,000
It's time for me to go.

445
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,559
Only by living

446
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,160
a meaningful day

447
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,039
that you can go home in peace.

448
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,720
I wish all of you

449
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,039
happiness and fulfillment.

450
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,039
Cheers.

451
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,759
Why so gloomy?

452
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,839
It's not like

453
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,119
I won't come back.

454
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:53,839
I will

455
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,319
when it's time to come back.

456

Come. Cheers.

Take care when you're out there.

This farewell dinner for Uncle Yan

482
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,119
is quite sentimental, isn't it?

483
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,200
Uncle Yan is a great cook.

484
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,680
I'm sure he'll prosper anywhere he goes.

485

Yan, don't worry about him too much.

Okay.

There will always be departure.

Don't be that rueful.

No one knows what the future holds.

490

Don't you think so?

491
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:04,440
Perhaps when we're 70 or 80 years old,

492
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,240
we can have a reunion
in a space station.

493
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,160
Exactly. No one knows about the future.

494
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,880
I'm sure there will be reunions.

No.

I want to tell you something.

That day at Tieyuan Station,

500

I got a call from her.

501
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,319
She told me something.

502
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,599
In that accident,

in the other universe.

506

That's why I'm destabilizing

507
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,839
but you aren't.

508
