00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,020
Do you know that?

171
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,700
Why do you want to ask for leave
to study drawing at this time?

172
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,180
Tell me honestly.

173
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,580
How long have you been learning to draw?

174
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,180
I've been learning by myself.

175
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,340
Zixi.

176
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,100
Did the goal of getting admitted
to Peking University

177
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,140
put a lot of pressure on you?

178
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,620
What about this?

179
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,740
You take one day off and rest at home.

180
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,820
Mr. Mi, I'm not going
to Peking University.

181
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,260
I'll sign up for a drawing class
and start learning.

182
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,220
Are you in your right mind

183
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,780
or do you have too much spare time?

184
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,540
Do you know

185
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,940
that the school has talked to me
many times, for your sake?

186
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,140
Again, for your sake,

187
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,500
I kept postponing college
registration of Peking University.

188
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,380
You go back and rest for one day.

189
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,580
Think about it seriously.

190
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,620
Mr. Mi, you don't have to do this
for me.

191
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,100
I'll decide on my future.

192
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,700
(It's true, please approve.
Parents' signature: Li Huixian)

193
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,140
Here you are.

194
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,060
Mr. Mi.

195
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,820
Have some tea.

196
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,500
Mr. Mi, what brings you here?

197
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,780
Let's chat a little first.

198
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,580
Don't make it intense like this.

199
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,020
Does it help if I tell you?

200
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,580
I've done so before.

201
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,220
You never take it seriously.

202
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,060
Why are you angry with me?

203
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,580
Mr. Mi, sorry to keep you waiting.

204
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,020
What's wrong?

205
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,260
What has happened?

206
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,020
Huixian.

207
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,500
Look at this.

208
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,540
Did you sign it?

209
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,660
This...

210
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,580
No.

211
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,300
I assure you

212
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,900
that I have no idea about this.

213
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,060
Do you know

214
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,380
what Zixi told me today?

215
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,740
What did he say?

216
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,940
He said that he wanted
to decide on his future.

217
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
He's going to learn to draw
and sit for the art exam.

218
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,300
He'll never go to Peking University.

219
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,580
Besides,

220
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,660
his result of the model test
has dropped

221
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,340
as well as his ranking.

222
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,420
What on earth has happened to him?

223
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,700
Do you know what his reason is?

224
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,900
Ketchup, sesame oil,

225
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,620
and soy sauce.

226
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,740
We get all things, right?

227
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,900
Do we miss out on anything?

228
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,020
Soy sauce.

229
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,300
Fermented bean paste.

230
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,660
Oh, right. Fermented bean paste.

231
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,740
Which one should we buy?

232
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,580
(The brand from Pixian County,
soybean paste.)

233
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,460
(Soybean paste from Pixian County.)

234
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,540
This one.

235
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,300
You see,

236
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,620
Lizi is always considerate of you.

237
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,020
He just acts like he knows me.

238
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,020
However, something is going on strangely
between you.

239
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,340
He's the strange one instead.

240
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,060
Does he finally realize something?

241
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,700
It's useless
even if he has understood something.

242
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,220
Are you two...

243
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,500
Just friends.

244
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,180
At times, our friendship even breaks
when we fight.

245
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,980
Actually, quarreling
with someone you like

246
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,180
is easier than

247
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,140
with someone you loathe.

248
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,340
Have you thought of

249
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,060
why the pressure-cooker

250
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,700
was changed to an advanced one

251
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,180
so that steam is released automatically?

252
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,740
Why didn't Lizi invite me to the movie

253
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,820
but you instead?

254
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,820
And why did he buy you a coffee machine?

255
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,420
Coffee machine? What do you mean?

256
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,700
You bought a new coffee machine
the other day.

257
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,060
Lizi has brought one too.

258
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,900
Dad and mum, I'm home.

259
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,300
Oh, my head.

260
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,340
You're back, Mr. Painter.

261
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,180
I've never expected

262
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,060
that my son possesses

263
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,380
the skill of signature forgery.

264
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,380
(Agree.
Parents' signature: Li Huixian)

265
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,300
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,980
I was worried that you'd object
if I told you.

267
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,580
The men of Mu

268
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,260
are all opinionated.

269
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,500
Do I have to say to raise objections?

270
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,140
How could you put it that way?

271
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,260
Isn't it that you always decide

272
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,460
for the family?

273
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,580
Am I right?

274
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,060
Of course.

275
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,700
As if.

276
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,100
Don't fool me by being honey-mouthed.

277
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,460
Tell us.

278
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,700
Why do you give up
on Peking University?

279
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,260
Why did you decide on learning drawing

280
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,860
out of blue?

281
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
I think

282
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,220
Zixi has his thoughts.

283
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,900
I don't need you
to put in a good word for me.

284
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,540
I refuse to go to Peking University

285
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,740
because I have no reason to be there.

286
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,100
Do you think you have reasons
for drawing then?

287
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,140
If you started drawing
when you were young,

288
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,420
I wouldn't stop you

289
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,620
when you insisted on the art exam.

290
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,660
But, what's now?

291
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,340
You just changed on a whim

292
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,820
and the zeal got into your brain
out of nowhere.

293
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,940
Zixi.

294
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,100
This is the College Entrance Examination
not some sort of small tests.

295
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
It's the exam
that influences your life greatly.

296
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,740
That's the point.

297
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,020
In my life,

298
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,020
drawing

299
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,940
is the only thing I want to do.

300
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,900
This is my dream.

301
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,500
A dream that came on a whim

302
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,340
never lasts.

303
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,940
True.

304
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,060
It might be forgotten soon after.

305
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,140
But at least
now I can feel the urge to try

306
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,020
because of this.

307
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,980
Geez, my head.

308
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,020
Zixi.

309
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,060
Don't head back to the class.

310
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,220
Go to the gymnasium now.

311
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,900
Why?

312
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,460
Did you forget

313
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,820
that today is a pep rally for the exam?

314
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,540
Mr. Mi selected you
as the best student representative

315
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,740
to give a speech.

316
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,740
Hurry.

317
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,980
Ask for leave for me.

318
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,300
Tell them I'm sick.

319
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,340
Zixi.

320
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,020
No class today?

321
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,580
I take one day off.

322
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,700
Off?

323
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,100
I take a leave for sketching.

324
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,580
Are you doing it here?

325
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,620
No.

326
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,740
I came to invite you.

327
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,540
Do you want to come with me?

328
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,940
If you are free.

329
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,900
Sure.

330
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,620
I'm free today.

331
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,580
I'll get my coat.

332
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,340
Give me a second.

333
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,220
Sure.

334
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,860
Zixi.

335
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,540
Where are you doing for the sketching?

336
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,220
Let's look around first.

337
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,980
Why do you pick up drawing suddenly?

338
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,700
Won't it affect your study?

339
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,220
I've decided

340
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,460
to sign up for a drawing course.

341
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,140
Seriously?

342
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,740
But, you do very well in your studies.

343
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,740
Do your parents support your decision?

344
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,140
I've made up my mind

345
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,660
no matter what they do.

346
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,660
This is the ticket for my departure.

347
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,060
It's nice having a dream.

348
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,020
I support you.

349
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,900
It's been some while
since I last played this.

350
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,980
I remember

351
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,140
I played this with Daqian and the rest

352
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,180
when we were in high school.

353
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,820
Let's go.

354
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,140
Let's refresh your memory.

355
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:34,980
How do you feel now?

356
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,340
Go.

bought you some hand cream

373

and face cream.

374
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,260
I came to pass it to you.

Where have you been?

378
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,020
Nothing. I took one day off.

379
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,380
I realized

380
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,060
that you've gone too far.

381
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,500
The clock is ticking away.

382
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,180
Why do you waste your time instead?

383
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,780
Do you want to repeat the grade?

384
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,460
And you too.

385
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,580
Do you know

386
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,220
he's in grade twelve now?

387
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,540
Don't you influence him

388
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,380
with something you've learnt outside.

389
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,940
He's my student.

390
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,020
He's unlike the hooligans outside.

391
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,060
Mr. Mi.

392
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,860
How could you say that?

393
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,820
I'm just saying the truth.

394
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,300
I invited Mi Lan out today.

395
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,380
She does nothing wrong.

396
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,620
You!

397
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,180
You're older than him by a few years.

398
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,140
You're a big sister to him.

399
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,020
Then, you should behave like one.

400
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,340
Out of a sudden,

401
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,660
you decided to run a restaurant.

402
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,060
But look at this.

403
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,260
No one is here.

404
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,740
Aren't you just messing around?

405
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,620
Look at yourself.

406
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,620
You've disappointed me in every way.

407
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,020
Do you have anything
that makes me feel proud?

408
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,300
Do you have any?

409
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,580
Mr. Mi. I'm the one
who started this business.

410
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,660
Mi Lan is my partner.

411
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,220
I invited her to help me.

412
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,580
Mr. Mi.

413
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,420
Please don't make any comments

414
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,260
if you know nothing.

415
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,460
I saw this with my own eyes.

416
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,460
Mu Zixi.

417
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,860
Do you really think

418
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,020
you can get to a good university

419
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,740
as you just started
to learn drawing now?

420
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,620
I don't care
what you're focusing on now,

421
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,300
you must represent the school

422
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,820
to sit for the exam
for Peking University.

423
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,900
Do you hear me?

424
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,260
Let's leave.

425
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,980
Let's go back to school
for the self-study session.

426
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,180
Mr. Mi, I'll repeat this the last time.

427
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,620
I'm not representing anyone

428
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,500
to sit for the test.

429
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,340
I took a day off today.

430
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,580
I'll attend school tomorrow.

431
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,900
You can punish me
with whatever you want.

432
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,300
But for now,
please don't involve others.

433
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,820
Good.

434
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,180
Tomorrow.

435
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,180
I'll see you tomorrow.

436
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,340
What the heck is wrong with you?

437
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,740
I'll go upstairs first.

438
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,500
Thank you.

439
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,820
Zixi and you...

440
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,260
Nothing has happened between us.

441
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,380
It's normal for a boy

442
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,900
who's going through puberty

443
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,940
to fall for a big sister.

444
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,060
Stop making fun of me.

445
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,460
I see Zixi as my little brother.

446
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,980
Don't take your dad's criticism
to heart.

447
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,180
Mr. Mi is always like this.

448
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,660
Bossing around
like the vice dean of students.

449
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,100
I've been used to

450
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,460
his attitude long ago.

451
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,300
He always thinks
that I disgrace his name

452
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,820
for everything I did.

453
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,020
Disgrace, my foot.

454
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,100
Why do people always value pride highly?

455
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,620
I remember when I was new to work,

456
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,540
my superior

457
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,020
disliked me

458
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,340
for not toasting others,

459
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,620
and disgracing his name.

460
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,060
When I think of it now,

461
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,900
it's just pointless of his behavior.

462
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,380
He should've made a toast himself
if he cared so much for himself.

463
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,740
I didn't know

464
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,780
Zixi has some nerves.

465
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,900
He even dared to confront Mr. Mi
head-on.

466
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,100
What did he say just now?

467
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,940
"Mr. Mi,"

468
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,300
"I repeat this the last time."

469
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,660
"I'm not representing anyone
to sit for the test."

470
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,500
Oh, that reminds me.

471
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
I left my things at his home.

472
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,540
I need to go fetch it.

473
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,300
I almost got it slipped my mind.

474
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,900
Go ahead.

475
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,220
Be careful.

476
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,060
Daqian.

477
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,860
These are the clothes you left here.

478
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,580
This is the skincare product
for your mum.

479
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,180
Thank you, Aunt Hui.

480
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,500
You're welcome.

481
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,060
Daqian, how's your dad?

482
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,140
As usual.

483
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,780
Dad, mum.

484
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,500
Let me show you something.

485
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,980
What's it?

486
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,380
This is...

487
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,780
These are

488
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,140
all drawn by Zixi.

489
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,940
Look at these,
the certificates of award.

490
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,420
Mum.

491
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,100
Can we let Zixi try what he wants?

492
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,460
I have nothing to say
if he did this earlier

493
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,740
or one year earlier.

494
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,620
I would've allowed him to learn drawing.

495
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,340
But it's a crucial moment for him now.

496
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,220
The exam is just a few months away.

497
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,460
Do you think

498
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,660
childhood talent

499
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,900
can be useful now?

500
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,020
Am I right, Daqian?

501
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,500
Zixi is indeed good at drawing.

502
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,900
However, College Entrance Examination is
also an important thing

503
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,140
in life.

504
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,860
Indeed.

505
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,740
Gaokao is only
a small and important matter

506
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,460
in our lives.

507
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,500
If so, why did you work so hard

508
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,900
for College Entrance Examination previously?

509
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,700
Why would you say it's a small matter
when it comes to your brother?

510
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,460
Mum, what I mean

511
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,460
is that Zixi didn't come out
with this decision on a whim.

512
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,220
He truly loves drawing

513
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,780
since he was young.

514
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,500
There's no harm in letting him try.

515
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,580
What if he fails?

516
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,100
Failing at the age of eighteen
is just nothing.

517
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,300
That's right.

518
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,660
Failure means nothing

519
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,700
even at the age of twenty-eight.

520
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,380
I know and understand

521
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,460
what you mean.

522
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,380
I'll allow him to learn to draw

523
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,740
if he gets this award

524
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,300
now.

525
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,140
But...

526
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,180
But this is a mere award

527
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,540
from childhood.

528
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,460
Zixi.

529
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,660
I'm not looking down on you.

530
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,180
Instead, I mean

531
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,420
you have to

532
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,660
think rationally about
the College Entrance Examination.

533
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,580
Zixi.

534
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,420
If you see drawing

535
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,060
as your dream,

536
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,100
why not sit down and have a little chat?

537
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,140
You can continue
to chat about your dream.

538
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,100
My dream

539
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,140
only deserves to be thrown
in the utility room upstairs.

540
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,500
I'll talk to him.

541
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,140
Zixi.

542
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,500
I support your decision.

543
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,060
If you need any help,

544
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,900
just tell me.

545
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,220
Don't pry into my business.

Who's that?

What has happened, Dazhi?

00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,500
Are you sure the door wasn't forced?

563

The lock cylinder

is intact.

That's weird.

566

None of the doors and windows
was forced either.

How did he get in then?

True.

569

That's the point.

570
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,220
Did you lose anything?

571
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,060
No.

572
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,500
But there are new rice grains,
noodles and eggs.

Speaking of which,

574
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,500
I just realized

575
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,340
that the door was left open
a few days ago

576
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,820
when I was back from work.

577
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,780
But, no one was in the house.

578
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,620
Mum, why didn't you tell me this?

579
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,460
I thought it was you

580
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,700
who forgot to close the door.

581
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,820
Well.

582
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,180
The priority now

583
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,620
is to change the lock immediately.

584
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,700
Yan.

585
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,380
We'll look into the security cameras

586

along the street

587
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,420
and find the suspicion.

588
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,900
Thank you so much, Dazhi.

589
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,460
I can't believe

590
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,260
such break-ins still exist now.

591
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,140
What did the police say?

592
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,180
Is it a pervert?

593
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,500
It's under investigation.

594
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,380
Anyway, the lock is changed.

595
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,620
Don't worry.

596
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,860
How could I not worry?

597
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,180
It's only you and your mum in the house.

598
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,540
What if someone targets you?

599
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,540
What about this?

600
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,500
You two move out of the house first

601
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,620
and move back

602
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,540
after the person is captured.

603
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,700
Sounds reasonable.

604
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,780
You said nothing was lost,

605
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,780
yet you have received some gifts.

606
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,140
It sounds scary.

607
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,220
Could it be that the thief has
some sort of weird fetish?

608
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,740
Probably those things are stolen goods.

609
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,460
Yan, try this.

610
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,820
I've tried a new recipe.

611
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,780
Give your suggestion.

612
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,020

Why didn't you call me to the sauna?

671
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,340
You're here, anyway.

672
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,780
The room is hot. Let's take a shower.

673
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,020
Let me introduce him to you.

674
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,180
This is Mu Zili, Mu's elder son.

675
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:28,900
This is Uncle Yan.

676
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,380
You've grown up, boy.

677
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,140
Long time no see. You're slim now.

678
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,580
Oh my.

679
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,820
You've grown stronger.

680
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,380
What are you up to?

681
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,140
Do you want to kiss each other then?

682
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,860
Hey, dude.

683
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,340
Let me introduce myself.

684
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,660
I'm Zheng Yingjun from Baihe.

685
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,900
Let's talk in a friendly way.

686
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,580
Play nice.

687
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,780
I don't care who you are.

688
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,700
Come here.

689
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,780
Didn't he tell you

690
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,500
to talk friendly?

691
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,340
Why?

692
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,860
Do you pay for his debt?

693
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,820
If he owes your money,

694
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,780
he should pay it back.

695
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,900
But if you're trying to cheat him
out of money,

696
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,340
that's another story.

697
