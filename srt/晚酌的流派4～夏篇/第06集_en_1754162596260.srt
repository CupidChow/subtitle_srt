1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Teleto

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Left hand is just a pair of hands.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yesterday, after dinner, I was reading that national basketball manga until I went to bed.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Today is the Hophousing basketball tournament.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's a great way to get ready for the night.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Good.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How can I drink the last drink of the day in the best way?

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This drama is a story of a woman who pursues it.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The amount of alcohol depends on your actions.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It can be 0 or 100.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm going.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Keep shining.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
In my head.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The melody that starts to dance.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I can't breathe.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's the best.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
As it is.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I was in a pinch yesterday.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I couldn't go out unless there were five people in the basketball tournament.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So I asked Mr. Nikuyama, who is the tallest in the shopping district, for help.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh!

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I was separated from the meat.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh!

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I couldn't go out because I was separated from the meat.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh!

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I couldn't go out this year.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I practiced with everyone.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I practiced with everyone.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Super Bat Shop!

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Super Bat Shop!

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Super Bat Shop!

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh no!

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If this continues, the basketball will be over.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh no!

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh!

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hi.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Can I help you?

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No, no, no. I'm Chris.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I came to work as a trainee.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What is it?

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Chris, a trainee.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Miyuki, you're fluent in English.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Your language skills will expand your range of skills.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Your English and Spanish are the same.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Welcome.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm the legendary manager.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Chris, we're looking for someone to help us with basketball.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Are you free tomorrow?

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes, I'm free.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Do you speak Japanese?

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you like basketball?

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've been playing since I was three.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh my god!

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So...

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's go.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We're different this year.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We're different this year.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm so tired.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Do you want to win?

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm the area manager, Eri Mura.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This year's basketball tournament is a regular event.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This year's winning product is...

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This!

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
A high-quality meat!

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There it is.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
A high-quality meat and a dream to enjoy a tired body.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This year's not a dream.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Here's the first match.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's the first match between Yukigayashi and Jiyuoka.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Jiyuoka.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's a winning practice for the athletic world.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We'll make use of everyone's individuality and win.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We can do it.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's do our best together.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yukigayashi-den. Ready?

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
1, 2, 3, yeah!

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's youthful.

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
One minute!

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Aoi has had basketball experience in elementary school.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Shimamura, who can't be found by his opponent.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm not a free kicker.

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If it's a human obstacle, it's a world-class problem.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And I've been practicing until today.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If these five can work together...

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Where are you?

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Chris!

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's a lawyer!

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Chris!

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I won!

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What are you doing?

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Calm down, Aoi!

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I've been playing since I was three.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're right. You've been playing since you were three.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I know Aoi will get angry.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If this goes on, the high-class meat...

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're doing it.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Great!

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What are you doing here?

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I was just passing by.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
High-class meat again this year.

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Great!

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Excuse me.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What?

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's ground beef.

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What?

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This year, we changed the cost of ground beef from steak to ground beef.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Ground beef?

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I didn't expect that.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's high-class ground beef, so it's the same as high-class meat!

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't think it's the ground beef.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But I was hoping for steak.

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So I'm not motivated.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Then...

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The staff's morale won't go up?

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Huh?

134
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Isao.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So...

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I have an additional product.

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The winning team...

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We'll give them a year's worth of alcohol!

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's our boss, Iyo!

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What a great experience!

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Awesome!

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll go now.

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Good luck, everyone.

145
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Thank you.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
One year worth of alcohol.

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Miyuki-san, the switch is on!

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh!

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Hey!

150
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Miyuki-san!

151
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's awesome!

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
All you have to do is...

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Move your left hand.

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes!

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's the spirit!

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's the spirit!

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Awesome!

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's the famous Miyuki Izawa.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He does anything for the sake of alcohol.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll definitely mark him.

161
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah.

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes!

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Wow!

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What's wrong with you, Chris?

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I've been so motivated since I started drinking.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You're just like Miyuki-san.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I knew it.

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I thought the cola foam would be perfect.

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Here I go!

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes!

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Finish!

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Did you see that?

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Finish!

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes!

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yes!

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
10 seconds left!

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't have time!

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Miyuki-san, you're too much!

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Hey!

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I...

181
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I want...

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I want to drink!

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The winner...

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
is...

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Miyuki!

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Miyuki!

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And...

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The winner is...

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
O-Kyuni!

190
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And you'll get a year's worth of alcohol.

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Thank you!

192
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm so happy!

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What are you doing?

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Thank you!

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yay!

196
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There's no limit to drinking.

197
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Today was a good day.

198
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
My body is perfectly fit.

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Now I'll see how I can use the muscles for drinking.

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's why I want to make tacos!

201
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's the flavor of my Mexico!

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's the flavor of my land!

203
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Tartillas?

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's the flavor of my Mexico!

205
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The Mexican is looking for tortillas.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I see!

207
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But they're out of tortillas.

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It seems the tortillas are exhausted.

209
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What? How can there be tortillas?

210
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't tell me that!

211
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Please understand!

212
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Please understand!

213
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
How can there be tortillas?

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
How can there be tortillas?

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Chinese mini tortillas!

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'll use these in exchange for other things.

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll use these in exchange for other things.

218
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What a great idea!

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They're like little tortillas!

220
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Thank you!

221
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Thank you!

222
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You're more creative than I thought!

223
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Thank you!

224
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Gracias!

225
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Amigo!

226
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Thank you very much!

227
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You're welcome.

228
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'll take that idea.

229
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you very much!

230
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Wow!

231
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Wow!

232
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Today's dinner is a bite of tacos.

233
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
First, we'll eat tacos with Mexican food.

234
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Mexican food is a combination of avocado and tacos.

235
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Tuna.

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Sesame oil.

237
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Soy sauce.

238
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We'll add grated garlic and finish it with sake.

239
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This is the finished avocado.

240
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This is the finished avocado.

241
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Next, we'll fry the frozen potatoes in a frying pan.

242
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's amazing how crispy it is when fried with this amount of oil.

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm grateful to my mother for giving birth to me when I had frozen potatoes.

244
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
After frying, add salt, pepper, and chili powder.

245
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The chili potatoes are ready!

246
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
By the way, chili is not a country, but a Mexican chili.

247
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Next, we'll make Mexican hot sauce.

248
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's a little bit spicy.

249
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Lastly, we'll make tacos.

250
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's my first time to use the skin of a gyoza outside of gyoza.

251
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If this is delicious, it's a three-point dish.

252
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Fry one side of the gyoza in a frying pan with oil.

253
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
When it's cooked, turn it over and fold it in half.

254
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I have moist teeth, so be careful not to make it too crispy.

255
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Add the minced meat to the frying pan and fry.

256
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
When the color changes, add grated garlic,

257
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:39,000
sake, heavy sauce, ketchup, and chili powder and fry for a while.

258
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm sure there are hundreds of people who say that.

259
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This alone looks delicious enough.

260
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Add a lot of minced meat to the skin of the gyoza.

261
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And then,

262
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
add lettuce and tomatoes.

263
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's done!

264
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll try it.

265
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Itadakimasu.

266
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's delicious.

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I won the basketball game and won this one cup.

268
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Today is the day I win the championship.

269
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's delicious.

270
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The combination of tuna and sesame oil is excellent.

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's really addictive.

272
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I didn't know until recently, but avocados are not vegetables, but fruits.

273
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The reason is a little long, so I want you to search it on the Internet.

274
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If so, it is definitely a fruit that goes well with alcohol.

275
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
This is also good.

276
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Fried potatoes are often thought to be a little weak for alcohol,

277
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
but by adding chili powder, it changes at once.

278
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm going to eat it with rice.

279
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's delicious.

280
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm going to eat it with rice.

281
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's delicious.

282
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm going to eat it with rice.

283
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's delicious.

284
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm going to eat it with rice.

285
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's a good change.

286
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
By the way, fried potatoes have various varieties,

287
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
but I'm a little thick and I'm a wedge-cutter.

288
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The second cup of today is a highball of bourbon whiskey.

289
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Pour it carefully so that it does not hit the ice.

290
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's perfect.

291
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Please look forward to the last.

292
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
This is delicious.

293
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Manager Jinyama is right.

294
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The taste of all ingredients is balanced and spread in the mouth.

295
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Pour the sake into it.

296
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
This is the aluptank of tacos and sake.

297
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Another famous scene was born in my history of eating all night.

298
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:29,060
There is medicine held by the

299
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,440
10 g of vanilla sugar

300
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,560
birds eye

301
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,420
2 to 3 work

302
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,360
provinces

303
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,940
Delicious.

304
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,860
ваш��Quéüş Crawfish Thanks to the dumpling skin, we can make takos.

305
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,660
There's no limit to being a good night's sleeper.

306
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,300
Thank you for the meal.

307
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,800
The president likes basketball,

308
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,480
and the baseball tournament is scheduled next week.

309
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,920
But there's no one else to go.

310
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,420
I wonder if the tickets will come from Los Angeles again.

311
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,320
Don't worry about it.

312
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,200
Wait, she just...

313
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,800
I would like to ask you a favor.

314
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,600
Hey,

315
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,240
oh don't tease her.

316
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,840
She's not that tall.

317
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,080
And she wasn't this tall?

318
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
I'm a deco-pan.

319
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,080
Excuse me, but do you play baseball?

320
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Baseball? I've never played it, but I'm trying to do something that's cool and atmospheric.

321
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
I'll hit you.

322
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Then, get ready.

323
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
Get ready.

324
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:57,080
This time, it's going to be tough to win, but I just want to go home run after that.

325
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,080
Aim for the two-tourniquet of sports and the full-time job.

326
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,080
I have to blow my own wind from today.
