1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm glad you're here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Mandala Chart is a way to achieve my goal.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm also making my own Mandala Chart to achieve my ultimate goal of being a night-time drinker.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I did gym, yoga, sauna, dance, and farm work.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I've done everything I could to prepare for the night-time drink.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I've been thinking about whether I should start a new activity to open up new possibilities for night-time drinkers.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How can I drink the best alcohol I can at the end of the day?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This drama is a story of a woman who pursues her dreams.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The amount of alcohol you drink depends on how you act.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If you pour everything into tomorrow,

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you'll get a smile that suits you.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Look, the beginning of a bright and bright loneliness.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I can't stop.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Just this time, the light of the day will continue to shine.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The melody that starts dancing in my head.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I can't breathe.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's the best.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'll keep it as it is.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, green onions.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Green onions and Japanese pepper.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Thank you.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We're all here.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How is it?

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We've been at a festival in the shopping district, but no one's coming.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No one's coming to such a shabby event.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
My new plan is to have a 2% off of festival.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
2% is too shabby?

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And the Gara Bono's product is too shabby.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm not sure that's possible.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have a secret plan.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A secret plan?

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A doll.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
A doll.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This town is full of mischief.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's a cute doll to grab the hearts of the family.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll make a doll of the Hophousing character.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Her name is Hoptaro and Hoppin.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's too shabby.

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If that's the case, I'll go to Shimamura and Aoi.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Are we coming?

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Are we coming?

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hey!

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's Hoptaro.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's Hoppin.

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hey!

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's Hoptaro.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's play together.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No, thanks.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No thanks.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This character is boring.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What? Where's Hoptaro?

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He's boring?

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If it's a character, make it pop.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hoptaro, you're not playing.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm not playing.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm not playing.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You two are bad at acting.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You should've been more unique.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Like me.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If you say so, please do it.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, I'll show you.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Miki, you should try it too.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, you don't have to do this.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll do it.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't do it, Hoptaro.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
One photo at a time.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This character is scary.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's not cute. Let's go.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's go.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Everyone, gather around.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's Hoppin.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm Hoppin.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm spinning.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm a Poo.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Miki, you're amazing.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're awake.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Isn't it hot?

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's hot.

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's too hot.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's like a steam bath in the summer.

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sweating.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's hard.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's the best.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Hoppin, dance.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Dance?

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Dance?

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's crazy.

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Miki, you're amazing.

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're like a different person.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I didn't know that the clothes were such a wonderful item.

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I found a new way to prepare for the night.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Miki, you can dance so well.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I learned online for the good reason.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You're amazing.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What?

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Is there a child crying outside?

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll go check.

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's a baby.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What?

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The baby turned into an old man.

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's creepy.

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I thought you said you were going to take a break.

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How can you do this in front of the children?

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't go.

107
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's go home.

108
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's go home.

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's the worst.

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What should we do?

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You fake.

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's Hoppin.

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Everyone, don't worry because Hoppin is here.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is the monster, Umiino.

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He's a fake who pretended to be Hoppin.

116
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I see. He's a fake.

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's right.

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Hoppin is a fake who pretended to be an old man.

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We don't have an old man like him.

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Miki, nice follow.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The fake is...

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yurusatsu.

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The last one is...

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hoppin.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I got you.

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hoppin.

127
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Good job.

128
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Thanks to Miki's Hoppin, we have a new customer.

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Everyone, you did a great job today.

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Especially Miki.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Nice ad-lib. Nice Hoppin.

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's a good chance to get a pinch.

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Please don't tell the person who created the pinch.

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Where's Hoppin?

135
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hoppin.

136
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hoppin, where are you?

137
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Hoppin, where are you?

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hoppin.

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Miss, the event is over.

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You should go home.

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Shut up, Miki.

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I want to go home with Hoppin.

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Miki, you're in trouble.

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay, Poo.

145
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's go home together, Poo.

146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yay.

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We can go home together.

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Are you okay, Miki?

149
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You can't ruin her dream, can you?

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's go.

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay.

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Excuse me.

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Miki, are you going home?

154
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hey, Hoppin.

155
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What's your favorite color?

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Thanks to the weight of the clothes and the heat,

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the normal way home is a very good training.

158
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Even if this child is not here,

159
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I may have returned home wearing this.

160
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What should we have for dinner tonight?

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There's a fish shop here.

162
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
If you come to the fish shop, you can't go home without seeing the fish.

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Fish?

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There's no fish there?

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What is it?

166
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Excuse me.

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's nothing.

168
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I sold out all the goods at the auction today.

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll come again.

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Come again.

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Wait a minute.

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I was going to bring it home with me.

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I have inada and chanja.

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
How about it?

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Inada?

177
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's rare for you to tell the customers.

178
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Brother.

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Inada is a fish roe.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's the season now.

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's low in fat, so it's good to make a steak and put a lot of pita sauce on it.

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And this chanja is...

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's delicious.

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Excuse me.

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's delicious if you put chanja on the ajijo.

186
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Please try it.

187
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's great.

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll have inada and chanja.

189
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'll take it.

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Then, with these two, it's 1 million yen.

191
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's 500 yen.

193
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Thank you.

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Please look at this.

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Excuse me.

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Your wallet.

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
My wallet?

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Here you go.

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Thank you.

200
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Thank you.

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's broken.

202
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The best dinner is ready.

203
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Let's make it.

204
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
First, I'll make a speed snack using eggplant.

205
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Cut the eggplant into pieces, sprinkle salt and rub it in.

206
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
After wiping off the water and putting in the white soup stock,

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
put it in the refrigerator and wait.

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's so easy, but the taste is very authentic.

209
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Next, I'll make a ajijo that Koaomote recommended.

210
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Put garlic in olive oil.

211
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Use the remaining octopus, shrimp and scallops.

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Add green onions to it.

213
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This is it.

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's delicious.

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's delicious.

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's delicious.

217
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's delicious.

218
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's delicious.

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This is it.

220
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I thought it was a snack that I could order at a restaurant.

221
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If this is delicious, it's a great snack revolution.

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Finally, add butter.

223
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Finally, the eggplant is ready.

224
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I've seen it several times at the supermarket,

225
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
but it's a fish that I haven't had the chance to eat.

226
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
How does it taste?

227
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
First, bake each side for about 10 seconds in olive oil.

228
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
When it's well-baked, slice it into bite-size pieces.

229
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It looks delicious even if you eat it with salt,

230
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll make a punchy sauce that Koaomote recommended.

231
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
First, fry the punchy seasoning No.1 anchovy and add the aroma.

232
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Add the punchy vegetable No.1 garlic and fry.

233
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Add sake and simmer.

234
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Finally, add tomatoes and add acidity.

235
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This is a punchy sauce that brings out the main character of Inada.

236
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If you put a lot of this on top,

237
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's a delicious Inada steak.

238
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The ajijo is also finished.

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's a delicious Inada steak.

240
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's done.

241
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Okay.

242
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'll eat.

243
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm full.

244
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
My body is shaking at once.

245
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm glad I'm human.

246
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
This lightness is the best on a hot day.

247
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's just a white soup, but it tastes like a restaurant I made with a lot of effort.

248
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's the best way to eat fast food.

249
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This is...

250
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's very fragrant outside, and it has a moist texture inside.

251
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a combination of garlic mayonnaise and grilled Inada.

252
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't need to say anything else.

253
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Honestly, I had an image of remaining in the fish market,

254
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I want to represent Inada and say this.

255
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Please don't judge by appearance and try it.

256
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's not aause but it's attainable by slaughter.

257
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:47,980
I thought it was too sweet because it was

258
00:18:47,980 --> 00:19:06,200
Asking 256 for help at the County Castle.

259
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,880
What's this?

260
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,300
Chanja comes up against their A descon-

261
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,300
I didn't know that Chanja had this much potential.

262
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Delicious.

263
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,300
Once again, I can feel that you need a broad vision and a flexible idea for a dinner.

264
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:50,300
And then, I put a bucket of oil with a lot of fish sauce in it.

265
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
I'm jealous.

266
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,300
I want to be a bucket of this and get addicted to the oil.

267
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
Perfect.

268
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Thank you for the best ingredients, Mr. Fish Shop.

269
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,300
Well, then.

270
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
I'm jealous.

271
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Thanks to the stuffed animal, I could see a new possibility of a dinner.

272
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,300
I want you to try it, thinking that you were deceived by the stuffed animal.

273
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Thank you for the meal.

274
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Excuse me.

275
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Welcome to the HOP HAUSING.

276
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
What kind of room are you looking for?

277
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Wow, it's a HOP MEN. I saw it.

278
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Thank you.

279
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,300
I'm sure this girl will live in a HOP MEN room.

280
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Okay.

281
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,300
Then, this way please.

282
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,300
Thank you.

283
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
Rinuki, you've been watching HOP MEN lately, haven't you?

284
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,300
In this state, both work and dinner are in a hurry.

285
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
And Ms. Umiro?

286
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,300
She's in a hurry to sleep.

287
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,300
It's a big and beautiful house.

288
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
What kind of room do you want to sleep in now?

289
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,300
The night of the day when people smile will be the best.

290
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
Let's do our best today.

291
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,300
Can you make an advertisement?

292
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,300
It may be a hint for a new night.

293
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
There are many after-sweat in the house.

294
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
It's a special day.
