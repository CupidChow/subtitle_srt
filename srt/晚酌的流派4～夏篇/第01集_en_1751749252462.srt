1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Summer has come again this year.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Summer always tells me.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The small but great happiness that comes at the end of the day.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The sake poured into the glass.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It is the best reward for the hard-working self.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I wonder what kind of dinner I can meet this summer.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I moved to a new house in Hophousing last weekend.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The sun has been getting better since before.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The kitchen has grown bigger.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And this time, the decision to move is ...

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can support my family with balcony.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I can draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can live an infinite life of taste.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
How can I drink the last sake of the day?

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This drama is a story of a woman who pursues it.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The taste of the sake depends on your actions.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to go.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I can't live without the melody.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's the best, it's the best.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
As it is.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm moved.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I can't believe I can move to a place 30 seconds away from the station.

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It took about 15 minutes.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's all thanks to you.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's all thanks to everyone.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Where is Ms. Umino?

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you late for the transfer?

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You haven't changed.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The reformed interior.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And the new customers are increasing because it is close to the station.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The increased work volume means that it is a perfect store for dinner.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Everyone.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm late.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's that outfit?

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There's no room I can't find.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm Super Executive Real Estate Advisor, Umino.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What's this bad name?

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm going to evolve into a good man in this store.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What is Super Executive Real Estate Advisor?

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to give advice to the super-exceptive real estate.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm evolving in the wrong direction.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I have to go home today.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
For some reason.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The Tsuruma Art Festival is held once a month.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's right.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I made something good.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Ta-da!

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's mine!

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm embarrassed to take this outside.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Ms. Umino's face is too big.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's the basics of marketing to get attention.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll give it to everyone.

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Top Housing Real Estate is open.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm Super Executive Real Estate Advisor, Umino.

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm Super Executive Real Estate Advisor, Umino.

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Welcome.

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm Super Executive Real Estate Advisor, Umino.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I want a big room.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I want a room where I can use the toilet.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Fireworks!

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I want a room where I can see fireworks.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's Ms. Izawa.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I saw her in the commercial.

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Commercial?

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Top Housing.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Searching for a room opens a new page in your life.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
One of the pages is the key to the future.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The opening of Top Housing is now open.

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Izawa, the top of the list, will find your ideal room in three minutes.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why me?

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The president wanted to make a commercial for us, so we provided material.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You told him last week, right?

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't think he heard.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey!

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hurry up and find a room.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Me too!

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is bad.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have to respond quickly.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sir!

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This way, please.

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Excuse me.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The kitchen is in this file.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Please let me know if you have any questions.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thank you for waiting.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
There is an animal hospital nearby in this building.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's popular with small cats and cats.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Thank you.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Please have a look.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Not only fireworks, but also cherry blossoms in spring and autumn.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can enjoy the autumn.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll live in this room.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Thank you.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's a great speed.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
How many people are there?

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It looks like they are pregnant.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Is it just me?

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The more you work, the more you prepare for the night.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It would be great if everyday was like this.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Thank you.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Thank you again.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Thank you.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Take care.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Miyuki-san, as usual, you are very professional.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Tsuruma Art's Sousai Hangaku Festival is often sold out at 18.15.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Therefore, you must come here at 18.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Thank you for your hard work.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Miyuki-kun, Miyuki-kun.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You forgot something.

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
All employees have to carry it.

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
As many people as possible will see it.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is the sea-style marketing.

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What are you doing?

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's hurry.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Tsuruma Art's Sousai Hangaku Festival.

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The target is a tonkatsu.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Tsuruma Art's tonkatsu is a popular dish that is ranked first in the Sousai ranking of the Super General Election last week.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It is juicy and has a deep taste, and many fans are there.

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hmm?

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The smell of this sauce.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It is possible to eat it as it is, but it is also possible to change it to a Niigata specialty, Tare-Katsu.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No, it's too early to decide yet.

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Wait, wait, wait.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll make an appointment.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's right.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can also make a Katsu sandwich.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The city is a hint.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I have high expectations for the dinner.

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Waiting for the signal is also important.

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I will prepare perfectly for the dinner at any time.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This sweat and heart rate.

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It will definitely make today's sake 100 times more delicious.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I did it just in time.

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
One visit a month.

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes, sir.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The customer today is.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Tonkatsu.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Miyuki, Miyuki.

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's a forgetful thing.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is Uminoshiki Marketing.

146
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
De, de, de, de.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If only I had that 10 seconds.

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't have a loud voice, but I want you to get it back.

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
God, please give me a favor.

158
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't say it, but please return the tonkatsu.

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hey, I took too much.

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, Matsunikko.

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Sir, how about it?

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Thank you.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I looked at Ushiba's eyes and took it without thinking.

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I was too late today.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's a mochi with a strong smell.

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What?

170
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This smell and the way the bag swells.

171
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's mochi.

172
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes.

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh, the movement of the eyebrows and mouth.

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Wasn't it what you were aiming for?

175
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I really wanted tonkatsu, but it was sold out.

176
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's really Mr. Nikuyama.

177
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's love coincidence.

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Innovation is often born by chance.

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The chocolate chip cookie was made by a restaurant owner.

180
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He tried to make chocolate-flavored cookies and made the chocolate of the sweets smaller.

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
However, it was born without melting and leaving a shape.

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Coincidence is what makes food evolve.

183
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Here you go.

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Curry?

185
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I produced it and distributed it as a sample.

186
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Maybe he just wants to promote this curry.

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I see.

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The innovation has happened.

189
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Thank you.

190
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The main character is decided.

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
One more scene.

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes, sir.

193
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Add the lever.

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I worked hard all day, so the bath soaked into my body.

195
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I was told that the bath scene always looks the same in season 3.

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:11,660
I plan to cut it next week for the sake of the

197
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I put the rice in a frying pan and boil it.

198
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I put the retort curry in there.

199
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I just need to boil it a little more and it's done.

200
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Bring it when you want to eat a little punchy rice.

201
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's the easiest dinner menu I've ever had.

202
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
While I'm boiling it over low heat.

203
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Curry is Indian.

204
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's a garam masala salad made with Indian spices.

205
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I want to praise myself for not biting it once.

206
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Cut the tomatoes.

207
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Slice the cucumber.

208
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Put vegetables, tuna, corn, mayonnaise, and salt and pepper in a bowl.

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And this garam masala.

210
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I think I put too much.

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm about to be stopped by the others.

212
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll put it on.

213
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There are no people around me.

214
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's make the lever like a green onion.

215
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Pour sesame oil into the frying pan.

216
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Roast the lever that was cut into cycles.

217
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I've heard this sound a million times, but I'm not tired of it.

218
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Put the lever in a bowl.

219
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Add salt, black pepper, umami seasoning, and sesame oil.

220
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And mix it.

221
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's a snack that goes well with alcohol, so the seasoning is very strong.

222
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's not a little bit, it's good.

223
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If there is a dinner test, I will take this test.

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm going to eat it with a little bit of sesame oil.

225
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

226
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's the best dish.

227
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
This one looks good too.

228
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Put this on a hot plate.

229
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Sprinkle with a lot of green onions.

230
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's done.

231
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm going to eat it.

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Itadakimasu.

233
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Ah...

234
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The first day of the renewal open, I was particularly busy, so the alcohol was delicious.

235
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's too delicious.

236
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
At first, it was a garam masala salad.

237
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
This time, I was able to say without biting.

238
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I was able to eat it.

239
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This time, I was able to say without biting.

240
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's delicious.

241
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I didn't expect to apply this spice to the salad.

242
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I want to praise myself for pursuing a salad that goes well with alcohol for many years.

243
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
When I proceed to the second cup, I change the glass as usual.

244
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The original glass was used once, so the temperature of the glass has increased.

245
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I've said it many times, but just in case.

246
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Main event.

247
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The first round of curry stew is the green onion and leek leek.

248
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm going to eat it.

249
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, it's good.

250
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
This is a lever that makes you want to drink a lot.

251
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm going to eat it.

252
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The best way to put the leek on top is to make it at home.

253
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's a taste that's definitely there.

254
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm sure the Japanese in a thousand years will be drinking alcohol with this.

255
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Finally, the main curry stew.

256
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
This is...

257
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It may be the best snack for me, who always thinks about how to drink alcohol with curry.

258
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm going to drink it.

259
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's perfect.

260
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's so easy, but it's so delicious.

261
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm grateful for the coincidence of today.

262
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Saturday...

263
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Ah...

264
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm going to drink it.

265
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Thank you for the meal.

266
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Isn't it too much?

267
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The design was too simple.

268
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I should have attacked more.

269
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I have to make a new house using this photo.

270
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't need it.

271
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It was hard to recover Umino's house because it was abandoned in the city.

272
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's also part of the marketing.

273
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I remember this store because I saw this house being abandoned all over the city.

274
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There are too many troubles.

275
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'll go outside.

276
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
See you.

277
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Excuse me.

278
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You're Miyuki Izawa from Hophousing, right?

279
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yes.

280
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm sorry for the sudden visit.

281
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
We're opening a store here.

282
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Please take care of the neighbors.

283
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I see.

284
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm looking forward to it in three months.

285
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm going to fry pork.
