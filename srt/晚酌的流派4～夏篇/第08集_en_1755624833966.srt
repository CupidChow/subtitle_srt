1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The End

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
How can you drink the best sake you can at the end of the day?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This drama is a story of a woman who pursues it.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The taste of the sake depends on your actions every day.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It can be 0 or 100.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Good morning.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Good morning.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What?

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The End

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The End

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Please come in.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is the Nakajima branch of the Yukigami branch.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The bench is 50 yen per person.

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm Umino, the manager of the Yukigami branch.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Umino?

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's going on?

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What do you mean?

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The Yukigami branch is in the shopping district.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hello, Mr. Izawa.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you know each other?

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm a consultant in the shopping district.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,420
Did you give me a

25
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,000
demonstration?

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm not a demonstration.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm here to introduce you to Mr. Umino.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're making up the name of the shop.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's the Gansu Yukigami branch.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is the Honke Yukigami branch.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't talk nonsense.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This is Nakajima.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What's the problem?

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,140
This is a

35
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,000
big deal.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The Yukigami branch is in the shopping district.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The Honke Yukigami branch is about to open.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to do it.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What's this?

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Are you parents?

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
My father, mother, and son were the three

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
consultants.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
My son was independent from them.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's a good thing that you're selling a shop

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
that looks like the Yukigami branch.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm here again.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm Umai-Itsu.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Thank you.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I ordered it for lunch.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is my father's Gansu.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is my son's Honke Yukigami branch.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's good.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's start with my father.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's eat.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's delicious.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a soft and tender taste.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Please eat your son's.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's eat.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's very delicious.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's a good punch.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is my father's voice.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You can retire.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll give you the map.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Welcome.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Izao, please find a shop.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm running a shopping district.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Please find a shop with a lot of people.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But...

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Izao, please find a shop.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I understand.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Please tell me the details.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll leave the details to you.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Please hurry up.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I see.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll contact you when I find a shop.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Thank you.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you for waiting.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Please come again.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm Nakajima, the owner of Yukigami branch.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
One branch is 10 yen today.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Please come.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's 10 yen.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
10 yen?

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's suspicious.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
20 Yukigami branches.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Please wait.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is Nakajima, the owner of Yukigami branch.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
One branch is 10 yen today.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I brought some fried chicken.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Thank you.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hello.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Izao.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The cream croquette was delicious.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You were worried about me.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What happened?

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It started about a year ago.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
My son, Gotan, asked me to buy a menchi.

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
My father didn't listen to me at all.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He kept on tasting the menchi.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's delicious.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I know.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You don't need sauce.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's good for walking.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What are you doing?

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Get out of here.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's the taste of Nakajima.

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Please eat it.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't want to eat it.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Father.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I think he's just being stubborn.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Welcome.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What would you like?

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Two menchi katsu and fried chicken.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Two croquettes, please.

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Menchi katsu and croquettes.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Hello.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There is enough room for a kitchen.

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I asked the manager to come because I was in a hurry.

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I can consult you about the remittance today.

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have the necessary costs for the contract here.

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It takes a long time.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I need to be prepared for the cost of the exchange.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Please give me the money.

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you.

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I made all the menchi.

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The menchi is delicious.

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's take a break.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Please.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Brother,

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
you always serve like this.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm cooking recently.

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Please give me advice.

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You're so proud to make me eat menchi.

137
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Hey,

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
this.

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Did you really make it?

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No.

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This is me.

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This is my menchi.

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Goto?

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You're testing your parents.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I asked Goto to do it.

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Why did you do that?

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's true.

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But,

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
is it really okay?

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't think he wants to deny or let you do it.

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But,

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I think he just wanted you to admit the taste of menchi that he made over and over again.

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I agree.

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
How was Goto's menchi?

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's delicious.

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I can't make it.

158
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Father,

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I've thought about it before.

160
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I want to be independent and do what I want.

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I just thought about it.

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But,

163
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
you really did it.

164
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
This is the new Yukigaya menchi.

165
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
From today,

166
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
you're the fourth generation.

167
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's delicious even if it's cold.

169
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Right?

170
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What's the secret?

171
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The secret?

172
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's delicious.

173
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It has pepper and sugar.

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's amazing.

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I changed my mind about what to do,

176
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
but I have high expectations for the dinner.

177
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Tonight, of course, it's menchi katsu.

178
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I've finished eating the meat.

180
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There is only the aura of menchi katsu from the whole body.

181
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I think I was thinking about menchi katsu all day today.

182
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But I'm sorry.

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Today is Obon.

184
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
According to the paper published by the Faculty of Meat Psychology,

185
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the ingredients for the family dinner are

186
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
92% of the dishes using meat such as hamburgers and gyoza.

187
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The sales of menchi have stopped.

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Since the opening of the main branch in front of the station,

189
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
the sales of menchi have been down,

190
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and the sales have been canceled.

191
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So today,

192
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll make chicken katsu.

193
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Chicken katsu?

194
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It might be good.

195
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
In the latest paper,

196
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
chicken katsu is the first ingredient to be selected when the menchi is sold out.

197
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And about 63% of the buyers choose potato salad.

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
In addition, there are 30 people who choose Namuro.

199
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm hungry.

200
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
OK.

201
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Let's make it.

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I couldn't get menchi katsu,

203
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
but I'll arrange the ingredients recommended by Mr. Nikuyama

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
so that it goes well with alcohol.

205
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
In fact, potato salad goes well with furikake.

206
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It has a salty taste and a strong flavor,

207
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and the level of snacks increases.

208
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I've tried all the furikake sold at Tsurumato,

209
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
but this is the best choice at that time.

210
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's shiso furikake.

211
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Next, namuro.

212
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If you think that namuro is only available at the beginning of yakiniku shops or at the end of the bivin,

213
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you're wrong.

214
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
By adding gochujang to this and frying it,

215
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
it transforms into a delicious snack.

216
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's done.

217
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I thought about adding gochujang to alcohol,

218
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and it was completed in no time.

219
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Another dish with the roast ham that Mr. Nikuyama gave me as a bonus.

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
First, put bread crumbs and curry powder in a frying pan.

221
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Fry until it gets a little color.

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Then, roast both sides of the ham.

223
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Add plenty of curry powder to it.

224
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Add more sauce.

225
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's done.

226
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Finally, today's main dish.

227
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
First, put the noodle soup, water, and sugar in a frying pan and boil them.

228
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Put the cut chicken cutlet in the frying pan and boil them.

229
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
When you enjoy the visual of the three great dishes,

230
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
add the shishito.

231
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
When it's boiled, serve it on a plate.

232
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Add radish and nametake.

233
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Chicken cutlet misoreni is done.

234
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Itadakimasu.

235
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's delicious.

236
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The day when good things happen, alcohol is delicious. It's special.

237
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
First, put potato salad on the shiso.

238
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's really good.

239
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Potato salad and shiso.

240
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's not round or curvy, but it's perfect.

241
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There are many kinds of potato salad, such as Chinese sauce, curry powder, and black pepper.

242
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I want you to try this way of eating.

243
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Next, stir-fry namul.

244
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's the right answer.

245
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's the right answer.

246
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I may not be able to go back to cold namul.

247
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
This is exactly what it feels like to find new possibilities.

248
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I feel like I've become a famous coach who can change the talent of professional baseball players.

249
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm going to eat.

250
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's perfect.

251
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I feel like I've become a snack expert by making a ham in a few minutes.

252
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Ham with cheap, delicious, and snacky three-syllable words is one of my favorite ingredients.

253
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The second dish is lemon sour, perfect for fried food.

254
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The lemon flavor is strong.

255
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm getting more and more hungry.

256
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
This is it.

257
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Japanese people always eat this.

258
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
This is the taste you want to eat when you go abroad for a week.

259
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
After adding rice to this, open a restaurant.

260
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's a restaurant that's like chicken and mom's stew.

261
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I feel like I've seen a restaurant that's more luxurious than this in a nationwide store.

262
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I feel like I've seen a restaurant that's more luxurious than this in a nationwide store.

263
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Well then.

264
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm going to eat.

265
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm going to eat.

266
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm going to eat.

267
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm going to eat.

268
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm going to eat.

269
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm going to eat.

270
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm going to eat.

271
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm going to eat.

272
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm going to eat.

273
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm going to eat.

274
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm going to eat.

275
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm going to eat.

276
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm going to eat.

277
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm going to eat.

278
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's delicious.

279
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's delicious.

280
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's delicious.

281
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I can't stop eating.

282
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I can't stop eating.

283
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm going to eat.

284
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm going to eat.

285
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm going to eat.

286
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm going to eat.

287
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I think it's more delicious than good.

288
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000

Thanks for the food.

295
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,400
But wait another day…

296
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Next, please.

297
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Hello.

298
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Welcome.

299
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Thank you for your help.

300
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
No, it's nothing.

301
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
What would you like to eat today?

302
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
One minced meat cutlet, please.

303
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Yes.

304
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Hey, Gotan.

305
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm back.

306
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Don't work at other people's shop.

307
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
I said I'm a substitute, but I didn't say I'm retired.

308
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
What's wrong with you?

309
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Dad!

310
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
You've improved.

311
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Thank you.

312
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Here you are.

313
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Two of them.

314
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Thank you.

315
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
I'll have it.

316
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
Thank you.

317
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Tonight, they'll have a meal at a minced meat cutlet.

318
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Is it a meal?

319
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
I want you to join this cooking class.

320
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
It's the day of Yuzawa Miyuki's revival.
