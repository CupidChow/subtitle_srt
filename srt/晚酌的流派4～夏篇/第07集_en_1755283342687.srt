1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Congratulations!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A message from Mr. Yamano from Gunma Oyama Okushiten, who left last year.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I am very pleased to present to you the child of the Seika family, Izawa-sama.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I was very grateful to you last year.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I am sorry to say this, but I will be sending you the soba, the famous soba from my hometown.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Please have a seat, it's very hot.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He looks just like Mr. Umino, but he is surprisingly polite.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Gunma's famous soba restaurant, so tonight's dinner is soba.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now, how will he eat it?

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can he drink the soba he drinks at the end of the day in the best way?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This drama is a story of a woman who pursues it.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The taste of the soba depends on how you act in the day, it can be 0 or 100.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll be going now.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The only thing that matters is the light of the day that I touched.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Keep shining.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The melody that starts to dance in my head.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't run out of breath.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's go, let's go.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
As it is.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The next morning.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, I think I saw Mr. Yamanosan's seriousness.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Mr. Umino, please do your job.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It was my imagination.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't talk to me.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll be back in two hours.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No, please do your job.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This is the best project I've ever had.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I've been doing it since yesterday.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I wish he could show his concentration at work.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Welcome.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The next morning.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Excuse me, I'm looking for a room nearby.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I heard there's someone who can find a room here.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I think it's Miyuki.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm Miyuki Izawa.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What kind of room do you want today?

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I've been feeling sick lately.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I want to move to a room where I can work harder.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I see. You want to create a better atmosphere.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes, that's right.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Did I say my profession?

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're a sauna worker, right?

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How do you know?

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There's a lot of towels in your bag.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And the texture is thick.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's for sauna, right?

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You can tell just by looking at the towel?

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's always amazing.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can't lose to Miyuki.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I've been struggling to feel the growth of the NEPPA city.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Can I take a bath in your NEPPA?

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Mine?

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I want to feel your wind and suggest the best room.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll try to find a room for you.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll be waiting.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're a very famous NEPPA.

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I see.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why are you here?

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I've been interested in saunas.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm looking forward to seeing you fly.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm looking forward to it.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm really getting a cold.

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's a beautiful place.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's right.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Miyuki?

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's go.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The heat you feel here is supposed to be the best fish for dinner.

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll burn your heart and body.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Wow, you're a very famous NEPPA.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm Namiro Atsuko, and I'll be your host today.

75
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Nice to meet you.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Namiro!

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't push yourself too hard.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
After the show, make sure to get enough water.

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Atsuko!

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Atsuko, give me the best wind!

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The first scent is coconut.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Enjoy the scent of the southern land.

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's hot.

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's the heat that's going to make your body feel better.

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This will make a bowl of rice 100 times tastier.

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Coconut...

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's so hot.

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's so hot.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's so hot.

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's so hot.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Coconut...

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This heat is the best. It feels so good.

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No, it's not.

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Next, enjoy the scent of ginger.

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's hotter than usual.

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Atsuko, you're serious.

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This isn't just a wind.

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's like a flag that's controlling the heat.

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is the best.

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Ginger...

101
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I can't take it anymore.

102
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's not it.

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The End

104
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The temperature will rise even more at the end.

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This is amazing!

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Please enjoy the fresh scent of lemon.

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's so cool!

108
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's so cold!

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's so cold!

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Not this.

111
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's so cold!

112
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The End

113
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This is it!

114
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's so cold!

115
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's been a while since I've done my best.

116
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Thanks to you, we've decided.

117
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You mean you've made up your mind?

118
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No, the dinner menu has been decided.

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What?

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll do my best to open a new door.

121
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Thank you.

122
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Thank you for today.

123
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Thank you.

124
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The sauna has finished, and the dinner menu has been decided.

125
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And the eel looks delicious.

126
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This restaurant has good eel.

127
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Today is the eel festival with our young people.

128
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's great.

129
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Akira, you're not alone in Yukigaya.

130
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You can go to Japan with me.

131
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm not ready yet.

132
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
100% eel!

133
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Thank you.

134
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Did you want eel?

135
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I saw a good eel today.

137
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's just sold out.

138
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I know!

139
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
How about squid?

140
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There's a big one in here.

141
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And there's a rare one.

142
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
There's also a big one.

143
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's fatty.

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I decided to have soba for dinner.

146
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I wanted to eat eel and loro soba.

147
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Soba!

148
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I can only think of Nishi.

149
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Soba, soba, soba.

150
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Is there anything else?

151
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Ah...

152
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What?

153
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes!

154
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
A...

155
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Ai...

156
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
How about anago from Aichi Prefecture?

157
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I think it's good to have anago and loro soba instead of eel.

158
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I see.

159
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It might be good.

160
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'll have anago.

161
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Thank you.

162
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Thank you.

163
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You're not nervous?

164
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Let's make it.

165
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Anago made in place of eel.

166
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
First, place the kitchen paper on top of the eel and heat it.

167
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This will remove the slimy smell.

168
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Let's make the eel white.

169
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Before baking, poke the eel so it doesn't roll.

170
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Then, bake it slowly in a frying pan.

171
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's baked well.

172
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
When I was a kid, the main event of kaiten sushi was sweet anago.

173
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
After time, the way of eating has changed, but my anago love has not changed.

174
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Today, I'll make a sauce with wasabi and mayonnaise.

175
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And, I'll make anago and loro soba.

176
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's a cold and refreshing soba.

177
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'll make a cold and refreshing soba.

178
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'll make a sauce with noodles and water and ice.

179
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll fry the eggplant and shishito peppers.

180
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's brilliant.

181
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's the color of summer.

182
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'll boil the soba.

183
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll make teriyaki, of course.

184
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
When the sugar, sake and soy sauce boil, add the anago and make teriyaki.

185
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
By the way, it's called kabayaki if you stick it in a skewer and bake it.

186
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's called teriyaki if you don't stick it in a skewer.

187
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Teriyaki is a Japanese dish.

188
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It looks like this.

189
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It smells like this.

190
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I feel that I was born in Japan.

191
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Soak the soba in ice water.

192
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'll make a sauce with wasabi and mayonnaise.

193
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll put the ingredients on the soba.

194
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'll put the sauce on the soba.

195
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's done.

196
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll eat it.

197
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll drink sake.

198
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll drink sake.

199
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'll drink sake.

200
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll drink sake.

201
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll drink sake.

202
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll drink sake.

203
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll drink sake.

204
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'll drink sake.

205
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'll drink sake.

206
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll drink sake.

207
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'll drink sake.

208
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll drink sake.

209
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll drink sake.

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll drink sake.

211
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'll drink sake.

212
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'll drink sake.

213
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'll drink sake.

214
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'll drink sake.

215
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The heat from the sauna will be released in this one cup.

216
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's a moment of healing.

217
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,700
Screwed Umeboshi

218
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,000
Okay.

219
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,420
This here tastes just like the channel 1 uh elders.

220
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,940
hemen sentimental

221
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,680
add us carrots

222
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,020
starch

223
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,160
For this dish,

224
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,220
we always give them lowly

225
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,220
It's a magical sauce that can make you eat all kinds of dishes.

226
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,220
And it's not supposed to go well with alcohol.

227
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,220
First, we need the ingredients.

228
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,220
I'll pour you some.

229
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,220
This is it!

230
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,220
Nice.

231
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,220
First, I'll drink a glass of it with the ingredients.

232
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,220
Then I'll go to the sofa.

233
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,220
This is the best way to drink alcohol.

234
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,220
Cheers!

235
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,220
This is the best!

236
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:06,220
The best dish to eat after a sauna is cold soba.

237
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,220
And the volume of the anago.

238
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,220
This is the best time to eat.

239
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,220
The fried vegetables and the pork are well cooked.

240
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,220
The soba goes well with the summer dinner.

241
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:37,220
This is the best soba to go with alcohol.

242
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,220
Of course, I did some research.

243
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,220
And...

244
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,220
tiny sippin...

245
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,220
in the sofa from...

246
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:09,220
Shen初

247
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,220
Brotherك

248
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,220

249
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:29,860

250
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,920
me

251
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,800
me

252
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,040
me

253
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,200
me

254
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,040
Would you please

255
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,920
I will

256
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:55,920
The End

257
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,920
It was a hot dinner tonight.

258
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Thank you for the meal.

259
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
How about this room?

260
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Is the whole room a sauna?

261
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,920
No, it's not.

262
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,920
There's a space on the roof where you can put laundry.

263
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
It's perfect for the day.

264
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,920
In my view, it's the easiest place to dry laundry in the house.

265
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,920
You can dry your towels perfectly.

266
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,920
The towel will dry better than now.

267
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,920
I can see the happy face of the towel.

268
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,920
I'll use this room.

269
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Thank you.

270
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
You knew about that room.

271
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Miyuki has everything in her head.

272
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
I'm sure she knows.

273
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,920
She has everything in her head.

274
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
Really?

275
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Miyuki, the building on the 11th and 5th floor of Kamata 8...

276
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
is the Land Court Kamata.

277
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Wow.

278
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Umino, the building on the 7th floor of Minami-yuki-gaya Otsuka 2...

279
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
I don't know.

280
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,920
It's a house with a pop house.

281
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,920
How does she work?

282
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Your cold was amazing.

283
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,920
I have to get my cold from today.

284
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Don't talk nonsense!

285
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,920
The day I have a good thing, I drink alcohol.
