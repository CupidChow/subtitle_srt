1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Kureto

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
All food has a voice.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I try to hear the voice of food every day.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But it's not easy to hear.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Kureto

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How can you drink the best sake you can at the end of the day?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This drama is a story of a woman who pursues it.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The taste of the sake depends on your actions.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm going.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Kureto

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The daily life in my bag

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I pour it all on tomorrow.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Look at the smile that's nearly leaking.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Look, the beginning of a lively loneliness

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can't stop.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Only this time, the light of the day I touched

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Keep shining

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Melody that starts dancing in my head

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't stop.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The end, the end, as it is

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Kureto

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Umino, are you going to change jobs?

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I won't make you happy.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's a new business.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In this time of turmoil, we can do something other than real estate.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't let me find a new job at the work center.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Umino, please tell me after you do your real estate work.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Welcome.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Welcome.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Huh?

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yuuki, Mr. Jukubo.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Finally, the renewal open. Congratulations.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Thanks to Mr. Yuuki for finding a good property.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Huh? But why did you move?

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Actually, my mom finished at the police station.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I made the store bigger.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And I got more in time.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yuuki, can you make a commercial?

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Commercial?

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You were doing it for the opening ceremony.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I want to shoot it.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't stop.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm a real estate agent.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm a vegetable store.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can only ask Mr. Miyuki who loves vegetables the most.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Please.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Please.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Please.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
New business.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Good.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's okay.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He lost to Mr. Jukubo's passion and finally accepted it.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But it may be a new way to get a commercial for vegetables.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Then I will introduce the staff of Umino who is my leader.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Aoi of the lighting.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Shibamura of the cameraman.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yuuki of the voice.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And Mr. Jukubo of the leading role.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Miyuki of the director.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And I'm the world's leader.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Mr. Jukubo.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'd like some water.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And can you order the lunch that Mr. Jukubo recommends?

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Mr. Jukubo, understood.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's not Mr. Jukubo.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's AD.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
First, I will cut the vegetables.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
When I look at the video, each vegetable has its own charm.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The idea of eating all the vegetables seems to be endless.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Cut.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Miyuki is amazing.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It looks delicious.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No, it's not good at all.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What?

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Shibamura, can you water the vegetables with a cloth?

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why?

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I want to make your skin more moist.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Especially the tomatoes.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Please give me four minutes.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Understood.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Aoi, please shine a little more.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's a waste to have a shadow on the face of the bell pepper.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Understood.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Mr. Jukubo, please rotate the cabbage 90 degrees clockwise.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's more lively.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What is Mr. Jukubo doing?

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He is doing the skin of the tomato, the face of the bell pepper, and the expression of the cabbage.

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He is very particular.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
OK.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
OK.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Sorry, the camera is out of focus.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OK.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Perfect filming environment.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
From now on, the most important way to eat.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Miyuki, do you want to pick vegetables?

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm in the middle of an audition.

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Tomato.

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
From Hokkaido.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It has a strong color and gloss.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Pea Man.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
From Ibaraki prefecture.

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The freshness of the young people who came in the morning truck is excellent.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Miyuki, what are you doing?

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't you get in the way?

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Who is the most motivated today?

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If you don't listen to the voices of the vegetables.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Use it.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Use me.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Please.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I heard it.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Everyone, today I will use cabbage.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I will cut the vegetables.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ready.

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
OK.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Ah.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Cut.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Chukubo, please eat it yourself.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Ready.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Fight.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Cut.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Please eat quickly.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hmm.

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Cut.

128
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Please eat without a sigh.

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Delicious.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Delicious.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Cut.

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Please eat the words as they are.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Delicious.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Cut.

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Your expression is hard.

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm thirsty.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Miyuki, what was not good?

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think it was good to cut 25 times naturally.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Then, did you get hungry after watching the video?

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Did you get drool?

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Did you want to wear it right now?

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Speaking of the main dish, meat and fish.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
There are not many people who think of vegetables.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But vegetables have great potential.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I want to convey it in this video.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If everyone does not share that feeling,

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I can not take good things.

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Miyuki, let me do it again.

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Ready.

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Fight.

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Delicious.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I think it's good.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's delicious.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's delicious.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
All that's left is editing.

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Please wait a minute.

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Shimomura, please return it.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hmm.

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is ...

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Hey, Umino.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Miyuki's OK was about to come out.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I was thirsty.

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Please drink after the video ends.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What is it?

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Because ...

166
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Please do not make it.

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's a shame.

168
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Director So.

169
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hmm?

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Thank you.

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You gave me a hint that this video would be better.

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Of course.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's the work of Director So and Umino to stimulate the creativity of the staff.

174
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a good thing.

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Please let me do it again.

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Can I drink it?

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes.

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I think it will look more delicious.

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Thank you.

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Ready.

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Touch.

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
OK.

184
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I did it.

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I did it.

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I was able to take a good picture.

187
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I want to go home early and eat vegetables.

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Miyuki.

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes.

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Take this.

191
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Is it okay?

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's okay.

193
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Thank you.

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Thank you for your hard work.

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Thank you for your hard work.

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I was able to take a good picture.

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's hard to make a video.

198
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I want to thank all the video creators in Japan.

199
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I want to thank all the video creators in Japan.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Tonight, I will eat vegetables.

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I will eat vegetables.

202
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I will eat vegetables.

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
OK.

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
First, I will eat peppers.

205
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I will cut the pepper in half.

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I will wash the pepper.

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It is delicious to eat with salt or miso.

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But today's partner is...

209
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I will eat beef.

210
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I will eat beef.

211
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It is delicious to eat as it is.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But I will make a decision.

213
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I will add mayonnaise and black pepper.

214
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I will mix well.

215
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It is cheap and delicious.

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It is delicious and easy to eat.

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I have prepared all the ingredients.

218
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I will eat this as a snack.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Next, I will eat tomatoes.

220
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I will cut the tomato.

221
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I will take the seeds with a spoon.

222
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I will put cheese on it.

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I will put cheese on it.

224
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It is a French word that is used when you put cream on a cake.

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I will put cheese on it.

226
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I will put the tomatoes.

227
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I will put salt and pepper.

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I will put olive oil in a frying pan.

229
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I will bake the meat.

230
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I will put tomato.

231
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
There are many dishes called meat rolls.

232
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But tomato meat rolls are the best.

233
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I will do it.

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I will put tomato.

235
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I will put tomato.

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I will put tomato.

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I will put tomato.

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I will sprinkle basil on it.

239
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I will finish tomato cheese pork belly.

240
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Finally, I will eat today's main dish.

241
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I have a lot of vegetables that go well with alcohol.

242
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I will eat this cabbage.

243
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I will eat it with sauce.

244
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is a good vegetable.

245
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I will put olive oil in a frying pan.

246
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I will put garlic.

247
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I will put cabbage.

248
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I will fry it with salt and pepper.

249
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Today's main dish is...

250
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I will eat this.

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
When the cabbage is fried, it goes well with alcohol.

252
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Today I will eat it with alcohol.

253
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I will eat it with cabbage and fried shrimp.

254
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
When the fire is high, I will add salt and pepper.

255
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I will put it on a plate.

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I did it.

257
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I will eat it.

258
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I will eat it.

259
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I sweat a lot.

260
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's special.

261
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I will eat it with pepper.

262
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's crispy and rich.

263
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's already 100 points.

264
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But it's more than that.

265
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's delicious.

266
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This way of eating is perfect.

267
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I will eat it with a little sauce.

268
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This tomato is...

269
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
This is delicious.

270
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The tomato and cheese spread in my mouth.

271
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The tomato has a strong taste.

272
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The taste of tomatoes is strong.

273
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I will eat it with a little sauce.

274
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I did a different job today.

275
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I will drink a little alcohol.

276
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I drink alcohol.

277
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's refreshing and delicious.

278
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's delicious.

279
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The smell of garlic.

280
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The taste of shrimp and salted kelp is mixed with cabbage.

281
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's the best fried food.

282
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
If there is a fried food that goes well with alcohol, I will drink it.

283
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I will drink it.

284
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I will win the best prize.

285
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I will drink it.

286
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's delicious.

287
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I will drink it.

288
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I will drink it.

289
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I will drink it.

290
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I ate a lot of vegetables today.

291
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I ate a lot of vegetables today.

292
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I ate a lot of vegetables today.

293
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I ate a lot of vegetables today.

294
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I want to deliver the deliciousness of the vegetables that the earth has grown.

295
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
How about vegetables for dinner tonight?

296
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Vegetables are in the air.

297
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Please come to the renewal open.

298
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Bravo!

299
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's great.

300
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's great.

301
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm glad that the narration that doesn't interfere with the video was good.

302
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's a CM debut.

303
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm proud of my sister.

304
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Let's have dinner.

305
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's a wonderful play no matter how many times I watch it.

306
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I want to eat vegetables again today.

307
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's done.

308
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Riki, I want to eat this.

309
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's a lifelong free ticket.

310
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Take it as much as you want.

311
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Mom, thank you.

312
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But I'll pay for it.

313
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I want you to keep the store.

314
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I love it.

315
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Are you making it yourself?

316
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You're going to eat it?

317
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm so hungry.

318
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What kind of vegetable dinner are we having today?

319
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's different from yesterday.

320
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I hope I can hear the voice of a new vegetable.

321
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Did you come to the dinner shop?

322
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Our ingredients are normal.

323
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
We have to arrange them.

324
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
We may find a new hint for dinner.

325
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I was able to get to this one dish today.

326
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It was a dinner that touched the unlimited possibilities of convenience stores.
