1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The End

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
How can you drink the best sake you can at the end of the day?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This drama is a story of a woman who pursues it.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The taste of the sake depends on your actions.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It can be 0 or 100.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm going.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If it's a story,

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll smile and laugh.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Look,

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the beginning of a lively loneliness.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can't stand it.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This time alone is the light of the day.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Keep shining.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The melody that starts to dance in my head.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I can't breathe.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's the best.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
As it is.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Welcome.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Is there anyone named Jiro Umino?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes, I'm here.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Would you like to call Mr. Umino?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, ma'am.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hello.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hello.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hello.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hello.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hello.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hello.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Mr. Umino.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Mr. Umino, a guest has arrived.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What?

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you for waiting.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You're welcome.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm the manager of this store, Jiro Umino.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry to call you.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I heard your name from a friend.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'd like to consult you.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Leave it to me.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll look for anything that can be named from dog house to white house.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm counting on you.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's the best weather for a real night view.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm leaving.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Goodbye.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I've never seen a store like this before.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There are strange customers.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's a black bean.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I like this.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's a restaurant.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's a restaurant that goes to a noodle shop.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's like a TV show.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Noodle shop?

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Really?

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't make a loud noise.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Look at this.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is the person from before.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm the manager of the hop house.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The interior inspection room?

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The person who was seen was sent to the basement.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
His name is Miruko.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You mean he was seen?

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If he keeps doing that...

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Send to the basement.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Send to the basement.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I knew it.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I knew it.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I knew it.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I forgot all the interior inspection set.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Bring it to me.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm going.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I have to tell the other person that I'm the inspector.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Is it okay to tell him?

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't know.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But if you don't do that, Mr. Umino...

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Wait.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I have an idea.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Please.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The croquettes here are the best.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Please come.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I like croquettes the most in the world.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
How much is it?

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's okay.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is already a charge.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If you use the power of the manager, you can get 10 croquettes.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's a charge.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Manager!

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Manager!

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a great day.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's great.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I was going to give this to you.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Mr. Umino.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll buy you a souvenir.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Really?

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That person is the worst.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
She's the worst.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But she's a nice assistant.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Is it possible that the croquette caused the arrest?

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Maybe.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We have 45 minutes until the trial is over.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We'll just have to get the key from the key and get the inside.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's all.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes.

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Really?

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's great.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's like a dream castle.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's great.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I can answer this question every day.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We're finally here.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We have to return here or we'll be sent to the basement.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Wait a minute.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Matsue.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sure the key to this comfort mansion is...

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Keybox at the back door.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's a shopping mall.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I forgot to take it.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The key won't open if I keep it.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's a big mistake.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's important.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll make it in time.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Shima, you stop the elevator at the top.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Aoi, open the key box and get the key.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's my job.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's go.

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Shima!

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Shima!

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Shima!

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yes!

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The answer is...

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
A ghost.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Shima!

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Matsue.

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Here it is.

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We're at the top of the comfort house.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's a nice view.

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I know.

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What?

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't tell me you don't have the key?

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I think my parents left it here.

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, yes!

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're a kind old man.

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, I am.

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Come on in.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What do you think of this amazing designer's room?

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I asked a bari to make a reform.

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's so old.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Umino?

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I have a question for you.

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I want to make a perfect design for the bath.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Of course.

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll pay you 50,000 yen.

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll make a decision now.

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Is there anything I can do?

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Something?

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you do something,

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll pay you 50,000 yen as a token.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
A trap.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll pay you 50,000 yen as a token.

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm kidding.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
How about 100,000 yen?

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm so confused.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's too early to make a trap.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's like a goldfish.

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I wonder.

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No, I can't.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let's step in before I get the ball.

180
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Wait.

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can't sleep.

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I can only imagine the future

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
where Miyuki and his friends will be angry.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's a little pathetic.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No.

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm guiding them this time.

188
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I usually leave it to my subordinates.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They're players who play on the field.

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm just a director.

191
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If I can do it,

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll believe in the players and wait.

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm not supposed to talk to the rent they adjusted

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
because I entrusted it once.

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You don't have to be a director.

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's better for the players to shine

197
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
than for the players to shine.

198
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You have a wonderful team.

199
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll be waiting for you.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Umino.

201
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What's up?

202
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The inside is going well.

203
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's okay.

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We'll support you.

205
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm not sure.

206
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I was worried.

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I was worried.

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I know how to be a good director.

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What is it?

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
When you're in trouble,

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
you can talk about something cool.

212
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And a little smile.

213
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I learned from my senior.

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Most people lose to smoke.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What?

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What is the reason for the work?

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I want you to return our hard work.

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Why did you save me?

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You said you'd help me.

220
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Shimamura said so.

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No, that's not true.

222
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm sure it's true.

223
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's okay.

224
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Whatever.

225
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Umino.

226
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Umino.

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Let's eat together.

228
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm sweating a little today.

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I feel good.

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What kind of dinner should I have?

231
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Welcome.

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Is it an event?

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes, it's a sudden idea.

234
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Thank you for waiting.

235
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
For the customers who are on a daily basis,

236
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
we will hold a tasting.

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
A tasting.

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's a wonderful idea.

239
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Actually,

240
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
the manager is in charge of the tasting.

241
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Let's start.

242
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's go.

243
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mr. Umino.

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Are you excited?

245
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's go.

246
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I just got a job.

247
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
No, it's a production.

248
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't eat.

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I've been waiting for a long time.

250
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Everyone.

251
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I changed the schedule.

252
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I will distribute the special hunt that I introduced on YouTube for free.

253
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Please have a look.

254
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Thank you.

255
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Please.

256
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Tuna.

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please.

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Please.

259
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I want to eat the hunt you made.

260
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Thank you.

261
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Thank you.

262
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's start.

263
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The hunt is a big star.

264
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's a big star, but it's a big star.

265
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Let's prove it tonight.

266
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It may be surprising, but the hunt goes well with miso.

267
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The combination of the sourness of the hunt and the saltiness of miso

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
is refreshing, which is different from the green onion miso.

269
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Of course, the cucumber goes well with this.

270
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The cucumber is complete.

271
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If this is in the sushi, I can drink two cups of sake before eating sushi.

272
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Next, the shime-saba goes well with the hunt.

273
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The shime-saba is delicious even if you eat it as it is.

274
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It goes well with the hunt.

275
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The sourness and the sourness are the most effective.

276
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Everyone will be surprised by the synergy effect of sourness and sourness.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Add sesame seeds to enhance the flavor.

278
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And this is eaten with seaweed.

279
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The sea scent is the best.

280
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Finally, I continued to create a main dish using the hunt.

281
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's been three years.

282
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Finally, I have a good idea.

283
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's a pork fried with a hunt.

284
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
When the pork is cooked,

285
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:09,000
add sake, mirin, soy sauce, and stir-fry.

286
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Then add the hunt.

287
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Ginger-grilled ginger is a fried dish that Japan is proud of in the world.

288
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
In the future, I want to have a feast to celebrate the hunt of this pork.

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's easy and beautiful.

290
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The hunt is over.

291
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
All right.

292
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'll eat.

293
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm nervous.

294
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm nervous.

295
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm getting a sense of relief from the nervousness.

296
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm getting a sense of relief from the nervousness.

297
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This is a new summer snack.

298
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The texture of cucumber and the punch of the hunt miso.

299
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I can't stop eating.

300
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm getting more and more hungry.

301
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm getting more and more hungry.

302
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I knew it.

303
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I knew it.

304
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The hunt that was active as a combination of sushi.

305
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I knew it.

306
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I knew it.

307
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I might be a genius who can draw out the charm of hunting.

308
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The second cup is refreshing and fresh.

309
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It tastes great.

310
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I was nervous when I first got on the roller coaster.

311
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I was nervous when I first got on the roller coaster.

312
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
This is a great victory.

313
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The juicy pork and the sweet and sour taste of the hunt are perfectly matched.

314
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Victory is certain.

315
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm sure Shouhei Otani will feel the same when he walks with a heart.

316
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well then.

317
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm full.

318
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm full.

319
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm full.

320
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm in love with hunting alone on a summer night.

321
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm full.

322
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The director is like a mirror for the players.

323
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That's all.

324
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Don't say that.

325
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You're the same as always.

326
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
We have to work hard.

327
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
This restaurant is no good.

328
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Umino.

329
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You're here again.

330
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I've been waiting for you.

331
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Let's go to the game.

332
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Please excuse me.

333
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That person is not here.

334
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Is it another person?

335
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm going.

336
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Is it real?

337
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Which one?

338
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I have to work hard again today.

339
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But that's how you can meet delicious dinner.

340
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Let's do our best.

341
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The dinner on the day you make people smile will be the best.
