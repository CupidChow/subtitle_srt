1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
O douki

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,500
This...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,660
He's life has returned as well.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,800
a long time to come!

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:20,280
A week ago, he had koan nonprofit balance.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:41,480
Oper bore no

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,080
...a woman's story that pursues it.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,440
The amount of alcohol depends on how you act.

9
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,780
It can be 0 or 100.

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,080
Well, I'm off.

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:18,840
If you pour it on tomorrow

12
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,540
A smile that's bitter and bitter

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,280
Look, the start of a lively loneliness

14
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,080
I can't help it

15
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:40,980
This time alone is the light of the day

16
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,900
Keep shining

17
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,780
In my head

18
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,200
The melody that starts to dance

19
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,660
I can't breathe it out

20
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,580
Let's go, let's go

21
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,040
As it is

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,040
The end

23
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,380
Miyuki.

24
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,220
I have a favor to ask.

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
What is it, Aratama?

26
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,900
I wanted you to come to this cooking class with me tonight.

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,060
Daichi, the chef of Mitsuboshi French Fuji-shiro.

28
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,420
He's so charismatic that he's the most famous chef in the cooking class.

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,220
My aunt was a big fan and invited me tonight.

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,900
She suddenly got a fever.

31
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,400
But the French classroom is so fancy.

32
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,700
No one else invited me.

33
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,200
You're fine today. Let's drink water.

34
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,040
Umino, your pants are torn.

35
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,340
Oh, that's true.

36
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,340
Shimamura is also open to society.

37
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,700
Oh, that's true.

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,040
I have a favor to ask.

39
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,580
I want to go home as soon as possible.

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,880
Okay.

41
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,880
Let's go together.

42
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,920
They're all rich women.

43
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,060
Oh, I found it.

44
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,340
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,140
Hello, everyone.

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,180
I'm Daichi, the genius chef.

47
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,820
That's...

48
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,860
He's so popular.

49
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,420
I can't even get a ticket.

50
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,760
Ladies and gentlemen, that's enough.

51
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,140
Let's go to the French world.

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,640
What kind of food will he teach us?

53
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,980
It's rare to learn from a top chef.

54
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,400
Let's learn from him for a special dinner.

55
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,640
Today's menu is Daichi style.

56
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,780
Magrere Canard sauce cremontine.

57
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,420
With arico fait and champignon.

58
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,920
I don't know what it is, but it looks great.

59
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,360
The recipe is simple.

60
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,820
Just make a daichi style dish and finish it.

61
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Daichi style!

62
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,860
I understand what you mean.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Make a daichi style dish and finish it.

64
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,540
Have you eaten?

65
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,660
First, we'll make a dish called Stagossilai.

66
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,600
It's a dish of pork.

67
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,260
Ampoule sauce.

68
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,500
Ampoule sauce.

69
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,940
Ampoule sauce.

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,800
Ampoule pourable.

71
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,940
Ampoule pourable.

72
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,480
Pourable.

73
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,380
Add a little seasoning to the pork.

74
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,880
It's time to play.

75
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,540
Stagossilai

76
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,780
Salt, pepper, and classic.

77
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,240
This is the first dish.

78
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,680
Ladies, join me.

79
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,540
Stagossilai

80
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,120
Miyuki, this is bad.

81
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,420
This cooking class is strange.

82
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,460
Miyuki.

83
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,500
I think I know what it is.

84
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,900
Next, we'll make a dish called Fried Pan.

85
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,600
It's a dish of love.

86
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,640
Whispering gently until the meat falls in love.

87
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,240
Whispering gently until the smell dies off.

88
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,180
Whispering gently until everything dies.

89
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,420
Whachu Circus was drunk on wine.

90
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,820
I see.

91
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Hywrun

92
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,320
It's very meaningful.

93
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,280
The violin was also important.

94
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,660
It's important to let it sit for a while after seasoning it.

95
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,580
It takes about 10 minutes to play.

96
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,320
Is that so?

97
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,120
And the process of frying it.

98
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,660
The turtle whispers until it falls into the fire.

99
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,040
That's what Hikage says.

100
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,300
While the teacher was whispering love to the turtle,

101
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,180
she was cooking it over low heat.

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,340
Miyuki, you're amazing.

103
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,200
You can't understand that much with that teaching.

104
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,840
I see.

105
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,500
So that's what it was.

106
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,900
Lady Miyuki.

107
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,680
Marvelous. Excellent.

108
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,640
The woman who understood my emotions so perfectly...

109
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,180
was you for the first time.

110
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,860
Now, it's done.

111
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,840
LAUGH

112
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,780
And you, and you, and you, and you

113
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:33,920
Prepare the

114
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:47,760
Lady Miyuki, thank you for the wonderful meeting tonight.

115
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,960
After this, can you ring the glass and talk to me?

116
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,240
Thank you for the invitation. But today, the corona virus has been cured for the first week.

117
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
I have to go home early.

118
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,040
I see. That's what it is.

119
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,840
A recipe perfect for a lady who is in conflict with time on a special night.

120
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
It's a thank you from me.

121
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,360
Mr. Daiichi, thank you very much.

122
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Thank you, my dear.

123
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Oh, that's great.

124
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
The recipe Mr. Daiichi gave me.

125
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,000
It seems that it can be easily made with a tool.

126
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
I've got everything I need, but...

127
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
It's the first one.

128
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
What the hell is this?

129
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Everyone, how about one?

130
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,240
We have a lot of products for the first week of the first week.

131
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
And today, the first chef has come.

132
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Mr. Daiichi!

133
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Mr. Nama!

134
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Well, let's welcome him.

135
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Please come in.

136
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Hello, everyone. I'm Daiichi, the genius chef.

137
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Mr. Daiichi?

138
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I recommend products for the first week.

139
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
And I sell them for the first week.

140
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
I'm so happy.

141
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
How about one?

142
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
You're a fake, aren't you?

143
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
You're a cold person.

144
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
You're right. You're a cheater.

145
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
No, no, no.

146
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
No, no, no.

147
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
No, no, no.

148
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Oh, no.

149
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
Mr. Kikki, please.

150
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Class is starting.

151
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Shut up.

152
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Let's go.

153
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,160
I thought it was impossible.

154
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
I thought it was pretty similar.

155
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
It's Daiichi.

156
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
I'll have one of these.

157
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Thank you.

158
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Please sit down.

159
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
What did you say?

160
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
I said, have a good dinner.

161
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Daiichi's cooking is making a special dinner.

162
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Let's get started.

163
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
First, we'll start with the vegetables.

164
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,080
We'll cut the scallops into thin slices.

165
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,080
We'll mix them with soy sauce and wasabi.

166
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,080
We'll put the circles we bought at the 100 yen shop on a plate.

167
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,080
We'll put the scallops on a plate.

168
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,040
We'll put the circles we bought at the 100 yen shop on a plate.

169
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,040
We'll put the chopped avocados on a plate.

170
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,040
We'll put the scallops on a plate.

171
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
We'll remove the circles.

172
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,040
This will give it a good French feel.

173
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,040
The first thing we'll do is to match them.

174
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,040
In other words, we'll make a seaweed tsukudani.

175
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,040
It's probably okay because there are similar ones sold in the supermarket.

176
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We'll put the green onions and black pepper on the salad.

177
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Then, we'll have a plate of tartar sauce with scallops and seaweed.

178
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Next, we'll make salmon.

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
First, we'll make the sauce.

180
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We'll wash the scallops and cut them into thin slices.

181
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We'll put mayonnaise,

182
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
and the soy sauce we'll eat.

183
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We'll mix it with lime juice.

184
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:15,960
It's amazing that we can make such a stylish and rich sauce with the ingredients we sell in the supermarket.

185
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,960
Next, we'll make salmon with mikiui.

186
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Mikiui means half raw in French.

187
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,960
We'll look at the salmon so that it doesn't overcook.

188
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,960
We'll put the salmon on the plate.

189
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
It's so delicious.

190
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,960
I'm going to fall in love with this cross section.

191
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
We'll put the sauce on the salmon,

192
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,960
and add salmon roe and scallops.

193
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,920
We'll finish it off with a lime peel.

194
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,920
It's so luxurious that it's hard to believe we made it at home.

195
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,920
It's so artistic.

196
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Lastly, we'll make a steak that's not essential for a full course.

197
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,920
We'll wrap the potatoes in wet kitchen paper and microwave them.

198
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
We'll put the potatoes in a bag,

199
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,880
crush them with a cotton swab,

200
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,880
flatten them, and sprinkle flour on them.

201
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
We'll fry the potatoes in a frying pan with oil.

202
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,840
We'll put the potatoes in the pan.

203
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,840
The color of the steak is always attractive.

204
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,840
I can feel the desire to play the violin and have a session.

205
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,840
I want to play it because it's a home-made instrument.

206
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
We'll add butter and garlic,

207
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
and bring the meat back to the pan.

208
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
We'll fry the meat while sprinkling melted butter.

209
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,800
The meat will slowly and deliciously grow.

210
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,760
We'll add butter, soy sauce, lemon juice, sugar, and black pepper.

211
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Finally, we'll add chives to make a shimichurri-like sauce.

212
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,760
I can't believe we can make such a great French dish at home.

213
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,760
There are no impossible words in my full-course dictionary.

214
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,760
I'll make it with the ingredients I learned from the video.

215
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,760
I'll make it with the ingredients I learned from the video.

216
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,760
I'll make it with the ingredients I learned from the video.

217
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,760
I'll make it with the ingredients I learned from the video.

218
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,720
There are no impossible words in my full-course dictionary.

219
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,720
If you add chervil to the finish...

220
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Voila!

221
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Thank you for the food.

222
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,720
I'll drink it with a glass of water.

223
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,720
I'll drink it with a glass of water.

224
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,720
I'll drink it with a glass of water.

225
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,720
I'll drink it with a glass of water.

226
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,720
I'll drink it with a glass of water.

227
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
I'll drink it with a glass of water.

228
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,720
I'll drink it with a glass of water.

229
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,720
I'll drink it with a glass of water.

230
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,720
I'll drink it with a glass of water.

231
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,680
I'll drink it with a glass of water.

232
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,680
After a week, the perfect dinner...

233
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,080
Izawa Miyuki, it's the day of resurrection!

234
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,560
They blend together...

235
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,880
I didn't know seaweed and tsukudani would blend so well.

236
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,120
I want to give a round of applause to the scallops, avocado, and seaweed ensemble.

237
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,580
ezawa yoroda

238
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,200
This is exactly like bossam miso minutes before a wrap.

239
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,620
It's banned from dinner irgendwann.

240
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,680
The salmon is so fatty. It's so delicious.

241
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,680
The raw salmon gives you the texture of grilled and raw salmon.

242
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,680
The sauce is good.

243
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,680
The mild mayonnaise and the spicy oil stimulate the taste.

244
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,680
And the lime smells elegant.

245
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
It's the best combination.

246
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
No, it's a combination.

247
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
And the French is the best.

248
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,680
The red wine makes me feel like I'm eating French at home.

249
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
The sauce is good.

250
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,680
The mild mayonnaise and the spicy oil stimulate the taste.

251
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,680
And the lime smells elegant.

252
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,680
And the spicy oil stimulate the taste.

253
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,680
And the lime smells elegant.

254
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,680
And the mild mayonnaise and the spicy oil stimulate the taste.

255
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
The sauce is good.

256
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,680
The red wine makes me feel like I'm eating French at home.

257
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,680
And the mild mayonnaise and the spicy oil stimulate the taste.

258
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,680
And the lime smells elegant.

259
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,680
The combination of potato and steamed steak is revolutionary.

260
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,680
It's the first time in my life that I've ever felt that potatoes are so delicious.

261
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
The meat is well grilled.

262
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
It's the best.

263
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Well...

264
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,680
The meat is well grilled.

282
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,680
I can enjoy French food at home.

283
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,680
It was a perfect meal.

284
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,680
Thank you for the meal.

285
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Thank you very much.

286
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,680
Niki, look at this.

287
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,680
It was a singer debut on SNS.

288
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,680
It seems that I can't get a ticket to the cooking class anymore.

289
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Niki, what do you think of this?

290
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
What is this?

291
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm an advisor for super executive real estate.

292
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,680
I teach how to find an executive real estate in the supermarket.

293
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Who wants to go to that class?

294
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
I want to go to that class.

295
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,680
Everyone, you can go to the class.

296
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Cool.

297
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,680
It's 40,000 yen because the old man told me.

298
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,680
Umino, this is the most expensive.

299
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,680
The daily excitement expands the possibility of the night.

300
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Where can I find the hint of the night?

301
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
I want you to find a room where you can see fireworks.

302
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,680
I want you to enjoy the night view in front of you.

303
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,680
