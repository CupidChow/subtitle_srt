1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Congratulations!

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Yesterday, I succeeded in the leftover fridge food challenge.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,500
Thanks to that, the fridge is empty.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,500
I have to buy the ingredients properly today.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,500
How can I drink the last drink of the day in the best way?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This drama is a story of a woman who pursues it.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,000
The taste of alcohol depends on how you act in a day.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll be going now.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If you're drunk, smile.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Look, the beginning of a lively loneliness.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can't stop.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This time alone is the light of the day.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Keep shining.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The melody that starts to dance in my head.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I can't stop.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's the best. It's the best.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
As it is.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The End

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Huh? Where's Shimamura?

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, he's not here.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I didn't notice him at all.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
When did he disappear?

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They're so mean.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I didn't notice him because I was chasing after him.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Welcome.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, thanks.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This way, please.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What kind of room are you looking for today?

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I've already found a room.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Can I see the room?

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I understand.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If you don't mind, I'll go with you.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No, I don't have to see this room.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Is that so?

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's go.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't want to be caught by anyone.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There's a convenience store downstairs.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's a very convenient room.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's right.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's the room over there.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Shimamura?

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Miyuki, is this the room?

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Huh? It's the one before.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, no.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you know each other?

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We're colleagues.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We work together.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
There's a room here.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is the kitchen.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The sink is big and there's a lot of storage.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There's a window.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's exactly as I imagined.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's a nice view.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The light is coming in.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No, no, no.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Why are you arguing with me?

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I came here first, so please forgive me.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I came first, so I'm first, right?

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Is that so?

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No, I'll be the one who asks you first.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Shimamura, let's go back and ask him right away.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh, it's dirty.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Stop it.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's go.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Excuse me.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I have a suggestion.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
How about we ask the same person and ask the owner to take care of it?

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sounds good.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Captain!

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm a part-time job.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He's a full-time employee.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I can't stand it if he sees me there.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's not what I meant.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Please let me meet the owner.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I think I'll know if I meet him directly.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm the owner, Chiyo.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm Morino, who's going to live here.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No, I'm Maeno, who's going to live here.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm aiming to be a cartoonist.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm a part-time job now, but I'm sure I'll sell it, so I'd rather be me.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No matter how much you talk about it, it's possible to die.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm the boss at the office now.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You two look alike.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We don't.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You two look like actors.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Thank you.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's often said.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You're a supporting role.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm the only one who's a supporting role.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I've been doing this since I was a kid.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm going to be famous.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm doing drama, movie, and stage.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm going to the semi-finals.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm going to watch Tiger.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to the semi-finals.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm going to the semi-finals.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I've never been to the semi-finals.

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I've never been to the semi-finals.

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Tiger is that?

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's not do the pre-production.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
How about you, Mr. Lachio?

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I feel more like a training technique.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I feel more like a heavyweight.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Same.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Does this mean we're together?

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is also a job.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's okay.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It should be a little more obvious.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He's fat, right?

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is bad.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Can you talk about people?

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm a funny guy.

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm actually a muscle guy.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're funny.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What's wrong with your sense of humor?

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's the truth.

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It doesn't matter if you're funny or not.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'd rather be fat.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's not funny.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's more cool than funny.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What's wrong with your sense of humor?

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have to buy potatoes.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Which one?

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You look alike.

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Which one lives around here?

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It doesn't matter which one.

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't tell.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Potatoes.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No, no, no.

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It didn't work out.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I feel like I've been here for 10 years.

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't have to come back for a while.

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's go home.

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's past 6.

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're going to be sick.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're going home.

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm going home.

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's been a day without a move.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I feel good about the night.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let's go shopping.

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
All the lights were broken down during the summer illumination.

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We're going to have a temporary break today.

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What?

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Why?

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Is it okay to have this?

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No, it's a trip.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's a trip to the whole shopping district.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That means the other shops are the same.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The lights in the convenience store look so bright.

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry I didn't come for a while.

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I've never used the convenience store because I have a mark.

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I might find a new hint for the night.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I might find a new hint for the night.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I found it.

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The ingredients.

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I think it's your duty to create an environment where you can work part-time.

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You can contact the headquarters in the morning.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The office is the same.

163
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The manager is making a strange line.

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The manager doesn't buy customers.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I sell more every month.

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And it seems that customers are more likely to buy when I'm standing in the office.

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What was the hourly rate?

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's good if you don't go down.

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Is that so?

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm taking all the voice recordings.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm taking this too.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm Izawa.

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Welcome.

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm not doing anything in the shopping district.

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm here to buy dinner.

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Our ingredients are ordinary.

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's not ordinary.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We have to arrange it.

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Arrange?

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If you mix the convenience store food and make a devise, it has a lot of potential.

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I see.

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Do you have any recommendations?

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If so.

185
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Natto and squid noodles.

186
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It goes well with summer.

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Natto is this.

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What does Mabo tofu taste like?

189
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's hot.

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you know that if you fry Mabo tofu with natto, it will taste good?

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Customers are buying dinner.

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I recommend something with bread.

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's delicious with natto.

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It may be good.

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And.

196
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's delicious if you make it with bread and tomato sauce.

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Bread is a must.

198
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This.

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Is it shumai with bread?

200
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Crush the frozen shrimp shumai and add the accent with mayonnaise.

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If you toast it in bread, it will be a good shrimp bread.

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Toast?

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If it's shumai, it goes well with curry.

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's good.

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll have shrimp bread.

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Thank you.

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And.

208
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This.

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If you cut the jumbo frank into bite-sized pieces and eat it with curry, it will be a good drink.

210
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's great.

211
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And.

212
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
How about the Zawa cloud style cut cabbage with vinegar and mustard?

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Stop talking about it.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's even better.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll have both.

216
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Thank you.

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It was a great convenience store, but they taught me a good recipe.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's make it.

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
First, make the cabbage.

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's a great idea to make the cut cabbage you can buy anywhere like Zawa cloud style.

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
After you salt it, water will come out, so remove the water.

222
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And season it.

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Vinegar, sugar and mustard.

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And leave it in the refrigerator for a while.

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Next, shrimp bread.

226
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Put the shrimp shumai in a bowl and heat it in the microwave.

227
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
When it's warm, add mayonnaise and crush it with a spoon.

228
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's a novel dish.

229
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm having fun arranging convenience store ingredients.

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I didn't think I'd be a toast.

231
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't know what life has.

232
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Next, frankfurters.

233
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll make a sauce I learned from the recipe.

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Put mayonnaise, cream and curry powder.

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Add a little salt.

236
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's easy, but this sauce is already the best.

237
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I've cut everything I could, but it's the first time I've cut a convenience store's frankfurter.

238
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll bake a delicious frankfurter as it is.

239
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I didn't think of this idea.

240
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, it feels like a snack when you bake it.

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's good to bake a luxury ham, but it's also good to do this.

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
When you add curry cream sauce, it's done.

243
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, well.

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The color of the bread is the best.

245
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Lastly, natto mapo tofu.

246
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's a sorry level of ease that you just heat the mapo tofu and add natto.

247
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll add some oil.

248
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I recommended adding natto to the mapo tofu three years ago, but I wonder if I'll be able to overcome it.

249
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Finally, add a lot of sancho.

250
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's done.

251
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's done.

252
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll eat.

253
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll eat.

254
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I was wondering what would happen at one o'clock, but I was able to get to this one cup safely today.

255
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
First of all.

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's done.

257
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This is...

258
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The classic menu of Akacho-chin Izakaya.

259
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The chunk of fried red sausage and the perfect size.

260
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's a 100-point snack.

261
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This curry cream sauce goes well with it.

262
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I can't believe I'm going to eat the jambon franc of the convenience store with ketchup mustard.

263
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I hope you can also introduce this sauce to the convenience store and choose the one you like.

264
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's a little spicy.

265
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's like the work out.

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's a recipe that the Germans might be annoyed with, but I'll add it to the future night-time repartory.

267
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's right.

268
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But...

269
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You had a hard time?

270
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The taste of the natto is very good.

271
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Next, I'll try the natto mapo tofu.

272
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes, this is very good.

273
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The mapo tofu in the convenience store has become level 99.

274
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm impressed again.

275
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I think I'm over the impression.

276
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I should have tried natto.

277
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I was going to try natto with a variety of natto dishes, but I was still too naive.

278
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What is this? It's too good.

279
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The taste of shrimp, shumai, mayonnaise and bread spreads in my mouth.

280
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This is a skill. It's definitely better than eating shumai as it is.

281
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's absolutely delicious. It can be commercialized.

282
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
How can I think of putting shrimp shumai on toast?

283
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay.

284
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm going to try it.

285
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm going to try it.

286
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm going to try it.

287
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm going to try it.

288
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm going to try it.

289
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm going to try it.

290
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm going to try it.

291
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm going to try it.

292
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm going to try it.

293
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm going to try it.

294
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm going to try it.

295
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm going to try it.

296
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm going to try it.

297
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm going to try it.

298
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm going to try it.

299
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm going to try it.

300
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It was a dinner that touched the unlimited possibilities of convenience stores.

301
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Thank you for the meal.

302
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Then, the two of you can share the room.

303
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
This person is not at all.

304
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's fine.

305
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I think these two are getting along well.

306
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Then, the contract is over.

307
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Thank you for your hard work.

308
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Fumino is taking the contract.

309
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What is this? It's a one-time deal.

310
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
There is no real deal.

311
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Excuse me.

312
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Did you make a contract here?

313
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I made a contract.

314
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm the one who's going to be the one to pay.

315
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's the worst. Someone's cheating.

316
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
No, you're the one who's cheating.

317
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You're always late for everything.

318
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm faster than you.

319
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm faster.

320
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
My legs are faster.

321
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm going to lose my mind today.

322
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But I believe that there is a good nightclub ahead.

323
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Let's do our best.

324
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's a good property.

325
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
No one would think that this would become a real estate company.

326
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You did well.

327
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Thank you.

328
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's get started.

329
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's finally been two months.

330
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yes.

331
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm looking forward to it.

332
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
There is no border on the nightclub.
