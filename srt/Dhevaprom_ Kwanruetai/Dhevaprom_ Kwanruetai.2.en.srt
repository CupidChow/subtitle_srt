1
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,880
Do you want to die?

2
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,960
I want to know

3
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,680
how those two sisters are doing.

4
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,720
Chat, you have to help me, dear.

5
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,440
I said that…

6
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,840
You've got this strange smile.

7
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,320
Are you falling for a Chiang Rai girl
or something?

8
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,880
How could he say he didn't feel a thing?

9
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,480
They are a handful.

10
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,880
At our first meeting,
he was barely clothed.

11
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,320
Then today, our lips touched
and he even felt my boobs.

12
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,560
What will he do tomorrow?

13
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,920
It's so hot.

14
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,760
Why is it so damn hot?

15
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,680
Gosh. It's so hot.

16
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,080
There's no breeze at all.

17
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,480
Hot.

18
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,200
Who's making all that noise?

19
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,560
You there.

20
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,600
You have no manners.

21
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,840
Haven't I taught you
about it several times?

22
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,360
I'm sorry, Mom.

23
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,079
Why are you still up?

24
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,520
How could I sleep when it's this hot?

25
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,480
When are you installing the AC?
It has been a year since you promised.

26
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,440
I've been working hard to earn money, Mom.

27
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,400
AC units aren't cheap, Mom.

28
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,240
Oh, my.

29
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,440
Why?

30
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,520
Can't you do this much for me?

31
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,400
Why am I so unlucky?

32
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,440
Why can't my life be
as comfortable as other mothers?

33
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,320
Mom, Kwan and I
are already working as hard as we can.

34
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,080
If I get offered the catering job,

35
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,120
I will get good pay.

36
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,360
When will you be
getting that catering job?

37
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
You've been talking about it for months.

38
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,840
They might give me a call this month.

39
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,600
I also received a meal box order
from a new customer.

40
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,640
It's a new doctor from Bangkok.
He's paying almost double the regular fee.

41
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,480
Is that doctor a guy?

42
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,760
Yes, Mom.

43
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
Look at you with your hair down
and makeup on.

44
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,280
All that for a meal delivery, huh?

45
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,800
-Why would I do that?
-Why?

46
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,920
What would I know?

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,080
You could be hoping to tie down
a rich doctor and kick me out.

48
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,160
I would never do that.

49
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,400
I sure hope so.

50
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,840
When you leave the house,

51
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,440
cover up properly and put on a hat
so you look like a tomboy.

52
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,640
You'd better hide your curves and boobs.

53
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,800
She knows all that.

54
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,800
But since she's at home,
please cut her some slack.

55
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,600
-Ouch, Mom.
-Remember.

56
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,080
-You must remember.
-You're hurting me.

57
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,240
You are a bad luck.

58
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,240
My life is in this sorry state
because of you.

59
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,160
You must serve me until my dying day,
do you understand?

60
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,040
Do you understand?

61
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,160
Why don't you answer me?

62
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,800
No answer.

63
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,800
It's so hot.

64
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,480
It's so damn hot.

65
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,680
No AC when it's scorching.

66
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,280
Poor me.

67
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,320
How pitiful.

68
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,800
I'll finish the ironing.
You should get some rest.

69
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,440
Hold on a little longer.

70
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,960
If I get that catering job,
things will get better.

71
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,720
I'm good. This is literally nothing.

72
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,520
By the way, what would you say
if I go foraging and sell what I find?

73
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,680
You shouldn't do that.

74
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
I would prefer that you go back to school.

75
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
I've stopped thinking about that.

76
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,360
I insist.

77
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,480
You must go back to school.

78
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,640
I promised Dad.

79
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,240
I won't break it.

80
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,880
All right?

81
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,880
ONE NEW MESSAGE

82
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,280
Tomorrow
I will arrive in Chiang Rai around noon.

83
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,880
Can you come to meet me?
I dearly miss my big brother.

84
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,360
HAIRCUT

85
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,200
Why were you photographing me?

86
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,120
I wasn't taking your photo.

87
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,560
Liar. I saw you doing it.

88
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,760
I'm photographing the location
for business purposes.

89
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,920
It was you who walked into my shots.

90
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,000
Yet you still took those photos.

91
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,760
That's rude and an invasion of privacy.

92
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,760
Well, how about this?

93
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,920
After I've had the films developed,
I'll send you the films.

94
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,200
Give me your address.

95
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,480
Do you think
I'll just give out my address?

96
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,800
Do you take me as a fool?

97
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,400
Don't tell me you think I like you

98
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,240
and am trying to flirt with you.

99
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,760
You're infuriating.

100
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,880
Let me tell you.

101
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,120
My type is a conservative Thai lady.

102
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,240
Not some girl

103
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,040
who shows a lot of skin

104
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,640
wearing a Western dress like you.

105
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,160
I don't find anything about you…

106
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,520
intriguing.

107
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,800
RUNGRUENG PANICH

108
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,680
Chat.

109
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,600
Kej.

110
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,160
I've missed you so much.

111
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,720
Behave yourself.

112
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,160
People are watching.

113
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,600
We're siblings who miss each other.
Why must we care what people think?

114
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,480
Park.

115
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Yes, Mom?

116
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,640
What do you think of the location?

117
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,520
Not bad at all. It's much more developed
than I imagined.

118
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,040
Give me some credit.

119
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,720
I wouldn't have put the initial investment
for your business here otherwise.

120
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
I know.
Shall we check out the company then?

121
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,560
Let's go.

122
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,720
-Let me carry that.
-Thank you.

123
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,960
May I ask

124
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,640
why you decided to take up
a job in a boutique in Chiang Rai?

125
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,880
We own a mall in Bangkok.

126
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,680
You could open as many shops
as you desire.

127
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,000
I wanted to apprentice at Arada Boutique.

128
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,000
They opened a Chiang Rai branch
and were in need of an assistant.

129
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,320
I never thought
they would offer me the job.

130
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,000
You graduated
with a fashion design degree from France.

131
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,280
Isn't that reason enough?

132
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,560
It's not enough.

133
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,360
What if my designs weren't to the liking
of Thai customers? What's the point?

134
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,160
Apprenticing at Arada Boutique
would go a long way to hone my skills.

135
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,400
I know very well
once you've made a decision,

136
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,520
no one can talk you out of it.

137
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,440
Siblings are pretty much
two peas in a pod.

138
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,960
And how did you get Mom and Dad
to go along with this?

139
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,200
That was easy. I said I really missed you
and wanted to work somewhere nearby.

140
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,080
It was smooth sailing from there.

141
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,400
The tricky part was Great-Grandma.
She even told me off.

142
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,200
She complained that I only just returned
from France and now I'm off to Chiang Rai.

143
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,480
I had to plead with her for two days.

144
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,800
We've arrived at Arada.

145
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,760
Let's go in.

146
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,280
Please don't let it slip to Mrs. Da
who our parents are.

147
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,320
I want to prove myself with my skills,
not my family name.

148
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,880
-I got it.
-Let's go.

149
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,320
Mrs. Arada.

150
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,360
This is my older brother, Mr. Chat.

151
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,240
-Hello.
-Hello.

152
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,560
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-You too.

153
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,120
Park.

154
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,640
Park, we need to settle this.

155
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,440
I'm tired. Let me have a quick nap.

156
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,400
Stop avoiding the issue.

157
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,360
I started a business for you here.

158
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,560
It's time you return the favor.

159
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,840
Which Chiang Rai girl
will we have a meal with this time?

160
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,960
She is not a Chiang Rai girl.

161
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,760
She's the daughter of that M.L. doctor

162
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,680
and Mrs. Krongkaew.

163
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,320
This was the smallest house
Dad could find.

164
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,040
You'll have to claim that you're staying
with a relative with a house this size.

165
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
Renting it doesn't sound plausible.

166
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,480
That's what I figured. Also, the shop
is just a short distance away.

167
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,560
Please tell Mom and Dad not to worry.

168
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,240
Did you only bring Nom?

169
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,200
Yes. Mom was going to have another two
accompany me, plus a driver.

170
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,000
Fortunately, I stopped her in time.

171
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,360
Where's your car?

172
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,880
Winai is bringing my car.
He should arrive by late afternoon.

173
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,880
There's no need for you to worry.
I can manage just fine.

174
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,360
I was living in France all by myself.
This is trivial.

175
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,520
Can you write down your phone number?

176
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,720
Of course.

177
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,320
Mr. Chat's sister?

178
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
That's right.

179
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,440
Isn't she supposed
to be studying in France?

180
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,200
She was. She's back though.

181
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,960
She's working at
the Chiang Rai branch of Arada.

182
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,960
I see now.

183
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,320
That's why you were so kind
to start a business for me here.

184
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,760
Here you are.

185
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,440
If you run into trouble
but you can't reach me,

186
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,320
you should try calling the army hospital
and go look for me there.

187
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,800
I'll do that.

188
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,320
-I'll be going then.
-Okay.

189
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,200
Chat.

190
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,280
Don't ever think you can escape from me.

191
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,320
I'd never do that.

192
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,880
-Are you really leaving?
-I have another errand to attend to.

193
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,560
I'm going.

194
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,120
Mrs. Krongkaew was delighted when she
heard you were opening a business here.

195
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,840
She's worried about her daughter.

196
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,480
So you and Aunt Krongkaew
knew from the start?

197
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,280
You already know
that I don't like being set up.

198
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,400
It feels like my hands are forced.

199
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,599
Chat is at the army hospital nearby.
I don't need another man to look after me.

200
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,200
I can take care of myself, Mother.

201
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,119
I already set a date with Mrs. Krongkaew.
Canceling it would look bad.

202
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,360
Please, it's only one meal.

203
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,600
If you like her, pursue her as you wish.

204
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,120
If you don't like her,
just treat her as a sister.

205
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,720
I'll go with you.
You don't need to be shy.

206
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,120
I'll agree to this one meal date.
After that, we go our separate ways.

207
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,160
As I recall,

208
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,760
I didn't like this friend of Chat's
when I was young.

209
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,320
He was a troublemaker. A vain one at that.

210
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,760
There's no way that I'll like her.

211
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,000
She was a crybaby.

212
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
She cried every time we met.

213
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,760
One meal, that's it.

214
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,960
Watch your words.

215
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,600
You might want to take back
what you said when you see her.

216
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,200
She's a woman now.

217
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,400
She even has a degree from abroad.

218
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,640
I don't fall in love easily.

219
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,280
"You've never fallen in love"
is more like it.

220
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,200
I agreed to you starting a business here

221
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,400
because I wanted you to get over
what your dad did.

222
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,520
Mr. Pinit's wandering eyes
and numerous mistresses

223
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,720
were not your fault, Park.

224
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,400
You and your dad are different people.

225
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,120
Your dad is dead.

226
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,120
Why do you still worry
that others will reject you?

227
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,400
Why do you lock up your heart
and refuse to fall in love?

228
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,800
I don't get it.

229
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
My partner will be of my choosing, Mom.

230
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,520
I get that.

231
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,720
This is just one meal, though.

232
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,920
It's not like I'm going to force you
into marriage after the meal.

233
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,440
It's so heavy.

234
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,480
-Hey, Tai.
-Hey.

235
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,760
What did you bring?

236
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,280
A pot of curry, Uncle.

237
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,600
-Let me see.
-Gosh, I'm tired.

238
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,280
Nice. Smells delicious.

239
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,640
Why a huge pot though?

240
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,280
What huge pot? This isn't much at all.

241
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,520
If not for your and Pon's help yesterday,

242
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,880
I'd have ended up sleeping in the wild,
getting mosquito bites.

243
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
What's up, Tai?

244
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,120
I heard you were captured
by your own trap, huh?

245
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,120
If only I hadn't been kind in helping
that new doctor,

246
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,160
I wouldn't have fallen into Sorn's trap.

247
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,000
-Tai.
-What?

248
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,360
People at the market were saying

249
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,360
that this new doctor
is as handsome as an actor.

250
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,280
Is that true?

251
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,400
He's not handsome at all.

252
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,720
His complexion is pale.
His eyes are doll-like.

253
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,560
I do question if he really is a man.

254
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,640
Must a guy be tanned and stocky like Pon

255
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,200
for you to consider handsome?

256
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,240
Exactly.

257
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,120
Speaking of which, where is Pon?

258
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,800
Over there, his usual place by the back.

259
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,920
Is he? I'll go and say hi.

260
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,040
Go ahead.

261
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,200
It's a pity that she can only
be my big sister.

262
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
I'd have loved to have her
as my daughter-in-law.

263
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,560
I doubt Tai's mom would ever
accept Pon as her son-in-law.

264
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,960
But a pale-faced doctor from Bangkok
might be a different story.

265
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,360
Let's have the curry
Tai brought us, shall we?

266
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,400
We shall.

267
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,480
Tai.

268
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,560
Your aim is as accurate as ever.

269
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,680
What brings you here?

270
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,960
I brought a curry as a thank-you gift
for your help yesterday.

271
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,720
Thank you.

272
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,760
When did you and the new doctor
become best buds?

273
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,280
Best buds? We're not close.

274
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
No?

275
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,360
But yesterday,

276
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,920
when I was walking the new doctor back,
he kept asking about you

277
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,640
non-stop.

278
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,200
What did you tell him?

279
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
I told him the truth.

280
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,120
I have a feeling
this new doctor is interested in you.

281
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,200
Shame.

282
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,200
What's with you?

283
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,760
What are you even saying?

284
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,800
You're pissing me off.
I'm heading back to sell meal boxes.

285
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,720
Hopefully, I won't run into him today.

286
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,880
What's up with her?

287
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,280
She comes and goes as she pleases.

288
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,920
Are your hormones acting up?

289
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,400
Here you go.

290
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,160
Thank you.

291
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,280
There's pork fried rice
and Pad Thai with shrimp.

292
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,200
-What would you like?
-The fried rice, please.

293
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Fried rice it is.

294
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,560
The pork fried rice is still piping hot.

295
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,280
Here you go. Thank you.

296
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,040
I have piping hot pork fried rice
and shrimp Pad Thai.

297
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,280
Also, my special dish,

298
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,400
chicken with basil and fried egg.

299
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,160
All dishes are 12 baht.

300
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,840
Are you looking for someone?

301
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,640
Are you okay?

302
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,320
Fon!

303
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,800
I'm sorry.

304
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
Who were you looking for?

305
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
I was looking…

306
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,800
I was looking for you, actually.

307
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,520
I was afraid I might run out.

308
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,640
What would you like today?

309
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,360
There are Pad Thai,
chicken basil, and pork fried rice.

310
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,320
I'll go with Pad Thai today.

311
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,120
-I haven't had it in a while.
-Of course.

312
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,800
Pad Thai.

313
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,040
Doctor, this way.

314
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,680
I'm starving today.
I'll have two servings.

315
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,000
How about

316
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,280
-chicken with basil and Pad Thai?
-Okay.

317
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,840
-Of course.
-I prefer to have them hot.

318
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,080
No worries. The heat is burning my hands.

319
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,280
Shall we get some for Dr. Chat?

320
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,320
He's not in today.
He's taking the day off.

321
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,680
Rumor has it he has a date in town.

322
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,360
His girlfriend, perhaps.

323
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,400
I'll take this one.

324
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,400
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

325
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,520
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

326
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,280
My portioning is perfect, Tai.

327
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,040
Make equal portions, okay?
Don't give Wa more than everyone else.

328
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,480
Families with pretty daughters
deserve special treatment.

329
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,800
-Why, you--
-Hi, Tai.

330
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,280
I'm back.

331
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,880
Hurry up and rinse the vegetables.
You sure took your time.

332
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,440
Tai, there's a person waiting for you
by the gate.

333
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,320
Who is it?

334
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,560
I didn't ask. But I think they're here
to discuss a meal box order.

335
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,400
You're useless.
Take over for me, all right?

336
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,680
Okay.

337
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,440
-You!
-Whoa! Why are you hitting me?

338
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,120
Why didn't you warn me

339
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,800
that it's the sweet-faced doctor?

340
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Is he the doctor? I didn't know.

341
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,280
Useless!

342
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,440
What should I do? Mom won't be pleased.

343
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,680
Maiseek, go and talk to him for a bit.

344
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,640
-What?
-Go on now.

345
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,280
Go.

346
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,280
Tai is busy cooking.
She can't come out to meet you.

347
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,920
That's fine. I only dropped by to confirm
the meal box delivery that we agreed on.

348
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,120
You should find another supplier.

349
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,600
Tai's no longer accepting orders.

350
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,680
What? But we had a verbal agreement.

351
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,880
I also pay a higher monthly fee
than the others.

352
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,480
So what? Tai is not accepting
any more orders and that's final.

353
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,920
You should go home.
I have work to get back to.

354
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,120
Hold on.

355
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,360
Tell your boss lady

356
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,560
that I don't accept this rejection.

357
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,520
If your boss lady is afraid to talk to me
herself about the cancellation,

358
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,480
I'll take it as me still being
her delivery customer.

359
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,160
Here's the advance monthly fee.

360
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,640
-Tai, he wouldn't hear any of it.
-I heard everything.

361
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,840
Go pack the meal boxes.
I'll handle this myself.

362
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,000
Sure thing.

363
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,760
Take your money back.

364
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,560
Take your money back.
I'm not taking your order.

365
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,000
What's the reason?

366
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,720
I already said…

367
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,360
No reason.

368
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,080
I'm tired and lazy.
I don't want to make any more orders.

369
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,240
Take your money back.

370
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,440
-If it's because I--
-Shut it.

371
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,560
-I didn't mean to--
-Do you want to get hurt?

372
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,040
Take your money back.

373
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,320
Find another supplier.

374
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,360
I'm at full capacity
and not taking more orders.

375
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,720
My not coming out earlier
to cancel your orders

376
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,040
wasn't because I was afraid

377
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,360
but because I don't particularly like you.

378
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,360
I didn't want to see you or talk to you.

379
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,440
You'd better get it right.

380
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,680
What is it, Dad?

381
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,840
Keep quiet.

382
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,080
Check the goods.

383
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,720
-Hey!
-Let's go.

384
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,560
Follow them!

385
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,760
Faster, Pon. Faster!

386
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,400
Yes. I can start right away.

387
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,080
Thank you.

388
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,440
Who did you give our number to?

389
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,880
How many times have I told you

390
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,600
not to share our number with anyone?

391
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,680
When you two aren't around,
I won't bother answering the phone.

392
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,520
But Mom,

393
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,640
that call was important.

394
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,440
I got a job offer.

395
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,160
What job?

396
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,080
The catering job.

397
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,600
Are you really going for it?

398
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,120
Whenever there's a job,
you have to leave for a week or two.

399
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,440
But the pay is so good.

400
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,200
Much better than laundry.

401
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,200
What?

402
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,720
Are you going to drop the laundry job
just like that?

403
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,960
There are a lot of customers.

404
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,000
Kwan will take over.

405
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,920
She'll manage as much as she can.

406
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,640
Who'll be selling the meal boxes then?

407
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,240
Sumlee and Maiseek said
they would lend Kwan a helping hand.

408
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,160
I'm thinking of giving them a raise.

409
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,520
Whoa, there.

410
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,720
You can't deduct my share.

411
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,320
I won't have it.

412
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,280
Of course not.

413
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,400
My income will be many times higher.

414
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,280
I won't accept the previous amount either.

415
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,360
I won't have it.

416
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,480
With you leaving,
it will be just Kwan and me here.

417
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,640
Just the two of us.

418
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,480
I'll have to rely on her for everything.

419
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,080
Kwan is your own blood.

420
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,680
That girl is bad luck.

421
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,920
I don't even see her as my child.

422
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,960
What a shame. It should have been
you in my belly instead of her.

423
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,960
Mom, if she heard you say that,
she'd be sad.

424
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,240
Who cares?

425
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,320
If she hadn't been in the way,

426
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,880
I would have wedded
a better man than your dad.

427
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,600
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

428
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,040
Can I have two packs, please?

429
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,800
-There you go. Here's for you.
-You want this one?

430
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,880
How many?

431
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,760
How many?

432
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,199
Is Tai not here?

433
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,600
If she were here, you'd have seen her.

434
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,239
I mean…

435
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,639
Tai isn't here.

436
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,400
She doesn't want to see
a certain someone here.

437
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,719
Starting today, the two of us will be
selling the meal boxes.

438
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,719
Just until Tai can free up her schedule.

439
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,120
Why did you tell him that?

440
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,320
Why are you so polite to him?

441
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,240
He's a doctor.

442
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,320
Do you think
you'll never get sick or what?

443
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,520
Thank you.

444
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,920
Here.

445
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,960
Hello, Miss. Do you have a reservation?

446
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,960
Yes. Has Lady Umpai arrived?

447
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,240
She has arrived.
The table is right at the back, Miss.

448
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,000
Thank you.

449
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,160
-You!
-You!

450
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
What a small world.

451
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,120
It's more like a cruel world.

452
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,040
Park, you're late.

453
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,160
You must be Lady Umpai.

454
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,840
You must be Kej.

455
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,800
I am.

456
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,960
You're so lovely, Park.
You went to pick her up.

457
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,480
Give her some food.

458
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,920
Thank you.

459
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,200
Mrs. Krongkaew told me
you were going to start working

460
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,120
as a manager for Arada Boutique.

461
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,320
That's right, ma'am.

462
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,560
Mrs. Arada actually has two daughters.

463
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,680
Doesn't either of them
want to work for their mother?

464
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,880
I don't really know the details.

465
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,160
What I know is that
Ms. Orawan works at a bank.

466
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,360
As for Ms. Orawee, I'm not quite sure.

467
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,440
Didn't you say
Ms. Kej has a design degree from France?

468
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,200
Why not start your own business?

469
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,720
Your family owns a mall in Bangkok, no?

470
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,960
I'm also curious.

471
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,520
I admire Mrs. Arada's
design and needlework.

472
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,960
Especially her traditional and modernized
Thai attire. Her work is impeccable.

473
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,520
I want to learn from her and apply
her techniques to my own work

474
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,840
so that they better suit
the taste of Thai customers.

475
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:57,560
When I met Mrs. Arada, she mentioned
the Chiang Rai branch that needed help.

476
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,320
I quickly applied, packed my bags,
and traveled up here.

477
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,440
Chatty, aren't you?

478
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,160
Park, why did you butt in?

479
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,760
I was enjoying the story.

480
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,400
Chatty was a compliment.

481
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,560
What did I do wrong?

482
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
Please don't mind my son.

483
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,600
This is why he doesn't have a girlfriend.

484
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,200
Perhaps my soulmate hasn't been born yet.

485
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,480
Not yet born

486
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,200
or steering clear because of your nagging?

487
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,960
Give her more.

488
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,360
How about that one?

489
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,200
This one then.

490
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,440
Thank you.

491
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,280
Ah Go. Let's keep him.
He doesn't have many clothes.

492
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,600
He's not naggy either.

493
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,920
-What about Aunt Paan?
-She's a big tipper. Keep her.

494
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,320
Aren't you greedy?
Don't overwork yourself.

495
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,080
What about Dr. Mes?

496
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,720
I'd rather

497
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
not keep him.

498
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,960
Why not?

499
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,040
I feel bad for him.

500
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,080
He's single and works hard.
He barely has any free time.

501
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,600
Fine. Put an asterisk to his name.

502
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,320
I'll find someone to help him.

503
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,680
What is this? Look here.

504
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,800
It's all torn up.

505
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,920
What did you do to get my dress
all torn up like this?

506
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,200
Do you know that I had this dress
tailor-made by the Arada shop in Bangkok?

507
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,760
I'll buy you a new dress.

508
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,760
Do you know how much this dress costs?

509
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,480
Her selling meal boxes for a month
might not even cover it.

510
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,240
Anyhow,

511
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,200
I appreciate your offer.

512
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,840
I heard Mrs. Arada
is going to open a branch in Chiang Rai.

513
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,960
I was hoping to get a new dress.

514
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,320
Mom, with all the clothes in your closet,

515
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,560
you could wear
a different one every day for two months.

516
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,400
What does it matter to you?

517
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,240
I could change three times a day
and it would be none of your concern.

518
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,560
If it's what makes me happy,
how is it any of your business?

519
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,640
Your job is to do the laundry. So do it.

520
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,400
Your opinion is not needed. Save it.

521
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,000
Mom.

522
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,960
What now?

523
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,880
Before I leave for Lamphun for work,

524
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,200
I'll give you money to order a new dress.

525
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,440
Really?

526
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,840
That's awesome. I'll pick the design
that I like in the meantime.

527
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,000
As for you, you'll go to Arada Boutique
to order me this new dress.

528
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,640
I'm feeling a bit better now.

529
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,800
What a relief. His car isn't here.

530
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,280
TAI, PLEASE DELIVER THE MEAL BOXES
FOR ME. SOI 8, NO. 35. PORAMES.

531
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,080
"Please deliver the meal boxes for me.
Soi 8, no. 35. Porames."

532
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,840
Damn. What a hassle.

533
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,920
House no. 35.

534
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,480
Put it down for a bit. It's so heavy.

535
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,080
Don't lift too high. It's heavy.

536
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,320
Ouch, it hurts.

537
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,840
Got it.

538
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,920
My knees hurt.

539
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,160
Slowly. Take it slowly.

540
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,360
Hey.

541
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,280
Sorry for interrupting.

542
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,600
Here's your meal delivery, Dr. Mes.

543
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,640
Thank you, Tai. Please leave it there.

544
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,000
Are you doing meal delivery
for the whole district or what?

545
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,120
Sarge.

546
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,360
What are you still doing here? Go home.

547
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,160
Why stay and be a third wheel?

548
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,400
I'm not a wheel.

549
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,920
You're at it again.

550
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,120
Hey.

551
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,400
Stop making false assumptions, will you?

552
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,680
Aren't you skittish?

553
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,000
I can't be bothered to correct
false rumors. It's a waste of time.

554
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,720
Don't be shy.

555
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,520
Love shouldn't be confined by gender.
I'm progressive, so I'm open to it.

556
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,280
If you keep making a false claim about me,

557
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,560
I will speak out about us.

558
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,200
So we have a deal.

559
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,160
If you keep quiet,

560
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,240
my lips are sealed.

561
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,720
Fine. Whatever.

562
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,640
From now on, you stay clear of me.
We are two strangers.

563
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,880
We end things here.

564
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,600
I still want to be your friend.

565
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,720
I don't want to be yours.

566
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,640
Out of my way.

567
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,120
Or I'll run you over.

568
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,400
Why don't you move?

569
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,240
I'm running you over.

570
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,440
Do you want to get run over?

571
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,400
Well? Get out of the way.

572
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,720
Hello.

573
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,080
Your friend is seriously annoying.

574
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,920
Does he know that I'm in the area?

575
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,120
I didn't get to bring it up.

576
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,240
But Mom must have already told Lady Umpai.

577
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,960
I'll find a chance to surprise him.

578
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,160
Keep this a secret from him.

579
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,720
I can't help but wonder

580
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,400
when Mom became so close to Lady Umpai.

581
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,760
So much so that they are
playing matchmakers.

582
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,000
They must be awfully close.

583
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,680
From what Mom told me,

584
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,400
it was after she married Dad
and started her nursing degree.

585
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,800
She has been working
at a public hospital since.

586
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,640
Lady Umpai is the hospital's benefactor.

587
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,120
They must have bumped into
each other at a fundraising event.

588
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,480
I'll talk to you later.
I have an emergency case.

589
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,040
Pon?

590
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,840
Both of his legs are broken.

591
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,480
Thankfully, he can breathe on his own.

592
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,360
Possible cause?

593
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,840
He must have fallen from a high place.

594
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,440
Pon himself was hanging
on a tree off a cliff.

595
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,040
The state of his left leg
is rather worrying.

596
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,440
What about it?

597
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,400
The main artery got severed
and the bones were shattered entirely.

598
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,960
Once the bleeding was stopped,
he was brought here immediately.

599
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,880
-Is the blood ready?
-Ready.

600
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,680
Let's do it.

601
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,000
We'll work on this case together.

602
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,280
I got it.

603
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,400
When I leave for the catering job,
you should get Maiseek and Sumlee to help.

604
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,480
I suggest you give them a raise.

605
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,120
But only as much as you can afford.

606
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,760
That's the 100th time you've said it.

607
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,000
Who's here at this time of the night?

608
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,920
I'll go check, Mom.

609
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,760
Kong, don't forget to deposit the money
in the bank for me tomorrow.

610
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,960
Yes, Mom.

611
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,800
Who is it?

612
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,600
It's Maiseek.

613
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,920
I'm going down to find out why he's here.

614
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,880
Stop.

615
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,560
Put on your hat.

616
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,320
Your hair is down. Are you trying
to attract that guy's attention?

617
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,600
The guy is Maiseek, Mom.

618
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,400
It doesn't matter if he's Maiseek.

619
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,240
He's a guy,
he can't control his instincts.

620
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,800
He can't be trusted.

621
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,840
Put your hat on.

622
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,480
-Okay.
-Do it.

623
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,560
Put your hair up. Don't let it show.

624
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,560
-I got it.
-Not a single strand. Cover it up.

625
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,000
Put it up.

626
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,040
-Right here.
-I'm gathering it, Mom.

627
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,040
Jeez.

628
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,760
Don't let it fall.

629
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,000
Hey, Maiseek.

630
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,400
What brings you here so late?

631
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,640
Hunter Boon…

632
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,600
is dead.

633
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,320
Pon is heavily injured.

634
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,840
He's in the operating room right now.

635
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,600
It's okay.

636
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,760
No one can escape sickness and death.

637
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,960
My heart aches for Uncle Boon and Pon.

638
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,440
Hey.

639
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,320
What are you two doing here?

640
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,480
What are you doing?

641
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,040
No answer.

642
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,840
-Mom.
-What is it?

643
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,640
Maiseek just came to ask
for some chili and fish sauce.

644
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,760
They are having a drinking party for sure.

645
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:08,120
If he wasn't working for us,

646
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,760
I'd have chased him away long ago.

647
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,520
I hate his guts.

648
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,960
Kwan, if you're sleepy,
why don't you go to bed?

649
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,160
Okay.

650
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,960
-Mom.
-What is it?

651
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,040
I should go to bed.

652
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,520
Do what you want.

653
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,240
Get on with it.

654
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,360
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

655
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,920
This way, please, Dr. Chat.

656
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,360
If Pon had come to us sooner,

657
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,760
his condition wouldn't be this bad.

658
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,040
His injuries are severe and there are
depressed fractures on the skull.

659
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,200
Do you think he'll pull through?

660
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,320
He definitely will. We did our best.

661
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,960
What I don't understand is
how Pon got thrown off a cliff.

662
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,400
Doctor.

663
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,960
What's the matter?

664
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:12,080
Dear God, please keep Pon safe.

665
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,280
Boon.

666
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,080
How could you leave me like this?

667
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,920
Who will stay by my side now?

668
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,200
Tai.

669
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,440
Your uncle is dead.

670
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,840
I'm sorry for your loss.

671
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,680
I'm the doctor in charge of Pon.

672
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,320
Pon…

673
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,960
How is he?

674
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,400
He's stable.

675
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,920
We need to monitor him closely.

676
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,840
His left leg suffered heavy injuries.

677
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,320
There was a lot of dead tissue.

678
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,480
We had no option but to
amputate his left leg.

679
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,960
-Kong.
-Kwan.

680
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,600
Kong.

681
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,800
Kong.

682
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,360
Uncle Boon is dead.

683
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,040
They amputated Pon's left leg.

684
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,120
Kwan.

685
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,360
Don't overthink it.

686
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,720
Let's wait until Pon is released
from the hospital

687
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,200
and we'll come up with something.

688
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,800
I don't believe

689
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,680
that seasoned hunters
like Uncle Boon and Pon

690
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,200
would accidentally fall off a cliff.

691
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,240
They could find a way out of the forest
with a blindfold on, I'm telling you.

692
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,960
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

693
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,800
I feel so sorry for Chalam and Nuch.

694
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,240
How will they make a living?

695
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,040
This shouldn't have happened.

696
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,040
If Pon's leg was really amputated,
as you said,

697
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,600
he won't be able to hunt wild animals
or forage for plants to sell.

698
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:01,520
Kong and I have been thinking
of ways to help out the family.

699
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,440
My worry is that things won't end here.

700
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,360
I heard from people in the mountains

701
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,680
that Hunter Boon and Pon
saw something they shouldn't see.

702
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,520
What was it?
Illegal logging or drug trafficking?

703
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,960
It's not our concern. Stay out of it.

704
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,680
Better pretend we don't know a thing.

705
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,880
Kong is right.

706
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,680
Those mountains have an owner.

707
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,160
Kong,

708
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,640
are we just going to make peace with
Uncle Boon's death and Pon's amputation

709
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,680
without
bringing the perpetrators to justice?

710
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,240
What can you do to them?

711
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,480
People in uniform are on their side.

712
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,880
Tai has been an informant for the police

713
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,160
to help them drive away drug traffickers.

714
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,360
Have you ever thought that Kwan might
just be a pawn in their publicity stunt?

715
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,800
Otherwise,
she wouldn't have lived to this day

716
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,680
with how
she's constantly getting in their way.

717
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,360
I'm confused.

718
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,720
Give me one night to think it over
and I'll explain it.

719
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,560
I forbid you. Don't get involved in this.

720
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,160
Also, don't forget to place
Mom's order at Arada.

721
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,520
She kept reminding me this morning.

722
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,160
If you don't get it done,
she'll go on about it until nightfall.

723
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,280
Let's go.

724
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,360
I'm going home to fetch Mom's order.

725
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,920
I'm going to wash up and get changed.

726
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,320
I'm going with you.

727
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,920
-I want to change into something cool.
-Let's go.

728
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,200
Pon was incredibly lucky
to get stuck on a branch,

729
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,040
or he wouldn't have made it.

730
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,600
He was a tenacious fighter

731
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,640
to have made it out alive
despite such heavy blood loss.

732
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,280
Who rescued him?

733
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,440
People who live in the mountains.
They heard a cry for help.

734
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:14,960
They notified the border patrol, who then
got in contact with the military camp.

735
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,600
Do the police have any clue
on who attacked Pon?

736
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,640
We don't know yet.

737
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,040
We are carrying out an investigation
and gathering evidence.

738
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,120
In your opinion,
is Mr. Pon fit for interrogation?

739
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,680
I don't think so.
He has yet to regain consciousness.

740
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,040
When he's awake,
I'll ask an officer to notify you.

741
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,880
Thank you.

742
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:46,400
We're lucky to have such
a capable doctor like you stationed here.

743
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,960
It's an honor to have been stationed here.

744
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,320
We'll be seeing each other around.

745
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,680
It has been a pleasure meeting you.

746
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:14,400
I wonder if you have misgivings
about Park, Mrs. Krongkaew.

747
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,760
As you're well aware,

748
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,200
my family has always been
under scrutiny by the press.

749
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,080
Not at all.
I'm aware of Park's kind nature.

750
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,320
I've seen him growing up.

751
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,480
Park is Chat's close friend.

752
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:35,080
As for Kej though, she spent
an amount of time studying abroad.

753
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,760
So she's rather progressive, I must say.

754
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:43,840
I'm afraid my daughter would be upset
about us trying to set her up.

755
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,120
They don't need to find out.

756
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,040
We'll keep it between the two of us.

757
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:56,560
My belief is that only partners who love
each other will stay together as a family.

758
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,920
I'd prefer Kej to find a partner
of her own choosing.

759
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,640
You needn't worry about that.

760
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,840
I'm only asking for a chance.

761
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,000
The rest is up to destiny.

762
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,720
Then let's give that a try.
I'll be cheering you on.

763
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,680
Hearing you say that puts me at ease.

764
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:26,800
I asked Park to bring the documents
that you gave me in the shop to Kej.

765
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,800
Yesterday, I deliberately forgot
to bring them with me.

766
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,280
This will be another chance
for them to meet.

767
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,560
I see.

768
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,000
What are you two strutting about?

769
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,440
The strut sure annoys me.

770
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,880
Come on, Tai.

771
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,920
We don't get to come
to the market that often.

772
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,280
With our cool outfits on,
we can't help but act dope.

773
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,920
Very cool indeed.

774
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,560
So cool that I want to hand you bananas.

775
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,800
-I'm not an elephant.
-I'm not a monkey.

776
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,560
-We were parroting.
-Yes, we were.

777
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,480
Wait here. I'll be right back.

778
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,000
-I got it.
-I got it.

779
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,400
Hi, babe.

780
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,600
Let's not walk together.
I'm scared of you.

781
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,520
Maiseek, aren't you dapper?

782
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,920
Of course, I am dapper.

783
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,800
-What about me?
-Why, you're dapper.

784
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,680
-Let's find ourselves some ladies.
-Let's go.

785
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,680
Marching on!

786
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,400
I thought you wouldn't be able to come.

787
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,480
I almost couldn't make it.

788
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,440
I had an emergency operation last night.
I only got a few hours of shuteye.

789
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,120
This is such a beautiful dress.

790
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,120
I do think that

791
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,120
if you were the maker, the dress
would have come out even better.

792
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,640
Mr. Chat, you're the best.

793
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,680
Let go of me.

794
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,520
I just want to talk

795
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,080
to clear things up between us.

796
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,160
I've told you
I don't want to be your friend.

797
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,480
Will you stop pestering me?

798
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,040
Hello.

799
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,880
Hello.

800
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,920
Heaven sent us our Noppamas contestant.

801
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,200
Whoa, you should watch out for playboys.

802
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,400
This line clearly suggests
there's one around you now.

803
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,680
Are you here to order a dress?

804
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,520
Ms. Kej.

805
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,800
Keep a close eye on him

806
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,160
in case Pon tips him off.

807
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,640
Yes, sir.

808
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,600
I'm here to visit you.

809
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,880
