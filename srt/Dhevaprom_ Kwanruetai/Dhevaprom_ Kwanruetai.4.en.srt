1
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,920
Hello.

2
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Hello.

3
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,800
Heaven sent us our Noppamas contestant.

4
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,840
Pretty enough to be
this year's Miss Noppamas?

5
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,360
-You're joining the Miss Noppamas Contest?
-Of course.

6
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,960
See you later, beautiful.

7
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,800
Whoa, you should watch out for playboys.

8
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,000
This line clearly suggests
there's one around you now.

9
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,280
Are you here to order a dress?

10
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,120
Ms. Kej.

11
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,720
Pon woke up, sir.

12
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,880
The extent of his brain injury
is still unclear though.

13
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,520
As long as he's still alive,

14
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,320
I don't trust this situation.

15
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,840
-Fon.
-The path is clear. Put this on.

16
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,840
I'm here to visit you.

17
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,440
Why are you back so quickly?

18
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,720
Dr. Chat is on his way up here.
I didn't even get to have my shaved ice.

19
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,200
I need to get the patients' files
ready for him.

20
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,240
Where are they?

21
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,080
Shoot.

22
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry, Pon.
I can't make out what you're saying.

23
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,600
Why don't you get some rest?

24
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,720
I'll come back some other time.

25
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,400
Tai, hurry. Dr. Chat is on his way.

26
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,120
Pon, I'm going now.

27
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,600
I'll be back later.

28
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,400
I'll come back to see you later.

29
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,960
Let's go.

30
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,800
-Let's split here.
-Okay. I'm leaving.

31
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,240
Your house might only be a short distance,

32
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,560
but there could be a reason
you have to go home late.

33
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,760
Take today, for example, the customers
turned up just before closing time.

34
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,160
Driving to work is safer.

35
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,640
You are a woman.

36
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,760
What's more,
you tend to dress provocatively.

37
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,080
This is fashion.

38
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,800
Men see it differently.

39
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,600
Nagging old man.

40
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,520
What'd you say?

41
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,440
We've arrived.

42
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,800
Wait.

43
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,440
Here's my name card.

44
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,880
I didn't ask for it.

45
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,120
It doesn't matter. Keep it.

46
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,160
Should anything happen,
you'll know how to contact me.

47
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,400
I'm staying at a hotel near the company.

48
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
I'll be able to reach you
before Chat does.

49
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,440
Keep it. I'd rather not suffer
your brother's kicks.

50
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,840
I've completed my duty. I'm leaving.

51
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,520
PG ENGINEER CO., LTD.

52
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,600
Can you two help me sell the meal boxes?

53
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,600
For how many days though?

54
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,360
I'll give you a raise.

55
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,320
As many days as you want. I love selling.

56
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,240
Right. You love selling
all of a sudden, huh?

57
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,040
Why don't you do it yourself?

58
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,280
I have other errands to run.

59
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,280
What errands?

60
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,600
Do you want the money?

61
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,040
-Of course.
-Of course.

62
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,320
If you do, zip it.

63
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,280
-You keep asking questions.
-Kwan.

64
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,200
Is my dress ready?

65
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,960
Mom, I only just placed the order.

66
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,160
When will it be ready?

67
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,040
A week or two. When it's ready,
the shop will give me a call.

68
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,840
You go there today and hurry them along.

69
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Tell them to finish the dress before
Loy Krathong. I'm going to wear it.

70
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,800
Are you planning to go to
the Loy Krathong Festival, ma'am?

71
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,200
Are you looking for trouble?

72
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,280
Are you really going to the festival, Mom?

73
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,840
Why would you ask?

74
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,400
I'm going to dress up
and go to the festival nearby.

75
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,240
There's no way I'm going
to the festival in the town center.

76
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,080
The crowd and heat there will be insane.

77
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,760
Exactly. You shouldn't go there.
It will be sweltering hot.

78
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,920
You're easily irritated,
so you'd better not go.

79
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,680
All the festivals are the same.

80
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,560
Hold on.

81
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,000
Something is off.

82
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,640
Why are you talking
as if you'd rather I not go?

83
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,880
Not at all. That's not what I meant, Mom.

84
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,600
I'll head to the shop to rush your order.

85
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,840
Can you hold that?

86
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,280
You're acting strange today.

87
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,880
ARADA

88
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,560
Wow, stunning.

89
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,040
Wow.

90
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,120
Hello.

91
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,640
This dress is stunning.

92
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,040
Can I try it on?

93
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,480
You can't.

94
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,520
Why not?

95
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,640
The shop made this dress for our
Miss Noppamas contestant this year.

96
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,000
Have you found your contestant yet?

97
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,920
What are you doing here?

98
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,680
I'm ordering a dress for my mom.

99
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,080
Poor you. You must have worked for a month
to earn enough to pay for this dress.

100
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,240
A lower class with a high-end taste.

101
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,160
So, has the shop made their choice
regarding the contestant?

102
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,880
We have.

103
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,560
What a shame.

104
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,840
A beautiful dress that's not to be worn
by the winner of Miss Noppamas.

105
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,400
We also offer ready-made outfits
that are currently a big hit in Bangkok.

106
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,720
If you'll please come this way.

107
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,680
No, thanks.

108
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,120
Judging from your customer,

109
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
we're evidently not on the same level.

110
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,200
Kej,

111
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,120
did I just lose you a customer?

112
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,280
You can change your mind
about picking me as your contestant.

113
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't mind her.

114
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,480
We don't accept orders from just anybody.

115
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,520
Ms. Da would never agree
to make a dress for someone like her.

116
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,360
That kind of attitude

117
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,240
would make it tricky.

118
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,360
Let's practice walking
on stilettos, shall we?

119
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,880
-Here you go.
-What'd you like?

120
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,160
-Two Pad Thais.
-You got it. Here you go.

121
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,280
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

122
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,120
We have basil rice, fried pork with rice,
and stir-fried rice noodles.

123
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,640
Do you have fried rice today?

124
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Do we?

125
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
We don't.

126
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,560
Where's your boss lady?

127
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,920
Should we tell him?

128
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,320
Is Tai going to be pissed?

129
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,840
-You tell him.
-You tell him. He asked you.

130
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,720
-You tell him.
-He asked you. You tell him.

131
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,040
-Why does it have to be me?
-You tell him. He asked you.

132
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,800
-You tell him.
-He asked you.

133
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,520
Are you open for business?

134
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,640
Of course, beautiful.

135
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,960
What options do I have?

136
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,840
-So many.
-There's basil rice, fried pork--

137
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,120
Do you have angel food cake?

138
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,040
-We have it for you, beautiful.
-Since you're an angel.

139
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,120
Stand upright. Straighten your back.

140
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,560
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

141
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,800
Slow and steady.

142
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,720
Good.

143
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,920
Well done.

144
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,280
Straighten your core.

145
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,720
-Slow and steady.
-Okay.

146
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,480
Good.

147
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,520
Well done.

148
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,960
-Now, stop.
-Okay.

149
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,440
Turn around and pose.

150
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,880
Turn around slowly.

151
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,200
Are you all right?

152
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,640
Slowly.

153
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,680
Stand upright, then pose.
Remember what I taught you?

154
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,720
Let me show you.

155
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,200
There and here.

156
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,400
Straighten your back.

157
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,800
Be confident.

158
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Tell yourself you're gorgeous.

159
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,440
Slowly assume a pose.

160
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,960
Right.

161
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,520
Good. Straighten up.

162
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,920
Do you think you can handle this?

163
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,040
-What would you like?
-Right away.

164
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,960
We have food for sale.

165
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,760
Looking for Tai?

166
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,160
No.

167
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
What are we having? Lead the way.

168
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,760
Let's go.

169
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,040
Are you done?

170
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,800
Stay still. I'm almost done.

171
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,120
What's taking so long? My shoulders
are aching from sitting too long.

172
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,800
Sit comfortably. Don't tense up.

173
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,560
Oh my.

174
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,480
It's as if she's a different person.

175
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,960
I wouldn't have recognized her.

176
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,080
Really? You wouldn't recognize me?

177
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
You look very different.

178
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,720
Can I see myself in the mirror, please?

179
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,880
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

180
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
What would you like?

181
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,280
Right away. Here.

182
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,760
Here you go.

183
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,520
Thank you.

184
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,840
This one is a free gift.

185
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,120
What would you like to have?

186
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,800
Where has Tai got to?

187
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,120
-You can pay later.
-Doctor.

188
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,400
I came to check on Pon's recovery.

189
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,960
I went on patrol today.

190
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,440
I heard the hill tribe people saying

191
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,960
Hunter Boon and Pon were silenced.

192
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,120
It probably wasn't an accident.

193
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,320
Do they know who did it?

194
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,120
Probably drug dealers.

195
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,760
Those two must have seen something.

196
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,440
They fear Pon might be targeted too.

197
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,040
This is a network of very powerful people.

198
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,760
We can't trust anyone.

199
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,680
He woke up.
His condition remains unstable.

200
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,600
He's still in the ICU.

201
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,800
For now, I'm not allowing visitors.

202
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,360
Can I interrogate him?

203
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,040
He's still not able to speak clearly.

204
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,560
His throat is damaged from the intubation.

205
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,080
When his condition improves,
I'll refer him for a brain evaluation.

206
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,760
I can't say for certain
how badly damaged it is.

207
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,520
Did the patient mention anything to you?

208
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,320
Every time I checked on him,
he was asleep.

209
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,240
As I said, he's not able to speak clearly.

210
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,720
Thank you, Doctor.

211
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,680
I'll be dropping by regularly for updates.

212
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,560
I hope I won't be a bother.

213
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,000
You won't. We're both doing our duty.

214
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,040
Once the patient is fit for interrogation,
please let me know.

215
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,760
I will.

216
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,120
I'll be going now.

217
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,680
ARADA

218
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,880
Good.

219
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,520
Chin up.

220
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,520
Tell yourself you're gorgeous.

221
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,119
Everyone is looking at you.

222
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,520
Then stop.

223
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,120
Hand on waist.

224
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,840
Turn around to pose.

225
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,080
Kwan, are you hurt?

226
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,040
Kej, please don't tell
your boyfriend that I'm here.

227
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,280
Boyfriend?

228
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,840
Sorry, I'm late.

229
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,960
Are you hungry?

230
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,600
A little.

231
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,160
Someone actually mistook us for lovers.

232
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,480
Are you…

233
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,960
alone?

234
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,040
I'm with…

235
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,560
Pilai.

236
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Why are you back here?

237
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,960
Please lower your voice.

238
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,680
Why are we speaking in a whisper?

239
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,920
Ms. Kej's boyfriend is here.

240
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,640
He's a doctor at the army hospital.

241
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,680
I don't want him to know
about my contest debut.

242
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,720
A doctor at the army hospital?

243
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,800
Do you mean Mr. Chat?

244
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,240
That's him.

245
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,560
He's not her boyfriend.

246
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,680
He's her older brother.

247
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,600
Older brother?

248
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,160
Let's get going, shall we?

249
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,400
Let's go see Park first.

250
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,520
Why are we going to see him?

251
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,400
Since I drove here,

252
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,840
I should spend time
with both my friend and my sister.

253
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,160
Two birds, one stone.

254
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,520
Don't think for a second
that I'm falling for it.

255
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,520
This is Mom's order, isn't it?

256
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,120
Hello, Mr. Chat.

257
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,200
You came to see your sister, yes?

258
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,240
I wish I had an older brother too.

259
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,400
Why would you want a meddlesome brother?

260
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,600
Who are you badmouthing?

261
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,200
If you don't want him,
feel free to give him to me.

262
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,960
I'm afraid you'd rush to return him
in less than a day.

263
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Shall we go?

264
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,120
I'll be taking your manager out for lunch.

265
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,120
By all means.

266
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,640
If you happen to want an extra,
I'm always happy to tag along.

267
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,120
-I'll bring back desserts.
-Thank you.

268
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
Let's go.

269
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,480
What a catch.
I shouldn't have married so young.

270
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,760
I sure hope that
Ms. Kej keeps her promise.

271
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,200
Who is your contestant?

272
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,560
It can't be yourself?

273
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,200
Do you not know your own sister?

274
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,880
I assure you, she's a unique beauty.

275
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,640
I'll introduce her to you sometime.

276
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,400
No need.

277
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,800
Why not? You're playing my matchmaker.

278
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,520
Why can't I return the favor?

279
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,640
Don't even think about it. No, thanks.

280
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,880
This young lady is cute.
How about a younger model?

281
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,080
-You have my full support.
-That's inappropriate.

282
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,480
She's too young for me, thank you.

283
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,200
You're considering it, aren't you?

284
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
I'm not.

285
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,360
I wouldn't dare.

286
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,080
Perhaps you have a young lady
tucked away at your residence?

287
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,200
Are you trying to send me to jail?

288
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,160
Where is Park's company? Are we there yet?

289
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,720
Over there. I'm not going in though.

290
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,520
Chat!

291
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,800
Luxurious decor you've got here.

292
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,400
My company does interior design,
so we can't be looking cheap, can't we?

293
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,960
When a customer comes in,
we strive to impress.

294
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,960
Are we done with the compliments?

295
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,680
I'm an employee, not the owner

296
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,800
who could take as long
a lunch break as he wants.

297
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,960
You know where I am.

298
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,160
Come alone next time
so we can have our chat

299
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,680
without imposing on someone.

300
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,560
How about we split here then?

301
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,600
Wait, I'm coming with you.

302
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,560
Let me treat you to lunch.

303
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,880
Park, I have a favor to ask you.

304
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,840
-What is it?
-Can you pick Kej up on Loy Krathong?

305
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,840
I was planning to go
with her to the festival,

306
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,720
but I'm on shift that day,
so it'll be quite late before I can leave.

307
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,040
I'll be going with the people
from the boutique, so I'll be fine.

308
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,360
The festival is at night.
I worry for your safety.

309
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,320
I'll leave her to you.

310
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,600
My pleasure.

311
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,640
You're a doctor. Isn't your schedule
supposed to be packed?

312
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,360
How come you're working
as a matchmaker on the side?

313
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,440
Hey, Mr. Chat.

314
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,480
I figured you were out with a girl
and forgot about me.

315
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,160
Why don't you bring
your girlfriend sometime?

316
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,360
Girlfriend?

317
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,000
What girlfriend?

318
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,000
The woman was my sister, Kej.

319
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,280
I see. A sister?

320
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,640
I've been mistaken all this time.

321
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,560
Let's start.

322
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,720
This way.

323
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,400
Are you not running?

324
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,400
Is the meal delivery late today?

325
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,480
Tai is always late these days.

326
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,200
I thought you were waiting
for me to run with you,

327
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,560
but you were actually waiting for Tai.

328
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,000
Mes.

329
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,360
Speak of the devil.

330
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,800
Tai, someone's waiting to see you.

331
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,920
I'm leaving.

332
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,480
I don't want to interrupt the date.

333
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,280
Tai, I have an important matter
to discuss with you.

334
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,360
I have nothing to discuss with you.

335
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,480
Do you really think I didn't see you?

336
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,920
What are you talking about?

337
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,960
Were you visiting Pon?

338
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,600
I thought Mr. Chat ordered no visitors.

339
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,080
Can we talk?

340
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,720
Of course.

341
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,480
Not me.

342
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,480
I'll bring the third wheel--

343
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,800
I mean, the containers inside.

344
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,320
I have no clue what you might
have heard from the others,

345
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,800
but as a doctor in charge
of Pon's treatment,

346
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,640
I assure you Pon's condition
is no longer critical.

347
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,360
The damage to the brain is minimal.

348
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,120
Why do the nurses say
that Pon has trouble remembering?

349
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,040
I have a reason for making that claim.

350
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,800
It's for the patient's safety.

351
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
What did you hear?

352
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,200
I received a tip-off

353
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,240
that the two hunters were silenced.

354
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,160
They saw something they shouldn't.

355
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,400
I'm certain that Mr. Songpol
had a hand in this matter.

356
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,880
Mr. Songpol?

357
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,440
You might not believe
what this nobody is telling you,

358
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,760
no one else does,

359
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,840
but I know that Mr. Songpol
is part of the drug trafficking ring

360
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,680
by the name of Red Dragon.

361
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,240
I might not have any proof
to back up my claim,

362
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,840
but I'm sure of it.

363
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,160
Pon will be the key witness
to take them down.

364
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,600
Since you know, you should stop
dropping by to see him.

365
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,560
Do you understand?

366
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,160
You have some trouble
with those drug dealers, right?

367
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,200
If they find out you visited Pon,

368
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,960
they might cause problems for you.

369
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,280
That's all I came to say.

370
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,960
You need to be careful too.

371
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,600
They will most likely be vigilant
against Pon tipping you off.

372
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,760
Thank you for your concern.

373
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,320
I simply don't want Pon to be
deprived of his doctor.

374
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,600
When will you start my meal delivery?

375
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,360
Aren't you persistent?

376
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,280
After Loy Krathong.

377
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,880
You can choose to wait
or find another seller.

378
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,880
I can wait.

379
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
I've become addicted to your cooking.

380
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,720
The other sellers' cooking
doesn't compare.

381
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,480
Fine. Only if I haven't forgotten by then.

382
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,400
Ms. Arada is as talented as ever.

383
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
Exquisite.

384
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,240
Maiseek.

385
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,560
Can you keep Mom company tonight?

386
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,480
But, Tai,
there's the Loy Krathong Festival tonight.

387
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,760
Obviously.

388
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,760
We're making Krathongs
for sale right now. Why wouldn't I know?

389
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,760
Do you have a plan?

390
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,320
I have work to do for Ms. Arada.

391
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,840
Unfortunately, Kong isn't home.

392
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,840
I don't want to leave Mom by herself.

393
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,720
Please, boss lady. My heart can't help
but yearn for some fun and games.

394
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,360
I'll give you 500.

395
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,040
-500?
-500?

396
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,760
The festival comes around
every year anyway.

397
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,080
I'm also available.

398
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,560
You two are greedy, aren't you?

399
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,280
What do you call yourself
working for Ms. Arada then?

400
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,640
Is that not greedy?

401
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,600
Don't parrot me.

402
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,920
-Have mercy.
-I didn't say anything.

403
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,640
Yes or no? I can retract my offer.

404
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,680
Please take it easy.

405
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,840
I'll do it.

406
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,320
I'll be feasting my eyes
on the contestants on your behalf.

407
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,080
That's my boy.

408
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,520
Where will you be checking them out?

409
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,600
Mali Brand Milk

410
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,240
Thick and white
Sweet and smooth

411
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,960
Mali Brand Milk

412
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,600
Oh so fresh

413
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,520
-Does anyone want a Krathong?
-I'll have one, please.

414
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,400
-That's 20 baht.
-Here, this one is big.

415
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,440
-That one?
-Here you go.

416
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,840
Can you two manage for a bit?
I need to pee. Be right back.

417
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
-No problem.
-Sure.

418
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,080
-We have beautiful Krathongs.
-Which one? Which price do you prefer?

419
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
Not a problem.

420
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,880
Hi, Nate.

421
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,600
-Have you eaten?
-What did Tai bring today?

422
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,080
-She only brought Krathongs.
-What?

423
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,240
You'll have to go out to buy lunch.
Or do you want me to get you some?

424
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,840
No, thanks. I'll go and have a look.

425
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,440
-Cover for me?
-Sure.

426
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,600
Pon can speak now. The path is clear.
Hurry up. Dr. Chat is on his way.

427
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,160
Pon.

428
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,440
Pon.

429
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,640
Pon.

430
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,040
Tai…

431
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,880
What happened?

432
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,040
Nate, why are you back so quickly?

433
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,360
I forgot to take my purse.

434
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,840
The patient in bed A4
has run out of saline.

435
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,560
Oh my.

436
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,400
We're dead.

437
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,800
Pon.

438
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,240
Did you and Uncle Boon know who they were?

439
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,360
-They--
-Tai.

440
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,160
The doctor said no visitors are allowed.
How did you get in here?

441
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,080
You let her in, didn't you?

442
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,440
I don't know anything.

443
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,679
I came in by myself.

444
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,320
I'm sorry. I wasn't aware that
no visitors were allowed.

445
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,639
I'll get going now.

446
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,320
You're not allowed to leave.

447
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,920
What's going on?

448
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,600
I forbid everyone from spreading the word
about Tai's visiting Pon.

449
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,840
Otherwise, all of us will be in trouble.

450
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,440
Pon is the police's key witness.

451
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
He didn't say anything though.

452
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,040
When I went in, Pon was sleeping.

453
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,080
Nate came in the moment he woke up.

454
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
That was all.

455
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,240
Do you think the police will believe that?

456
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,680
All of us will be interrogated.

457
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,960
I can't say for sure
what the consequences will be for us.

458
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,520
If the four of us don't say a word

459
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,640
and Pon doesn't say a word,

460
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,440
things will end here.

461
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,080
Hunter Pon can speak now, Sak.

462
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,840
-Since when?
-A moment ago.

463
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,680
I think his memory
is gradually coming back.

464
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,160
Other than yourself,
did anyone else speak to him?

465
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,440
Didn't I tell you not to visit Pon?

466
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,280
I'm worried about him.

467
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,480
Worry about yourself first.

468
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,400
What did he say to you?

469
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,920
Pon was about to say something,
but then all of you showed up.

470
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,440
I hope that what happened today
won't reach them somehow.

471
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,320
Is that it? I'm leaving.

472
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,240
Wait.

473
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,080
Are you going to the festival tonight?

474
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,920
Why are you asking?

475
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,480
I'm going with a friend.

476
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,360
It would be nice to be shown around.

477
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,200
I won't be going.

478
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,680
I don't like crowds.
I'd rather laze around at home.

479
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,680
What did he say to you?

480
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,440
Pon.

481
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,120
Did you and Uncle Boon know who they were?

482
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,760
The Red Dragon gang.

483
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,280
Mr. Songpol and Inspector Pichai.

484
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,320
-Hey!
-Let's go.

485
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
Follow them!

486
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,720
Pon, faster!

487
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,240
Dad!

488
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,600
After them!

489
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,920
Let's go.

490
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,680
Are you okay, Dad? We must hurry.

491
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,320
Dad! Are you okay?

492
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,440
Dad!

493
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,080
Dad.

494
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,080
Pon, run quickly.

495
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Don't let them see your face.

496
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,240
Go now. Don't worry about me.

497
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,400
No! You're coming with me!

498
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,760
-Please get up, Dad.
-Go! Go now!

499
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,080
-You two, go after him.
-Got it.

500
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,400
You can't escape.

501
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,760
Is my Krathong finished?

502
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,800
I'm working on it.

503
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,000
How much did you make on the Krathongs?

504
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,240
Only this much?

505
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,240
There's some remaining.
Maiseek and Sumlee are still selling them.

506
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,440
Mom.

507
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,640
I asked Maiseek to take you
to the festival tonight.

508
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,920
What?

509
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,160
Why aren't you coming with me?

510
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,240
I have work to do for Ms. Arada.

511
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,400
She's paying me 1,000 baht, Mom.

512
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,800
I'll give you half.

513
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,480
Thank you.

514
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,560
Speaking of which,

515
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,040
you working for Ms. Arada
is not a bad idea.

516
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,080
Once you've gotten close to her,
she might give me a discount.

517
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,640
I should go back to finish your Krathong.

518
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,800
Listen.

519
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,760
My makeup and hairdo should be the focus.

520
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,480
So don't put too many accessories
on my Krathong. Do you hear me?

521
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,080
-Loud and clear.
-It shouldn't overshadow me.

522
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,520
Got it.

523
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,040
Are you bringing the Krathong
to your card game venue?

524
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,200
Don't tease me like that.

525
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,080
Are you really not coming with me
to the Miss Noppamas Contest?

526
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,160
My, my. You can save the courtesy.

527
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,440
You surely want to be by yourself to
check out the girls without me in the way.

528
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,520
What makes you think that?

529
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,920
If today weren't Mrs. Sinee's birthday,

530
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,400
I wouldn't so easily
let you out of my sight.

531
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,320
Actually, I should contribute
to Mrs. Sinee's birthday party.

532
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,560
Thank you.

533
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,920
Boss, Pon regained his speech.

534
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,440
Our mole said his memory
might have returned.

535
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,600
Did he speak to anyone?

536
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
Not yet.

537
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,880
I had someone keep an eye on him.
They'll notify us if anything happens.

538
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,880
The night of Loy Krathong
is the perfect time.

539
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,560
Don't let Pon live past tonight.

540
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,600
I'll deal with him right away, sir.

541
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,160
I've been waiting for ages.

542
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
You volunteered. Nothing I can do.

543
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,000
Are you a contestant yourself?

544
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,040
No, I don't want the title.

545
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,520
Nom, are you done? The car is here.

546
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,040
Nom, take the front seat.

547
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,480
-Is that appropriate, Miss?
-Do you want to go or not?

548
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,000
-Yes, I do.
-Good.

549
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,280
Excuse me.

550
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,400
Excuse me, can I please close the door?

551
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,200
Am I your driver?

552
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,160
If I'm not the driver,
I usually sit in the back.

553
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,040
It's what I'm used to.

554
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:11,000
CHIANG RAI YI PENG FESTIVAL

555
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,640
Hey, isn't that Tai's mother?

556
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,720
You're right. Look at her.
She looks so young and beautiful.

557
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,680
I mean, she could be a beauty queen.

558
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,840
-So beautiful.
-I'm way prettier.

559
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,560
I'll release my Krathong here.
Not many people around.

560
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,440
As we were walking, I heard so many people
complimenting your beauty.

561
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,720
So why would you pick this spot
with barely anyone around?

562
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,800
I heard them.

563
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,480
I want to do it here.

564
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:09,960
Okay.

565
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,200
After releasing the Krathong,
do you want to head home right away?

566
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,280
I'm going back.
What's the point of staying?

567
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,200
You're all dressed up.

568
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,320
The dress isn't cheap either.
It has been less than 15 minutes.

569
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,560
In my opinion,
you haven't got your money's worth.

570
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,360
If I were you, I'd do a few rounds

571
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,880
and dazzle all the young
and old guys in this town.

572
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,200
You're exaggerating.

573
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,480
I'm not young anymore.
Nobody will be looking.

574
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,480
No. You're still very beautiful.

575
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,800
Even I couldn't help
but sneak a glance at you.

576
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,200
-You're overstepping.
-My apologies.

577
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,200
But really, you should.

578
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,320
I heard quite a few big names
are making an appearance tonight.

579
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,040
The Miss Noppamas Contest will be
taking place on that stage over there.

580
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,280
Are you sure you're not going?

581
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,080
Since it's still early,
I could take a walk.

582
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,960
Festival, here I come!

583
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,960
Are you coming? I might change my mind.

584
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,120
Coming.

585
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,920
CHIANG RAI YI PENG FESTIVAL

586
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,080
I'll happily be your campaigner
in the next election.

587
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,160
I'll ensure a high turnout.
You'll definitely win.

588
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,360
-No worries. We're good friends.
-Thank you, sir.

589
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,200
Stay here to watch.
There are over ten contestants.

590
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,840
All of them will be beautiful.

591
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,760
You must be one of the judges.

592
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,760
I hope you enjoy the contest.

593
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,840
There's quite a lot of contestants.

594
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,400
-Please.
-Sir.

595
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,320
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.

596
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,080
I heard your daughter is a contestant.

597
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,000
Her name is Mali.

598
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,200
Please vote for her. She's number eight.

599
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,440
Your daughter is a beauty.

600
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,920
The title of Miss Noppamas
will surely go to her.

601
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,000
Aren't you just being polite?

602
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,960
-Thank you, sir.
-You're welcome.

603
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,160
-Number eight, sir.
-Don't worry.

604
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,680
By the way,

605
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,080
do you happen
to be this year's contestant?

606
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,880
Oh, my. Good evening, sir.

607
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,120
-Good evening.
-Good evening, sir.

608
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:10,800
Please don't tease me, sir.
I don't have much confidence.

609
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,760
This is you not feeling confident?

610
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,920
You're all dolled up today.

611
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,440
Please, sir.

612
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,520
Please spare me the teasing.

613
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,400
Today, I came
as the hospital's representative.

614
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,520
So I couldn't let the others
outshine me completely.

615
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,640
Excuse me, I need to sit down.

616
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,520
Go ahead.

617
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,080
What a representative she is.

618
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,400
You should get ready for a photograph
with your daughter on the stage later.

619
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,240
-I'm truly grateful, sir.
-No worries.

620
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,800
Hello…

621
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,840
My daughter is such a stunner.

622
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,280
Don't you think the costume
is a tad too modest?

623
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,120
This is the traditional
Miss Noppamas Contest.

624
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,520
Ergo, a Thai costume is in order.

625
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,960
-But my selling points aren't showing.
-Stop.

626
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,880
This is plenty.

627
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,960
You should prepare your thank-you
when given the winner's sash.

628
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,960
That's a certainty, Mom.

629
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:19,120
Arada Boutique is going to regret
their rejection of me.

630
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,280
Precisely.

631
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,440
By the way, is Dr. Chat going to be here?

632
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,200
I'm not sure about that.

633
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,120
Panadda is coming for sure.

634
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,960
Everyone else at the hospital
would have heard about it from her.

635
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,000
Where's Paew? Why isn't she here
with the blotting paper?

636
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,920
Paew!

637
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,360
At your service, Ms. Menie.

638
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,600
I was sneaking a look at the candidate
sent by Arada Boutique.

639
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,320
She's breathtaking.

640
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,200
Even prettier than me?

641
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,520
Why don't we go sneak a look?

642
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,000
What if she's prettier than me, Mom?

643
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,120
-You're right.
-What do you mean?

644
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,640
Anyhow, you'll be the winner for sure.

645
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,760
-Don't you agree?
-I agree.

646
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,640
-Let's touch up your makeup.
-Let's touch up.

647
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,640
-Have a seat.
-Touch up her face, please.

648
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,680
Let's shift the hair bun a little higher.

649
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,600
Higher is better.

650
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,480
You'll miss Loy Krathong then?

651
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,040
Fon will come earlier for a shift change.

652
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,080
She must be at the festival
with Dr. Mes as we're speaking.

653
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,520
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

654
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,240
ONE NEW MESSAGE

655
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,200
Checking out the contestants by the stage
while waiting for you. Come quickly.

656
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,080
Here it is. Where all the well-known
people from the town are gathered.

657
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,080
They are all here at this contest, ma'am.

658
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,960
Something is missing.

659
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,280
Sumlee! I'm going to look for Sumlee.
Please wait right here, ma'am.

660
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,600
-Enjoy the contest. I'll be back.
-Wait.

661
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,440
-I'll be quick. Where the heck is Sumlee?
-Hey, you!

662
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,040
Sumlee!

663
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,400
Those contestants.

664
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,920
So reward-hungry.

665
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,160
The judges are our people.

666
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,160
Is Dr. Chat here yet?

667
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,920
I haven't seen him.

668
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,480
I feel my motivation draining away.

669
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,080
Please relax. Keep up the motivation.

670
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,760
I'll go check one more time.

671
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,400
-Paew! Please keep her company.
-Yes?

672
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,120
-Yes, ma'am.
-Relax. I'll go check.

673
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,040
Please come sit. Let's do some touch-ups.

674
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,080
Kej,

675
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,440
I'm so nervous.

676
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,960
Don't be nervous. Ms. Arada is waiting
by the stage to cheer you on.

677
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,400
You're well-prepared for this.
You can do it.

678
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,400
If you have problems, come knock on
my door any time. You're always welcome.

679
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,040
-We will.
-Great.

680
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,760
Where did he go?

681
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,000
Mrs. Manee?

682
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,720
I'm Songpol.

683
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,800
We met at Kavee's office, do you remember?

684
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,720
That was ages ago. I don't remember.

685
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,240
I'm the owner
of the wood processing factory

686
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,840
to which Kavee supplied wood.

687
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,920
Are you starting to remember?

688
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:36,320
I own the land surrounding Kavee's.

689
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,800
The person who bought out all his land

690
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,040
was none other than me.

691
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,840
It's beginning to come back to me.

692
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,600
If we were to randomly pick
any land in this town,

693
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,400
I'd say there's a high chance it's mine.

694
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,720
Do you remember now?

695
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,880
Excuse me, sir.

696
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,760
The governor's wife is looking for you.
The contest is starting soon.

697
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,160
If you'll excuse me,
I have a duty as one of the judges.

698
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,200
Hopefully, we'll meet again.

699
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,600
Goodbye.

700
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,640
Good evening, everyone.

701
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:44,600
I'd like to welcome you to this year's
Yi Peng Festival in Chiang Rai.

702
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,640
It's a great pleasure to be a part
of the long-standing tradition

703
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,960
that is Loy Krathong.

704
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,840
Tonight's highlight that cannot be missed

705
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,960
-is the Miss Noppamas beauty contest,

-Chat!
-which is an annual event.

707
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,040
I'll now be introducing you
to our lovely contestants.

708
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,760
Contestant number one,

709
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,160
Miss Truengtra Prakamas.

710
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,920
You arrived just in time.

711
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,200
-She's 19 years of age.
-I have no interest in this.

712
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,280
I'd rather check out the stalls.

713
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,680
Ease up. Let's enjoy the eye candy.

714
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,720
I don't need to ease up.

715
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,840
She's 162 cm tall.

716
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,280
Let's just kill some time
while waiting for Ms. Kej.

717
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,400
There are a lot of people.
It'll be hard to find her.

718
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,920
Oh. Hello, Ms. Arada.

719
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,600
-Hello, Doctor.
- Contestant number two…

720
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,440
He's a friend of mine. Parkrach.

721
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,880
-Hello, Ms. Arada.
-Hello.

722
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,360
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

723
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,000
-Miss Laorngdao Prakaisang
-She's Kej's employer.

724
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,800
She also goes by the name Dao.
She's 18 years of age.

725
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,600
Her measurements are 34-24-35.

726
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,080
She's 164 cm tall.

727
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,000
She's a candidate from Duangdao Salon.

728
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,640
-Has she been introduced yet?
-Not yet.

729
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,720
-Did I arrive in time?
-Yes, you did. Sit down.

730
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,760
-Excuse me.
-Sit down.

731
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,880
Here, thank you.

732
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,080
Contestant number three,

733
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,920
Miss Petchngarm Sawangmak.

734
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,480
She also goes by the name Petch.

735
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,000
She's 17 years of age.

736
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,840
This year, all the contestants
are quite stunning,

737
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,680
but I heard number eight is the prettiest.

738
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,800
You should see for yourself. Number eight.

739
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,720
Sir, we've only seen three contestants.
Please don't be so quick to judge.

740
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,960
But I heard number eight is the prettiest.

741
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,040
You should see for yourself.

742
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,680
Contestant number four…

743
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,240
-Slow down.
-Excuse me.

744
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,240
I'm back, ma'am.

745
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,920
Where did you go?

746
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,400
I've had to stand here and wait for ages.

747
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,520
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I really tried to make it quick.

748
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,680
-Let's leave.
-Pardon? Are we leaving already?

749
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,280
I feel like I haven't seen enough.

750
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,280
Let's leave.

751
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,640
What?

752
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,400
I guess we're going.

753
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,560
Contestant number eight,

754
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,120
Miss Menie Phonsawan.

755
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,200
Look. That's number eight. It's her.

756
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,720
-Wow.
-That's her.

757
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,440
Mali! I'm rooting for you!

758
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,120
-Mali! I'm rooting for you!
-Excuse me.

759
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,960
-Excuse me.
-Mali, you look exquisite today.

760
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,840
-You're not into Tai anymore?
-Zip it. Tai is always in my heart. Gimme.

761
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,920
-Give you what?
-Goddammit. Give me the garland.

762
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,200
-Here you go.
-Get your cheap garlands

763
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,240
away from my dress.

764
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,880
-I'm not--
-Stop!

765
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,120
-What?
-I'll keep these for you.

766
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,760
-Come down.
-What?

767
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,200
-Come down.
-I'm rooting for your daughter.

768
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,920
Why are you pissed at me?

769
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,280
-Sir?
-If she gets dropped, you're dead.

770
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,440
-Let me give her the garland.
-Sit down.

771
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,640
-Please. We even brought the garlands.
-Sit down!

772
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,200
-Sit down now.
-Gosh.

773
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,520
-Excuse me.
-Come.

774
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,160
But sir, Sorn bought
all these garlands to put on her.

775
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,320
I came specifically to cheer Mali on.

776
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,800
Don't call her Mali
or you'll make her angry.

777
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,120
She changed her name to Menie.

778
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,680
She doesn't like people calling her Mali
because it sounds dated.

779
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,000
-Jeez.
-I totally forgot.

780
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,440
-Thank you, Father.
-It's okay.

781
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,040
You punk! I'm not your father!

782
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,200
I'm so nervous.

783
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,080
Don't be nervous.

784
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:33,400
Tell yourself you're gorgeous.
Then walk out.

785
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,040
Okay.

786
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,040
Contestant number nine,
please come up here to stand by.

787
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,560
Got it.

788
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,440
I wish you luck.

789
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,280
Thank you.

790
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,760
Contestant number nine…

791
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,560
CHIANG RAI YI PENG FESTIVAL

792
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,680
That's an angel.

793
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,000
I'm sure I've seen her before.

794
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,880
My daughter doesn't stand a chance.

795
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,160
Look at you with your mouth hanging open.

796
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,880
Didn't you say you had no interest?

797
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,160
She's my candidate.

798
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:54,800
I have Ms. Kej to thank for convincing
Kwan to participate in this pageant.

799
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,040
Pardon? What's her name again?

800
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,680
Krongkaew.

801
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,360
That's not her name.

802
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,520
That's her stage name.

803
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:10,160
I picked the name Krongkaew,
the famous Sri Siam beauty queen.

804
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,920
Her real name is Kwanruetai.

805
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,680
I knew it.

806
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,080
I wasn't mistaken.

807
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,560
Do you know her?

808
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,960
From what she told me,
she sells meal boxes at your hospital.

809
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,200
She's all dolled up.
I could barely recognize her.

810
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,680
This is all thanks to your sister.

811
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:13,960
Who is this girl?

812
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,880
Miss Krongkaew Arada.

813
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,000
Her measurements

814
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:28,200
-are 34-24-35. Her height is 164 cm.
-Despicable name.

815
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,200
-Let me see her face.
-She's a candidate from Arada Boutique.

816
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,120
Didn't you say you wanted to leave, ma'am?

817
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,680
Why does number nine look so familiar?

818
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:46,960
Don't you think?

819
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,960
Do you reckon she looks like Tai?

820
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,360
It can't be her.

821
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,560
Number nine is a knockout.

822
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,360
Who is she? I've never seen her before.

823
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:26,960
Kwan.

824
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,320
Mom.

825
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,040
Who said you could compete, Kwan?

826
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,600
It's you?

827
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:45,360
Give me your national ID card.
I'm making a copy of it for safekeeping.

828
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,360
Playing hard to get, aren't you?

829
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,560
I'll make you mine.

830
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,800
I give you my word
that I'll keep this a secret.

831
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,160
Do you love my daughter?

832
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,960
You are grounded.

833
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,880
Don't leave the house
unless you have my permission.

834
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,000
If you run away,
don't ever come back here again.

835
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,720
You'll no longer be my daughter.

836
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,880
