1
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,560
Criminals like you guys

2
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,600
need to be wiped out.

3
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,280
Maiseek!

4
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,120
Dr. Chat.

5
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,280
You're two-timing me!

6
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,160
Kwan!

7
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,360
Know this,

8
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,400
I am…

9
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,040
Mom Luang Maratee Dhevaprom,

10
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,840
the fiancée of M.R. Phudhipat Jutathep.

11
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,480
If Mrs. Manee is really
M.L. Maratee Dhevaprom,

12
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,920
your dad is…

13
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,680
General Pinit Thanasak.

14
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,080
Dealing with your mother hating me
by cutting me off,

15
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,720
isn't that too easy?

16
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,560
Why don't we fight it together,

17
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,440
prove ourselves to her,
and make her accept us?

18
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,920
SAMMIT

19
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,640
It's a shame.

20
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,600
When Kong tried to set us up,

21
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,960
I should have listened to him.

22
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,920
You were too young back then.

23
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,120
It wasn't the right place

24
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,680
or time.

25
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,320
But now,

26
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm still waiting for that answer.

27
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
I consider myself lucky.

28
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,360
I'm an only child,

29
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,440
but I've got two brothers who love me.

30
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,800
Right.

31
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,440
And that new doctor they're talking about?

32
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,200
Did he miss out on being your brother

33
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,000
like me and Kong are?

34
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,040
He's…

35
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,480
He's just…

36
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
He's just someone I used to know.

37
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,760
Hey.

38
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,440
Where are you going?

39
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,160
What's going on?

40
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,880
We got a tip about heroin trafficking
across the village tonight.

41
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,120
-Can I check your backpack?
-Yes.

42
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,760
Here, we found it, Lieutenant.

43
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,560
It's not mine.
I don't know anything about it.

44
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,480
The evidence is in your backpack,
yet you're still denying it?

45
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,760
Officer, escort him to the station.

46
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,400
It's not mine. It's really not.

47
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,160
-Come with me. Let's go.
-I know nothing about this. It's not mine.

48
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,480
-We'll talk at the station.
-I've never seen it before.

49
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,960
-Let's go.
-I know nothing about this. It's not mine.

50
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,640
Tell Kwan I'm being framed.

51
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,640
-Keep walking!
-Walk!

52
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,760
It's really not mine.

53
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Walk!

54
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,360
Kwan!

55
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,440
Kwan, are you asleep?

56
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
Kwan!

57
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,120
Prod?

58
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,520
Kwan!

59
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,400
Kwan!

60
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,840
Tai is asleep.

61
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,440
What do you want?

62
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,240
Who are you?
How did you get into Kwan's house?

63
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,760
And who are you? Just leave.

64
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,280
-I'm awake.
-Kwan.

65
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,080
What's going on, Prod?

66
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,880
-Kong got arrested.
-What?

67
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,920
They're accusing him of running drugs.

68
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,360
That's impossible.

69
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,160
Kong would never do that.

70
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,080
They searched him
and found heroin in his backpack.

71
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,760
It's impossible.

72
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,040
He's definitely being framed.

73
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,080
He asked me to tell you

74
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,840
that he has been set up.

75
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,960
Not sure which cops he crossed.

76
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,280
This must be about you
and your friends betraying Mr. Songpol.

77
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,240
I need to see Kong.

78
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,520
I'm going with you.

79
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,080
No, I don't want more trouble with Mom.

80
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,840
Kong.

81
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,360
Kwan.

82
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,840
Thank you.

83
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,000
Kong,

84
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,880
it's my fault.

85
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,080
It's because of me that you're in trouble.

86
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,080
What did you do?

87
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,960
Hello, ma'am?

88
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,120
Ma'am?

89
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
Who are you? Why are you in my house?

90
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,960
Ma'am?

91
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,000
Police!

92
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Here's the search warrant.

93
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,440
What is it for?

94
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,040
Kongphop Pitakdheva lives here, right?

95
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,200
Yes, why?

96
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,560
Your son has been arrested
for drug trafficking.

97
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,600
We searched your son

98
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
and found heroin in his backpack.

99
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,280
He's not my son. I don't know him.

100
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,080
I don't know anything.

101
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,520
No way!

102
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,280
I can't believe

103
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,600
Lt. Pallop was one of them.

104
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,920
I'm sorry, Prod.

105
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,080
I don't believe

106
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,160
he hanged himself because of debt.

107
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,360
Me neither.

108
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,360
And him leaving a suicide note?

109
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,080
That couldn't be right.

110
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,640
It seems more like it was staged.

111
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,200
Kong, what do we do now?

112
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,960
I know someone who can help us.

113
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,480
Hello?

114
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,120
I was starting to think you wouldn't call.

115
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,520
Is this about Kongphop?

116
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,440
I need your help to bail him out.

117
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,680
I do want to help you,

118
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,600
but it's a drug case.

119
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,560
I'd rather not get involved.

120
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Come on,

121
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,680
think of it as helping out
your future wife.

122
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,400
Hey, Mrs. Manee,
are you really agreeing to be my wife?

123
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,000
Well,

124
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,000
if you're on board with all my conditions.

125
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,320
First,

126
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,280
you need to divorce your wife immediately

127
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,520
and sign the marriage papers with me.

128
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,520
No problem at all.

129
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,640
My wife and I

130
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,840
aren't legally married.

131
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,680
We're just together
for the sake of our child.

132
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,960
I see,

133
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,880
you're just common-law spouses.

134
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,360
And about our intimate relationship,

135
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,000
we haven't been close for a long time.

136
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,320
The woman I've been
in love with for a long time

137
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,440
is you, Mrs. Manee.

138
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,800
Second,

139
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,360
I want a new house,

140
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,920
and it must be under my name alone.

141
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,840
No problem.

142
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,680
Third,

143
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,840
I want Sornram to marry Kwan

144
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,200
because I don't like the other men
who are pursuing my daughter.

145
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,400
I would actually love
to make this third one happen first.

146
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,720
Sorn will be jumping for joy.

147
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,040
His wish will finally come true.

148
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,480
He has been in love with Tai for years.

149
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,600
Well, if you can meet
all these conditions,

150
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,040
then I'll say yes.

151
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,160
And what about Kongphop?

152
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,200
If you're not comfortable with it, well,

153
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,280
you don't have to.

154
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,560
He's not my biological son anyway.

155
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,520
When will you become my wife then?

156
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,920
As soon as you're ready,

157
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,520
I'll be ready to move
into the new house too.

158
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,600
In the meantime, I'll start packing up.

159
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,840
Right, just don't take too long.

160
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,680
I might change my mind.

161
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,120
You're not my only option.

162
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Krongkaew,

163
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,440
your son

164
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,680
will never succeed in love.

165
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,440
Have this.

166
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,920
You'll feel better.

167
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,120
I thought you'd offer me some alcohol.

168
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,760
I know you don't drink.

169
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,640
Thank you.

170
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,400
Just hot milk, no coffee.

171
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,120
I know you avoid coffee after 3:00 p.m.

172
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,760
You know me better than my loved one.

173
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,120
Don't say that again, Mr. Chat.

174
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,960
People might get the wrong idea.

175
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,680
Last time, I almost lost my girlfriend.

176
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,560
Come to think of it, your love life
is more dramatic than a soap opera.

177
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,280
From the older generation's past conflicts

178
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,560
to the younger generation falling in love.

179
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,520
Do you remember the first time I met Tai?

180
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,000
She was acting so tough.

181
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,160
I never would have thought
you and Tai would fall for each other.

182
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,160
It was beyond imagination.

183
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,080
But Tai is pretty mean.

184
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,000
She didn't just break up with you,

185
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,720
but she brought a new guy
to taunt you too.

186
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,760
It seems she chose heartbreak
over conflict with her mom.

187
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
How do you plan to fix this?

188
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,720
Feelings like these
don't happen to me that often.

189
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,359
I won't give up easily.

190
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,240
I'll prove my sincerity to Mrs. Maratee.

191
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,840
My love is not one-sided
or imaginary like hers.

192
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,480
The two of us love each other.

193
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,600
In the cabinet by my bed,

194
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,640
there's a Dharma book

195
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,520
with a letter tucked inside.

196
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,240
KARMA IS REAL

197
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,800
KONGPHOP

198
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,760
You must travel to Bangkok.

199
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,840
Find the person addressed on the envelope.

200
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,520
Don't tell anyone about this,

201
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
not even Mom.

202
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,640
And who is this person?

203
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,720
"If there's ever a problem,
don't hesitate.

204
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,920
Come find me at the address below anytime.

205
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,240
Remember, we share the same dad."

206
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,400
Once you meet him,
let him read the letter,

207
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,960
and you'll find out.

208
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,320
Catch the first bus tomorrow, okay?

209
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,240
MEENA CHIANGJAN

210
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,840
MANOP CHIANGJAN

211
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
You and your mom's deaths
won't be in vain.

212
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,680
I'll make sure those villains

213
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,960
face justice.

214
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,840
In the next life and all the ones after,

215
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,880
I hope you,

216
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,120
myself,

217
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,160
and Sumlee

218
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,280
meet each other

219
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,880
and become best friends again.

220
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,680
I have an important errand in Bangkok.

221
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,680
Please don't worry. I'll be back soon.

222
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,200
Kwan.

223
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,160
Why don't you accept help
from that doctor, Kwan?

224
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,040
He might be able to help with Kong's bail.

225
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,560
Enough about him.

226
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,680
I don't need his help.

227
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,760
Did you two have a fight?

228
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,920
His…

229
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
surname is Jutathep.

230
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,640
You understand, right?

231
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,080
It's impossible between us.

232
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,840
Doctor.

233
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,200
I'm here to bail you out.

234
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,520
It's not a good idea.

235
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,320
I don't want trouble with my family.

236
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,560
Did Tai tell you?

237
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,040
Yes,

238
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,600
M.L. Chatklao Jutathep.

239
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,000
-I don't think…
-If I had known,

240
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,280
I would have stopped you and Tai
from the beginning.

241
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,360
So you know

242
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,160
that Mrs. Manee

243
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,520
and Mrs. Maratee are the same person?

244
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,200
Yes.

245
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,840
I also know about the problems
between your parents and my mom.

246
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,880
But that has nothing
to do with Tai and me.

247
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,120
The past is the past.

248
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,840
We shouldn't let
our parents' grudges burden us.

249
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,920
My mom doesn't see it that way.

250
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,120
Don't waste your time.

251
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,400
I know my mom well.

252
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,160
You two can never be together.

253
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,720
I'll prove to Mrs. Maratee

254
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,920
that I really love
and can take good care of Tai.

255
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,720
I don't know about other women,

256
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,240
but for Kwan,

257
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,520
I'm sure her mom
comes before a guy she loves.

258
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,720
I'm sorry about you and Kwan.

259
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,680
It's best to move on

260
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,560
and consider

261
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,960
that you two aren't meant for each other.

262
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,920
Thank you for the offer.

263
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,320
I need to see Tai again,

264
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,080
even if it's for the last time.

265
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,520
I have so much to talk to her about.

266
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,640
Kwan is not in Chiang Rai.

267
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,680
Where is Tai?

268
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:20,600
BANGKOK

269
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,160
Who are you looking for?

270
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,800
Hello.

271
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,080
Who are you looking for?

272
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm here for…

273
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,960
Hold on.

274
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Here you go.

275
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,800
Why do you need to see Mr. Poom?

276
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,640
My brother asked me
to give him this letter.

277
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,080
I'll hold onto it for him.

278
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,960
You can't.
I have to hand it to him in person.

279
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,840
Mr. Poom is at work. He's not home.

280
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,360
Come back later.

281
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,840
Hold on.

282
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,400
Can I wait inside the house?

283
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,440
I'm from Chiang Rai.
I don't know anyone in Bangkok.

284
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,680
I have nowhere else to go.

285
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
How can I trust you?

286
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,240
How do I know you're not a criminal?

287
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,240
Wait in front of the house.

288
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
Who's here?

289
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,960
Someone's here to see Mr. Poom.

290
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,600
-To see Poom?
-Yes.

291
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,240
You.

292
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,080
Mr. Park.

293
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,040
What are you doing here?

294
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,800
Right now, Chat sees the world
through rose-tinted glasses.

295
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,960
Don't worry, Great-Grandma.

296
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,440
Soon, Chat will bring Kwan
to pay you respects.

297
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,920
Your arm isn't dry anymore.

298
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,440
It also has a nice, light scent.

299
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,440
-The other arm?
-Okay.

300
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,200
So when are you bringing your boyfriend
around for me to meet him?

301
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,520
You already know him.

302
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,760
I only saw him when he was a kid.

303
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,440
I might not even recognize him now.

304
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,520
How about inviting him
over for dinner sometime?

305
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,280
Hello?

306
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,720
It's Kej.

307
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,200
Who's on the phone?

308
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
It's Park.

309
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,920
Goodness, you two are
inseparable, aren't you?

310
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
What's up?

311
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,760
Kej, guess who showed up at my front gate?

312
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,760
It was the biggest surprise ever.

313
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,680
I have no idea. Who was it?

314
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,600
Kwanruetai.

315
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,480
I'll tell you everything later, okay?

316
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,200
I'm glad we could meet again.

317
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,760
She's our little sister.

318
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,840
What's going on, Poom?

319
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,920
I'm feeling a bit lost here.

320
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,320
That's right.

321
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,600
How can I be your sister?

322
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,280
Because we share the same dad.

323
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,480
Poom, are you saying that

324
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,000
she's the daughter of Dad's mistress?

325
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,760
Kwan,

326
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,440
I'm sorry, that came out wrong.

327
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,920
It's okay, Mr. Park.

328
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,080
What happened back then?
I'd like to know more.

329
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,160
This took place after our dad died

330
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,000
while you were still studying abroad.

331
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,160
I see. No wonder.

332
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,160
That explains why I had no idea.

333
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,760
What happened next?

334
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,880
During that time, all of Dad's mistresses

335
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,280
were filing lawsuits
for financial support.

336
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,880
It was a complete mess.

337
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,120
But none of the cases

338
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,200
made our family more uncomfortable

339
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,400
than when M.L. Maratee

340
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,280
brought her baby to court.

341
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,680
So Kwan's mom is M.L. Maratee?

342
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,360
I just found out before coming here.

343
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,480
Mom was quite sure

344
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,160
that Kwan was Dad's child,

345
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,560
so she had the lawyer trace her.

346
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,800
When Mom heard that Mrs. Maratee
remarried and moved to Chiang Rai,

347
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,800
she called it off.

348
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,680
So what did my brother

349
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,240
write to you in his letter?

350
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,760
I'm the one who wrote this letter.

351
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,800
Hey, kid,

352
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,960
did you come here with Mrs. Maratee?

353
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,840
What's your relation to her?

354
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,920
She's my dad's new wife.

355
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,280
And the baby?

356
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,200
It's her baby.

357
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,320
Then I want you
to hold onto this letter for the baby.

358
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,880
Keep it well-hidden
and don't let Mrs. Maratee find it.

359
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,520
If there's ever a problem, don't hesitate.

360
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,960
Come to the address in the letter.

361
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,280
Remember, we share the same dad.

362
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,400
I didn't expect
that kid to actually keep the letter.

363
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,760
We wanted to help

364
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,960
without making it too obvious

365
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,679
because when Mrs. Maratee lost her case,

366
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,760
she treated Mom horribly in court.

367
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,239
Did Mom know about this letter?

368
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,400
Of course,

369
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,760
it was Mom's idea,
but she let me take the lead.

370
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,679
Even though Mom was furious,

371
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,440
she felt sorrier for the baby.

372
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,760
It's kind of funny.

373
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,280
All of a sudden, we have a new sister.

374
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,120
My injury hasn't fully healed.

375
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,800
I'm sorry.

376
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,800
So what's going on?

377
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,400
Why did your brother give you this letter?

378
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,680
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE, DEED OF LAND

379
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,360
Manee,

380
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,400
could you come out to eat now?

381
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,280
Please hold on a moment.

382
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,280
You look amazing today.

383
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,000
Shall we enter the bedroom now

384
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,280
-and skip the meal?
-Goodness.

385
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,360
-Songpol, no.
-Yes?

386
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,480
I'm hungry.

387
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,840
Then eat up because we've got

388
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,880
a long night ahead.

389
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,280
How about some more?

390
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,480
-How about some more?
-Okay.

391
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,960
Take a sip.

392
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,520
This is only the second.

393
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,440
How are you feeling?
Don't be nervous, Kwan.

394
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Pat is eager to meet you.

395
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,120
He has been monitoring this.

396
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,400
Are you excited, Kwan?

397
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,840
Suddenly, you've got three new brothers.

398
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,640
Yes, sir.

399
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,280
This is Lt. Col. Parkpipat,
my second brother.

400
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,240
Hello.

401
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,080
Park is the only one
who didn't join us in the military.

402
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,720
Honestly,

403
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,760
I'm still not sure
if I'm really your sister.

404
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Let's save that for later.

405
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,960
Right now, your local insights
are what matters most to us.

406
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,160
Take a seat.

407
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,120
Okay.

408
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,760
You know how serious this is, right?

409
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,240
It involves a drug gang
the authorities are actively pursuing.

410
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,480
Are the authorities
monitoring Mr. Songpol?

411
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,600
More than that.

412
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,160
The army is teaming up with the police
to find connections between Mr. Songpol

413
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,440
and Kevin, the henchman of a major dealer.

414
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,800
Here.

415
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,560
I've seen him before.

416
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,480
With Sak, Mr. Songpol's man.

417
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,480
That matches our leads.

418
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,080
Our intelligence identified the presence
of drug cartels along the border.

419
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,080
They used the Thai locals
to smuggle drugs to Bangkok.

420
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,240
Like the model
who overdosed in Chiang Rai.

421
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,280
Do you mean Rungrawee?

422
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,080
That's right.

423
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,320
The army worked with the police
to examine the evidence at her place

424
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,320
and found that Mrs. Arada's son
is linked to the drug gang.

425
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,880
The police are actively pursuing them.

426
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,080
The Area Commander has issued an order

427
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,160
to quickly eliminate
the drug production base.

428
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,600
The challenge is

429
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,320
we're not sure
where their base is located.

430
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,560
I think Kong and I can help.

431
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,840
We used to go foraging often.

432
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,000
Kong mentioned
their base is near the valley,

433
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,480
up the mountain, just inside the forest.

434
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,280
We can help you.

435
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,640
But…

436
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,920
First, you must set Kong free.

437
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,480
As for your brother,

438
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,080
of course, we'll help him.

439
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,240
Don't worry.

440
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,080
Let's head to Chiang Rai right away.

441
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,640
Don't tell Kej yet.
I'll talk to her myself.

442
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,920
If Great-Grandma finds out now,
she'll be more anxious.

443
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,840
Don't lose hope.

444
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,760
I'm sure you'll win over
your future mother-in-law.

445
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,280
Where's Tai now? Is she still in pain?

446
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,640
Wow, you're so worried about your girl.

447
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,320
I've set up the guest room for her.
She's probably asleep by now.

448
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,080
She hasn't complained about any pain

449
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,920
except when I tapped her
on the shoulder to welcome her.

450
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,960
She's both stubborn and tough.

451
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,480
It's strange but true.

452
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,200
In the end,
we're each other's brother-in-law.

453
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,560
Hey, when will you be back in Chiang Rai?

454
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,800
Tomorrow, I'm catching the first flight.

455
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,000
I hope Mom doesn't make the wrong choice

456
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,240
and turn to taking shortcuts again.

457
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,240
Manee,

458
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,200
could you come out to eat now?

459
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,040
Please hold on a moment.

460
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,160
I'm sorry.

461
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,960
I'm not quite ready yet today.

462
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,560
Is the food to your liking?

463
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,280
I like it very much.
I haven't had anything this good in years.

464
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,160
My life has to be better than this.

465
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,800
I refuse to grow old and die
as some hick woman.

466
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,240
POLICE STATION
PROTECTING AND SERVING THE PEOPLE

467
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,400
Come out now!
Your relative has posted bail for you.

468
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,600
Kong.

469
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,320
Was everything okay?

470
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,200
Yes.

471
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,800
It was right under our noses.

472
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,560
I was just as surprised.

473
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,480
Anyway, congratulations

474
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,400
on finding a new little sister.

475
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,000
Thank you.

476
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,520
Kong, it might not be true.

477
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,360
I hope it is true, Kwan.

478
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,400
I want to be Chat's brother-in-law.
I can tease him a bit.

479
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,760
You talk too much.

480
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,160
I understand why you turned Chat down,

481
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,360
but I'm confident that his sincerity

482
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,400
will win over Mrs. Maratee's heart.

483
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,720
Poom,

484
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,600
this is Kwan's brother.

485
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,520
Hello.

486
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,000
I'm grateful for your help with my bail.

487
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,360
It was nothing.

488
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,280
By the way, do you remember me?

489
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,520
It's okay if you don't.

490
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,120
We're done here.
You both can come with me.

491
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,400
Thanks a lot, Poom.

492
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,200
Let's go.

493
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,240
What's the next move?

494
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,560
Let's go see Chat first.

495
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,800
He must be anxious by now.

496
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,840
Worried about his girl, right?

497
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,320
Let's go.

498
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,160
POLICE STATION
PROTECTING AND SERVING THE PEOPLE

499
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,760
Let's go.

500
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,480
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

501
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,440
I never thought
we'd end up being so closely related.

502
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,760
But my relationship isn't
as sweet as yours with Kej.

503
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,280
You're exaggerating, Chat.

504
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,360
Hey, I can tell that
the girl is still in love with you.

505
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,920
I agree with Park.

506
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,560
Kwan must find this difficult.

507
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,760
If it were me, I'd choose Mom too.

508
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,400
Men are just other people.

509
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,760
You're not pulling punches, Kej.

510
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,360
Right, did you hear about
Kongphop assisting the army?

511
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,920
Yes, I did.

512
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,240
I've just been asked for assistance from
the border police and the army as well.

513
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,320
What did they ask you to do?

514
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,240
The director assigned my team to prepare
medical supplies for the operation.

515
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,720
When is this?

516
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,240
Tomorrow.

517
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,640
Chat,

518
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,960
can you not go?

519
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,080
Kej, don't you trust me?

520
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,080
Your brother is not just a doctor
but also a soldier.

521
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
I can't help but worry anyway.

522
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,560
If Mom finds out, she'll be uneasy.

523
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,040
Don't call and let her know.

524
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,400
I don't want to worry her.

525
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,200
Then you must take good care of yourself.

526
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,760
I went foraging in this area

527
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,800
and saw them setting up a checkpoint.

528
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,280
Do you remember, Kwan?

529
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,200
Yes. We went with Uncle Boon and Pon.

530
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,240
While we were there, we saw more than
ten people dressed like hired soldiers.

531
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,360
After that, we quickly slipped away.

532
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,760
Have you ever been deeper?

533
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,640
Our surveillance team

534
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,120
believes their production base
is probably around that area.

535
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,560
This area is restricted,

536
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,200
but I saw people moving things from there.

537
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,760
Judging by their clothing and accent,

538
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,680
it seemed likely they weren't Thai.

539
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,400
This is also where
Hunter Boon's body was found

540
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,240
and Pon got attacked.

541
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,680
Maybe their camp's hidden in this valley.

542
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,920
If that is correct,
barging in won't be easy.

543
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,520
The terrain is on their side.

544
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,360
Then we'll need Kongphop
to guide our soldiers,

545
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,000
so we can get closer to their camp.

546
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,680
Absolutely.

547
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,280
I know this area well.

548
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,960
Other than climbing,

549
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,840
we can take the stream path

550
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,040
that goes through the cave.

551
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,560
Is there a stream around there?

552
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,200
Yes, a small one.

553
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,600
It starts around here.

554
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,640
I went there when I was a kid.

555
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,520
Great, now we've identified
the suspected area,

556
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,800
the entrance, and the exit.

557
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,920
This information is very helpful.

558
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,320
We'll need your help leading our soldiers.

559
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,320
No problem.

560
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,720
So,

561
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,880
when are we heading out?

562
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,560
Today.

563
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,920
We made a few changes
to the plan to avoid leaks.

564
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,640
The Area Commander wants no mistakes.

565
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,360
We want to avoid unnecessary losses.

566
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,160
Our mission is to destroy
their production base.

567
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,480
Another unit will handle
the cleanup afterward.

568
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,120
Honestly, there's no need
to move to Chat's place.

569
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,680
You'll be safe staying
with me at the hotel.

570
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,200
Do you dare
to call my mom and tell her that?

571
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,160
Let's quickly grab my things.
I need to hurry to the boutique.

572
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,800
Take it easy, ma'am.

573
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,840
Is that Attawit?

574
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,480
Yes.

575
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,680
Pilai is with him.

576
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,120
Can I come with you?

577
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,480
No, I can't let you take any risks.

578
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,440
Taking care of Mom is our responsibility.

579
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,480
If I'm not around,

580
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,760
you'll have to handle that.

581
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,280
I'm just worried about you.

582
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:48,920
Why?

583
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,680
If you come along,
do you think you can protect me?

584
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,880
Don't worry too much.

585
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,240
I won't be storming
into their base myself.

586
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,240
My role is to provide info.

587
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,440
It'll be okay.

588
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,120
Our work here is done. Let's go home.

589
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,960
Mom has probably
turned the house upside down.

590
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,680
Let's go.

591
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,360
Here are your room keys.

592
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,720
Why did we even come back?
It feels like we're begging to get caught.

593
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,640
If we hadn't returned,
Kevin might think we're not serious.

594
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,640
How can you be sure

595
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,680
Kevin will let us keep working

596
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,960
if we give him the money?

597
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,440
Come on,

598
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,960
good drug runners like us
aren't easy to find.

599
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,240
We know the game,
and we've made him a ton of money.

600
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,120
If Kevin doesn't listen,

601
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,640
we can talk to his big boss.

602
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,520
It won't be easy.

603
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,360
What leverage do we have?

604
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,720
The police are after us now.

605
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,320
I've got a plan.

606
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,400
If we don't take a risk, we'll never know.

607
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,280
Let's go!

608
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,240
I wonder why they returned.

609
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,400
I don't think it's anything good.

610
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,000
You should give Mrs. Arada a call
and tell her to be careful.

611
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,600
Okay.

612
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,080
I'll stay back and keep an eye on them.

613
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,920
Be careful.

614
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,560
Okay.

615
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,640
Get ready. I'll pick you up this evening.

616
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,240
Okay.

617
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,280
Thank you.

618
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,040
You're both finally back.

619
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,920
What's going on, ma'am?

620
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,720
I really didn't want to bring this up,

621
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,240
but you'll find out anyway.

622
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,640
The rumor is already spreading
throughout the market.

623
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,640
Well, I've been meaning to ask
if you heard

624
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,520
that your mom has become
Mr. Songpol's mistress.

625
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,920
What are you talking about?

626
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,280
I saw him picking her up
right here in front of the house,

627
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,480
and they were moving things
back and forth a few times.

628
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,760
I saw it with my own eyes.

629
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,800
Mom has really left us, Kong.

630
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,800
I wouldn't be hurt

631
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,520
if Mom left us

632
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,720
to start a new life with a good man,

633
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,800
but that's not the case.

634
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,920
Mom chose the wrong path again.

635
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,840
She has become someone's mistress.

636
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,040
Kwan,

637
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,840
it could just be a rumor.

638
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,360
Maybe it's not true.

639
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,760
I'm going to the market.

640
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,000
I need to find out the truth.

641
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,560
Kwan!

642
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,560
Kwan!

643
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,600
Ouch!

644
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,640
Oh, are you awake?

645
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,560
Two spoonfuls of coffee and one sugar,
I made it especially strong for you today.

646
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,320
Thank you.

647
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,320
I feel a bit embarrassed.

648
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,880
On our first night,

649
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,640
I dozed off.

650
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,880
I'm sorry.

651
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,760
I'll make it up to you.

652
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,160
Goodness, Songpol.

653
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,160
It's still daylight.
I don't think it's appropriate.

654
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,240
I can't handle it during the day either.

655
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,120
I have some business to attend to.

656
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,440
But tonight,

657
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,760
I promise I won't doze off.

658
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,880
Songpol.

659
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,840
How about this?

660
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:49,000
I'll get dinner ready
for you at home tonight.

661
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,720
Do you want anything in particular?

662
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,360
I just want you, Manee.

663
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,680
You should take a shower,
or you'll be late for your business.

664
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,280
I'll prepare your breakfast, okay?

665
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,840
Okay.

666
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,160
By the way, Manee,

667
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,200
I've already found you a maid.

668
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,760
She should arrive this evening.

669
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,920
Songpol,

670
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,320
you're the best!

671
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,360
Don't make me say it, Tai.

672
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,160
It might upset you.

673
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,440
But I really want to know

674
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,120
what these busybodies
are saying about my mom.

675
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,360
They're saying that your mom has moved in

676
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,240
and become Mr. Songpol's mistress.

677
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,520
Well, it's hard to dismiss

678
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,280
because someone claims to have seen it.

679
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,800
I think I know where the rumor originated.

680
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,240
Is it true or not?

681
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,920
I'm not sure, Ah Go.

682
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,360
Ah Go, can you help me find out
where Mr. Songpol has taken my mom?

683
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,520
I can find that out for you.

684
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:14,880
Are you serious?

685
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,640
I'm serious.

686
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,760
If it's in our district,

687
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,400
I'll find out before the day's over.

688
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,080
I know every house in this district
that belongs to Mr. Songpol.

689
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,240
The old one moves out,
the new one moves in.

690
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,480
-Ah Go, check, please.
-No,

691
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,440
-it's on me.
-Thank you.

692
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:34,320
Hey, when you find out about my mom,
come tell Ah Go quickly.

693
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,560
I'll compensate you.

694
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,840
Sure thing. You can expect some good news.

695
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,960
Hey, Tai,

696
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,600
it could just be a rumor.

697
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,640
Don't jump to conclusions.

698
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,080
How did it go?

699
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,520
There has been no movement.

700
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,960
Did you get in touch with Mrs. Arada?

701
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,920
Yes, she packed up and went home.

702
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,960
That's good.

703
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,880
So are we going to keep watch here?

704
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,080
Can't I come with you?

705
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,040
I have a bad feeling,
I'm worried about you.

706
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,880
We're both students of Hunter Boon.

707
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,640
It's just a little hiking, I'll be fine.

708
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,760
There's no need to worry.

709
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,320
But it's different this time.

710
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,200
I'm just leading the way.

711
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,760
I won't be storming into their hideout.

712
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,160
After leading the team there,

713
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,600
I'll join the medical unit with Dr. Chat.

714
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,280
I didn't want to hear about that.

715
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,280
Have you found out where Mom moved to?

716
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,200
I had a motorbike taxi rider look into it.

717
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,280
He should know by tomorrow.

718
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,880
Mr. Songpol might have taken Mom
to one of the houses he took over.

719
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,120
I have to go now.

720
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,560
Take care of yourself, Kong.

721
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,280
If she doesn't want to come back,

722
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,080
just let her go.

723
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,880
Once she makes up her mind,

724
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,040
she won't listen to anyone.

725
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,320
I'm going now.

726
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:06,960
Wait.

727
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,760
Promise me you'll get home safely.

728
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,800
My skin is as thick as your head is tough.

729
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,200
I promise I'll come back
and nag at you for a long time.

730
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,760
Until there's another man

731
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,440
to take care of my sister for me.

732
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,360
Kong.

733
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,640
Just go now, go.

734
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,120
I'm off.

735
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,240
I really picked
the right person for the job,

736
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,760
well-deserving
of the nickname Mian, the Hawkeye.

737
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,680
Gosh, ma'am,
you're giving me too much credit.

738
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,040
It was just good timing.

739
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,800
After accepting your job,

740
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,160
I went for coffee
at Ah Go's place to plan,

741
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,840
but I ran into Tai.

742
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,000
Luck was on your side.

743
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,400
But I do need

744
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,920
to ask for a 200 baht tip
for the motorbike taxi.

745
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,880
-Here, I'll give you 500 baht.
-I really appreciate it.

746
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,720
But you have to come with me to see her.

747
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,280
Of course,

748
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,760
even if you didn't pay me,
I've been wanting to see her face.

749
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,880
What a shameless, husband-stealing bitch.

750
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,960
Manee, others might not
be a match for you, but I am.

751
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,920
You have no idea what's coming.

752
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,440
-Let's go, Mian.
-Okay.

753
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,480
Let me see the bitch
who doesn't know her place.

754
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,280
Sunant.

755
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,080
Maratee.

756
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,400
They have no idea
the entrance will become their graves.

757
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,640
So you've planned it all out?

758
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,480
We'll draw them into the camp

759
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,040
and take them all out.

760
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,120
-Tell our men to go out and kill them all.
-Yes, sir.

761
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,760
Make sure none of them make it out alive.

762
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,040
Tai!

763
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:34,080
