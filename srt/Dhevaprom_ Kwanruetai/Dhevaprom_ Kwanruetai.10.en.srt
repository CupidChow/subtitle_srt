1
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,720
Mr. Wit!

2
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,240
But since you messed up…

3
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,280
Mr. Wit!

4
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,080
Tai!

5
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,800
I'd like to bring this pendant inside
and show it to you.

6
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,080
Will you allow me?

7
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,080
Don't sell drugs to Mr. Sorn again.
Remember that!

8
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,640
I'd rather die

9
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,280
than see you take the wrong path.

10
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,040
I'm already trying to quit.

11
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,800
It's not wine. It's clearly heroin.

12
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,920
What do we do next?

13
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,040
Let's take this to the police
as evidence against Mr. Songpol.

14
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,000
This is Lt. Pallop.

15
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,520
I need to speak to him
about something important.

16
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,880
Maiseek!

17
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,600
What is it, Tai?

18
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,040
What is it?

19
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
Take the money. You need it.

20
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,320
Thank you, but I have some saved up.

21
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,360
Take it.

22
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,320
So when you're short on money,

23
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,560
you won't have to repeat
this stupid mistake again.

24
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,040
Take it.

25
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,800
Thank you.

26
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,680
Don't be a crybaby.

27
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,960
This isn't much.
I can earn it back in no time.

28
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,920
After I've found my footing,
I'll pay you back.

29
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,440
With interest?

30
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,440
Better than the bank's rate, trust me.

31
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm counting on it.

32
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,040
Maiseek.

33
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,840
I hope your mom recovers

34
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,720
and gets back to good health soon.

35
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,040
Call me the minute
you arrive in Bangkok, okay?

36
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,680
I will.

37
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,040
Before long,

38
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,920
our little gang will be back together.

39
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,280
I'm going to miss you a lot.

40
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,080
Me too.

41
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,480
Good luck.

42
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,600
Thank you.

43
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,160
You made a significant contribution
today, Lieutenant.

44
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,360
Yes, sir.

45
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,960
I can't quite decide

46
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,240
on the reward to give you
for your contribution today.

47
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,160
Thank you, sir.

48
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,280
Ma'am, the ride is here. Let's go.

49
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,440
Wait.

50
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,520
I forgot the towel. One second.

51
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,080
Come on, ma'am. It doesn't matter.

52
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,920
Why don't we just get in the car?
We'll buy what we didn't bring.

53
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,240
What's the rush? Since we already have it,
why should we waste money?

54
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,760
Being late for five or ten minutes
is not the end of the world.

55
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,080
-I'll be back. Wait for me.
-I'll carry these bags over first.

56
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Go, then.

57
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,280
-Come down quickly, okay?
-All right.

58
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,720
What's taking you so long, Sumlee?

59
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Dad.

60
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,520
What?

61
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,400
Dad.

62
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,360
Dad.

63
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,920
Whose noise was that just now?

64
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,760
Dad.

65
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,560
Dad!

66
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,440
Dad!

67
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,400
Dad!

68
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,080
Pork with basil and an omelet for you.

69
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,840
No need for so much food, really.

70
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,480
No, really. You let me borrow your car.

71
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,560
Eat up. It's all yours.

72
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,960
Are you not eating?

73
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,920
It's late.

74
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,960
Now that you're a pageant girl,
are you watching your weight?

75
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,160
Hey, watch it.

76
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,840
Mom was complimenting you endlessly

77
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,960
on your surprising new look.

78
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,200
A pity I wasn't there.

79
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,560
I'm not talking to you anymore.

80
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,640
I'm getting some snacks.

81
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,360
Prod. Did you hear
that Lt. Pallop hanged himself?

82
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,720
What?

83
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,880
-Maiseek.
-Mom.

84
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,240
-Maiseek.
-Maiseek.

85
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,880
-Why did you get off? We need to hurry.
-Maiseek.

86
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,040
Sak!

87
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,360
You've got a nerve betraying Mr. Songpol.

88
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,640
What did you steal from them?
Give it back.

89
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Give what back? I don't understand.

90
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,320
Liar.

91
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,440
Maiseek, they know.

92
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,840
Where did you stash the goods?
Tell me or your mom will die.

93
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,040
Sak, please don't hurt my mom.

94
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,280
Give the goods to me.

95
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,960
I already delivered it.

96
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,240
You're lying!

97
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,120
Mom!

98
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,640
Mom.

99
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,360
Sak, my mom is old. She has cancer.

100
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,360
Please spare her life.

101
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,720
Please have some compassion
for us two insignificant people.

102
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,120
Fucking save the speech.

103
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,560
You damn well asked for it.

104
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,520
You betrayed Mr. Songpol.

105
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,160
You guys and Tai
totally underestimate him.

106
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,640
I'm asking you for the last time.
Where did you stash the goods?

107
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,680
Please hand it over to them.

108
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,880
Would you rather die? Hand it over.

109
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,880
I gave all the drugs to the police.

110
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,720
Criminals like you guys

111
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,920
need to be wiped out.

112
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,520
-Maiseek!
-Maiseek!

113
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,200
Holy shit!

114
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
Is the food to your liking?

115
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,200
I like it very much.
I haven't had anything this good in years.

116
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,800
What do you say

117
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,360
if I bring you to visit Bangkok
on a regular basis?

118
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,080
I--

119
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,520
Excuse me, I need to get that.

120
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
She's just a girl.

121
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,760
I have her completely under my thumb.

122
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,520
Teach her a little lesson.

123
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,800
She has no proof against me.

124
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,600
Wait until I've hooked her mom.

125
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,440
I'll have her subdued then.

126
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,920
I apologize for the interruption.

127
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,240
Where were we just now?

128
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,600
We were discussing

129
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,040
the label to put on our relationship.

130
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,240
-Is it really Maiseek?
-Affirmative.

131
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,160
There's also his mom and Sumlee.
Three bodies.

132
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,280
Who's going to be my supplier now?

133
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,280
Come on, Sorn. This is a serious matter.

134
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,000
RUAMKATANYU FOUNDATION

135
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,440
Maiseek. Sumlee.

136
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
-Maiseek.
-Where are you going? Don't go over there.

137
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,800
-Let go. They're my friends.
-You can't help.

138
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,080
-But--
-Stop. They're dead.

139
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,440
They're dead?

140
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,480
Yes, they are all dead. You going there
is not going to help with anything.

141
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,440
It's not true.

142
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,280
No. My friends aren't dead. Let go.

143
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,520
-I need to see.
-They're dead.

144
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,640
Tai, they're covered in blood.

145
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
If they aren't dead,
they're clearly supermen.

146
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
Maiseek.

147
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,720
-Let go of me. I want to see my friends.
-They're dead. Stay back.

148
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,200
-Let go! Maiseek.
-Tai.

149
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,000
-Tai, I'm asking you to stop.
-Maiseek.

150
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,440
Sorn.

151
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,800
-I beg of you. We need to get out of here.
-Maiseek.

152
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,760
I beg of you.

153
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,200
Tai.

154
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,480
Let's go.

155
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,720
Mrs. Manee.

156
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,319
What is it?

157
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,480
There's something I have yet to tell you.

158
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,119
I didn't want to bring it up at the table
for fear it would dampen your appetite.

159
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,680
Sak called to tell me

160
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,400
Tai has been shot.

161
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,640
What?

162
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,880
How…

163
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,920
How is she doing now?

164
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,920
She was sent to hospital.

165
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
You shouldn't worry.

166
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,040
Tai is in the doctor's hands.
There's nothing to worry about.

167
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,960
But I want to head back
to Chiang Rai right away.

168
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,360
I can't wait until tomorrow.

169
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,800
I won't be able to force myself to sleep.

170
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,600
Okay. Let's pack the bags
and we'll be on our way.

171
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,720
Thank you so much.

172
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,600
She's a tough girl. Believe me.

173
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
She'll be fine.

174
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,800
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

175
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,880
You…

176
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,120
Are you awake?

177
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,840
Hey. You need to be careful.

178
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
I…

179
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,440
How did I get here?

180
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,720
Don't you remember getting shot?

181
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,520
Fortunately,
the bullet only grazed your skin.

182
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,280
Your injury must be
from the motorbike crash.

183
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Maiseek…

184
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,800
What about Maiseek and Sumlee?

185
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,320
Maiseek's mom as well?

186
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,880
I saw them being carried off.

187
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,480
Is everyone all right?

188
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,560
Maiseek and his mom

189
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,880
were shot and passed away

190
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,720
before reaching the hospital.

191
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
What?

192
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,520
That's not true.

193
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,800
It can't be true.

194
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,040
Are you lying?

195
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,880
You must be lying.

196
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,760
Maiseek. He could never be dead.

197
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,800
He's…

198
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,960
He's a sinner.

199
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
He has to live to repent for his sins.

200
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,720
He can't be dead.

201
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,240
Tai, don't move around.

202
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,800
Maiseek and his mom
have gone to a better place.

203
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,080
They won't be in any more pain.

204
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,360
What about Sumlee?

205
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,400
Don't tell me that he's dead.

206
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,600
I heard Dr. Chat is back from Bangkok.

207
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,760
The news sure traveled fast.

208
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,800
Well, I miss him. What can I do?

209
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Is it unrequited?

210
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,200
None of your business.

211
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,440
Where's Dr. Chat?

212
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,920
He rushed back to check on his girlfriend.

213
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,000
Hey. What girlfriend?
Watch what you're saying.

214
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,520
The rumor is all over town.
Have you not heard?

215
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,600
Remember Miss Noppamas
contestant number nine?

216
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,920
The one right after you.

217
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,160
Contestant number nine…

218
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,960
Tai?

219
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,640
You've just heard it
for the first time from me?

220
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,280
I don't believe you.
Dr. Chat has a better taste than that.

221
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,520
Why don't you go to Room 3110
and see for yourself?

222
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,160
Go away. I need to work.

223
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,680
She's so jilted.

224
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,040
Dr. Chat.

225
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,960
You're two-timing me!

226
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,200
She must have misunderstood something.

227
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,760
No, she understood.

228
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,240
You could have told me
that you have such a weird taste.

229
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,760
I won't give in so easily,
you fake tomboy.

230
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,040
Sumlee…

231
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,480
A bullet missed his lung,
causing a hemorrhage.

232
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,200
We inserted the tube to drain it.

233
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,400
Another bullet penetrated his abdomen.

234
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,400
We had to operate on his spleen
to stop the bleeding.

235
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,880
We also stitched up his intestines.

236
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,560
What is his condition now?

237
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,440
The abdominal bleeding has stopped.

238
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,600
But I can't say
when he's going to wake up.

239
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,960
His heart stopped beating one time.

240
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
We successfully resuscitated him.

241
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,280
He'll definitely wake up.

242
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,520
I'm confident that he'll wake up.

243
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,200
I also believe that he can fight this.

244
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,960
Can I go with you to visit Tai?

245
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,200
Let's not. There are many people around.

246
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
I'd rather not be the subject
of gossip right now.

247
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Have you finally agreed

248
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,960
that we'll be having
a secret relationship?

249
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,520
The thing is…

250
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,120
I like to be number one.

251
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,960
If another woman comes before me,

252
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
I'd rather stay single.

253
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,480
Please don't worry.
Tai is in the clear now.

254
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,400
The bullet grazed her shoulder.
The rest are just slight bruises.

255
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,120
She'll be discharged today.

256
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,720
I wonder who she ticked off this time.

257
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,960
I was away for just a day
and this thing happened.

258
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,200
It's this room.

259
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,520
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

260
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,320
MAJOR DOCTOR M.L. CHATKLAO JUTATHEP
KWANRUETAI PITAKDHEVA

261
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,920
Chatklao Jutathep?

262
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,760
MAJOR DOCTOR M.L. CHATKLAO JUTATHEP
KWANRUETAI PITAKDHEVA

263
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,760
It was my stupid idea…

264
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,000
that led to their deaths.

265
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,240
And Sumlee is now
critically injured because of me.

266
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,800
I'll never forgive myself.

267
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,160
Stop blaming yourself.

268
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,960
It's not your fault.

269
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,360
It all stems from that Songpol guy.

270
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,040
He must be held accountable.

271
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
The three of you have my utmost admiration

272
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,960
for standing up against them.

273
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,520
If only Lt. Pallop hadn't been their mole,

274
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,760
you'd have successfully
uncovered the mastermind.

275
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Do you…

276
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,160
Do you believe me

277
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,120
that Mr. Songpol
is part of the drug syndicate?

278
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,240
I've always believed you.

279
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,880
Everybody else believes him.

280
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Not a single person listens to me.

281
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,760
Is it because I'm just a child
in their eyes?

282
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,160
I've never seen you as a child.

283
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,000
Since the first time that I saw you

284
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,160
chasing those dealers out of the village
on that motorcycle.

285
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,760
What child would be
so selfless and courageous?

286
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,120
Stop blaming yourself.

287
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,120
We can't let Hunter Boon, Pon, Maiseek
and his mom die without closure.

288
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,680
We must find a way
to bring Mr. Songpol to justice.

289
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,720
I shouldn't have rushed to act.

290
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,360
I should have waited until you got back.

291
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,640
Who's there? What terrible timing.

292
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,320
Who's ringing the doorbell?

293
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,360
Sorn, you woke up to have breakfast
and now you're sleeping again?

294
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,360
Wake up.

295
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,880
I'm sleepy, Mom.

296
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,000
Your dad
is getting back from Bangkok today.

297
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,240
Isn't he back later this evening?

298
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,120
What about the tasks he assigned you?
Did you finish them?

299
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,200
Get up.

300
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,080
Who's that?

301
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,960
Mali Brand Milk.

302
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,680
Am I dreaming?

303
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,720
Is Mrs. Nant here?

304
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,920
Yes, she is. Please come in.

305
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,920
Sorn!

306
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,040
Who is it?

307
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,960
It's me.

308
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,040
-Mali.
-Menie.

309
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,080
Hello.

310
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,680
What urges you

311
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,280
to drop by my home?

312
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,360
The yearning urges, perhaps?

313
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,679
I came to see Mrs. Nant.

314
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,159
What business do you have with me?

315
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,280
Why don't you take a seat, Menie?

316
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,639
There's no need.

317
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,400
I only have a few words to say,
and then I'll take my leave.

318
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,920
I saw your husband at the army hospital.

319
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,560
How could you have seen him?

320
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,360
He left for Bangkok
to take care of business.

321
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040
He won't be back till late.

322
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,239
I saw him with my own eyes.
He was with a woman.

323
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,560
What woman?

324
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,239
Tai's mom.

325
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,880
Tai's mom?

326
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,920
That's right.
I couldn't have been mistaken.

327
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,520
She made a scene at the contest
not long ago.

328
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,760
They seemed close and flirtatious.

329
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,719
I wonder when they became so close.

330
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,040
At first, I thought she was Mrs. Nant.

331
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,960
What gave me second thoughts was

332
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,400
I remember you being much prettier.

333
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,040
So what's your intention
in mentioning this?

334
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,480
I mean well. I simply wanted
to give you a warning.

335
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,800
You don't have to believe me.

336
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,960
Just keep a good eye on your husband.

337
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,440
I'm leaving.

338
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,200
Menie.

339
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,120
-Menie.
-Somchai.

340
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,480
Yes?

341
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,600
Go to the market and find out

342
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,040
if Mr. Songpol is already
back in Chiang Rai.

343
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,880
Yes, ma'am.

344
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,760
Menie.

345
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,160
Menie.

346
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,280
Menie, wait.

347
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,080
You just planted a bomb in my house,
and you're simply going to leave?

348
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,600
You should be thanking me
for opening your mom's eyes.

349
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,600
Suddenly, you're all good intentions.

350
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,360
What do you want in return?

351
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,840
Since you asked, I'm going to answer.

352
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,440
I don't like that
Tai is flirting with my boyfriend.

353
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,080
Your boyfriend? Who?

354
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,960
Dr. Chat.

355
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,920
Are you dating? Since when?

356
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,320
That's my business.

357
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,160
I heard you've been
pursuing Tai for many years, right?

358
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,240
You're not wrong.

359
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,200
How could you let Dr. Chat
snatch her away just like that?

360
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,160
He probably feels pity because she's poor.
That's why he has a soft spot for her.

361
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,840
But if her mom is your dad's mistress
and it becomes a scandal,

362
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,960
Dr. Chat wouldn't choose her and risk
tarnishing his family's good name.

363
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,320
We should work together.

364
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,880
If I work with you,

365
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,480
is Tai going to fall for me?

366
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,400
Would you rather
the two of them be together?

367
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,800
That way, we're both rejected.

368
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Two jilted souls coming together.

369
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,000
Doesn't sound half bad.

370
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,480
You're just shooting
for the moon, that's all.

371
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,960
I'm not a bad shot, you know?

372
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,360
Don't hold your breath.

373
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,640
Mali, you've underestimated me.

374
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,320
We have arrived, my lady.

375
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,520
I can walk on my own. Why did you put me
in a wheelchair like I'm badly hurt?

376
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,200
I hardly ever get a chance to spoil you.

377
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,040
Mom.

378
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,640
Enjoying yourself?

379
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,640
Did your legs get blown off
so you can't walk?

380
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,760
You're just showing off.

381
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,960
I'd rather not aggravate the wounds,
so I didn't let her walk on her own.

382
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,800
Did you not hear when I ordered you
to stay away from my daughter?

383
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,880
Do you want to go head-to-head with me?

384
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,640
Mom.

385
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,280
Ouch. That hurts, Mom.

386
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,520
Don't touch my daughter.

387
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,400
Mom, can you keep it down?
You're embarrassing me.

388
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,280
Why are you embarrassed? Why do you care?

389
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,600
We should let the whole hospital know
there's a doctor

390
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,560
treating his patient unprofessionally.

391
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,120
Mom, I owe him a big favor.

392
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,480
Even more than me, your mom?

393
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,680
The love of a mom and a lover

394
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,680
cannot be compared.

395
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,200
I love your daughter.

396
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,000
I want to openly be with her.

397
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,080
Kwan!

398
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,040
I'll never allow you two to be together.

399
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,720
You two can never be in love.

400
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,680
You!

401
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,600
I'll sacrifice my life to keep you apart.

402
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,080
I don't understand.
What makes you hate me this much?

403
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,880
You hate me because of my surname,
Jutathep, is that it?

404
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,640
I have news for you.

405
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,680
Don't go falling for their good looks.
I was once a victim of it!

406
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,400
Those handsome doctors
from the Jutathep family

407
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,720
are all frauds.

408
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,840
When the mask comes off,
they show their true colors as playboys.

409
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,160
I wouldn't have had
the fucking fall from grace

410
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,760
if not for the two of them.

411
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,840
Do you hear me? I despise them.

412
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,600
I despise them. That fucking bitch
and her asshole husband.

413
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
-I hate their guts.
-Mom.

414
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,920
You hate me

415
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,520
because of my dad, M.R. Phudhipat,
and my mom, Mrs. Krongkaew, don't you?

416
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,000
Your birth name isn't Manee.

417
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,520
-You're--
-No!

418
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,480
No!

419
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,120
Stop! Stop right now!

420
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,320
Hello, Mrs. Nant.

421
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,800
Did you come to get more prescriptions?

422
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,600
No, I came to see Tai.

423
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,560
Tai? Kwanruetai, you mean?

424
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,280
That's right.
Her mom is visiting her, isn't she?

425
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,480
Yes.

426
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,360
Has she left?

427
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,760
I don't think so.
She only went up just now.

428
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,640
Which room is she in?

429
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,120
Well…

430
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,720
Get out. Get him out of here. I hate him.

431
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,440
Get out.

432
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,280
-Kwan, get him out of here.
-Can you please leave?

433
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,760
Kwan, you're coming home with me.

434
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,640
She should stay here for observation.

435
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,520
That's not necessary.
I don't care if she dies.

436
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,400
As long as she's out of your reach.

437
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,240
Ouch. Mom.

438
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,280
It hurts.

439
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,040
You must choose between
coming home with me

440
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,560
or staying here with him
and cutting our relationship off.

441
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,480
Mom, you're hurting me.

442
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,640
What is it?

443
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,880
Let me see that old mistress for myself.

444
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,520
Panadda, damn you for playing me.

445
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,320
Why are you so late?

446
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,240
I'm way ahead of time, actually.

447
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,800
But in my heart, you're late.

448
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,360
-I'm leaving.
-Where are you going?

449
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,720
I might get chewed out.

450
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,760
Who would chew you out? Hey.

451
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,400
Where is she off to?

452
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,520
Who the hell finished my whiskey?

453
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,360
You drank it all by yourself, Mom.

454
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,080
Where are you off to now?

455
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,680
I'm going out to buy food for you, Mom.

456
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,280
Right.

457
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,840
Are your legs up and running now?

458
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,040
Your legs weren't working this afternoon.
You even had to be in a wheelchair.

459
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,720
Playing the damsel in distress.

460
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,800
If I didn't get in the wheelchair,

461
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,160
Dr. Chat wouldn't take me to visit Sumlee.

462
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,880
Stop there.

463
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,640
Don't bring up that name in this house.
It's bad luck.

464
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,640
I hate the Jutathep family.

465
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,880
They made my life into this sorry state.

466
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,680
I don't get it.

467
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,320
What's with you? Why are you
so hellbent on hating them?

468
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,440
What did they do to you?

469
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,360
They broke their promise.

470
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,080
Both Grandma Eied and Grandma Orn

471
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,280
are liars.

472
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,840
That Krongkaew woman

473
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,440
took my Pat from me.

474
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,120
Your Pat? Who is he?

475
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,960
M.R. Phudhipat Jutathep.

476
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,800
The dad of that playboy doctor
who's pursuing you.

477
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,160
If they'd kept their promise,

478
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,720
I'd have gotten married to Pat.

479
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,680
You and him…

480
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,320
Were you in love?

481
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,360
Yes, we were.

482
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,800
Know this,

483
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,160
I am…

484
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,720
Mom Luang Maratee Dhevaprom,

485
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,080
the fiancée of M.R. Phudhipat Jutathep.

486
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,960
-Gosh.
-Mom.

487
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,880
-Gosh.
-Mom Luang…

488
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,640
Maratee Dhevaprom.

489
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,880
Jutathep?

490
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,760
Stop. It's none of your business.

491
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,840
Stay put.

492
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,200
I've missed you, my darling wife.

493
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,080
If not for the fact that the job
had to do with an elder I respect,

494
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,120
I wouldn't have driven
all the way to Bangkok.

495
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,480
Have you just arrived?

496
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,360
Why are you waving at me?
I'm tired from the drive.

497
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,800
Sorn.

498
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,160
Go tell them to set the table.

499
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,760
Your dad just had a long, tiring drive.

500
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,000
He must be starving.

501
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,320
Go now.

502
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,240
I brought a lot of souvenirs for you.
Give me a second.

503
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,480
Sure.

504
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,160
The sample collection date is last month.

505
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,560
It has been so tiring today.

506
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,800
I wonder if someone
would be kind enough to feed me.

507
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,440
Over here.

508
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,400
It's so sweet. Thank you.

509
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,640
Hi, Tai. Are your wounds flaring up?

510
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,960
Dr. Chat just voiced his concern.
Do you want me to have a look?

511
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,920
It's all right. I already had
the wounds redressed downstairs.

512
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,880
I actually have a question
for you, Dr. Mes.

513
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,960
What is it?

514
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:21,640
Does Dr. Chat have the title of M.L.?

515
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,720
You didn't know? It was big news
when Dr. Chat got transferred.

516
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,240
I didn't know. I never paid attention.

517
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,800
You're only paying attention now, huh?

518
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,080
Major M.L. Chatklao Jutathep, that's him.

519
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,280
Is there a problem?

520
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,000
No.

521
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,840
I'll be going now.

522
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,920
There must be a problem. Don't you agree?

523
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,560
Who's there?

524
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,280
-Kwan?
-Teacher.

525
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,560
Your dad is here. Just a second.

526
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,880
Chat is on the phone.

527
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,160
You don't look too well.
Is everything all right?

528
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,760
He needs our advice.

529
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,280
He just found out that Kwan
is Mrs. Maratee's daughter.

530
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,160
Tell me about it.

531
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,360
After the incident,

532
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,040
have you had any contact
with Mrs. Maratee?

533
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,200
Not at all. I didn't have a chance.

534
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,200
She was furious with me.

535
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,320
What should I do, Dad?

536
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,120
Do you want me to talk to her?

537
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,120
Is that a good idea?

538
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,960
If you talk to her,
you might make her angrier

539
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,920
or worse, become hostile toward Chat.

540
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,000
How about I talk to her?

541
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,920
I was the cause of the problem.

542
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,160
We'll probably get the same result
with you going.

543
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,880
What should we do?

544
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,480
I don't want to be the cause
of our son's heartbreak.

545
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,760
Chat.

546
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,480
I think you yourself should
have a talk with Maratee.

547
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,160
Sincerity will solve all problems.

548
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,320
Okay, Dad.

549
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,760
I'll handle this matter.

550
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,600
I love Kwanruetai.

551
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,080
I won't give up easily.

552
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,040
I'll show it to Mrs. Maratee

553
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,280
that I sincerely love her daughter.

554
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,960
Even if I had to weather countless storms,
I wouldn't back down.

555
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,400
If Mrs. Manee is really
M.L. Maratee Dhevaprom,

556
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,400
your dad is…

557
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,760
General Pinit Thanasak.

558
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,840
Do you know my dad?

559
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,000
I don't know him, but I've seen his name
mentioned in the newspapers.

560
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,400
It was big news back then.

561
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,600
Every newspaper
was reporting on it for months.

562
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,080
What I find hard to believe

563
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,440
is that your mom and M.L. Maratee
are the same person.

564
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,400
Can you tell me what happened?
I want to know.

565
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,880
From what I can remember,

566
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,520
General Pinit was a womanizer.

567
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,600
He had countless mistresses.

568
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,880
When he passed away,

569
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,200
those mistresses came out
to file for alimony.

570
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,920
One of the mistresses was an M.L.
who had just given birth.

571
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,960
People were admonishing her

572
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,800
for carrying a baby to the court.

573
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,720
That woman

574
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,600
was my mom, wasn't she?

575
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,280
As I recall,
her surname has a "Prom" syllable in it.

576
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,600
What happened next?

577
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,880
Because he had a lot of mistresses,
they all had to fight in court.

578
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,520
The case dragged on
for a considerable time.

579
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,560
In the end, they lost.

580
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,000
That's why…

581
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,520
she has been saying to me
that I'm bad luck since I was a kid.

582
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,840
It might not be as you think.

583
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,280
Since it happened a long time ago,

584
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,840
I can't remember the details.

585
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,080
But if you want to know,

586
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,760
I'll ask my librarian friend
to look it up.

587
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,320
If it's the truth,

588
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,040
now you'll get to know your real dad.

589
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,880
Even if he's my dad,

590
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,240
he was never inclined
to accept me as his daughter.

591
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,760
In the end,

592
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,120
I still don't have a dad.

593
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,800
If that's the case,
what are you going to do?

594
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,120
I'm going to break it off.

595
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,120
Clearly, we aren't supposed to be.

596
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,600
Today, when I heard that you got shot,

597
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,520
I rushed to the army hospital.

598
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,160
But you had already left.

599
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,760
So I went to your home.
I saw you talking with your mom.

600
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,880
We were destined to meet, I guess.

601
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,920
You don't act like someone
who recently got shot.

602
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,560
I'm basically a robot. This is trivial.

603
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,120
Kwan.

604
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,480
If you need any help, tell me.

605
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,520
Don't be shy to ask.

606
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,720
Eat up.

607
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,960
Hello, Doctor.
What brings you to the market?

608
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,960
My hunger, I guess.

609
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,760
The meal delivery didn't come.

610
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,960
I'll take care of this meal for you.
What would you like to have?

611
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,680
Can I have chicken fried rice, topped
with a fried egg? To take away, please.

612
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,880
As you wish. Please wait a moment.

613
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,560
Chicken fried rice,
topped with a fried egg for the doctor.

614
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,240
To take away.

615
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,800
I'll chop up the ingredients.

616
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,400
Thank you.

617
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,200
Would you like anything for your mom?

618
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,040
She's most likely passed out drunk.

619
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,840
That's good. No arguments then.

620
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,760
I'll walk you home.

621
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,400
It's late.

622
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,800
Let's head to the house by the pond.

623
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,840
How are your wounds?

624
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,360
They're better.

625
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,960
This is a lovely house.

626
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,720
Did you save up for it?

627
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,560
Do you think I could afford this?

628
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,440
It was a birthday gift from someone.

629
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,520
They are extremely generous.

630
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,800
I admit defeat.

631
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,480
Come on, Prod.

632
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,400
My stepdad bought it for us.

633
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,440
Your stepdad?

634
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,800
Please don't tell anyone about this.

635
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,800
It's a secret.

636
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,440
I won't say a word.

637
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,080
I'll be going then.

638
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,560
You should get some rest.

639
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,880
Okay. Thanks a lot.

640
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,120
Kong is coming back tonight, isn't he?

641
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,920
Yes. Please remind Kong to come
pick me up tomorrow morning.

642
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,520
I got it. I'm leaving now.

643
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,240
-Okay. Good night.
-Bye.

644
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,280
Why are you hiding there?

645
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,960
What if you scared me to death?

646
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,200
Who is that guy?

647
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,120
What guy?

648
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,920
The guy who was with you at the market
and just walked you home.

649
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,400
A friend.

650
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,520
A friend?

651
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,280
Why did he have to put his arm
on your shoulder like that?

652
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,000
We are…

653
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:57,840
close.

654
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,000
Close?

655
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,280
How close?

656
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,560
We're seeing each other.

657
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,520
Stop with the ploy, will you?

658
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:13,240
Dealing with your mother hating me
by cutting me off,

659
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,880
isn't that too easy?

660
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,240
What about everything
that we have started?

661
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,240
Does it mean nothing to you?

662
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,600
Why don't we fight it together,

663
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,560
prove ourselves to her,
and make her accept us?

664
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,480
You don't know my mom very well.

665
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,960
It's not possible.

666
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:05,080
I might know her better than you do.

667
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,760
I'd rather bear the pain myself

668
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,280
than inflict more pain on her.

669
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,160
The evidence is in your backpack,
yet you're still denying it?

670
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,720
Officer, escort him to the station.

671
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,880
-Come with me. Let's go.
-I know nothing about this. It's not mine.

672
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,160
You must travel to Bangkok.

673
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,040
Find the person addressed on the envelope.

674
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,680
I'm glad we could meet again.

675
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,800
She's our little sister.

676
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,800
I've been meaning to ask if you heard

677
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,560
that your mom has become
Mr. Songpol's mistress.

678
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,840
Shall we enter the bedroom now?

679
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,280
I've been wanting to see her face.

680
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,560
What a shameless, husband-stealing bitch.

681
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,000
Manee, others might not
be a match for you, but I am.

682
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:42,120
Our intelligence identified the presence
of drug cartels along the border.

683
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,600
They used the Thai locals
to smuggle drugs to Bangkok.

684
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,080
We can help you.

685
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,720
But…

686
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,640
First, you must set Kong free.

687
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,520
Let's head to Chiang Rai right away.

688
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,880
