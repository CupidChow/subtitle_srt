1
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,480
I'm afraid my daughter would be upset
about us trying to set her up.

2
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,520
They don't need to find out.

3
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,440
Then let's give that a try.

4
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,520
You're so lovely, Park.
You went to pick her up.

5
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,000
-Hey!
-Let's go.

6
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,960
Follow them!

7
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,040
I heard from people in the mountains

8
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,320
that Hunter Boon and Pon
saw something they shouldn't.

9
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,920
-Is the blood ready?
-Ready.

10
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,320
Let's do it.

11
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,080
Uncle Boon is dead.

12
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,960
I forbid you. Don't get involved in this.

13
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,720
Also, don't forget to place
Mom's order at Arada.

14
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,040
She kept reminding me this morning.

15
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,120
Mr. Chat, you're the best.

16
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,000
Ms. Kej.

17
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,360
Your mom asked me to give you this.

18
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,880
Sorry for interrupting your--

19
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,680
Hey.

20
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,440
Chat.

21
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,680
Park.

22
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,960
What are you doing here?

23
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,519
Check it out.
I'll show you how to take it off.

24
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,320
-Ouch!
-Wow.

25
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,680
-Wow.
-Wow.

26
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,720
Take a look. I'll put it back on.

27
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
There you go.

28
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,800
What the heck are you guys doing here?

29
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,640
What?

30
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,760
Come on, Tai.

31
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,880
We're just getting to the fun part.

32
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,320
Let's go home.

33
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,320
Did you finish getting the dress made?
Why was it so quick?

34
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,080
I'm not getting it made.
I'm not in the mood anymore.

35
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,560
-What? Tai.
-Tai.

36
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,880
-Tai.
-Tai.

37
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,160
-Hey, hurry up.
-Let's go.

38
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,520
-Hey, Tai. Wait up.
-Tai.

39
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,640
I'm staying at the hotel now
for convenience.

40
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,440
After the company finishes furnishing,
I might turn upstairs into a living space.

41
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,960
I'm really happy
that you're starting a company here.

42
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,520
It makes me worry less about Kej.

43
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,960
With you nearby, if anything comes up,
you can reach her quickly.

44
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,760
Our mothers probably have more in mind.

45
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,240
They've got everything planned out.

46
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,440
I think you two are a great match.

47
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,840
Can we go, Chat?

48
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,440
Mrs. Arada is probably at the shop by now.

49
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,280
I have to take my mom to the airport too.

50
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,680
Let's catch up when we're free.

51
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,320
Take care of Kej for me.

52
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,360
Chat, why did you
ask him to take care of me?

53
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
I'm a grown-up. I can take care of myself.

54
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't need a nagging guardian
controlling me.

55
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,400
Don't worry, Chat.

56
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm here every day
to oversee the furnishing.

57
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,920
Arada Boutique is just right here.

58
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,240
I'll help keep a watch
morning, noon, and evening.

59
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,040
Let's go, Chat.

60
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,000
Slow down, Wit.

61
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,440
I've missed you so much.

62
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,720
But Mrs. Da will be here soon.

63
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,640
Please hurry.

64
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,880
Thank you so much, honey.

65
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,360
Wit!

66
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,680
What are you doing at the cash counter?

67
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,440
I just took a call.

68
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,800
Are you trying to steal the money?

69
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,200
Hey, tone it down.

70
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,400
You're always picking fights.
I'm your brother.

71
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,080
Last month, some money
from my shop also went missing.

72
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,520
Let me search you.

73
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,680
Don't. Why are you searching me? Back off.

74
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,520
-Leave me alone!
-Where is it?

75
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,200
-Where is it?
-Where is it?

76
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,560
Leave me alone.
Why the hell are you searching me?

77
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,200
-Leave me alone. Let go!
-Where is it?

78
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,240
It's the shop's money.

79
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,360
-You thief!
-It's my money.

80
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,320
-Give it back right now!
-Give it back!

81
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,160
-Give it back!
-Do you want to get hurt?

82
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,640
-Wit, you can't take Mom's money!
-What's your problem?

83
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,000
It's my money! Back off!

84
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,720
I know what you're buying with it.

85
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,920
You junkie!

86
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,600
-Junkie? Do you want to die?
-Let go!

87
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,280
-Let go of her!
-Do you want to die?

88
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,960
-Hey, do you have a problem?
-Let go!

89
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,920
-Do you have a problem with me?
-Wit! Let go!

90
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,080
-Hey!
-Let go!

91
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,559
Go away!

92
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,120
-You jerk!
-Let go of your sister now!

93
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,200
Oh no, what's going on here?

94
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,760
How were you watching the shop?

95
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,200
We just got robbed by a thief.

96
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,960
Wan,

97
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,400
who are you calling a thief?

98
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,680
Do you still have to ask? Who else?

99
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,000
Mom, search Wit now.
He stole money from the shop.

100
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,640
It's not true, Mom.

101
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,080
Oy is just picking a fight with me.

102
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,480
I'll search him myself.

103
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,560
-I'll help you.
-Leave me alone!

104
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,880
-Where is it?
-Hey!

105
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,720
-I know you have it.
-Stop!

106
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,400
Stop! Enough of this.

107
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,680
What happened, Mrs. Da?

108
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,720
-Hello.
-Hello.

109
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Wit,

110
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,120
wait for me in my office.

111
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,600
Sure, Mom.

112
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,040
Please come inside.

113
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,560
This is Orawan, my eldest daughter.

114
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,440
She works at a bank in Bangkok.

115
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,640
And here's my youngest, Orawee.

116
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,640
You can call me Oy, Doctor.

117
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
Just Wan is fine.

118
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,600
And that's Pilai, our shop's accountant.

119
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,880
You're stationed
at the army hospital, right?

120
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,960
Yes, how do you know?

121
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,760
I heard our clients talking about

122
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,160
this new handsome doctor from Bangkok.

123
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,360
You're definitely the one.

124
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,040
Take it down a notch, Pilai.

125
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,400
Where are your manners?

126
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,960
It's all right.

127
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,200
Get back to work.

128
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Of course.

129
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,320
Don't worry, Mr. Chat.

130
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
We work as a family in our shop.

131
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,880
Right, I think I saw your shop
at JT Center in Bangkok.

132
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,920
Yes, that's the second branch.

133
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,480
I'm planning to have Oy take over.

134
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,440
The original shop is in Siam Square.

135
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,360
Wan has been running it for me.

136
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,600
So why did you open a new branch
all the way here in Chiang Rai?

137
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,160
It's far from Bangkok
but close to my mother.

138
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,600
She's unwell
with age-related health issues.

139
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,480
I wanted to have time
to take care of her closely,

140
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,680
so I decided to open a branch here.

141
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,920
And I'm lucky

142
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,800
to have Ms. Kej as the manager.

143
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,720
I'll do my absolute best

144
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,920
to make sure your trust is well-placed.

145
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,080
Hey.

146
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,200
So when will my dress be ready?

147
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,720
Did you meet Mrs. Arada?

148
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,360
Did you tell her about my large collection
of her clothes? Was she pleased?

149
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,600
I haven't placed the order yet.

150
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,600
What?

151
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,280
What on earth?

152
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,080
You were gone for half a day.

153
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,400
Why didn't you place the order?

154
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,560
The shop was closed, Mom.

155
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,040
Darn it!

156
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,240
You are a bad luck.

157
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,040
Always getting in the way of my happiness.

158
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,960
I'll go to the shop again
for you next time.

159
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,160
If Kong were a woman,
I wouldn't need your help.

160
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
You're just not reliable.

161
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,360
Kong, are you leaving now?

162
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,680
Yes.

163
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,960
When will you be back?

164
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,520
I'll be back in time for Loy Krathong.

165
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,880
Really?

166
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,880
But I'll lose my mind before the festival
because of your beloved sister!

167
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,760
Mom,

168
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,240
treat yourself and feel better.

169
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
1,500 baht?

170
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,760
-Just 1,500 baht?
-Mom.

171
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,080
Kong has to pay for your dress too.

172
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,600
It's not cheap either.

173
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,440
Stay out of it.

174
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,840
No one asked for your opinion.

175
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,320
Sort out your own mess first.

176
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,800
I'm going now, Mom.

177
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,200
Kwan, don't forget to make congee
for Hunter Boon's funeral.

178
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,600
Sure.

179
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
And apologize to Chalam for me

180
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,560
that I can't be there.

181
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,920
Hey, you two already went to
the cleansing ritual this morning.

182
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,080
Why go through more trouble?

183
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,440
They aren't even our relatives.

184
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,000
Why must you waste money
on making a meal for their guests too?

185
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,800
Why?

186
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,840
Are we suddenly rich or what?

187
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,520
Let's go now. I'll take you on my bike.

188
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,720
-I'm off now, Mom.
-Okay.

189
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,440
My brother is quite popular.

190
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,400
Women all over the province
must know you by now.

191
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,360
It's probably just a coincidence.

192
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,280
Don't be too modest.

193
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,880
How was it? You saw where I work.

194
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,240
Do you feel more at ease?

195
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
I always believed in you, Kej.

196
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,000
You lived alone in France for years.

197
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,120
Living in Chiang Rai
should be a walk in the park.

198
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,520
It's our parents
who should feel more at ease.

199
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,120
Then tonight, my tattletale brother,

200
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,480
don't forget to call and update them.

201
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,160
If I'm worried about anything,

202
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,640
it's that family's son.

203
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,880
He was giving you very flirtatious looks.

204
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,440
I've dealt with worse.

205
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Just a bit of looking isn't a big deal.

206
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,960
Got it, my strong little sister.

207
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,360
I'll be a spy and visit you
at the hospital sometime.

208
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,120
Just to check if you're hiding a woman.

209
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,960
What are you talking about?

210
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,280
I've only been here a few days

211
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,920
and I've got a ton of work.

212
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,640
Where would I find time to find a woman?

213
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,120
You're defending yourself pretty hard.

214
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,360
That's odd.

215
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,560
Just get back to work now.

216
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,160
No, I'm going to walk you
to your car first.

217
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,800
So where are you off to next?

218
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,840
I'm just going home to rest.

219
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,760
I have a funeral to attend tonight.

220
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,880
Mom lent me some money to invest.

221
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,320
Investing in your drug habit?

222
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,440
Hey, Oy.

223
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,960
Tone it down.

224
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,960
I'm your brother.

225
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,880
You're getting more disrespectful.

226
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,360
Then act like a brother
who deserves respect.

227
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,280
Aren't you in a hurry, Wit?

228
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,680
I'll call you, Mom.

229
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,880
See you later, beautiful.

230
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,320
Why do you always end up giving Wit money?

231
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,960
He's in trouble. I have to help him.

232
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,880
Mom, Wit has a gambling addiction.
You know that.

233
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,600
One day, he'll use up
all your inheritance.

234
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,360
Lower your voice, Oy.
Show some consideration for Ms. Kej.

235
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,040
Why bother?
She's just an employee at our shop.

236
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,000
She'll find out sooner or later.

237
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,040
That's right.

238
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,400
What kind of brother is he?
He doesn't work.

239
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,040
He just keeps asking for handouts.

240
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,280
Haven't you noticed

241
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,200
how Wit looks more worn out each day?
Just like a junkie.

242
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,640
That's enough, Oy.

243
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,240
Who taught you to talk
about your brother like this?

244
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,800
You're unfair, Mom.
You only love your son.

245
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,200
-You don't love your children equally.
-You don't love your children equally.

246
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,440
You're giving me
a less profitable branch to run.

247
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,240
What are you talking about?

248
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,280
I love all of you equally.

249
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,000
Then you should make a will
and divide the inheritance now.

250
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,920
That's right. If you leave it like this,

251
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,400
we'll all end up with nothing.

252
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,400
I'm not dead yet.

253
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,880
Why are you talking about
dividing the inheritance so casually?

254
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,480
Please excuse me.

255
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,920
Let's talk in my office.

256
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,800
They're so annoying.

257
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,880
When will those two bitches
go back to Bangkok?

258
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,600
Kwan, you love this place, don't you?

259
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,360
Yes.

260
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,960
Then it's yours.

261
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,720
Really, Dad?

262
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Yes.

263
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,040
I'll put the house and the land here

264
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,400
in your name.

265
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,400
It's a secret between us.

266
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,800
Okay.

267
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,640
Thank you, Dad.

268
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,200
Kwan,

269
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,120
you need to remember

270
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,560
you're not bad luck.

271
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,200
I've waited all my life
to have a daughter.

272
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,320
You're a gift to me from heaven.

273
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,160
I have another gift for you.

274
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,240
Come.

275
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,120
I know you've had your eye on it.

276
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,440
Here.

277
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,760
You went to try it on
at Jay Kiaw's shop every day, didn't you?

278
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,040
Mom might not like you
wearing pretty clothes,

279
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,960
but I do.

280
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
I'll secretly buy you more.

281
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,080
Okay.

282
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
This house

283
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,480
will be a place where you

284
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
can be your true self.

285
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,640
You can do whatever you want here.

286
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,720
MAISEEK AND SUMLEE ARE IN LOVE…

287
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,480
Today, Kong has gone
to Lamphun for a catering job.

288
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,600
I'm alone with Mom.

289
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,480
I'm not used to it.

290
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,240
BOONSUK SINGSIN

291
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,520
My condolences.

292
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,280
Please take care of Pon for me, Doctor.

293
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,480
Don't worry.

294
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,520
I'll do my best to care for him.

295
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,280
Thank you, Doctor.

296
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,480
It's like we're the doctors' plus ones.

297
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,040
The husbands lead. The wives follow.

298
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,640
Perfect couples.

299
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,560
Maybe the men are one couple,
and the women are another, Da.

300
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,040
-Hey.
-Ouch!

301
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,960
Why do you always
have to shatter my dreams, Fon?

302
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,160
Hello.

303
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,240
My condolences.

304
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,120
Thank you, ma'am.

305
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,080
To help keep things afloat.

306
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,440
Thank you.

307
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,960
Boon is already dead.

308
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,880
Those still living

309
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,560
should learn to keep quiet.

310
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,200
Understand?

311
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,200
Yes.

312
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,320
Goodness.

313
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,200
I didn't expect Mr. Songpol

314
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,840
-to show up at this funeral.
-Hello.

315
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,440
That's right, Da.
He even brought his wife.

316
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,400
How do you think they met?

317
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,240
She's pretty.
It's the first time I've seen her.

318
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,080
Mistresses are usually pretty.

319
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,840
Why say that, Da?
His first wife died a long time ago.

320
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,280
If she hadn't, how would
this one have moved up?

321
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,520
Mr. Songpol

322
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,280
Dr. Chat is here. Why didn't you tell me?

323
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,640
How was I supposed to know?

324
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,720
What?

325
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,680
Thank you.

326
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Tai.

327
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,000
-Are you good?
-Tai.

328
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,600
Tai, can I help you with anything?

329
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,680
Ouch!

330
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,960
Just stay far away.

331
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,160
Is this far enough?

332
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
Tai, no.

333
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,760
It's congee for the guests.

334
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,160
-Hey!
-Busted!

335
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,040
Did you just put a love spell on me?

336
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,360
-I love you.
-Stay away. I'm annoyed.

337
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,920
Tai.

338
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,240
Hey,

339
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,800
how are my moves with the ladies?

340
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,680
Feel free to use them. I don't mind.

341
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,320
I still have plenty of moves left.

342
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,640
-Mom.
-Come home with me.

343
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,320
What's with you, Mom?

344
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,960
The ceremony hasn't even started yet.

345
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,120
Just come with me.
How can I go home alone?

346
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,080
Let's go.

347
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,240
Come now. Come with me.

348
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,160
-Hey, tell Tai that I miss her.
-Jeez.

349
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,600
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

350
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,880
Hello.

351
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,520
This is Dr. Chatklao.

352
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,320
Oh, it's you.

353
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,520
I've heard a lot about you
in the last few days.

354
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,280
And I finally meet
Dr. Chat in person today.

355
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,400
It's good we haven't met until now.

356
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,480
That means you're healthy.

357
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,480
You're right.

358
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,200
Why did Ms. Sunant leave so early?

359
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,400
-The ceremony hasn't even started.
-Well…

360
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,840
She has to attend another one.
We share duties.

361
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,680
Nice to meet you.

362
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Likewise.

363
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,520
I'm glad for the locals

364
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,720
that we have a skilled doctor

365
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,440
at the hospital here.

366
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,920
Stay and help out the folks here

367
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,880
for a long time, okay?

368
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,320
I will.

369
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,640
-Hello, sir.
-Oh, hello.

370
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,000
-How have you been? All good?
-Yes, all good.

371
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,960
It's better
to keep your distance, Mr. Chat.

372
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,640
He's dangerous.

373
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,120
-Tai.
-What?

374
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,760
That doctor is looking at you.

375
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,960
Are you crazy? Why would he?

376
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,720
It's true, Tai.

377
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,840
Look, he's gazing at you so sweetly,

378
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,600
-like a man fawning over a woman.
-Right.

379
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,080
Tai's a woman too,

380
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,840
but just a touch of woman
and a whole lot of man.

381
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,880
Stop talking.

382
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,840
Hey, you're asking for pain, aren't you?

383
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,480
Come on, just admit you're shy.

384
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,000
-Tai, your hand hits hard.
-Whoa.

385
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,120
Not just my hands.
My feet hit hard as well.

386
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,440
Keep talking, and I'll put my fist
in your mouth and take out your teeth.

387
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,000
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

388
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,880
Do it on your own.
I won't help you anymore.

389
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,560
-What? Tai.
-What? Tai.

390
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,880
It's because of you, Sumlee.
You upset her.

391
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,080
What? You're the one who started it.
Don't blame me.

392
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,199
But that sweet-faced doctor
is really checking out Tai.

393
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,840
Exactly. Maybe he's not gay?

394
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,040
You're dancing with death, sweet-faced.

395
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Out of anyone, you had to go for my boss.

396
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,800
-You chose absolutely the wrong one.
-Yes.

397
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,320
I need to use the bathroom.

398
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,320
-Want me to come with you?
-It's okay.

399
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,360
Well, I'm hungry.
I'll see what Tai is preparing.

400
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,960
Okay? Be right back.

401
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,880
Finally, we have some alone time.

402
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,840
Tai.

403
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,960
What? Tai! Hold on, Tai!

404
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,040
Hey.

405
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,880
Let go!

406
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,640
Let go of me.

407
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,640
I just want to talk

408
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,440
to clear things up between us.

409
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,360
But I have nothing to talk about with you.

410
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,160
I've told you
I don't want to be your friend.

411
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,960
Will you stop pestering me?

412
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,280
It'd be great if I could turn
back time and change things.

413
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,200
You wouldn't feel this way about me.

414
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,520
So this is what a player sounds like.

415
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,280
You hug a man one moment,
a woman the next.

416
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,320
It's all a front
to cover up the truth, right?

417
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,840
Do you think I can't see through it?

418
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,880
Hey, what are you talking about?
I really don't understand.

419
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,960
Mr. Chat.

420
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,640
Gosh. The monks are here, Mr. Chat.

421
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,480
Hey, Tai.

422
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,360
Dr. Mes, be careful.
You might get your heart broken.

423
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,960
Falling for someone so fickle.

424
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,720
I think

425
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,120
you must be misunderstanding something.

426
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
You sly,

427
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,560
-slippery,
-Hey.

428
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,520
-Hey.
-two-faced man.

429
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,520
Whoa, she fired shots without stopping.

430
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,320
What was she talking about?

431
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,320
I'm really confused.

432
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,000
I think it looks like a couple
fighting because of jealousy, Mr. Chat.

433
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
You're insane.

434
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,640
Mr. Chat, wait for me.

435
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,080
Pon still hasn't woken up, sir.

436
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,840
Isn't he just the luckiest?

437
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,440
He has got a concussion.

438
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
If he wakes up, he might remember nothing.

439
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,440
It's better if he doesn't.

440
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,720
Keep a close eye on him.

441
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,160
Find the right moment.

442
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,680
Yes, sir.

443
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,920
Oh, Doctor, you're here too?

444
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,640
-Yes.
-Well…

445
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,000
The monks are about to begin their prayer.
We should go upstairs.

446
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
It's that new doctor

447
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,400
who's in charge of Pon's care.

448
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,760
Keep a close eye on him
in case Pon tips him off.

449
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,560
Yes, sir.

450
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,440
But don't start trouble with him.

451
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,960
He's the commander-in-chief's nephew.

452
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,440
Yes, sir.

453
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,080
Tai.

454
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,440
-It's just me.
-You startled me.

455
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,840
-Come here.
-What is it?

456
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,640
-What is it?
-Fon,

457
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,600
I need a favor.

458
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,360
What's with the secrecy?

459
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,680
I want to visit Pon.

460
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,280
Can you help me out?

461
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,440
That's a bit difficult, Tai.
Dr. Chat isn't allowing visits right now.

462
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,600
I'm worried about Pon.

463
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,880
Pon is in the doctor's care. Don't worry.

464
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,680
Visiting him now won't make a difference.

465
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,800
He hasn't woken up yet.

466
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,000
Then when Pon wakes up,

467
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,440
you have to find a way
to bring me in to see him.

468
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,760
I can't promise, Tai,

469
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,920
but I'll try.

470
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,360
Thank you.

471
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,720
Hello.

472
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,960
Hello.

473
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,320
What?

474
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,200
What were you looking for?

475
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,520
I wasn't looking for anything.

476
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,680
Please.

477
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,400
That'll be 100 baht.

478
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,360
Why are you following me?

479
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,480
Who's following you?

480
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,760
I'm not following you.

481
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,480
My company is this way too.

482
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,520
Doctor.

483
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,520
Pon just woke up.

484
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,480
He's trying to remove the restraints.
He's not listening to anyone.

485
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,680
-I'll check on him now.
-Okay.

486
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,520
-Patient.
-Patient.

487
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,400
-Patient, please stay still.
-Hang on, the doctor is on his way.

488
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,720
-We can't remove those just yet.
-Pon.

489
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,560
Try and stay calm. Dr. Chat is here.

490
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,280
-The doctor is here.
-Pon.

491
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,840
If you can hear
and understand what I'm saying

492
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,280
squeeze my finger.

493
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,880
How is his breathing?

494
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,280
He should be able
to breathe without the machine.

495
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,760
-Switch the tube for an oxygen mask.
-Got it, Doctor.

496
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,600
Pon,

497
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,880
I will have the nurses
take out the breathing tube

498
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,240
to prevent any risk of infection.

499
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,240
Now you might not be able to talk.

500
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,760
Get plenty of rest.

501
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,960
I'll have the nurse give you a medication
to reduce swelling in your neck.

502
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,960
-Hello, Mrs. Da.
-Hello.

503
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,840
You're here so early.

504
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,800
Wow, this dress is stunning.

505
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,000
I wish I could make
a traditional Thai dress like this.

506
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,640
Stick around for a while,

507
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,640
and I'll turn you into a pro.

508
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,000
Thank you.

509
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,920
Did a client order it to be made?

510
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,640
No, I actually made it last year,

511
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,760
but I couldn't finish it
in time for the contest.

512
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,240
What contest?

513
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,760
Miss Noppamas Contest.

514
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,720
You might not know, but Arada Boutique
got attention at Miss Noppamas Contests.

515
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,600
But we truly made a mark when we

516
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,640
made a wedding dress
for the minister's daughter.

517
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,560
That must mean
if anyone wears an Arada Boutique dress,

518
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,600
they're a sure winner for Miss Noppamas.

519
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,040
Something like that.

520
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,560
But this year,

521
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,320
I've found a strong contender,

522
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
so I brought it out for a few tweaks.

523
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,800
No, Mrs. Da.
I won't ever take center stage.

524
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,440
What? Why not, Ms. Kej?

525
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,360
You have got a great figure
and a modern look.

526
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,320
How about this? I'll be your scout.

527
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,840
But it's almost Loy Krathong now.

528
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,920
If we can't find someone as pretty as you,
you can't turn me down.

529
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,800
I just want more people in Chiang Rai
to know about Arada Boutique.

530
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,520
Hello.

531
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,120
Hello.

532
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,160
I'm here to order a dress for my mother.

533
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,040
Mr. Chat, you're the best.

534
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,040
Heaven sent us our Noppamas contestant.

535
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,080
Come, please have a seat.

536
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,160
Okay.

537
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,120
-Please wait here, ma'am.
-Okay.

538
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,640
Yes, I advise you to observe
the symptoms for two more days.

539
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,200
Okay, goodbye.

540
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,400
-Hello.
-Hello.

541
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,280
Goodness.

542
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,320
-Hi, Village Headman, Somsri.
-Hi.

543
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,960
Your whole family is here today.

544
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,240
What's going on? Don't tell me

545
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,560
everyone in the family is sick.

546
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,480
Is Dr. Chatklao making his rounds today?

547
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,360
He makes his rounds
every day without fail.

548
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,880
-I see.
-I see. What room is he in?

549
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,400
He's in Room 6.

550
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,360
-Thank you.
-Sure.

551
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,640
You have got a pretty smile.

552
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,760
-Honey.
-Ouch!

553
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,080
I see, that's Room 6 over there.

554
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,120
ROOM 6

555
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,280
Young man,

556
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,520
let me cut in line to see the doctor.

557
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,840
Of course, Village Headman.

558
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,040
Very good.

559
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,000
You show great respect.

560
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,360
Here it is.

561
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,800
Mali.

562
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,960
It's Menie, Mom.

563
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,240
Come here!

564
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,200
Menie, have a seat, honey.

565
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,600
So pretty.

566
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,440
Your mother is still in good shape.

567
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,680
My mother cares a lot
about her appearance.

568
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,560
It's a shame she didn't come with you.

569
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,000
I'd really like to meet her.

570
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,640
She's an old customer from Bangkok too.

571
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,600
She said she wasn't feeling well.

572
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,200
Don't worry about the dress.

573
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,360
I'll make it the best I can,

574
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,160
even prettier than
the photo in the magazine.

575
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,880
Thank you so much.

576
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,800
Excuse me, I should get going.

577
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,200
I have to get back to work.

578
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,640
Hold on.

579
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,280
Do you mind taking off your cap for me?

580
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,600
Well…

581
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,520
I just want to see your face clearly.

582
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,320
Do it for me.

583
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,480
You're really pretty.

584
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,200
Ms. Kej, you have a good eye.

585
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,680
Lovely bone structure,
small lips and nose.

586
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,120
What's all this about?

587
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,800
Have you ever entered a beauty contest?

588
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,960
No, never.

589
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,840
And how do you feel about
giving the Miss Noppamas Contest a try?

590
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,800
Oh no, I'd rather not.

591
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,200
I'm not good at that.

592
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,440
I should go now.

593
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,520
-Well…
-You'll be paid for entering the contest.

594
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,640
I'll pay you 2,000 baht.

595
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,560
2,000 baht

596
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,600
for the day?

597
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,480
That's right.

598
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,600
Whether you win or not, I'll pay you.

599
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,640
I make less in a month
from my meal service.

600
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,840
And if you're lucky enough to win,

601
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,240
there's a 50,000-baht prize.

602
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,520
I won't deduct
a single baht from your prize.

603
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,560
I just want to promote my boutique

604
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,160
and make it more well-known in Chiang Rai.

605
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,560
But can someone like me do this?

606
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,120
Hello, I'm Menie.

607
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,400
I'm here with my mother
and my father, the village headman.

608
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,600
Well, who's sick today?

609
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,240
No, there's nothing wrong
with any of us, Doctor.

610
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,960
We're just here to introduce ourselves
and get to know you.

611
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,440
Well,

612
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,000
nice to meet you.

613
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,880
Now that everyone knows each other,
could you step outside?

614
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,560
People are waiting to see the doctor.

615
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:29,680
Dr. Chat, I'd like to invite you
to join us for lunch today.

616
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,840
I hope you'll give us the honor.

617
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,160
People usually don't say no
to Village Headman Tuek, Doctor.

618
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,760
Well…

619
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,240
If it's around noon today,

620
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,840
I have some time.

621
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,720
-Wow.
-That's perfect, Doctor.

622
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,680
Our timing is spot on.

623
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,840
-Destiny brought us together, right?
-That's right!

624
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,120
-Lunch today.
-Now that you're done, this way, please.

625
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,160
-Come, honey.
-Okay.

626
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,360
This way, please.

627
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,240
Mrs. Da,

628
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,800
this dress looks like it was made for her.

629
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,200
Let me take a look.

630
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,840
Just need to tighten it a bit,
and it'll be just right.

631
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,760
If I get my hair and makeup done,

632
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,800
no one will recognize me, right?

633
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,680
I guarantee it.

634
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,800
That's a relief.

635
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,360
You're quite odd.

636
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,960
Most people want to be
famous and well-known,

637
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,280
but you're worried
people might recognize you.

638
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,520
And can I use a different name?

639
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,160
You can pick any name you like,

640
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,040
or Mrs. Da can give you a new one.

641
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,400
Well, then,

642
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,240
I'll come up with a name that suits you.

643
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,240
What's your name? We've been chatting,
but I still don't know your name.

644
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,480
I'm Kej.

645
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,280
I'm Kwanruetai, or you can just call me…

646
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,680
You can just call me Kwan.

647
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,680
Okay.

648
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,560
But I can't promise yet
that I'll enter the contest for you.

649
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,360
I'm just gathering information
before I make up my mind.

650
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,880
-Look, Mali is…
-It's Menie, Mom.

651
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,160
Okay, Menie.

652
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,400
Menie's a physical therapist.

653
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,600
She graduated in this field, Doctor.

654
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,760
Right, Doctor. I'm thinking of pulling
some strings to get her a job here,

655
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,000
so she can be closer to you.

656
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,880
-I mean, so she can have a stable career.
-That's right.

657
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,040
-Are you sore? I'm good at massaging.
-No, I'm not sore.

658
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,560
I'm sorry.

659
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,760
I have an emergency patient
who needs immediate surgery.

660
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,360
I can't join you for lunch anymore.
Excuse me.

661
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,840
Doctor?

662
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,440
-Dr. Chat!
-What should we do?

663
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,880
I couldn't grab him.

664
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,560
Dr. Chat must not like me.

665
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,320
He must think I'm not good enough for him.

666
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,280
There, there.
Don't think like that, darling.

667
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,560
You're Village Headman Tuek's only
daughter, the famous local millionaire.

668
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,920
How can you not be good enough for him?

669
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,360
Relax, honey.

670
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,520
Once you have a title to your name,

671
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,840
everything will get easier.

672
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,960
What title, Mom?

673
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,480
Miss Noppamas of our province.

674
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,800
You're right, Mom.

675
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,280
She suddenly transformed.

676
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,320
-She's quick on her feet.
-I'm Menie.

677
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,040
-Nice!
-Keep practicing, honey.

678
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,520
-Nice!
-Nice!

679
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,880
Thank you so much, Mrs. Da.

680
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,240
It's no big deal.

681
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,640
My doctor, my protection.

682
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,080
So what do you want for lunch?

683
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,600
Is Tai selling her food today?

684
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,680
No, she's not.

685
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,040
I'll pick up something
from the alley next to the hospital.

686
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,920
Do you want anything in particular?

687
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,120
I'm fine with anything.
You can pick for me.

688
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,120
Just not too spicy.

689
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,280
-Not spicy, you got it.
-Thank you.

690
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,880
-Sure.
-I'll be in the staff lounge.

691
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,040
Go ahead.

692
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,720
Mrs. Arada is really kind.

693
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,000
She's making a dress for my mother
completely free of charge.

694
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,760
If you find the time, drop by the shop.

695
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,320
I'll help you with walking
and wearing high heels,

696
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,240
and we can practice
makeup and hair together.

697
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,080
Just give it a shot. If you really
can't do it, I won't force you.

698
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,480
Your look and figure are great already.
We can work on other things.

699
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,880
Don't keep me waiting.

700
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,800
Okay, if I have the time, I'll stop by.

701
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,800
Thank you.

702
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,560
Kej, are you into fortune reading?

703
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,040
Do you know how to read fortunes?

704
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,720
Whoa, you should watch out for playboys.

705
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,760
This line clearly suggests
there's one around you now.

706
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,120
This guy looks sharp.

707
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,880
His work is related to helping others.

708
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,840
On the outside, he looks polite,
has a sweet smile, and seems sincere,

709
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:10,440
But underneath,
he's sly, two-faced, unfaithful,

710
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,960
and the best at taking advantage.

711
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,400
Can hand lines really tell all that, Kwan?

712
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,200
That's right.
I've seen this on many people, Kej.

713
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,040
Don't worry. I'm always careful.

714
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,880
He doesn't seem very trustworthy anyway.

715
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,400
Good to hear.
I don't want to see someone as kind as you

716
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,920
get hurt over something like this.

717
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,640
Thank you.

718
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,960
Hey, hold on.

719
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,760
Did you meet Mrs. Arada?

720
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,240
Yes, I did.

721
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,360
Is she still looking good

722
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,480
with that radiant aura?

723
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,800
It was my first time seeing her.

724
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,200
Mrs. Arada looked pretty
and seemed really nice.

725
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,440
Did you let her know what I told you?

726
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,440
I did.

727
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,080
I told her about your love
for her dressmaking

728
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,960
and the big collection
of her dresses you have.

729
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:20,000
Exactly. This one's also from her.
See, isn't it pretty? Look at the lace.

730
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,120
Oh, and Mrs. Arada said
she'd like to meet you.

731
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,800
I told her that when I pick the dress up,

732
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,320
I'll try to have you join me.

733
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,920
You're nosy.

734
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,280
Who told you to do more than I asked?

735
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,600
You're dumb but trying to act smart.

736
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,200
Why would I go all the way there?

737
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,320
Do you want me to ride
on the back of your bike?

738
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,280
Come on, use your head.

739
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,240
Don't let it just sit there.

740
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,800
You don't have
anything else to ask me, right?

741
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,760
Hold on.

742
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,680
How much does it cost?

743
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,320
The cost…

744
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,520
They gave a special rate
for old customers, just like you said.

745
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,280
Good. Now get out of here.

746
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,640
I returned the money
meant for the dress, Kong.

747
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,400
You've been working tirelessly
for us for so long.

748
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,560
I'll get you tens of thousands, Kong.

749
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,480
Even if it means

750
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,400
doing something I don't want to.

751
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,960
PG Engineer.

752
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,840
What would you like?

753
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,320
Oh, okay.

754
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,960
I'll have pineapple, watermelon,

755
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,760
and guava, two pieces of each.

756
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,360
-Okay.
-I'll come back for it.

757
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,280
Okay.

758
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,960
It's a big company.

759
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,320
Well, what can I do for you?

760
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:51,960
Well…

761
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,360
The company isn't open yet.

762
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,360
We're in the middle of decorating.

763
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,520
I see, I thought it was already open.

764
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,560
Not yet.

765
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,160
Please come back later.

766
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,280
I nearly embarrassed myself.

767
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,320
Are you here to order a dress?

768
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,240
Ms. Kej.

769
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,600
Well,

770
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,960
I was walking by

771
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,080
and saw the pretty dress.

772
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,080
I had to stop and look.

773
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,120
Why were you walking past here?

774
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,560
Your company is on the other side.

775
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,320
Do you know where my company is?

776
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,760
Did you scope it out?

777
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,560
Do you think you're that interesting?

778
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,280
You're nitpicking me, aren't you?

779
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,600
Your mother and brother

780
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,760
kept telling me to do it,

781
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,080
so I'm just following orders.

782
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,200
I'll take you home this evening.

783
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,280
My place is just right here.
I can walk home myself.

784
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,560
Your brother asked me to.

785
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,560
He wants me to know where you live.

786
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,280
So if something happens, I can find you.

787
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,960
Chat is always meddling.

788
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,120
When do you get off work?

789
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,480
You'll know when.

790
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,000
-Where should I wait for you?
-Wait wherever you want.

791
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,240
Then I'll see you when I see you.
Or maybe I won't.

792
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,400
You say that as if I asked you to.

793
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,080
Mr. Park.

794
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,240
Oh, hey.

795
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,480
Do you know Mr. Park?

796
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,160
Do you two know each other?

797
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,840
This lady came to see you at the company.

798
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:00,320
Don't tell me Mrs. Krongkaew
told you to keep an eye on me too.

799
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,280
ARADA

800
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,120
It's a pull door.

801
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,280
The full amount, no more, no less.

802
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,800
I've paid off my debt, Ah Go.

803
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,080
Sure, I'll cross it out.

804
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,280
In the meantime,
what do you like to drink today, Tai?

805
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,760
Let me know.

806
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,720
Oliang, iced tea, iced black tea,

807
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,240
or the usual?

808
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,800
Come on, Ah Go,

809
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,120
you never take a break
from selling, do you?

810
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,000
How come it never crossed
your mind to treat us, Ah Go?

811
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,800
Hey, there are no freebies here.

812
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,040
You haven't even paid for the last ones.
Be glad I'm not charging you interest.

813
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,560
I'm sorry.

814
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,840
Tai.

815
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,120
Tai, my dear.

816
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,760
Tai, what do you want today?
Order up. It's on me.

817
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,600
Wow, we're in for a treat, Sumlee.

818
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,000
-Ah Go!
-It's not for you guys.

819
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,200
It's just for Tai.

820
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,600
What will it be?

821
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,000
The usual for Chai and me, Ah Go.

822
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,040
Sure, hang on.

823
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,600
I'll make it perfect for you.

824
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,880
Don't keep me waiting.

825
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,760
Tai, aren't you selling your food today?

826
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,960
If I was, would I be sitting here?

827
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,000
Exactly, Sorn. You shouldn't have asked.

828
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,480
Chai, are you with me or what?

829
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,240
-Go sit over there. Take my side.
-Okay.

830
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,520
One iced black tea, less sweet, Ah Go.

831
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,440
Sure thing, beautiful. Hang on a second.

832
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,760
Find a seat. There's a bit of a wait.

833
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,840
Have a seat.

834
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,440
Hey!

835
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,160
You're drooling.

836
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,760
No matter how many years go by,

837
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,680
you're still as scruffy as ever, Tai.

838
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,000
Then why come back to our village?

839
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,280
Why not stay away after leaving?

840
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,080
Is this your village?

841
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,600
Whether I come or go, it's my business.

842
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,880
But you've gotten much prettier.

843
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,600
Pretty enough to be
this year's Miss Noppamas?

844
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,840
-You're joining the Miss Noppamas Contest?
-Of course.

845
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,480
I'm this pretty.
It'd be strange not to have a title.

846
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,200
That's true.

847
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:34,520
In the whole province, I don't see
anyone prettier than you, Mali.

848
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,800
It's Menie.

849
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,840
I've changed my name. Get it right.

850
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,880
Wow,

851
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,640
I'll be cheering for you
in front of the stage, Menie.

852
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:48,120
Then I'll be singing your song
to cheer you on in front of the stage too.

853
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,520
-Mali Brand Milk, fresh and new
-Mali Brand Milk, fresh and new

854
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,160
-Every drop
-Every drop

855
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,960
-Always tastes good
-Always tastes good

856
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,640
-Thick and white
-Thick and white.

857
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,640
Sweet and smooth

858
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,200
You guys are jerks!

859
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,800
Is it ready, Ah Go?

860
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,800
There's quite a wait. Just a second.

861
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,080
If it's not ready yet,
I don't want it anymore.

862
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,280
She has got the butt and the boobs.

863
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,160
How can I compete with that?

864
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,640
Did Pon tell you anything, Mr. Chat?

865
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,520
Not yet. He just woke up.

866
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,880
Pon is very strong.

867
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,880
His body is recovering quickly.

868
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,200
Is something up?

869
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,600
I went on patrol today.

870
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,160
I heard the hill tribe people saying

871
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,000
Hunter Boon and Pon were silenced.

872
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,520
It probably wasn't an accident.

873
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,280
Do they know who did it?

874
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,040
Probably drug dealers.

875
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,240
Those two must have seen something.

876
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,680
They fear Pon might be targeted too.

877
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,720
But Pon is in the hospital,

878
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,200
and I'm not allowing visits.

879
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,760
Nothing is likely to happen.

880
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,560
Still, you shouldn't talk to Pon too much.

881
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,840
You might learn things you shouldn't.

882
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,400
This is a network of very powerful people.

883
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,320
We can't trust anyone.

884
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,800
I'm afraid you'll get mixed up in this.

885
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,640
Instead of being afraid,

886
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,280
we should try to find the truth

887
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,240
in order to wipe out these drug dealers.

888
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,040
We can't just focus on ourselves

889
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,480
and fear danger,

890
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,440
thinking that it's not our job.

891
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,040
Right.

892
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,560
I understand, but I'm worried…

893
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,480
Mr. Chat.

894
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,680
Wait for me. Mr. Chat.

895
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,320
When I leave,
make sure you go upstairs quickly.

896
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,160
Someone might see you.

897
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,560
Please come here more often, sir.
I miss you.

898
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,480
Okay.

899
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,440
Goodness, sir.

900
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,000
Hello.

901
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,080
Pon woke up, sir.

902
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,360
The extent of his brain injury
is still unclear though.

903
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,320
He still can't speak.

904
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,000
He has a sore throat and a hoarse voice.
Visits aren't allowed.

905
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,280
As long as he's still alive,

906
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,240
I don't trust this situation.

907
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:34,040
And can we really trust
your spy in the hospital?

908
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,240
We talk in bed every night.

909
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,080
Okay.

910
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,840
I understand that you're really
worried about your friend, Sak.

911
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,360
If Pon is able to speak,
I'll call you right away.

912
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,160
Okay.

913
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,960
I miss you.

914
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,360
When did they get so close?

915
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,080
Nate.

916
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,200
I'm so sorry.
I forgot to get the noodles for you.

917
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,680
I got carried away chatting.

918
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,000
No worries.
I'll go down and get it myself.

919
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,399
I'm suddenly craving shaved ice.

920
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,000
You can go now. I'll keep watch for you.
Chompu is on her way up.

921
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,680
-Keep an eye out for me.
-Okay.

922
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,120
Tai.

923
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,600
-Fon.
-The path is clear.

924
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,160
-Put this on.
-Thank you.

925
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,120
-Make it quick, okay?
-Okay.

926
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:42,800
Pon.

927
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:55,360
Pon.

928
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,360
Pon, it's me, Tai.

929
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,360
I'm here to visit you.

930
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,640
How are you feeling?

931
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,640
Don't worry.

932
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,000
Both your mother and Nuch

933
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,280
are doing well.

934
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,440
Everyone is so worried about you.

935
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,560
You are having some trouble
with those drug dealers, right?

936
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,040
If they find out you visited Pon,

937
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,720
they might cause problems for you.

938
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,080
That's all I came to say.

939
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,800
You need to be careful too.

940
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,640
-Now stop. Turn around and pose.
-Okay.

941
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,640
The night of Loy Krathong
is the perfect time.

942
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,840
Don't let Pon live past tonight.

943
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,920
CHIANG RAI YI PENG FESTIVAL

944
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,560
Kej,

945
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,160
I'm so nervous.

946
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,240
You're well-prepared for this.
You can do it.

947
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:40,560
Contestant number nine,
Miss Krongkaew Arada.

948
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,120
She's literally an angel.

949
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,400
My daughter doesn't stand a chance.

950
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:21,240
