1
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,480
What happened?

2
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,760
You can't escape.

3
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,200
Kej, please don't tell
your boyfriend that I'm here.

4
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,480
Someone actually mistook us for lovers.

5
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,080
The night of Loy Krathong
is the perfect time.

6
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,960
Don't let Pon live past tonight.

7
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,640
You're well-prepared for this.
You can do it.

8
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,400
Contestant number nine is

9
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,960
Miss Krongkaew Arada.

10
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,840
Didn't you say you had no interest?

11
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,160
That's an angel.

12
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,840
My daughter doesn't stand a chance.

13
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,160
Kwan.

14
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,920
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

15
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,320
Kwan!

16
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

17
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,120
Mom.

18
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,880
Who said you could compete, Kwan?

19
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,640
It's you?

20
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,240
No wonder…

21
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,040
Tell me!

22
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,200
Tell me! Where do you think you're going?

23
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,680
Hey, Kwan!

24
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,160
Stop right there!

25
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,720
Who's that woman?

26
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,040
Darn it!

27
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,560
It looks like someone's family
or something.

28
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,640
-I'll check on my contestant.
-Okay.

29
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,320
-I'll join you.
-What does it have to do with you?

30
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,160
Kej.

31
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,240
I'm so sorry.

32
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,760
I can't go on with the contest.

33
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,040
I need to leave now.

34
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,160
Hold on, Kwan.

35
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
Who's that woman?

36
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,080
I'm her mother.

37
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
It's you, isn't it?

38
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,320
You tricked my daughter
into competing in this stupid contest.

39
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
Kwan is in the Miss Noppamas Contest.

40
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,960
She looks pretty in a traditional
Thai dress. It's not stupid at all.

41
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,800
Don't think I can't see through you.

42
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,440
You're planning to use
that winning title to turn my daughter

43
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,400
into some rich man's mistress, aren't you?

44
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,920
-You're just like a brothel madam.
-Mom.

45
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,920
Mom, Kej's not like that.

46
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,640
You're a no-good, wicked child!

47
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,440
Do you want to be a rich man's mistress?

48
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,680
Leaving me behind
to live the good life all on your own?

49
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,000
-You're an ungrateful child.
-Ma'am, that's enough.

50
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,320
Let go of me. Stay out of it.

51
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,840
This is between mother and daughter.

52
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,080
Mom,

53
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,400
I joined the contest

54
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,000
to earn money for you,

55
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,880
to ease Kong's burden.

56
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,000
How dare you suggest I owe you gratitude?

57
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,400
You're an ungrateful child!

58
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Who are you?

59
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,560
Who are you?

60
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,560
How dare you touch me?

61
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,080
Don't lower yourself
to associate with this family, Doctor.

62
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,280
Doctor?

63
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,520
Doctor?

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,080
Doctor?

65
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,960
Kwan, is this your boyfriend?

66
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,840
-You slut.
-No, you've got it wrong.

67
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,400
-Let go of me.
-Tai, leave now.

68
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,520
Let go! Kwan!

69
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,880
This is your fault.

70
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
You're just making everything worse.

71
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,600
You shouldn't have gotten
involved in the first place.

72
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,840
Kwan, where do you think you're going?

73
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,200
You're shameless! I'll punish you
for what you've done, Kwan!

74
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,240
I said let go!

75
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,400
Excuse me.

76
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,960
Are you Kwan's mother?

77
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,720
I'm Arada, the owner of the boutique
that entered Kwan into the contest.

78
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,480
Chat, you know Kwan?

79
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,680
What?

80
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,480
-Where do you think you're going?
-Ma'am.

81
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Can I have a quick word with you?

82
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,160
Tai!

83
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,680
It's really you, Tai.

84
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,320
-Sorn.
-You look absolutely stunning.

85
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,880
It's good I ran into you. I need a favor.

86
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,200
You can count on me, Tai.
Are we really doing this? I'm feeling shy!

87
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,520
If you want to be angry, be angry at me.

88
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,200
I'm an adult,
but I didn't think it through.

89
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,440
I should have asked
for her mother's permission first.

90
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,960
It was a hectic time before the contest,

91
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,200
so we completely forgot about it.

92
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,280
I'm really sorry.

93
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,480
You're well aware
of our boutique's reputation.

94
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,840
Our business would never
provide mistresses to wealthy men.

95
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,160
I assure you on my honor.

96
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,240
Regardless of your role,

97
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,960
the contest is still the ladder
to reach wealthy husbands.

98
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,760
You have such a narrow mind.

99
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,520
How dare you speak to me like that?

100
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,560
Know your place.

101
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,240
We're on different levels.

102
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,680
I graduated in engineering from America.

103
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,240
I'm the youngest son
of General Pinit and Lady Umpai.

104
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,640
I'm taking over my family's
construction contracting business.

105
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,080
You've probably heard of PG Engineer.

106
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,360
What level do you think
someone like me belongs to?

107
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,560
You look really familiar.

108
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,520
Have we ever met at my shop in Bangkok?

109
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,520
You wouldn't be dealing with this
if you had chosen my daughter.

110
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,960
It's clear who's the winner.

111
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,200
I should go apologize to the organizer.

112
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,480
I just realized
you're not only good at nagging

113
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,760
but also at acting like
you're above everyone else.

114
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,240
Kwan, how could you?

115
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,880
How dare you defy me?

116
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,080
Kwan!

117
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,960
Kwan,

118
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,320
do you think you can get away from me?

119
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
Kwan!

120
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,960
Oh, my goodness! You wretch!

121
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,960
Hello, ma'am.

122
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,240
What a creep!
This is absolutely repulsive.

123
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,280
Why say that, ma'am? Your daughter
tricked me and ran off with my clothes.

124
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,360
Where's Kwan now?

125
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,720
How would I know?

126
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,240
After Tai got my clothes, she ran off,

127
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,520
leaving me in this state.

128
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,000
You're a fool! You're repulsive!

129
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,360
-Wait, ma'am!
-What?

130
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,280
-I'm in this mess. Bring me clothes.
-I don't have any.

131
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,840
-I'm so exposed. It's so cold.
-Leave me alone. That's your problem.

132
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,280
Ma'am! Which way should I go?

133
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,360
Come down and see me,
and let me see your face for a bit.

134
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,600
I'm on shift by myself.

135
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,400
Everyone went to
the Loy Krathong Festival.

136
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,920
Can you wait until Fon is back?

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,720
I have to go do some work for Mr. Songpol.

138
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,440
I can't wait any longer.

139
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,240
We can't go to
the Loy Krathong Festival together,

140
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,520
and you would be so unkind
not to let me see your face?

141
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,200
Fine, but just for a little bit, okay?

142
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,960
TELEPHONE

143
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,080
Are you tired from work?

144
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,680
Not at all.

145
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,200
When we have free time, I'll take you out.

146
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,000
Really, Sak?

147
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,360
Sak, you're the best.

148
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,880
Sure.

149
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,280
I need to head to work now.

150
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,160
Enjoy Loy Krathong for me.

151
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,320
-I will.
-How about a kiss?

152
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,800
Ma'am, I couldn't find Tai.

153
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,760
Who asked you to look for my daughter?

154
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,480
We met because
Tai was selling food at the hospital.

155
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,440
I enjoyed her cooking,

156
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,760
-so--
-I don't believe you.

157
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,160
There are plenty of food sellers.

158
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,200
Why would you specifically
like my daughter's cooking?

159
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,560
You're planning to
take my daughter as your wife,

160
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,320
and then you'll just discard her, right?

161
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,560
A doctor like you can't be serious
about a country girl like Kwan.

162
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,520
-It's not my intention to deceive--
-Stay away from my daughter.

163
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,600
And get this into your head,

164
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,880
I hate every male doctor in this world.

165
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,600
Stay away from my daughter. Understand?

166
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,840
How dare she enter a contest?

167
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,720
Just wait, I'll keep you locked up
that you won't know day from night.

168
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,520
Mrs. Manee.

169
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,680
This contest is a real snooze.

170
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm calling it a day as the judge
and on my way home.

171
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Do you need a ride?

172
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,560
-I have legs. I can walk by myself.
-It's quite late.

173
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,800
Walking home alone can be dangerous
for someone as pretty as you, Mrs. Manee.

174
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,280
I'm just worried.

175
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,200
Just worry about your own wife.

176
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,400
I understand that you may not trust me.

177
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,840
How about I drive slowly behind you
at a good distance on the way home?

178
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Please?

179
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,960
Just for your safety.

180
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,640
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

181
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,640
-Please go ahead.
-Thank you.

182
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,560
I'm still hungry.

183
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,080
I loved their dipping sauce.

184
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,400
Let's go again next time.

185
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,880
I'm so jealous of couples
enjoying Loy Krathong together.

186
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,840
You'd better hurry, Nate, before
your boyfriend finds someone else.

187
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,560
-Right.
-He's busy. He's working now.

188
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,240
Hey, how about I go with you instead?

189
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,640
Ouch!

190
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,400
-You got the answer, Doctor.
-Right.

191
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,920
I'm just teasing.

192
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,240
-Have a great time.
-Thank you.

193
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,560
-I should go check on Pon.
-Okay.

194
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,640
How's everything going?
Do we have any new cases?

195
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,360
Hardly anyone comes.

196
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,360
-Everyone is going out tonight.
-That's good.

197
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,920
What's wrong, Fon?

198
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,400
His heart has stopped, Doctor.

199
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,320
I can't feel a pulse. I'll start CPR.

200
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,480
Get the defibrillator
and adrenaline, stat.

201
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,840
-Okay.
-Okay.

202
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,400
Hey, Chat.

203
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,720
Did you find Tai?

204
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Who's Tai?

205
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,600
Kej's beauty queen.

206
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,359
You're a bit too concerned about Kwan.

207
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,720
That's right. When did you guys meet?

208
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,560
It's odd.
Are you considering a younger girlfriend?

209
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,880
There's an emergency at the hospital.
Park, I'm leaving Kej with you.

210
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,880
Your brother left you with me.

211
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,480
Kong.

212
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,400
-Mom, where did you go?
-I couldn't let your mother

213
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,600
walk home alone late at night.

214
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,960
I was worried,
so I followed her in my car.

215
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,520
I asked her to get in, but she wouldn't.

216
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you so much, sir.

217
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,320
Now that I'm home,
you can go back to your wife.

218
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,120
I hope I have the pleasure
of seeing you again.

219
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,240
Let's go inside, Mom.

220
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,240
Where's Kwan?

221
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,040
She's not back yet?

222
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,520
-Did something happen?
-Yes.

223
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,000
Your beloved sister

224
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,960
is practically itching to get a husband.

225
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,840
-Did you find Kwan?
-I didn't see any sign of her.

226
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,160
We've searched the area several times.

227
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,320
She couldn't have gone far

228
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,160
in a traditional Thai dress.

229
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,680
I think we should search that side again.

230
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,080
-Good idea.
-That sounds good.

231
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,400
-Let's go.
-Let's go now.

232
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,080
I did CPR, used the defibrillator,
and administered adrenaline,

233
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,560
but there was no response from Pon.

234
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,080
Pon was doing much better this morning.

235
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,880
How did this happen?

236
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,040
How was his blood pressure before?

237
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,480
Was his heart rate normal?

238
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,080
I'm sorry.

239
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,080
Earlier,

240
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,840
I had to use the restroom.

241
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,360
I had diarrhea,
so I was in there for a while.

242
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,400
So you weren't present
when the patient stopped breathing?

243
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,720
-No.
-So who was on watch?

244
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,680
No one.

245
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,080
Well, I thought that
since Pon was getting better,

246
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,040
everything would be fine.

247
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,560
I'm really sorry, Doctor.

248
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,440
I'm sorry.

249
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,280
There are scratches on Pon's lips,

250
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,560
and there's also blood.

251
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,960
You're right, Doctor.

252
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,920
I see what looks like skin
and blood under his nails as well.

253
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,360
Let me check.

254
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,120
Has anything in this room been moved?

255
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,120
Things were chaotic earlier.

256
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,920
Our main focus was on saving Pon.

257
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
What's wrong, Mr. Chat?

258
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,960
Where did you place this pillow?

259
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,800
I placed it under the patient's legs.

260
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Why?

261
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,440
I'm not sure yet.

262
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,160
Call and ask Captain Chitkhet to come.

263
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,200
Got it, Doctor.

264
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,240
Why are we calling the captain?

265
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,600
Something's not right.

266
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,960
Pon was doing much better this morning.

267
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,280
Why did his heart suddenly stop?

268
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,880
And the blood stains on the pillow,

269
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,120
where did they come from?

270
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,840
Do you think Pon might have been killed?

271
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,680
I'm just speculating.

272
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,440
Whether or not that's true,

273
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,840
we have to wait for the police.

274
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,840
Hey. Did you find her?

275
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,720
Did you?

276
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,560
No, I haven't found her.

277
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,840
I don't know where she went.

278
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,800
She must be at her boyfriend's.

279
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,040
-Mom, she's not like that.
-Hey.

280
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,840
Don't talk if you don't know anything.

281
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,480
Just as promiscuous as her father.

282
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,360
She's probably in bed, being coddled
by that sweet-faced doctor by now.

283
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,480
She's a good-for-nothing!

284
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,280
Do you mean

285
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,800
Dr. Chat?

286
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,480
I don't know his name,

287
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,400
and I don't want to know him either.

288
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,360
I get irritated thinking about

289
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,960
how concerned that doctor was about her.

290
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,680
They must be infatuated.

291
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,240
I bet you she isn't coming home tonight.

292
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,800
Someone like her,

293
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,400
who would marry her openly?

294
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,200
Jeez, a country girl
who's only finished high school,

295
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,720
at best, she's nothing more
than a woman on the side,

296
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
waiting to be discarded.

297
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,200
If you don't believe me, just wait.
Remember what I said.

298
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,080
Darn it.

299
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,240
Where are you, Kwan?

300
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,920
Kwan, is this your boyfriend?

301
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,720
-You slut.
-No, you've got it wrong.

302
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,840
-Let go of me.
-Tai, leave now.

303
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,560
Let go! Kwan!

304
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
This is your fault.

305
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,320
You're just making everything worse.

306
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,840
You shouldn't have gotten
involved in the first place.

307
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,680
Kwan, where do you think you're going?

308
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,840
You're shameless! I'll punish you
for what you've done, Kwan!

309
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,920
How can I show my face to anyone?

310
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,800
I'm sure to be the talk of the town.

311
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,720
Mom, how could you?

312
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,840
Maybe I should just run away.

313
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,360
Pon's autopsy showed no unusual findings.

314
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,080
Just blood stains on the pillow,

315
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,520
blood on his lips,

316
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,040
and skin and blood under his nails.

317
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,840
I'll ask the captain

318
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,320
if we can send Pon's body
to forensics in Bangkok for examination.

319
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,320
Maybe we'll find out more.

320
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,080
That's a great idea.

321
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,160
I spoke with the hill tribe people
who found Hunter Pon and Hunter Boon.

322
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,480
I believe these two

323
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,200
must have encountered
a drug trafficking gang,

324
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,480
so they were silenced.

325
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,360
Hasn't the drug trafficking gang
been taken care of already?

326
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,880
Not yet, Doctor.

327
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,440
As far as I know, there's ongoing
drug trafficking in this area,

328
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,040
and we're yet to catch the mastermind.

329
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,000
Are there still others besides Kun Sa?

330
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,400
Yes.

331
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,000
The one who's taken
on the role of the leader

332
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,560
is named Chang Chen.

333
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,720
Chang Chen?

334
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,720
That's right.

335
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,920
He claims to be a relative of Kun Sa,

336
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,720
but I have no clue if that's true or not,

337
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,640
and I suspect this could be his doing.

338
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,560
What's the location of their base?

339
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,920
Why haven't the authorities
cleared them out?

340
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,960
No one really knows.

341
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,120
The mountain's terrain
is extremely complex,

342
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,120
and it's still
inaccessible to the officials.

343
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,760
Couldn't they ask for
the army's assistance?

344
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,960
It depends on their policies.

345
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,680
Anyway, I'll quickly report to my officer

346
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,160
about sending Pon's body
for examination in Bangkok.

347
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,880
I'll keep you posted
if there are any updates.

348
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
Okay.

349
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,400
Mom, please don't tell me
you haven't slept.

350
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,800
I told you, didn't I?

351
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,480
That wild child

352
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,000
slept over at her doctor
boyfriend's place and never came back.

353
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,840
I think you've got it wrong.

354
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,360
If I had to guess,

355
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,440
she went to order a dress for you.

356
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,400
They liked her look
and asked her to enter a contest.

357
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,440
She did it for the prize money,

358
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,560
wanting to support our family.

359
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,240
Where on earth is she?
Why hasn't she come back home?

360
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,400
She's disgracing our family.

361
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,240
I think she probably
slept over at a friend's house.

362
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,400
Really? The gossip is probably spreading
throughout the entire market by now.

363
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,520
Do you honestly think
the talk about her is positive?

364
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,160
-If you hadn't rushed up on the--
-Hey!

365
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,040
Are you blaming me?

366
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,800
Your sister is the one at fault here.

367
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,800
She's a good-for-nothing,

368
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,760
strutting around
and flaunting herself to men.

369
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,800
Just wait and see.
If I can't find her today,

370
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,240
I'll file a report with the police

371
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,600
and have that sweet-faced
army doctor arrested.

372
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,320
Hello.

373
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,280
Okay. I'm on my way there now.

374
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,800
Doctor?

375
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,120
What happened?

376
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,360
Why are they not sending
Pon's body to Bangkok as agreed?

377
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,280
I really don't know.

378
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,240
Police officers came
to request an embalming

379
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,720
and to let the relatives take the body.

380
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,560
Who signed off on removing the body?

381
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,240
-Well--
-I did.

382
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,000
What's going on, Director?

383
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,080
Inspector Pichai called to let me know
the family preferred no further autopsy.

384
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,280
They want an embalming and an immediate
transfer to the temple for a ceremony.

385
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,360
But Captain Chitkhet has already
discussed this with Chalam.

386
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,840
Chalam just called me.

387
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,800
She asked me to cancel it.

388
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,440
She and her daughter
don't want to continue with anything.

389
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,760
I want to talk to Captain Chikhet first.

390
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,480
He isn't here anymore.

391
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,600
He got an immediate transfer.

392
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,840
-An immediate transfer?
-Yes.

393
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,800
I'm handling everything now.

394
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,920
If you need to discuss anything,
you can talk to me directly.

395
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,800
How is it possible for a transfer order
to go through so quickly?

396
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,080
I honestly don't know.

397
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,200
If you're curious,
you should ask the higher authorities.

398
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,920
I went to all of Tai's
old friends' houses.

399
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,320
No one has seen her.

400
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,280
Did you visit Ms. Waew's house?

401
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,520
I did, but she had no clue.

402
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,000
She just kept questioning me,
so I bailed quickly.

403
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,600
You won't find her that way.

404
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,760
Maiseek,

405
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,880
go check that Dr. Chat's place,

406
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,480
and you, keep watch at the hospital.

407
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,000
Believe me,
they're definitely going to meet up.

408
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,280
You go to Dr. Chat's house.

409
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,640
I'm afraid I'll get violated.

410
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,080
No, she told you to go there,
so you have to.

411
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,280
Gosh, stop talking.

412
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,800
Your look ensures your safety.

413
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,800
-I'll go to the hospital.
-No, you go to the house.

414
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,120
-You go to the house.
-Hey!

415
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,480
If you two don't get a move on,
I'll give your heads a good smack! Go now!

416
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,640
-Oh, no. Yes, ma'am, we're going.
-We're going now, ma'am.

417
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,640
It was a shame I wasn't
with you at the contest.

418
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,640
I heard that an overdressed woman
ended up on stage too.

419
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,520
I never thought my Tai

420
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,960
could look so captivating
all dressed up as a woman.

421
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,560
Save the opinions, just eat.

422
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,840
If Manee hadn't intervened on stage,

423
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,920
Tai would've made it to the later rounds.

424
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,719
The judges liked her a lot.

425
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,920
But Mali

426
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,960
will win Miss Noppamas anyway.

427
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,159
Is there any truth to the rumor
that Tai is Dr. Chat's secret girlfriend?

428
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,440
It's not true.

429
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,280
That's impossible.

430
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,480
No one lays a finger on my Tai,

431
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,159
not even a doctor.

432
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,159
Don't be an idiot.

433
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,679
Women have countless tricks
up their sleeves,

434
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,679
and someone like you can't catch on.

435
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,679
I'm not that dumb, Mom.

436
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,560
Maybe Tai isn't as much
of a tomboy as we think.

437
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,120
She's pretty.

438
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,680
Come eat, Mom.

439
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,080
Who would have an appetite?

440
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,400
Who's calling?
Maybe it's those two. Check quickly.

441
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,240
-Hello?
-Who is it?

442
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,080
It's Sumlee.

443
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,480
There's no car at his place.

444
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,120
The doctor is probably at the hospital.

445
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,200
Search that doctor's house.

446
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,920
I believe he's definitely
hiding Kwan there.

447
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,160
Breaking into someone's house
could land me in jail,

448
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,160
especially since it's on an army base.

449
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,400
Hey, just do as I say.

450
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,000
If you end up in jail,
I'll bail you out. That's all.

451
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,760
Aren't you taking it too far, Mom?

452
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,240
Kong, come with me.

453
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,600
Where are we going?

454
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,840
He isn't here anymore.

455
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,280
He got an immediate transfer.

456
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,880
An immediate transfer?

457
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,680
I'm handling everything now.

458
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,760
If you need to discuss anything,
you can talk to me directly.

459
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,200
How is it possible for a transfer order
to go through so quickly?

460
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,440
I honestly don't know.

461
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,600
If you're curious,
you should ask the higher authorities.

462
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
But Pon's death is suspicious.

463
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,360
You don't think
it's an unnecessary hassle?

464
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,240
It's just one person who died in the ward.

465
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,360
Sending the body to Bangkok for forensics

466
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,120
would take up time and the state's funds.

467
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,360
I don't think it's worth it.

468
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,160
But these two hunters were attacked.

469
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,680
And before this happened,

470
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,200
Captain Chikhet visited Pon
multiple times to obtain his statement,

471
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,200
but he couldn't do so
because Pon was unconscious.

472
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,880
I understand that,

473
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,440
but since

474
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,320
Pon has already passed,

475
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
there's no need
to make a hassle out of it.

476
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,960
The family has no doubts.

477
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,240
In fact, they're thankful to you

478
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,640
for the care you gave their son.

479
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,280
I understand that
you're a passionate person,

480
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,240
but your work at the hospital

481
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,840
is already quite heavy.

482
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,520
Let the police handle this matter.

483
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,600
Are you trying
to tell me to stay out of it?

484
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,920
I'm not telling you to stay out of it,

485
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,080
but I think our roles are clear.

486
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,080
Caring for patients is your job,

487
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,160
and solving cases
is the duty of the police.

488
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,200
That means there's nothing I can do.

489
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,440
If you want to do more,

490
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,360
you'll have to talk to
the deceased's family directly.

491
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,320
But I don't think it will change anything.

492
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,520
The deceased's sister

493
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,120
only wants a one-day ceremony,
followed by cremation.

494
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,160
I'm sorry, Doctor.

495
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,040
Are you okay?

496
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,520
Yes, I'm fine.

497
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,240
Well, Maiseek is here to see you.

498
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,720
Maiseek?

499
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,280
-Tai's sidekick. Pale, eyes like this.
-Yes, I know him.

500
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,680
Okay.

501
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,880
Let him in.

502
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,760
Okay.

503
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,920
Maiseek, come.

504
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,520
Doctor, where are you hiding Tai?

505
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,880
Why would I do that?

506
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,480
Tai is missing.

507
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,000
She didn't come home all night.

508
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,040
-Is she still not back home?
-No.

509
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,960
We've searched the entire village
but couldn't find her.

510
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,240
I don't know where she went.

511
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,040
Go quickly, or we'll lose him.

512
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,520
Go now.

513
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,800
Hurry up, or we won't catch up.

514
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,800
Hold on, Tai.

515
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,720
I mean no harm.

516
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,800
Once I know you're safe, I'll leave.

517
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,120
How did you find out I was hiding here?

518
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,520
I followed you to this place
in my car once.

519
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,400
You should've stayed out of it.

520
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,000
What a lovely house.

521
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,760
Is it yours?

522
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,560
Yes, my father gave it to me.

523
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,520
Don't let anyone else know about this.

524
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,840
I give you my word.
I'll keep this a secret.

525
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,600
Kwan!

526
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,840
Mom.

527
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,040
Stop! Stop right there!

528
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,520
Hey, so this is where you've been
meeting up to fool around?

529
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,840
No, you misunderstand.

530
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,040
Kwan,

531
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
how could you stoop so low?

532
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,800
You shouldn't be my child.
You're a bad luck.

533
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,400
Mom, hold on.
We should hear her out first.

534
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,480
There's no use, Kong.

535
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,560
Mom had already made up her mind.

536
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,720
I'm a bad person in her eyes,
no matter what.

537
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,040
How dare you talk back?

538
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,920
What is this? Whose shirt is it?

539
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,480
It's definitely not yours.

540
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,360
It's a man's shirt!

541
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,880
It's still damp. Did you wash it
for your boyfriend, you fool?

542
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,520
No, Mom. That's Sornram's shirt.

543
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,640
Sornram?

544
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,880
How many men do you have, Kwan?

545
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,080
-Mom!
-Mom!

546
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,600
-Let go of me!
-Mom!

547
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,520
-Mom!
-Mom, you're hurting me!

548
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,840
I raised you myself. How could you
turn into a promiscuous woman

549
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,360
-involved with multiple men?
-Mom!

550
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,760
Did you really raise me?

551
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,880
It sounds like you don't know me at all.

552
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,160
Have I ever shown that kind of behavior?

553
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,080
You're my role model,

554
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,640
and I've never known you
to be anyone's mistress.

555
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,600
-Kwan!
-Ma'am!

556
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,120
-Kwan, stop talking back to Mom.
-Let go of me!

557
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,480
And this house is mine.

558
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,760
Dad gave it to me.

559
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,760
It's not like you ever think at all.

560
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,920
Kong…

561
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,920
lock her up in our house right now

562
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,600
unless you want her to die by my hand.

563
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,280
-Get her away!
-Kwan, come with me

564
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,600
But…

565
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,400
Come, now.

566
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,520
Keep a close eye on her.

567
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,720
Make sure she doesn't go out
and get up to no good again.

568
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,560
Go now! I'll be right behind you.

569
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,720
You ruined my life.

570
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,600
I have nothing left.

571
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,400
We still need to talk.

572
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,000
I'll find time to visit you at your place.

573
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,680
Isn't it all so pretty?

574
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,880
Aren't these decorations pretty?

575
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,240
It's so pretty, isn't it?

576
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,800
It's so pretty, isn't it?

577
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,760
You no-good brat!

578
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,280
You no-good brat!

579
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,600
You can't do this.

580
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,200
Why can't I do it?

581
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,160
This house belongs to Tai.

582
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,120
She's my daughter.

583
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,440
And the person who gave this house to her

584
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,520
was my husband.

585
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,480
I have every right to it.

586
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,440
I can do anything with it.

587
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,280
Do you understand?

588
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,280
Get out of my house right now

589
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,200
and stay away from my daughter.

590
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,520
If you ignore my warning,

591
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,160
I'll file a complaint
with the army hospital

592
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,280
and report you for sexual harassment.

593
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,800
Why? Do you think I won't do it?

594
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,760
Go ahead if you want
to ruin your future in your career.

595
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,520
Your threats don't scare me.

596
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,840
If I'm listening to you,

597
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,560
it's only to prevent more trouble for Tai.

598
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,400
Do you love my daughter?

599
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,600
Get over her

600
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,240
because you'll never get past me.

601
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,240
I hate all male doctors.

602
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,440
I hate them more than maggots!

603
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,000
I don't understand.

604
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,840
A man like you will never understand!

605
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,560
Get out!

606
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,920
Get out of my house!
Why are you still here staring at me?

607
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,040
I said get out!

608
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,240
Go away!

609
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,680
You loved her so much, didn't you?

610
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,840
You gave her a house
without even telling me.

611
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,920
You loved her so much, didn't you?

612
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,080
You didn't even tell me!

613
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,680
Every day, you were out,

614
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,800
sneaking in here to decorate the place
and indulge yourself alone, weren't you?

615
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,720
You slut!

616
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,640
You even drew pictures of men?

617
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,040
Today, Kong has gone
to Lamphun for a catering job.

618
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,320
I'm alone with Mom.

619
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,120
I'm not used to it.

620
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,080
You're not used to it?

621
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,920
You're not used to it?

622
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,080
You've been defying my orders
since you were a child?

623
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,800
You've been dressing up to flaunt men
since you were a child, Kwan!

624
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,440
You no-good brat!

625
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,560
I shouldn't have followed you here.

626
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,560
How did you take care of our shop's items?

627
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,960
My mother trusted the wrong person.

628
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,240
The dress is very dirty.

629
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,480
Someone returned the dress
worn at the contest in a bag.

630
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,240
I checked briefly.

631
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,120
I found many signs of damage.

632
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,200
Did you know
completing this dress took my mother

633
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,360
almost two years?

634
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,480
I thought you admired her skills so much.

635
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,520
How could you leave
her work neglected like this?

636
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,760
Do you have any idea
how much we could sell this dress for?

637
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,560
How about this?

638
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,040
I'll buy it.

639
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,320
You'll buy it? My gosh.

640
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,400
Do you think you can afford it?

641
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,080
Let me tell you, your whole month's pay

642
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,880
couldn't even cover half the dress.

643
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,080
She's not getting paid.

644
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,280
She asked to work here
to learn dressmaking from Mrs. Da.

645
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,960
Goodness, working for free
to learn dressmaking?

646
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,560
Is your family so wealthy?
Is your surname Jutathep or something?

647
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,120
Are you plotting
something against our shop?

648
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,560
That's right. You're trying to
steal my mother's knowledge

649
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,360
and take our customers, aren't you?

650
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,640
Confess now.

651
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,080
My mother might appreciate
those who admire her work,

652
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,400
but I'm not quick to trust.

653
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,200
Pilai, get me her employee record.

654
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,920
-We don't have it.
-How can we not?

655
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,400
She's not officially
an employee at our shop yet,

656
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,840
so Mrs. Da hasn't asked me
to create her record.

657
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,320
You're useless. We can't trust her, Wan.

658
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,200
Hand over your ID card.

659
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,120
Wow.

660
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,880
Look at us all here together again.

661
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,600
We three siblings always think alike.

662
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,560
Someone's already out
looking for a handout, Wan?

663
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,080
Well,

664
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,080
I always get it anyway.

665
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,720
Hey, save the fight for another time.

666
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,680
Give me your national ID card.
I'm making a copy of it for safekeeping.

667
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,120
Hurry up!

668
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,040
-Mom Luang Phokkej Jutathep.
-Mom Luang Phokkej Jutathep.

669
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,480
No need to create an employee record.

670
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,800
Feel free to fire me.

671
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,760
I can handle hard work,

672
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:49,080
but dealing with bosses who use emotions
to solve problems, like immature people.

673
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,200
It's a waste of my time.

674
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,400
Ms. Kej.

675
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,120
Ms. Kej.

676
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,400
Ms. Kej, wait for me.

677
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,920
I owe you an apology
on behalf of my sisters.

678
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,400
You're not involved.
There's no need to apologize.

679
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,200
Ms. Kej, I need you to stay calm.

680
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,640
I'm not the most patient person,

681
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,840
especially with people like your sisters.

682
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,120
I'd rather not deal with them
unless necessary.

683
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,720
Ms. Kej, let me explain.

684
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,880
I understand you.

685
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,760
Even though I'm their brother,

686
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,440
I can't stand them.

687
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,280
But what can I do?

688
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,920
They're my family, after all.

689
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,600
I'm asking you for my mother's sake.

690
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,040
Today, my grandmother's not doing well.

691
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,760
I don't want to burden my mother more.

692
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,160
I'll find a chance
to talk to Mrs. Da myself.

693
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,400
Hold on.

694
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,000
I'm sorry.

695
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,120
I don't want you to quit now.

696
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,120
Without you, what's going
to happen to the shop?

697
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,960
Wan and Oy rushed to Chiang Rai

698
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,760
because my grandmother
got worse last night.

699
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,560
They hurried here to show their faces.

700
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,440
Hoping for the inheritance.

701
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,880
Please wait and see
my grandmother's condition first.

702
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,800
I don't want my mother
to deal with so much at once.

703
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,600
She's quite old now.

704
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,240
Then I'll put up with it for Mrs. Da

705
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,320
until your grandmother gets better.

706
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,880
Thank you so much.

707
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,320
Playing hard to get, aren't you?

708
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,400
I'll make you mine.

709
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:35,880
ARADA

710
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,800
I once secretly followed her home.

711
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,840
Her place is massive.

712
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,480
She even has a maid.

713
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,240
I thought she might be
a rich man's mistress.

714
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,040
Who would have thought she's from
a national-level noble family?

715
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,760
Why didn't you mention that earlier?

716
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,560
But we shouldn't bow down to her, Wan.

717
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,440
We're an old family,
and we're not nobodies.

718
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,600
Why are you back? It's all talk.

719
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,960
I need to talk to Mrs. Da first.

720
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,080
Her mother isn't well.

721
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,240
I don't want to add to her troubles.

722
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,280
That's good.

723
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,360
My mother is no pushover.

724
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,120
Hold on.

725
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,840
And the appointment
to make a dress for the governor's wife,

726
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,360
is Ms. Kej going to do it?

727
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,200
Why would she? She's quitting, isn't she?

728
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,200
Oh, so who's going to do it?

729
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,920
-Excuse me, I have plans with a friend.
-Oy.

730
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,960
Oy, hey.

731
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,080
This girl…

732
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,280
You.

733
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,200
Yes? Are you talking to me?

734
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,880
Yes, you. Come with me.

735
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,720
And you, stay here and watch the shop.

736
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,560
Ms. Kej,

737
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,920
how about some juice?

738
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,160
I can get it for you.

739
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,840
No, thank you.

740
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,960
How does Dr. Chat know about your house?

741
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,720
He followed me.

742
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,160
Nosy.

743
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,080
Kong.

744
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,560
You don't think like mom, do you?

745
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,440
I know you.

746
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,560
My sister isn't the type
to trade herself for comfort.

747
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,200
You're not angry that

748
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,400
I kept the house by the pond a secret?

749
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,560
I am.

750
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,320
Kavee took it too far.

751
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,040
Giving you an entire house
without even a word to me.

752
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,800
You're really clever,

753
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,600
so good at charming others.

754
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,280
He wasn't even your real father.

755
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,280
-He wasn't even your real father.
-Mom, calm down.

756
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,880
Maybe Dad saw that she liked it.

757
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,120
It's just a small house
with no access to the road.

758
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,360
It can't be worth that much.

759
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,120
That's not the point.

760
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,400
Whether it's cheap or expensive,
it's still money.

761
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,520
Why?

762
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,160
Why are you keeping it for yourself?

763
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,120
Why are you keeping it for yourself?

764
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,320
Do you want to keep it for yourself?

765
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,000
Do you want to keep it for yourself?

766
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,600
Get me the deed.

767
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,280
-Do it!
-Mom.

768
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,960
Mom, Dad gave it to Kwan.

769
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,560
I'm her mother.

770
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,000
Giving it to her is like giving it to me.

771
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,400
You're his real son.

772
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,680
He didn't even give you anything,

773
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,760
and you're still defending her.

774
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,240
Gosh, seriously,

775
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,320
are you the kindest brother
or the dumbest?

776
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,480
If you want it, you can take it.

777
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,360
Then go get me the deed.

778
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,920
Go!

779
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,880
Are you still not moving?

780
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,760
I said go!

781
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,960
What are you planning to do?

782
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,800
I'm going to sell the house.

783
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,040
Mom,

784
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,640
please don't sell the house.

785
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,760
I love that house so much.
I'm begging you, Mom.

786
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,520
Am I supposed to keep the house for you
to get up to no good with countless men?

787
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,960
You're grounded.

788
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,840
Don't leave the house
until I give you permission.

789
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,320
If you run away,
don't ever come back here again.

790
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,200
You'll no longer be my daughter.

791
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,560
Kong,

792
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,840
get the keys and lock the door
and windows of her room.

793
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,000
Kong.

794
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,920
Make a sign to sell the house
and put it up everywhere.

795
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,000
-Mom.
-I told you to do it.

796
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,400
I don't need your opinion.

797
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,640
Include the phone number.
I'll discuss the price myself.

798
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:58,960
Okay, Mom.

799
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,920
Are you going to buy it?

800
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,840
I'm free. Today is fine.

801
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,680
I want to sell it as quickly as possible.

802
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,160
Just leave me alone.

803
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,760
I can't do that.

804
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,240
I'm worried about you.

805
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,520
I want to help you.

806
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,080
I want to see you happy like before.

807
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,280
Those handsome doctors
from the Jutathep family

808
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,640
are all frauds.

809
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,680
When the mask comes off,
they show their true colors as playboys.

810
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,600
Great-Grandma,

811
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,960
I want to know more about Mrs. Maratee.

812
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:34,280
Can you tell me
what you remember about her?

813
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,200
Both the good and the bad.

814
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,560
