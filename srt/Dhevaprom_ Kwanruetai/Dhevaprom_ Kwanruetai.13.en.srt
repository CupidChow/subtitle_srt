1
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,440
They have no idea
the entrance will become their graves.

2
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,280
Tell our men to go out and kill them all.

3
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,480
Make sure none of them make it out alive.

4
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,600
Tai?

5
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,040
Tai!

6
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,440
Give it back!

7
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,120
I suggest you turn yourself in.

8
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,760
Trust me.

9
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,880
He's a good man. A good soldier.
He's going to pull through.

10
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,080
The heavens will grant him blessings
to survive and come out stronger.

11
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,320
There's no heart rate, Doctor.

12
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,840
-Go ahead with CPR.
-Right away.

13
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,560
-Prep the defib.
-Yes, sir.

14
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,160
-150 joules.
-150 joules.

15
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,320
All clear.

16
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,800
No heart rate.

17
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,520
Raise to 200 joules.

18
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,760
200 joules.

19
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,840
All clear.

20
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,760
Still no heart rate.

21
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,880
The CPR failed.

22
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,720
Time of death: 05:45.

23
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,080
Dr. Chat is now able
to breathe on his own.

24
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,200
The surgery went well.
There should be no complications.

25
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,800
As for the details of the surgery,
Dr. Mes will explain it to you.

26
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,000
Are you feeling better now?

27
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,800
When he wakes up,

28
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,720
it'd be nice if he had forgotten about us.

29
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,520
Kwan.

30
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,000
Are you sure about that?

31
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,800
Does it not occur to you
that the past few months

32
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,320
could have been a happy time for him

33
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,360
that he would have loved to remember?

34
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,840
Hey.

35
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,480
No matter what happens now,

36
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,400
at least

37
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,440
you two have good memories
to look back on.

38
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,680
Dr. Chat has to be okay.

39
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,680
I don't want to see another person
harmed because of me.

40
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,080
Is anyone here Mr. Sornram's relative?

41
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
I am.

42
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
Is he safe, Doctor?

43
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,880
I'm sorry.

44
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,920
Mr. Sornram has passed away.

45
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,800
Doctor.

46
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,400
-Could you please have another look?
-Excuse me, please.

47
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,640
Sorn.

48
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,840
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

49
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,280
Tai.

50
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Tai.

51
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,640
Da.

52
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
Why don't you shower and get changed?
Here's a change of clothes.

53
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,920
Sumlee woke up.

54
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,600
-He's awake?
-Yeah.

55
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,240
-Let's go.
-Okay.

56
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,840
Please wait for me outside.

57
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,040
I'll check if the officers
have finished questioning him.

58
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,360
-Wait here.
-Okay.

59
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,640
Are you finished?

60
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,520
-We're finished.
-I see.

61
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,560
This is Kwanruetai.
She is Kongphop's sister.

62
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,120
Would you mind if we question you?

63
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,360
That's fine, but can I
quickly see my friend first?

64
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,400
Please do.

65
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,840
-Sarge.
-Thank you.

66
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,440
Tai.

67
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,560
Sumlee.

68
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Tai.

69
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,440
You're not dead.

70
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,840
POLICE STATION
PROTECTING AND SERVING THE PEOPLE

71
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,120
There they are.

72
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,080
-How can you be so evil?
-You should be hanged.

73
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,600
-I looked up to you.
-I could hardly pay for a meal now.

74
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,440
-You're a fucking asshole.
-You're evil.

75
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,800
-He must be held accountable.
-Please calm down.

76
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,800
-Everyone, please calm down.
-Mr. Songpol.

77
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,520
When I leave,
make sure you go upstairs quickly.

78
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,680
Someone might see you.

79
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,720
Please come here more often, sir.
I miss you.

80
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,680
Okay.

81
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,320
Get out.

82
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,600
Don't show your face again. Get out.

83
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,440
You said I'd be your last.

84
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,280
Why did you buy a house
for that old hag then?

85
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,080
Mr. Songpol was stabbed.

86
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
-Holy shit.
-Step back.

87
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,480
Detain her.

88
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,640
Mr. Songpol!

89
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Come in.

90
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,680
Take it slow.

91
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,960
Mom.

92
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,880
When did you come back?

93
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,560
Where did you two go?

94
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,840
Are you hungry? Have you eaten?

95
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,120
I'm starving.

96
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Go get me some food, will you?

97
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,560
Okay. I'll get you some food.

98
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,520
Stop there.

99
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,920
Hey, you.

100
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,560
Why are you telling her to stop?
I'm hungry.

101
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,640
If you're hungry, make your own food.

102
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,480
Kong, you…

103
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,280
You ungrateful brat.
I'm hungry. Don't you hear me?

104
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,080
I can hear you.

105
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,680
Say, do you think I couldn't hear
what you told the police?

106
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,520
The police said I had no relatives…

107
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,120
because the woman they met at the house

108
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,640
said she didn't know me.

109
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,920
She's not my mom.

110
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,920
She's not related to me.

111
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,400
Dr. Chat is not my relative,

112
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,080
but he offered to bail me out.

113
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,520
I refused his offer though.

114
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,320
Do you know why?

115
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,080
Because I didn't want to
hurt your feelings.

116
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,600
Is this

117
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,440
the reward I get for caring for some woman

118
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,760
who happened to be Dad's wife?

119
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,360
If Dad hadn't made a dying wish

120
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,040
to have me look after you well,

121
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,280
I'd have chased you
out of this house long ago.

122
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,280
I wouldn't have put up with you this long.

123
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,680
Kong, you!

124
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
You're going too far.

125
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,080
-Kong, Mom is--
-Kwan.

126
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,400
Stop making excuses for her.

127
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,400
She packed her clothes and left

128
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,880
so she could be some guy's mistress.

129
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,840
All for her own gains.

130
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,760
She has never cared about us.

131
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,400
You're really…

132
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,040
ungrateful!

133
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,800
I was the one who raised you two.

134
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,520
Did you raise us?

135
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,840
After Dad's passing,

136
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,920
the two of us have been raising you.

137
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,480
The two of us have been
working ourselves to the bone

138
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,000
so you could live a comfortable life.

139
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,880
But during our tough times,

140
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,200
you leave us high and dry.

141
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,080
I think now is the time

142
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,280
to set things straight.

143
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,640
You…

144
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,600
Are you going to kick me out of the house?

145
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,280
You ungrateful brat.

146
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,840
You're wicked.

147
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,040
I wouldn't go so far as to kick you out.

148
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,080
But if you want to stay,

149
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,800
you have to follow the house rules.

150
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,560
You cannot just laze around
and do nothing like you used to.

151
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,440
You must work to earn your keep.

152
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,480
You may stay,

153
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,480
but you must work
in exchange for your three meals.

154
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,240
If you want new clothes,

155
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,600
you must work alongside me and Kwan.

156
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
The choice is yours.

157
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,960
You may pack up your belongings
and go to Mr. Songpol,

158
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,160
but I doubt the prison will allow that.

159
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,120
Kong, you!

160
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,720
Let's go, Kwan.

161
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,480
Is this a good idea?

162
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,880
Trust me.

163
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,680
We are doing the right thing.

164
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,720
Mom needs to be taught
how to deal with a letdown.

165
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,360
Hold onto this conviction.

166
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,760
If we don't do this,

167
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,960
when are we ever going
to escape this situation?

168
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,840
Are we going to blindly
work ourselves into the ground

169
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,960
in order to satisfy the endless needs
of this person?

170
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,920
Kong.

171
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,920
I know

172
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,280
this may seem ruthless,

173
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,880
but after I had a brush with death,

174
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,520
I realized that I needed to stop taking
advantage of you by spoiling Mom rotten.

175
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,640
I only focused on being a good son.

176
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,920
By doing that, I dragged you
into hell with me.

177
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,080
You had to sacrifice your teenage years.

178
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,240
You couldn't go to college
like your friends.

179
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,320
I'm not going to just sit by and be happy
with you working as a food vendor.

180
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,800
You deserve a better future.

181
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,560
It's time that all of us
make you the priority.

182
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,160
Dad. Mom.

183
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,280
How are you feeling, Chat?

184
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,520
You've been sleeping for so long.

185
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,080
You made me really worried.

186
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,600
You were truly fearless.

187
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,320
You planting explosives
in Chang Chen's drug production base

188
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,960
will surely become a legend in Chiang Rai.

189
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,520
It's all thanks to one person.

190
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,160
Tai suggested the idea
of us turning the tables on them.

191
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,720
Jeez. You only just woke up,
but you're already looking for your girl?

192
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,640
You must be feeling much better.

193
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,520
She's his pillar of strength.

194
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,960
Isn't that right, brother-in-law?

195
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,640
Tai is safe, right?

196
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,200
Yes, the two siblings are doing okay.

197
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,400
They had already gone home.

198
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,400
Mind you, Chat.

199
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,440
Would you like us to bring her here?

200
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,160
Seeing her face will probably
motivate you to recover quickly.

201
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,960
You don't need to do that.

202
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,400
Seeing everyone gathered here…

203
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,600
-fills me with joy.
-Oh, my.

204
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,680
That silver tongue of yours must be
the reason the girl is so in love.

205
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,560
Did Kwan come by at all?

206
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,760
She's probably hesitant.

207
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,040
She must be feeling guilty
for putting Chat in a critical condition.

208
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,920
Please tell Kwan that Chat is a soldier.

209
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,920
Sacrificing his life for the nation
is his patriotic duty.

210
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,200
This mission also led to the elimination
of one of the biggest drug distributors,

211
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
so it benefits many people.

212
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,760
She probably can't help herself, Dad.

213
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,440
Perhaps

214
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,880
her mom wouldn't allow her to come.

215
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,720
Are you referring

216
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,560
to M.L. Maratee?

217
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,800
Excuse me, we're here to clean
the patient's wounds.

218
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Please wait.

219
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,800
Did you come to visit Chat?

220
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,840
-Yes.
-Why didn't you go in?

221
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,600
I noticed he already had
many relatives visiting him.

222
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
If you don't mind,

223
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,960
may I ask if you are Kwanruetai?

224
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,640
I am.

225
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
I'm glad to finally meet you.

226
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,360
I'm Chat's mom.

227
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,520
You don't have to be so formal.

228
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Let's go inside to see Chat.

229
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,960
I'd rather not.

230
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,640
Why? Everyone is eager to meet you.

231
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,080
This is clearly a gathering of relatives.

232
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,720
But

233
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,560
you're the woman that Chat loves.

234
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,800
You're no different from a relative.

235
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,680
Let's go.

236
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
I…

237
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,320
wouldn't dare to entertain the idea.

238
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,840
The two of us are too different.

239
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,760
We're not meant to be.

240
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,080
I understand what you might be
feeling right now.

241
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,800
I had the exact same thought
when I was in your position.

242
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,520
But you should have faith

243
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,480
that unwavering love

244
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,880
will clear all the hurdles in your way.

245
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,920
Excuse me, I'll be leaving now.

246
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
Today…

247
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,480
I realized…

248
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,880
that you're the only person in this world
who truly loved me.

249
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,560
This world has never been fair to me.

250
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,400
I've been searching for
true love all my life…

251
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,480
but when it was right before me…

252
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,320
I couldn't see it.

253
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,000
By the time I realized, it was too late.

254
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,120
Even now,

255
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,200
my children hate me.

256
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,600
I have nothing left.

257
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,400
I feel like I'm all alone in this world.

258
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,040
Maratee.

259
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
Pat?

260
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,400
Pat,

261
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,680
did you come to apologize to me?

262
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,680
Yes.

263
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,040
And no.

264
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,680
I want to apologize to you

265
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,320
for never offering you help.

266
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,800
But if you want me to apologize

267
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,400
for not falling in love with you,
I can't do that.

268
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
You're as heartless toward me
as you used to be.

269
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,200
You want to send me to the depths of hell
and never come out, don't you?

270
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,160
The opposite, actually.

271
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,160
I love you

272
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,960
as a sister.

273
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,600
The feelings of this brother
have never changed.

274
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,440
But as time passes,

275
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,080
I still see you chasing after a dream
that can never come true.

276
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,880
You're right.

277
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,040
Who was it that made my life
into this sorry state?

278
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,560
You're still exactly as you used to be.

279
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,760
You blame everyone for everything.

280
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,640
I want you to see the truth.

281
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,040
The reason you're all alone

282
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,040
is not because of anyone else.

283
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,720
It's because you've never recognized
the value of the things you have.

284
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,760
You're so mean.

285
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,080
You hit right where it hurts.

286
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,200
I want you to realize.

287
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,680
In our final years,

288
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,400
shouldn't we be content with what we have?

289
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,920
Enough. Stop with the preaching.

290
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,560
Just say whatever it is
that brings you here.

291
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,400
You've come to formally ask for Kwanruetai
to be your son's bride, haven't you?

292
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,240
I won't ask you that.

293
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,640
I know that you'll fully oppose the idea

294
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,920
to make things difficult
for Krongkaew and me.

295
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,920
They seem very much in love though.

296
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,600
Eventually, they're going to be together.

297
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,880
Kwan will never abandon her mom.

298
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,200
Are you sure about that?

299
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,160
The daughter whose mom never loved her.

300
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,680
Whose mom insults her every day.

301
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,920
What can you use to keep her with you?

302
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,760
Are you admonishing me?

303
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,080
It's well-intentioned advice.

304
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
Would you rather have a loving family

305
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,240
or be all alone

306
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,520
because of your resentment?

307
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,560
The choice is yours.

308
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,800
Is that all you have to say?

309
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,000
Maratee.

310
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,960
Don't forget you still have
your dad, M.R. Dhevapan,

311
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,760
who still loves
and has been waiting for you.

312
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,040
Are you suggesting that
I should go see Dad?

313
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,800
I'll never do that.

314
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,920
I'll never go back to face humiliation.

315
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,400
No dad in the world

316
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,920
hates their own children.

317
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,400
If there's a chance, you should visit him.

318
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,040
He's getting old with the passing years.

319
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,080
Is Dad sick?

320
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,760
He's unwell.

321
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,760
I won't go back.

322
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,480
I'll never go back.

323
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,360
I couldn't possibly force you.

324
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,400
That's all I have to say to you.

325
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,320
I wish you luck.

326
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,760
Thank you.

327
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,639
What's in the letter?

328
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,719
You seem ecstatic.
Did you win a prize or what?

329
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,960
I passed the exam
for a vocational nursing course.

330
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,960
-Really?
-Really.

331
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,840
But

332
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,880
I'll have to go to Bangkok to study.

333
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,199
I could reject the offer.

334
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,440
I don't want to impose on you.

335
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,960
It'll be hard caring for Mom by yourself.

336
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,400
I don't mind being tired.

337
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,480
I'll miss you though.

338
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,960
Kwan, you've always told me that
you wanted to study to become a nurse.

339
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,120
The opportunity has arrived.

340
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,960
Don't miss it because you feel bad for me.

341
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,800
It's only a vocational nursing course.

342
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
I'll need to do
a full nursing degree as well.

343
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,400
-I think maybe I--
-Every journey begins with a single step.

344
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,280
After you graduate,

345
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,880
you're going to have a brighter future.

346
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,600
All right, I'll go to Bangkok to study.

347
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,920
But on one condition.

348
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,920
You must not tell Dr. Chat.

349
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,240
Why not?

350
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,680
It's already bad enough that I won't
be here to tend to Mom's needs.

351
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
I'd rather not do anything
to hurt her feelings.

352
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,640
If Dr. Chat finds out,

353
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,600
he'll definitely follow me.

354
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,840
You know very well the hatred
that Mom has for his family.

355
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,920
I don't want to be
an ungrateful child in her eyes.

356
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,280
I don't have to rely on them
to not starve to death.

357
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,480
-Let me help you.
-Don't bother.

358
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,720
I said don't bother.

359
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,680
I'm just a tenant.

360
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,320
If I don't help out with the chores,
Mr. Kong might decide to kick me out.

361
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,120
-He wouldn't go that far.
-He would and more.

362
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
Mom.

363
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,200
I want to tell you something.

364
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,440
I took an exam
for a vocational nursing course.

365
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,440
And…

366
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,480
I passed.

367
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,600
But…

368
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,120
I'll have to go to Bangkok
for an interview.

369
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,800
The course will start right away.

370
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,600
This is payback, isn't it?

371
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
You're also leaving me.

372
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,040
Do whatever you want.
You never obey me anyway.

373
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,560
I want to be a nurse like you.

374
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,480
You've been telling me all this time…

375
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,400
that you loved being a nurse.

376
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,520
I…

377
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,200
I want you

378
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,080
to be proud of me, you know?

379
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,040
I don't want you

380
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,720
to see me as bad luck forever.

381
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,840
Not for as long as we live.

382
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Mom.

383
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,760
Please let me go back to school.

384
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Just go wherever you want.

385
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,800
Leave.

386
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,920
I need to work to get fed.

387
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,400
I'm starving.

388
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,040
I'll be going now.

389
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,120
Make sure to stop by to clean
the house by the pond for me.

390
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,560
At least once a week.

391
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,960
I won't forget.

392
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,480
You shouldn't forget
to leave the key with Kong.

393
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,200
I know.

394
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,680
I'm going to miss you a lot
when you're not around.

395
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,560
Once I've found a place to stay,
I'll send you my phone number in a letter.

396
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,120
Come on.

397
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,680
Long-distance calls to Bangkok
are not cheap, you know?

398
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
Fine, letters will do.

399
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,560
I'll be waiting for them.
They'll help ease my loneliness.

400
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,920
You're going to need a whole night
to decipher my handwriting.

401
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,720
I'm sure you won't feel so lonely then.

402
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Right.

403
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,120
I'll be swearing at you as I'm reading it.

404
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,800
Are you okay?

405
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,480
Hey.

406
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,640
You gave me your word

407
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,360
that you'll be around to help Kong out.

408
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,720
Don't worry about that.

409
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,240
Just focus on completing your studies.

410
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,200
You can be my nurse when I'm older.

411
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,480
All right.

412
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,000
You make sure not to die young, okay?

413
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,040
By the way,

414
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,120
have you told Dr. Chat about this?

415
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,160
I'm sorry.

416
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,880
I didn't mean to disturb your rest.

417
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,520
It's okay. I was only resting my eyes.

418
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,400
Would you like something to eat now?
The food is still hot.

419
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,520
-Wait, Ms. Da.
-Yes?

420
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,160
Did Tai come by at all?

421
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,000
I haven't seen her.

422
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,200
She's probably deterred
by your relatives from Bangkok.

423
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,600
I'm also afraid.

424
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,640
Afraid I can't stop my heart from falling.

425
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,280
All of them are so handsome.

426
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,320
Let's get you fed.

427
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,480
Here you go.

428
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,680
I want to be a nurse like you.

429
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,520
You've been telling me all this time…

430
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,800
that you loved being a nurse.

431
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,000
You slut!

432
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,920
You even drew pictures of men?

433
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,360
Today, Kong has gone
to Lamphun for a catering job.

434
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,640
I'm alone with Mom.

435
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,280
I'm not used to it.

436
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,120
You're not used to it?

437
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,400
You're not used to it?

438
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,120
One day, I'll be a nurse like Mom.

439
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,840
Mom in a uniform is the coolest.

440
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,560
If you cry like that,

441
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,200
your eyes will swell up.

442
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,200
Dr. Chat.

443
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,880
Let go of my hand.

444
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,120
I won't let go.

445
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,840
I know that you chose to come in only
after the nurse had given me sedatives.

446
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,120
How can you be so heartless?

447
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,200
Forget about me.

448
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,920
I'm not right for you.

449
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,080
Will you ever stop thinking like that?

450
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,160
Forget who my parents are
and who your mom is.

451
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,600
No Jutathep. No Dhevaprom.

452
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,800
No one else.

453
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,360
Only the two of us.

454
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,800
Don't bother denying

455
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,760
that you love me.

456
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,440
I heard you say it with my own ears.

457
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,320
Do you know

458
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,360
it emboldened me to fight off death?

459
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,960
It's no use.

460
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,960
We were never meant to be.

461
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,160
I won't apologize for that.

462
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,160
I did it willingly.

463
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,360
Stop saying we're not meant to be.

464
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,960
I don't want to hear it.

465
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,600
It doesn't matter
if your mom fiercely opposes us.

466
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,480
I will never give up.

467
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,840
I'll wait for her to change her mind.

468
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,240
Is that all you have to say?

469
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,480
Take care of yourself.

470
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,400
Wait.

471
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,120
Can you get something
from the drawer for me?

472
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,720
What do you want? There's only a ring.

473
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,760
Bring me the ring.

474
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,080
Here you go.

475
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,760
I'd like you to put this ring on.

476
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,360
It's just an ordinary ring
that doesn't cost much,

477
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,720
but I'd like you to put it on…

478
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,880
for me.

479
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,560
This ring will be my substitute.

480
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,880
It will be with you everywhere,

481
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,560
always.

482
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,080
This ring will be my substitute.

483
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,360
It will be with you everywhere,

484
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,240
always.

485
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,280
Goodbye, Dr. Chat.

486
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,360
It's me, Kwan. Can I come in?

487
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,000
Come on in, Kong.

488
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,160
Are you almost done?

489
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,280
Do you want my help?

490
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,040
I'm done.

491
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,480
What's that?

492
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,680
A contact? Who am I meeting this time?

493
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,160
Ms. Lamai.

494
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,600
Who is she?

495
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,040
She rents out a place. I knew her
from when I was living in Bangkok.

496
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,120
At least at the beginning,
I'd like you to stay with her.

497
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,720
It'll put my mind at ease.

498
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,880
After you've adjusted,
you can choose to move out.

499
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,880
If you like it there,
you can choose to stay long-term.

500
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,240
Okay.

501
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,920
She'll be taking care of you in my place.

502
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,720
It makes me feel better.

503
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
Have you said goodbye to Mom?

504
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,880
Mom, are you awake?

505
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,960
Mom, I'm leaving for Bangkok.

506
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,760
Mom, the car is here. I have to leave now.

507
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,560
Just leave.

508
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,720
I'll be going then.

509
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,880
Goodbye.

510
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,600
Once I've arrived in Bangkok,

511
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,840
I'll be in touch.

512
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,160
I love you, Mom.

513
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,080
Let me know when you've arrived.

514
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,520
I will.

515
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,840
Please take care of Mom.

516
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,640
Don't be too harsh on her.

517
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,680
I'm not that cold-hearted, you know?

518
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,640
Have a safe trip.

519
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,280
You should go.

520
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,160
I'm going now.

521
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,000
-The food is really delicious.
-Thank you.

522
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,920
So two packs for you?

523
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,120
-Kong.
-Thank you.

524
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,880
Yes?

525
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,760
-Are you managing by yourself?
-Where is Tai?

526
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,320
She won't be coming.

527
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,960
-Why?
-What?

528
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,800
Are you selling at two locations?

529
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,080
That's not it. Tai already
left for Bangkok to study.

530
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,280
She's doing a nursing course.

531
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,960
Really? Wow.

532
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,640
Why did she keep it quiet?

533
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,920
That's right. She should have told us.
We are fellow nurses here.

534
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,200
We could offer her some advice.

535
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,200
Maybe she wanted to wait
until after the interview to be sure.

536
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,000
Not to tempt fate.

537
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,600
Does Dr. Chat know this?

538
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,440
Why are you back so early?

539
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,920
No customers?

540
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,680
You.

541
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,040
How did you get in here? Get out.

542
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,360
Hello.

543
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,520
Are you here for Kwan?

544
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,880
She's no longer here.
She left for Bangkok to study.

545
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,240
I came to see you.

546
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,680
What do you want?

547
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,440
I have something to tell you.

548
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,720
Do you want to talk about my daughter?

549
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,120
You would better go back the way you came.

550
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,080
You know who I am.

551
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,400
You're not welcome here.

552
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,520
I'm asking you to give me a chance.

553
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,440
I have no chances to give you.

554
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,880
You know what your parents did to me.

555
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,680
Do you expect me to just brush that aside

556
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,120
and give my daughter to you?

557
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,640
In your dreams. Not a chance.

558
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,160
I know that

559
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,480
I can't change the past.

560
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,960
But may I please ask you

561
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,520
to take my love for Tai
into consideration?

562
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,920
I love her sincerely

563
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,640
and want to care for her
for the rest of my life.

564
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,360
A man's words

565
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:04,880
can never be trusted.

566
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,800
Especially the words of the son of a man
who never kept his promises,

567
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,960
such as Pat.

568
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,080
They are just empty promises.

569
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,160
I understand your resentment.

570
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,640
Our two families made a pledge.

571
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,080
Even though, in the end,

572
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,320
we did not fulfill our end of the bargain.

573
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,200
But please understand that

574
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,400
the matter of love

575
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,760
cannot be forced.

576
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,840
Are you implying

577
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,480
that I coerced your dad?

578
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,000
I'm not saying that. I'd never say that.

579
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,720
I'm asking for your empathy.

580
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,600
-I--
-Stop.

581
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,120
Stop. Don't say anymore.

582
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,840
Love can wane with time.

583
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,880
The heartache is temporary. It'll heal.
You'll soon forget about her.

584
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,520
I'll never forget Tai.

585
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,440
I love her.

586
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,680
I don't care what you have to say.

587
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,920
As long as I'm still breathing,

588
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,200
you and Kwan will never be together.

589
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,640
Pat and I didn't have our happy ending.

590
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,760
Don't even dream

591
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,320
that you, the son of Pat and Krongkaew,
could find happiness.

592
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,480
You will be in misery
for the rest of your life.

593
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,560
I know that you love Tai,
like any other mom.

594
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,760
I believe that all moms

595
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,200
wish for their children to find true love.

596
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,800
I'll wait for you to change your mind.

597
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,560
Sir.

598
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,160
Mrs. Maratee is here to see you.

599
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,640
It's all my fault.

600
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,200
Forgive me.

601
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,560
Dad, I'm sorry.

602
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,440
I'm sorry about what happened.

603
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:43,000
And I'd rather let sleeping dogs lie.

604
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,200
I can only hope that

605
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,760
from today on

606
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,840
we can take a step forward together

607
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,160
and focus on our children's happiness.

608
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,280
Your mom and mine teamed up to set us up.

609
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,480
That leaves your dad as the final hurdle

610
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,880
and then the wedding.

611
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,160
Not yet.

612
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,880
I'll wait until after Chat's wedding.

613
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,400
Come on.

614
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,360
I'm in love with Tai.

615
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:10,880
I give you my word that

616
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,440
I'll look after her the best I can.

617
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,800
She'll come before my own life.

618
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,320
Are you giving me permission to marry Tai?

619
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,000
I give you an inch, and you take a mile.

620
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:28,000
I haven't said a word about
entrusting my daughter to you.

621
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:04,680
