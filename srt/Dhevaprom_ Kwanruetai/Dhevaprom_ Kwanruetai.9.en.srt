1
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,720
All sorted, Mom.

2
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,200
Open wide.

3
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,280
Oh my gosh! Snake!

4
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,800
You seem very concerned about her.

5
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,280
-Vines don't bite.
-How did you know it was a vine?

6
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,880
-Where are you going?
-Let go!

7
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,240
No one's here.

8
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,920
I'm sorry. I didn't plan that.

9
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,040
What the hell?

10
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,320
They are going to have us arrested.

11
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,600
We've got to run. Now.

12
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,360
-Good morning, Ms. Kej.
-Good morning.

13
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,160
Where did you sleep last night?

14
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
-Well…
-Ms. Kej went home last night.

15
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,800
But Ms. Kej, you seem to be wearing
the same clothes as yesterday.

16
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,160
Well, I just picked Ms. Kej up.

17
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,680
Everyone's here.

18
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,680
Does anyone know
who Mr. Wit fought with last night?

19
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,080
His face was all banged up.

20
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,399
Ms. Mint, how did you know?

21
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,920
How could I miss it?

22
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,560
This morning, I saw Ms. Pilai
taking Mr. Wit out of the hotel,

23
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,040
looking quite suspicious.

24
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,920
Ms. Rung?

25
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
It's time for your wake-up call.

26
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,200
Ms. Rung?

27
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,280
Ms. Rung,

28
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,160
are you awake?

29
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,200
I called your room, but no one answered.

30
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,840
Ms. Rung?

31
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,760
Ms. Rung, may I come in?

32
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,000
Can't we come in yet?

33
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,240
-What's going on?
-You can't come in.

34
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,720
We've been waiting for a long time.

35
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,080
Ms. Rung called last night.

36
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,200
She was very insistent about waking her up

37
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,120
because she had an important appointment.

38
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,160
If she overslept,
she'd hold the hotel responsible.

39
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,200
-I called, but no one answered, so I…
-She was Mr. Attawit's secret girlfriend.

40
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,920
-The son of the boutique's owner?
-That's right.

41
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,960
But Mr. Wit has already checked out.

42
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,360
Chat.

43
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Kej.

44
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,080
Is Wit there?

45
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,840
Yes.

46
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,200
Hold on a moment.

47
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,520
Sak wants to talk to you.

48
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,520
The boss wants to meet both of you.

49
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,600
Is it something urgent?

50
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,640
I don't know.

51
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,760
When does he want to meet Pilai and me?

52
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,120
Today, as soon as possible.

53
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
Come to the abandoned warehouse.

54
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Okay.

55
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,840
I'll be there shortly.

56
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,960
It's a total mess. We're finished.
We've got nothing left.

57
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,440
Our ten million baht just vanished,
thanks to that junkie bitch!

58
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Damn it!

59
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,920
What did the boss say?

60
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,960
He wants to meet us.

61
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,960
Mr. Wit, is he planning to silence us?

62
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,080
Watch your mouth!

63
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,240
Can't you say something positive?

64
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm already on edge.

65
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
All right.

66
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,520
Let's ask the boss for a second chance.

67
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,160
But I'm scared.

68
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,120
Scared? What good does that do?

69
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,200
I'm furious. Everything is ruined
because of that bitch Rung.

70
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,280
I warned her so many times
not to take too much.

71
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,520
It's more that Mom Luang bitch's fault

72
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,200
that we're in this mess.

73
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,280
We missed out on the money,

74
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,040
and we're taking the heat from the boss.

75
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,520
Just you wait.

76
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,520
When we get through this,

77
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,520
that Mom Luang Kej
will answer for all of it.

78
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,640
Where is he?

79
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,320
I'll toss him in the army jail

80
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,520
and ask Uncle Phee
to lock him away for good.

81
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,520
Calm down, Chat. Wit ran away already.

82
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,280
He's probably hiding out somewhere.

83
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,520
Why didn't you tell me about him?

84
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,560
Well, I was afraid
you'd make me quit my job.

85
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,360
What if he had attacked you?
Would it have been worth it?

86
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,800
If Park hadn't stepped in, what then?

87
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,680
You can't outsmart those villains.

88
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,080
Take it as a lesson, Kej.

89
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,480
I'll remember this lesson, Chat.

90
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,840
I won't take that risk again.

91
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,360
It's on me, Chat,
for not letting you know.

92
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,600
What now, Chat?

93
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,280
I was going to report him to the police,

94
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,560
but with Rungrawee's overdose incident,

95
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,320
I'm hesitating.

96
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,240
Let's hold off on that for now.

97
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,360
If Wit's the one behind
the heroin in the doll,

98
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,360
he'll be in jail for a long term.

99
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,880
Good idea.

100
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,800
Kej can avoid ruining her name.

101
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,760
If the police can't catch him,

102
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,680
with his grudge against Kej,

103
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,040
he might return for a payback anytime.

104
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,440
I want you

105
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,520
to think again about going back
to work at Arada Boutique.

106
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,120
-Ouch!
-Mr. Wit!

107
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,240
-Ouch!
-Mr. Wit!

108
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,840
Mr. Wit!

109
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,200
-Ouch! No more.
-Hold off for now.

110
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm sorry, no more.

111
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,040
No more.

112
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,400
-No more, let me go.
-Come here!

113
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,440
Mr. Wit.

114
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,160
-I'm sorry.
-What good does your apology do?

115
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,920
Can you even afford
to make up for the money I lost?

116
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,840
I'll figure out a way to pay you back.

117
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,920
Please, Kevin.

118
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,280
Please let the boss know that
I'm asking for another chance.

119
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,560
Please.

120
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,520
-Please.
-Mr. Wit!

121
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,360
Count your blessings
that he hasn't ended both of you.

122
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,280
One week. Just give me one week.

123
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,320
I'll find the money to pay you back.
Please.

124
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,880
Someone like you?

125
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,200
Mr. Wit's mom owns a boutique.

126
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,880
She's loaded.

127
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,120
I handle the boutique's accounts.
I know it well.

128
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,240
That's right, Arada Boutique.
Have you ever heard of it?

129
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,440
My mother's boutique is famous. It's true!

130
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,160
It's true!

131
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,280
Please, Kevin.

132
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,320
-Please.
-Since you've always come through before,

133
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,680
I'll give you another shot.

134
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,640
Thanks a lot. I really appreciate it.

135
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,280
Thank you so much.

136
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,120
Thank you so much.

137
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,240
But since you messed up,

138
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,280
there has to be some consequences.

139
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,120
-What do you mean?
-What are you doing?

140
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,840
-What are you doing? No!
-What are you doing?

141
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,800
No! What are you doing?

142
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,280
No!

143
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,800
No!

144
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,320
-What are you doing?
-Kevin.

145
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,320
Don't!

146
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,080
Don't!

147
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,520
-Don't!
-Don't!

148
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,360
-Don't!
-Don't hurt Mr. Wit!

149
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,640
Don't!

150
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,720
Kevin!

151
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, no, Mr. Wit!

152
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Mr. Wit!

153
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Mr. Wit!

154
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,480
Follow him
and see where he's sneaking off to.

155
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,160
Whatever you find, don't let
Mr. Songpol know. Do you understand?

156
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,560
-Yes, Mrs. Nant.
-Go.

157
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,080
Boss!

158
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,040
Why did you come here without me?

159
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,040
Run now!

160
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,840
Hey, what's up with you?

161
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,200
-Oh, shit!
-Maiseek!

162
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Hey!

163
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,440
Maiseek!

164
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,960
Maiseek!

165
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,960
Hey!

166
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,760
You can't get away from me, Maiseek!

167
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,200
Hey, get lost!

168
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,480
Maiseek!

169
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,960
Hey!

170
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,480
-Hey, get up.
-Sak.

171
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,080
-Sak.
-Why are you selling drugs to Mr. Sorn?

172
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
I asked,
why are you selling drugs to Mr. Sorn?

173
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,920
I need the money, and Sorn pays big.

174
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,320
If the word gets out,

175
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,360
I'll silence you first.

176
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,360
Let's go.

177
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,840
Hey, let go of me!

178
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,840
Why did you hit Sak?

179
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,800
He threatened to silence you.

180
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,480
You don't know anything,
so cut it out, Sumlee.

181
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,400
Who said I don't know?
I know, I just never said it.

182
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,160
You're running drugs.

183
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,280
You go to the gambling den too.

184
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,319
If Tai finds out, you're done for.

185
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,440
What trouble are you in?

186
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,240
Why do you need
that kind of money, Maiseek?

187
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,079
Please try not to worry.
You'll get well soon.

188
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,560
Doctors are amazing these days.

189
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,359
Hang in there, ma'am.

190
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Every time I go through radiation,
it's a struggle, Sumlee.

191
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,560
Sometimes, I just wish
for an end to all of this.

192
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,880
If it weren't for Maiseek
being left alone,

193
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,440
I wouldn't bother.

194
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,800
It's both painful and costly.

195
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,200
Look at him, working tirelessly
every day to earn a living.

196
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,080
I hardly get to see him.

197
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,280
Come on, Mom.

198
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,320
I'm okay with working hard,
but you can't give up.

199
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,160
You must complete
the doctor's treatment plan.

200
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,160
Okay.

201
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,600
I better get going

202
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,160
so you can get plenty of rest.

203
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,320
Please look out for Maiseek, Sumlee.

204
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,920
I worry about him.

205
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,680
If something happens to me,

206
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,280
don't abandon Maiseek.

207
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,440
He doesn't have anyone else.

208
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,440
Think of him as a brother, Sumlee.

209
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,960
Okay?

210
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,280
Love each other and stick together.

211
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,160
Don't worry, ma'am.

212
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,960
Maiseek and I are friends for life.

213
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,480
I'll never abandon him.

214
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,360
Thank you, my dear.

215
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,720
Mom, let's get you upstairs for some rest.

216
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,680
Yes.

217
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,800
Please look out for him.

218
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,400
Why is she running late today?

219
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,360
Where has she gone?

220
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,360
Tai!

221
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,120
Tai!

222
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,360
Tai!

223
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,520
Tai, are you home?

224
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,480
Tai, did you forget
my meal delivery today?

225
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,000
Hey, Mr. Chat,

226
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,520
what brings you here?

227
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,720
I came by to ask

228
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,600
if Tai delivered your meals.

229
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,480
Not yet. Her mother's health
might be keeping her busy.

230
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,840
Tai?

231
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,760
Tai?

232
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
Tai?

233
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,960
Tai?

234
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,360
Tai?

235
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,560
Tai?

236
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,960
Tai, are you home?

237
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,080
Tai!

238
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Tai!

239
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,800
Tai!

240
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,480
Tai!

241
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,480
Tai!

242
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,720
Tai!

243
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,760
Are you awake?

244
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,120
Don't get up yet. Get some more rest.

245
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,560
Hey, how did you get inside my house?

246
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,440
You didn't deliver my meals.

247
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,560
When I called, no one answered.

248
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,480
I was worried that

249
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,920
your mom might be getting worse.

250
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,480
But guess what?

251
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,800
It was you passed out in the bathroom.

252
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,440
Did you change my clothes?

253
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,560
Hey, Tai.

254
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,040
-Fon.
-You're awake?

255
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,160
Has your fever gone down?

256
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
Let me check.

257
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
You're still warm. I'll wipe you down.

258
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,440
-Fon.
-Yes?

259
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,240
Did you change my clothes?

260
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,600
Yes.

261
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,360
What were you thinking,
taking a bath with a fever like that?

262
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,400
You could've caught pneumonia.

263
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,120
Well…

264
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,600
If Dr. Chat hadn't come over
to check on you, what then?

265
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,520
Give me your arm.

266
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,640
Why are you home alone?

267
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,920
That's right.
Where are your mom and brother?

268
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,080
Kong is away on a catering job.

269
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,080
And Mom…

270
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,880
went to see a doctor in Bangkok.

271
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,040
Kong's not around. Who took her?

272
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Probably a friend.

273
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,240
Does your mom have friends?

274
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,720
I'll give you an injection,
and you can get back to resting.

275
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
Do I need one?

276
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,120
Scared of needles?

277
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,960
No, who's scared of needles?

278
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,360
It's just a needle.

279
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,080
It hasn't even gone in.

280
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,000
It was cold.

281
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,440
I was startled.

282
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,040
Don't tense up your arm. Keep it relaxed.

283
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,480
I'm injecting you now.

284
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Okay, hold it down. All done.

285
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,240
That's it?

286
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,720
Dr. Chat is known for having
the gentlest touch in the whole province.

287
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,000
Ant bites hurt more than this.

288
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Rest up, okay?

289
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,240
Thank you so much, Fon.
You can go back to your shift.

290
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,880
-I'll keep an eye on Tai.
-Okay, Doctor.

291
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,920
Bye.

292
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,600
Why didn't you tell me?

293
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,360
I didn't want you to get into trouble.

294
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,760
Do you see me as your friend?

295
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,000
If you had told me and Tai from the start,

296
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,880
we could have helped you earn money
for your mother's treatment

297
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,800
without turning to dirty money like this.

298
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,680
All right, stop rubbing it in.

299
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,760
I messed up. I didn't think it through.

300
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,560
Anyway, I'll quit.

301
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,440
That circle is easy to enter
but hard to exit.

302
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,480
When I saw how Sak was
chasing you down today,

303
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,480
I knew that no matter what, you'd be
his lackey for the rest of your life.

304
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,200
Are you just rubbing it in
or are you going to help, Sumlee?

305
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,680
Maiseek,

306
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,480
you have to tell Tai about this.

307
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,080
Keep laughing.

308
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,640
Once you taste it, you'll beg me
to make you omelets again.

309
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,720
Talk less, okay?

310
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,400
Let me check.

311
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,040
Oh, no. Hey, it's burning.
Flip it quickly.

312
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,000
Quickly.

313
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,640
Gosh, it's burnt. Can we even eat it?

314
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,120
Hey.

315
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,200
Wow.

316
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,440
We've got congee with ground pork too.

317
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,280
It looks good, right?

318
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
Let me taste it.

319
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,080
Let's see if it's any good.

320
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,360
You've got some skills.

321
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,880
Well, of course.

322
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,360
Dating a cook,
I have to learn how to cook.

323
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,320
Do I have to learn
how to give injections too?

324
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,600
Get over your fear of needles first.

325
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,960
The congee is burning.

326
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,800
-I'll help.
-Don't, just go away.

327
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,320
Are you talking to us?

328
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,960
You're asking for it!

329
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,560
How could you do this, Maiseek?

330
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,880
You know I'm in charge of getting rid
of drug dealers from our village,

331
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,440
and now you're dealing yourself?

332
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,720
I can't handle this mood shift.

333
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,440
Stop eating!

334
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,440
Take it easy, Tai.

335
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,000
You're not fully recovered.

336
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,480
It's infuriating.

337
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,640
Why did you do it?
The three of us are like family.

338
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,320
Why didn't you tell me about this?

339
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,400
Your mom being sick
is like my mom being sick.

340
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,960
And Dr. Chat is one of us.

341
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,440
If you had told us from the start,

342
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,320
we could've come up with a better plan

343
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,120
than your stupid idea of going into
the gambling den and running drugs.

344
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,560
I'm really sorry, Tai.
I won't do it again.

345
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,440
But Sak won't let him off the hook.

346
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,240
Who's Sak?

347
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,080
Well, he's Mr. Songpol's right-hand man.

348
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,920
Maiseek sells drugs he gets from him.

349
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,160
Does that mean
Mr. Songpol is involved too?

350
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,960
Of course, he is, Doctor.

351
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,840
But for this one, Sak probably
stole Mr. Songpol's drugs to sell

352
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,080
and pocketed the money.

353
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,880
What if we use Maiseek as our spy?

354
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,680
With careful planning,

355
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,400
we can throw Mr. Songpol behind bars.

356
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,640
Karma is catching up to him.

357
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,160
Uncle Boon and Pon's deaths
won't be in vain.

358
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,120
BANGKOK

359
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,280
Did anyone bring me up?

360
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,040
No, sir.

361
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,440
Are you sure Wit won't rat me out
to save his own skin?

362
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,200
Kevin cut off his finger
and scared the hell out of him.

363
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,440
Who knows where he's hiding?

364
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,880
If you're sure he won't talk, that's good.

365
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,120
I can stay in Bangkok
for a couple more days.

366
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,080
Who's the lucky girl for this trip, sir?

367
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,920
This one isn't a girl.

368
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,720
I've had my sights set on this temptress

369
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,560
for a long time.

370
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,400
Mrs. Manee? It's me.

371
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,680
Mrs. Manee, are you asleep?

372
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,520
I'm about to go to sleep. What is it?

373
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,360
I can't sleep.

374
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,360
This place is unfamiliar.

375
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,160
Would you mind keeping me company?

376
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,800
I'm tired already.
I'm going to bed now because tomorrow

377
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,040
I have an early doctor's appointment.

378
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,880
Hold on, just a moment.

379
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,920
You see,

380
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,360
I walked past a jewelry shop in the lobby

381
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,040
and saw

382
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,920
this beautiful pendant

383
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,640
that would go perfectly
with that necklace I got you before.

384
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,440
So I…

385
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,120
bought it for you.

386
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,480
I'd like to bring this pendant inside
and show it to you.

387
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,640
Will you allow me?

388
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,800
Then,

389
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,160
let me

390
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,040
hold onto it for the night,
and I'll tell you tomorrow

391
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,440
if it's to my liking.

392
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Sweet dreams.

393
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,920
Are the police and reporters
still hanging around the shop?

394
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,560
They show up sometimes,

395
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,680
but not as many as the first day.

396
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
I'm…

397
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,480
at a loss for how to apologize to you.

398
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,840
I never thought
my son could do such a terrible thing.

399
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,760
I can't get in touch
with Orawan and Orawee.

400
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,840
They've all abandoned me.

401
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,640
They probably don't want
their names ruined.

402
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,840
Ms. Kej,

403
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,640
could you stay on

404
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,760
and not resign right now?

405
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,440
I really empathize with Mrs. Arada,

406
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,600
but my parents are seriously concerned.

407
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,240
They asked me to quit right away.

408
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,000
Today, Chat even had to request
urgent leave to go to Bangkok

409
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,840
and explain everything.

410
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,960
Did you hand in your notice?

411
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,520
Not yet. I couldn't say no to her.
I just smiled.

412
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,600
I do want to stay
and help out Mrs. Da for a while longer

413
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,600
until this whole situation settles,

414
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,200
but I don't know how to tell my parents.

415
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,880
They want me back in Bangkok by tomorrow.

416
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,280
It's not that hard. I have a plan.

417
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,160
How does it work?

418
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,120
You can tell your parents
you've already quit

419
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,000
and have joined my company instead.

420
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,360
I don't want you to leave now either.

421
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,120
What position would I be taking?

422
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,960
Managing director's wife.

423
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,480
Are you crazy?

424
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,120
How about becoming my secretary?

425
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,480
No way, you'd mess with me
and give me too much work.

426
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,960
I'm joking.

427
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,800
There are several roles
at my company that would suit you.

428
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,200
Like the interior design team.

429
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,880
I saw your decorating skills
at Tai's house by the swamp.

430
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,280
You'd do great in this role.

431
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,920
If you agree,

432
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,560
I'll ask my mom to help speak for you.

433
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,600
There won't be any problems.

434
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,720
Our mothers already want us to get closer.

435
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,880
Okay, let's go with that.

436
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,960
And what's the salary?

437
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,360
How about I treat you
to dinner instead of a salary?

438
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,560
For life, okay?

439
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,480
You're quite crafty.

440
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,520
If you don't give me your hand,

441
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,800
the job offer is off.

442
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,840
You're the worst.

443
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,720
-Sak!
-Take that!

444
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,280
Get up.

445
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,160
-Ouch!
-Hey!

446
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,800
Don't sell drugs to Mr. Sorn again.

447
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,520
Remember that!

448
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,040
I won't. I'm scared now.

449
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,560
Do it again,

450
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,520
and you'll meet the same end as Pon.

451
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,560
I won't do it again.
I've learned my lesson.

452
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,480
Please forgive me, Sak.

453
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,840
Will you work for me this evening?

454
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,640
I will!

455
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,480
-Hey! You're annoying!
-Ouch!

456
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,640
Get away from my feet!

457
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,600
Don't sell drugs to Mr. Sorn again.

458
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,280
-Okay.
-Let's go!

459
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,360
If you're going to press it that hard,

460
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,760
you might as well kick me.

461
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,080
Sorry, buddy. I'm just anxious for you.

462
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,760
When will Sak ask you
to move stuff for him again?

463
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,720
This evening, I already gave my word.

464
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,360
Is it too soon?

465
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,320
Yes,

466
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,880
but if we plan it right, we'll be fine.

467
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,880
Actually, tonight works the best.

468
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,680
My mom's in Bangkok for a doctor's visit,

469
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,600
and Kong's still in Chiang Mai.

470
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,240
It's more convenient for me this way.

471
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,280
I'm just worried about my mom, Tai.

472
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,200
If I cross them,

473
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,960
they might come after her
to get back at me.

474
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,560
It's not just your mom. It's you too.

475
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,040
Both of you need to find a safer place
until things calm down.

476
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,040
Turning to this kind of stuff
was such a stupid move.

477
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,360
I'm trying to quit, okay?

478
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,080
With all the secrets you know,

479
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,240
quitting might just mean death.

480
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,480
And about your mom's health,

481
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,440
I believe Dr. Chat will figure
something out.

482
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,400
Don't worry.

483
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,760
Today,

484
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,080
I'm unmasking Songpol
as the villain he really is.

485
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,600
We can't make any mistakes tonight.

486
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,560
Do you get it?

487
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,000
-Okay.
-Okay.

488
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,240
Chat.

489
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,000
How was the family meeting?

490
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,320
Everyone wants Kej to quit.

491
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,320
Dad usually never interferes
with Kej's work,

492
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,400
but this time, he even spoke up himself.

493
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,680
But Mrs. Arada isn't involved in this.

494
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,560
Even so, the situation
has become more serious.

495
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,520
Kej might find it uncomfortable
to continue working there.

496
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,480
That's true.

497
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,200
Don't forget that Kej
was the one who provided the statement,

498
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,400
leading her son to run off.

499
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,800
Can they look each other in the eye

500
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,320
if they work together?

501
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,680
Kej respects Mrs. Arada
as if she were an elder relative.

502
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,840
She empathizes with her
and doesn't want to leave her now.

503
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,320
Chat,

504
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,200
empathy is a good thing,
but her own safety also matters.

505
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,840
This case is related to drugs.

506
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,600
Petch is right.

507
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,880
The police still haven't caught him.

508
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,480
He could come back
and get revenge on Kej anytime.

509
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,480
I heard Dad ask his friend in the police.

510
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,480
According to him, this is linked to
an international drug trafficking network.

511
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,440
The major players may be
Chang Chen and his crew,

512
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,840
who the authorities
are trying to track down.

513
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,360
Goodness.

514
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,720
Wit.

515
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,040
Where have you been?

516
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,520
I need a million baht, Mom.

517
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,480
Where am I supposed
to find that kind of money?

518
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,080
You should leave now.

519
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,840
Mom, are you kicking me out?

520
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,240
I'm your son.

521
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,080
Because you're my son,

522
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,200
I'm not calling the police.

523
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,560
Just get out of here, go.

524
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,600
If someone sees you,

525
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,080
you'll get arrested.

526
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,520
But I need the money now, Mom.

527
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,400
I'm in trouble.

528
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,880
The police are coming after me.

529
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,840
I'm running for my life.

530
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,600
Can't you help me?

531
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,520
Who told you to do something so terrible?

532
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,840
Gambling was bad enough,

533
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,480
but dealing drugs too?

534
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,600
Rungrawee died because of you, right?

535
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,880
That's right, Mom.

536
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,280
I'm dealing.

537
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,680
I need the money to clear my debt.

538
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,240
All you care about is
the money for Wan and Oy.

539
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,200
You don't care about me.

540
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,120
Me? I don't care about you?

541
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,800
You know I mortgaged
the shop's deed for you?

542
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,760
Every bit of cash I make
is to pay off the debt.

543
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,960
If I didn't love you,

544
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,840
why would I do that?

545
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,400
I need the money now, Mom.

546
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,520
If I don't get it…

547
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,200
If I don't get it,
they're going to kill me.

548
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,880
Mom, look at this.

549
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,600
They cut off my finger.

550
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,400
Wit.

551
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,080
Stop running. Turn yourself in.

552
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,880
The punishment might be reduced.

553
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,880
That way, they can't hurt you anymore.

554
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,000
No way, I won't go to jail.

555
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,720
-I won't go to jail.
-Hey, you can't take it.

556
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,280
Please, Mom, give it to me.

557
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,720
-I'll sell it. I need the money.
-You can't take it!

558
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,600
-I already mortgaged the shop for you.
-I need the money.

559
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,160
-Give it back!
-I'll sell it to get the money.

560
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,120
Mom.

561
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,600
Mom, I'm sorry.

562
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,320
-I'm sorry.
-You can't take it, Wit.

563
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,800
-I asked nicely, but you won't give it.
-You can't.

564
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,800
Give it back, Wit.

565
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,880
Give it back.

566
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,960
You can't take it. Give it back!

567
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,760
-Give it back!
-I need it, Mom.

568
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,120
I need the money.

569
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,680
-I need the money, Mom.
-Wit.

570
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,280
-Mom, I can't give it back. Mom, let go.
-Give it.

571
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,560
-Mom, please let go.
-Give it back!

572
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,760
Mom!

573
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,880
Mom.

574
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,160
Mom!

575
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,800
-Mom!
-What did you do to Mom? Tell me now!

576
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,640
I didn't do anything.

577
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,200
Mom fell on her own.

578
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,360
There's a lot of blood, Wan.

579
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,080
Wit!

580
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,080
Why did you hurt Mom?

581
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,520
Why did you hurt Mom? Did you steal that?

582
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,520
-It's mine!
-Give it back! Oy, help me!

583
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,920
-It's mine!
-Give it back right now!

584
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,440
-It's mine!
-Give it back!

585
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,280
-Give it back!
-I'll never give it back!

586
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,280
-Ouch! Wit!
-Let go!

587
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,040
Wit, you asshole!

588
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,080
-Give me the bag! Oy, help me!
-I said I won't!

589
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:53,320
-Give it back!
-I won't give it back! It's my money!

590
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,120
-Give it back!
-Ouch!

591
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,560
-We got it back, Wan.
-We got the bag.

592
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,320
We got the bag.

593
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,320
Do you want to get stabbed? Give it back.

594
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,000
You dare use a knife to threaten me.
I'm your older sister!

595
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,600
Yes! Do you want to get stabbed?
Do you want to die? Give it back!

596
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,800
-Don't, Wit!
-Let go!

597
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,080
-Give it back!
-No!

598
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,160
-Ouch!
-Wan!

599
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,080
-Don't follow me.
-Ouch!

600
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,080
-Don't follow me.
-Ouch!

601
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,280
Ouch! Hey!

602
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,480
Ouch!

603
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,360
Don't come any closer.
Park is getting the police.

604
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,000
If you don't want to get arrested,
get out of here now.

605
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,040
I'll be back for you.

606
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,040
Mom!

607
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,440
-Mom!
-Mom!

608
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,080
-Mom!
-Mom!

609
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,800
-Mom!
-Mom!

610
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,760
Where have you been?

611
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,080
What happened to your face?

612
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,480
-It's nothing, Mom.
-Let me see.

613
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,440
My goodness.

614
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,240
Your eyes and face are swollen,
and you said it was nothing?

615
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,320
Who did you get into a fight with?
Tell me now.

616
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,800
I was just playing with Sumlee,

617
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,600
and he accidentally
punched me in the face.

618
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,120
Don't think I'm clueless.

619
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,600
Okay?

620
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,480
Was it the thugs running the gambling den?

621
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,200
Right?

622
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,320
Sumlee told me everything.

623
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,360
Sumlee, you traitor.

624
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,400
Don't be too harsh on him.

625
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,240
He's just worried about you.

626
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,120
He's afraid you're getting in too deep.

627
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,840
That's why he confessed to me.

628
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,720
I just need the money
to give you the best care.

629
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,600
I'd rather die

630
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,360
than see you take the wrong path.

631
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,200
Nothing good comes from gambling.

632
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,480
You will always lose.

633
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,840
The longer it goes on,

634
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,280
the deeper you sink,
making it harder to break free.

635
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,400
If your house caught on fire,

636
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,760
at least you have the land left.

637
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,320
But losing in gambling,

638
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,040
you end up with nothing, Maiseek.

639
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,640
Okay, Mom.

640
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,040
I'm already trying to quit.

641
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,080
Are you serious? You're not lying to me?

642
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,960
I'm serious.

643
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,400
I made a mistake,

644
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,240
but I'm lucky to get a chance to fix it.

645
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,640
Promise me

646
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,040
you'll see the treatment through
until you're fully healed.

647
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,280
Don't lose hope,
and don't stop your treatment.

648
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,600
And don't worry about household expenses.

649
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,560
Dr. Chat promised
to help with your treatment.

650
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,720
Who's Dr. Chat?

651
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,240
Why would he help me?

652
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,000
It's Tai's boyfriend,

653
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:37,960
but don't tell anyone.

654
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,400
She is shy and keeping it low profile.

655
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,200
We're keeping it among us.

656
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,280
I won't tell anyone.

657
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,160
Tai is really something.

658
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,480
She has got a doctor boyfriend, huh?

659
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,360
Sumlee will pick you up
in the evening, okay?

660
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,000
Where will he take me?

661
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,480
To get your treatment.

662
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,720
What?

663
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,480
Why do I have to go with Sumlee?
What about you?

664
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,520
Well, I have to take care of something.

665
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,320
We need to move temporarily
for your treatment until you're healed.

666
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,760
You can start packing your clothes
and get ready.

667
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,920
I love you, Mom.

668
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,320
Mom, please stay with me for a long time.

669
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,240
Don't leave me like Dad did.

670
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,560
Okay, Mom?

671
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,920
Stay with me for a long time.

672
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,080
How is she?

673
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,760
Wan is still getting stitches.

674
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,560
As for my mother,

675
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,640
the X-ray shows no hemorrhage,

676
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,240
but the doctor wants her
to stay for observation overnight.

677
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,440
Thank you, Ms. Kej, for helping us.

678
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,680
I don't understand what Wit was thinking,
hurting us like this,

679
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,520
his own mom and sisters.

680
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,360
I should go and check on my mom and Wan.

681
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,760
I shouldn't have gone back to my office.

682
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,240
If I had returned with you,

683
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,720
I could have caught Wit
and turned him over.

684
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,480
From now on, I won't let you
out of my sight, not even for a second.

685
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,880
He is coming.

686
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,760
You are Maiseek, right?

687
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,480
-Yes.
-Mr. Songpol sent me.

688
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,840
-Open the trunk.
-Okay.

689
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,680
-What am I taking to Bangkok?
-Imported wine.

690
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,040
Well, what do I need to do?

691
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,760
Just follow these directions.

692
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,760
If you get lost,
call the number down here.

693
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,840
When you arrive, just ring the bell.
Someone will come out and get it.

694
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,360
Then you can drive back and get your pay.

695
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,440
Hurry now, drive to Bangkok.

696
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,360
Don't make any stops.

697
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,600
If you can't deliver the wine on time,

698
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,560
you'll be in trouble.

699
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,560
Okay. I'm on my way now.

700
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,920
-Don't make any stops, okay?
-Okay.

701
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,760
It's not wine. It's clearly heroin.

702
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,960
It's the same in this box, Tai.

703
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,640
You did well, Maseek.

704
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,040
What do we do next?

705
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,080
I'm so nervous I can't think.

706
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,960
Let's take this to the police
as evidence against Mr. Songpol.

707
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,480
Captain Chitkhet was shipped out.

708
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,160
Who else can we trust, Tai?

709
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,640
Lt. Pallop. He's Ms. Waew's brother.

710
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,880
I've known him for years.

711
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,920
He's clean and trustworthy.

712
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,120
He's retiring this year.
This could earn him some recognition.

713
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,320
Should we go now, Tai?

714
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,840
I'm dying to get out of here.

715
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,280
Okay, let's split up.

716
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,920
-Pick up Ms. Maen and go to our spot.
-Okay.

717
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,000
-And you come with me. Let's go.
-Okay.

718
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,600
I'm off now.

719
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:26,920
Who's there?

720
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,040
It's me, Tai.

721
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,200
What's up? Why are you here so late?

722
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,200
I'm sorry to bother you,

723
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,800
but it's something urgent
that can't wait until morning.

724
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,800
What's it about?

725
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,680
Mr. Songpol tricked me.

726
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,560
He told me to deliver imported wine
to his friend in Bangkok,

727
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,040
-but it turned out to be heroin.
-Is that true?

728
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,000
-Open the trunk.
-Yes.

729
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,080
Maiseek and I don't know
who else to turn to.

730
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,760
Captain Chitkhet is no longer here.

731
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,680
You're the only one I trust.

732
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,080
I'll take this evidence
to the police station,

733
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,680
but you and Maiseek will have
to come to provide statements.

734
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,920
Or it might look like
I'm accusing Mr. Songpol

735
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,360
based on some vague evidence.

736
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,800
I understand,

737
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,480
but can we wait until Maiseek
moves his mom somewhere else first?

738
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,920
If Mr. Songpol finds out,
he'll come after him and his mother.

739
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,520
How about this?

740
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,720
I'll give you my phone number.

741
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,560
If you need him to come,
just call me immediately.

742
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,480
I'll bring him to you.

743
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,400
Please, sir.

744
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,720
Fine, I'll handle it from here.

745
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,880
Thank you, sir.

746
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,600
Let's move the stuff quickly
so we can leave.

747
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,720
I'll return the car to Prod.

748
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,600
We're lucky to find a good
and reliable cop like Lt. Pallop.

749
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,080
May I speak to Inspector Pichai?

750
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,160
This is Lt. Pallop.

751
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,440
I need to speak to him
about something important.

752
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,440
Dr. Chat.

753
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,040
You're two-timing me!

754
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,880
Kwan!

755
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,520
Know this,

756
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,840
I am…

757
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,200
Mom Luang Maratee Dhevaprom,

758
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,120
the fiancée of M.R. Phudhipat Jutathep.

759
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,760
What should I do, Dad?

760
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,360
Do you want me to talk to her?

761
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:36,960
Is that a good idea?

762
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,560
If Mrs. Manee is really
M.L. Maratee Dhevaprom,

763
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,640
your dad is…

764
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:22,720
