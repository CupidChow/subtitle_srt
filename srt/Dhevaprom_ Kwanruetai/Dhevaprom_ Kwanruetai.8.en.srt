1
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,280
I forgive you.

2
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,560
Consider it a birthday gift.

3
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,000
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

4
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,240
I was in charge of the house renovation.

5
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,920
Don't worry.
It barely put a dent in Chat's pocket.

6
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,600
Happy birthday.

7
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Do you think this will make
for an easy ending?

8
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,120
You've been gone for days,

9
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,960
and someone missed you.

10
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,600
If we take her to the hospital,
she'll cause a big scene.

11
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,000
You have to trust me.

12
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,520
Even though your mom doesn't like it,
I'm confident

13
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,800
I can handle it.

14
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,760
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

15
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,680
We have no patient records
of Mrs. Manee, Doctor.

16
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,960
She's not covered by
any medical benefits scheme either.

17
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,120
Can you please tell the cashier
to notify me before her discharge?

18
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
I'll take care of all the bills.

19
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,800
Tai is not going to accept that.

20
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,320
She doesn't have to know.

21
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,920
Tell her it's some social welfare
scheme or whatever.

22
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Pardon?

23
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,280
I want to help her.

24
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,000
She's taking on too much as it is.

25
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,640
Okay.

26
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,040
By the way,

27
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,840
here's a copy of Mrs. Manee's ID card.

28
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,960
Thank you.

29
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,440
If you'll excuse me.

30
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
"Mrs. Manee Pitakdheva."

31
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
She changed her entire name.

32
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,880
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

33
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Is everyone here?

34
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,640
We're missing one person. A special guest.

35
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,880
Who is it?

36
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,640
Ms. Menie, this year's Miss Noppamas.

37
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,520
Who invited her? Why wasn't I consulted?

38
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,560
She invited herself.

39
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,440
And we're just going to let her
come with us as she pleases?

40
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,800
The hospital director didn't want
to offend the village headman.

41
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,760
Some freshly made congee, sir.

42
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,600
I'm quite hungry actually.

43
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,200
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

44
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,960
Why don't you have some
of that congee to cool down?

45
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,600
Thank you. You turned up
at just the right time, my savior.

46
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,680
Is everything okay?

47
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,840
Our squad leader is in a foul mood.

48
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,960
Can you please tell Ms. Menie to hurry up?

49
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,360
I'll do that.

50
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,960
Leader, why don't you have some congee?

51
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,720
We have a long day ahead of us.
You need the energy.

52
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Have some.

53
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,200
Hey.

54
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,360
Get back to sleep, Tai.
I only came by to take her temperature.

55
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,200
Please do it gently.

56
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,600
If she wakes up,
she's going to cause a fuss.

57
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,960
I know how to do my job.

58
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,200
The doctor mixed in
some stress-relief medication in the drip

59
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,040
so that your mom
could have a deep and restful sleep.

60
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,960
I'm relieved to hear that.

61
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,360
Tai, you should get
plenty of rest as well.

62
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,720
Since you're staying by her bedside,

63
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
you might catch the virus.

64
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,160
They are highly infectious these days.

65
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,840
Is Dr. Chat not coming?

66
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,600
He's out with the mobile medical unit.
He'll be back in two days.

67
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,680
Why are you asking?

68
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,720
Dr. Chat was assigned
to Mom's case, wasn't he?

69
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,960
Tai, can you be honest with me?

70
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,600
Do you have a crush on him?

71
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,480
No, I don't like him like that.

72
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,720
I'm relieved that you don't.

73
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,480
One less competitor for me.

74
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,640
You should get plenty of rest.

75
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,040
-I will. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

76
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,160
We should set out one by one.

77
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,840
We are not going to let one person's
tardiness affects our schedule.

78
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,920
-The medical kit, Doctor.
-Thank you.

79
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,920
What do you think of my leader?
Intense, isn't he?

80
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,320
Dr. Chat!

81
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,440
Dr. Chat!

82
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,960
Are we leaving already?

83
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,800
-Holy smoke!
-Holy smoke!

84
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,680
Are you with the mobile medical unit
or a traveling cabaret show?

85
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,160
Oh, the ferocious glare.

86
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,480
My apologies, Dr. Chat,

87
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,240
for arriving a little bit late.

88
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,800
Almost an hour isn't "a little bit late."

89
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,040
-It's my dad. He's the reason I'm late.
-Yes, I know.

90
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,040
-There he is. It's him.
-Yes.

91
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,360
-My car broke down.
-That's right.

92
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm terribly sorry.

93
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,880
We should get moving then.

94
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,160
Let's go.

95
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,720
Excuse me, Doctor.

96
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,120
Please take care of my daughter.

97
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,000
-Mali has never--
-It's Menie.

98
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,720
Ah, yes, Menie.

99
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,240
My daughter has never spent the night out,

100
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,680
least of all in a tent in the woods.

101
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,320
However, her altruistic tendency

102
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,800
prompted her to volunteer
with the medical team.

103
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,000
That's right, I'd like to use
my massaging skills--

104
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,360
She means physical therapy.

105
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,040
To help people in remote areas
who have no access to a massage service.

106
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,080
-Physical therapy.
-Right. They're similar, aren't they?

107
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,960
-I thank you on their behalf.
-You're welcome.

108
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,800
Let's save the conversation for later.
We are already very late.

109
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Of course.

110
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,200
-Get the luggage, Dad.
-Okay.

111
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,160
-Damn, you two. What's with the afro hair?
-Why'd you care?

112
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
You should hurry, my dear.

113
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,240
A golden opportunity like this
doesn't come easily.

114
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,680
Better use this three-day-two-night trip
to get as close to the doctor as you can.

115
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,120
-I know. I'm going, Mom.
-Bye.

116
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,480
What a clever girl.

117
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,400
Over there, please.

118
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,920
Can't I sit in the back?

119
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,680
How am I supposed to get on?

120
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,840
-Can you do it, dear?
-Let me help you.

121
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,040
Be careful.

122
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,920
-Here you go.
-I'm here.

123
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,640
MOBILE MEDICAL UNIT

124
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,720
That girl is a dead weight.

125
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,160
Gosh, Mom. How do I sit?

126
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,840
-Am I going to fall off?
-You'll be fine.

127
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,760
-Is she okay?
-Gosh.

128
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,600
You'll make it. Please come back alive.

129
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,120
-Stay safe.
-Oh, dear.

130
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,680
-Bye.
-See you.

131
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,640
-Bye.
-Good luck and don't forget.

132
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,240
-Three days two nights, okay?
-Yes, Dad.

133
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,480
That's not the goodness of her heart
but the dark side of it.

134
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,280
You're jealous.

135
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,120
Boss, if you throw that at me,

136
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,320
you'll crack my head open.
I'll bleed everywhere.

137
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,440
-You asked for it.
-Please.

138
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,480
Okay. You're not jealous.
Forget I said anything.

139
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,320
Seriously though, if Mali were to stay
by my side day and night,

140
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,960
dight and nay.

141
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,120
Shouldn't it be day and night,
night and day?

142
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,760
Yes, whatever.

143
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,080
If Mali were glued to us like that,

144
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,200
surely we might catch some feelings,
don't you think?

145
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,600
You're right. The doctor is also a man.
He's not resistant to temptation.

146
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,840
Right.

147
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,080
I'm heading home to get changed.

148
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,960
Keep a good eye on Mom till I get back.

149
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,480
-We will do that.
-We will do that.

150
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,360
-She's jealous.
-She's jealous.

151
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,640
It sounds like you've got pharyngitis.

152
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,640
I'll give you some antibiotics

153
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,760
and paracetamol.

154
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,960
Ms. Sompohn Wiangkumueng?

155
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,200
MOBILE MEDICAL UNIT

156
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,880
-Hello.
-Hello.

157
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,320
Ms. Sompohn?
May I ask what symptoms you have?

158
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,640
The symptoms are a dry cough and fatigue.

159
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,080
From the readings we took,
she also has a high temperature.

160
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,720
You're running a fever,
probably from the changing weather.

161
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,480
There are many cases like yours.

162
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,200
I'll quickly check your lungs, okay?

163
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,560
-Of course.
-All right.

164
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,160
EXAMINATION DECK

165
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,680
Excuse me.

166
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,240
Please breathe in.

167
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,560
Breathe out.

168
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,960
Okay.

169
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,240
The lungs sound good.
But let's take your temperature again.

170
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,360
Yes, Doctor.

171
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,280
Excuse me, open your mouth, please.

172
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,880
Are you tired?

173
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,360
With you by my side, I can keep going.

174
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,800
You two are so cute.

175
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
-Did we get your temperature?
-Yes, sir.

176
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,520
I think you're all good now.

177
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,800
We're done here.
Please wait for the prescription.

178
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,240
-You'll recover soon.
-Get well soon.

179
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,080
Mr. Kamkaew Jamsai?

180
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,960
-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello, please have a seat.

181
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,880
May I ask what brings you here?

182
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,360
I have these rashes. They are very itchy.

183
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,960
There's some there. Over here as well.

184
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
-I see.
-They are itchy.

185
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,440
Iced cold water for you, Doctor.

186
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,360
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

187
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,240
How long have you had these rashes?

188
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,120
Yes, Doctor?

189
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,000
How long have you had these rashes?

190
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,160
It has been several days.

191
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,080
There's some here.

192
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,240
See these? Here as well.

193
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,560
They are very itchy.

194
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,560
I've got some here. There too.

195
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,480
-I see.
-Here as well.

196
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,440
From the look of it,
you must feel very itchy.

197
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,880
Extremely itchy, indeed.

198
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,480
-Mali.
-Yes?

199
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
-Let me take a closer look.
-Sure.

200
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,240
This one is itchy. There's some there too.

201
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,760
One more here. Another one there.

202
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,319
It's so itchy, Doctor.

203
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,880
See these?

204
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,040
There's a lot.

205
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,400
Do you have any food or drug allergies?

206
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,800
I'm allergic to milk, Doctor.

207
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,760
Ms. Kej.

208
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,120
Rungrawee hasn't arrived yet.

209
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,640
I couldn't reach her.

210
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,800
We bought her an expensive phone,
but she turned it off.

211
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,240
-Did you page her?
-I did.

212
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,800
Why don't you try her manager?

213
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,920
Ms. Pritty has resigned, claiming
she couldn't put up with Ms. Rung.

214
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,480
What are we going to do if the model
for the final dress doesn't make it?

215
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,440
Who's going to take her place?

216
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,280
The dress was tailor-fit for her.

217
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,960
Why don't you try Ms. Saifon?
She came by the shop this morning.

218
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,240
I think she's on vacation
and won't leave until next week.

219
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,720
You're quite daring

220
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,080
to even consider having me replaced.

221
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,960
My goodness.
Did you have an encounter with Dracula?

222
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,520
You're as pale as a ghost.

223
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,040
Isn't it your job to ensure
my makeup is flawless?

224
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,760
If you can't do your job, why don't you
go home to sing your boy toy to sleep?

225
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,080
I do makeup for models, not for ghosts.

226
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,560
Get back to your grave, will you?

227
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,400
We all have work to do here.

228
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,440
You're already late.
Please own up to your responsibilities.

229
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,680
Who do you think you are?
How dare you order me around?

230
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,360
I wouldn't dare to order anyone around,
but everyone here is a professional.

231
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,400
Are you not?

232
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,960
Wait. I think I remember you.

233
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,960
You're the designer
with a fancy degree from Paris.

234
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,400
Thank you for remembering.

235
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,400
You all must be in quite a rush,

236
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,680
but I'm tired.

237
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,920
I need to rest first.
If I don't get my rest, I won't walk.

238
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,240
My, my.

239
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,360
What happened, Rung?

240
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,880
Your employees won't let me have any rest.

241
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,200
I'm tired from the journey.
I'd like some rest first.

242
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,640
You can't have me work
before my beauty rest.

243
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,800
It's okay. Don't be mad.
I'll take you to get some rest.

244
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,080
Let's see who'll dare
to oppose the shop owner.

245
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Let's go, Rung.

246
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,040
Spoiled brat.

247
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,080
-You should calm down, Mint.
-Why should I?

248
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,880
Don't worry, Ms. Kej.
That hellcat's career is on the decline.

249
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,800
No one is looking to hire
a model with a face like a drug addict.

250
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,880
Let's not badmouth her behind her back.

251
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,880
I'm speaking the truth.
I'm willing to stake my life on it.

252
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,400
That woman is definitely a user.
I've seen that look too many times.

253
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,760
If only I had proof, I'd announce it
so the entire industry knows.

254
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,240
Hey, you're basically spitting
all over the model at this point.

255
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,600
Sit back down and finish the makeup,
all right? We all have bills to pay.

256
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,040
-I'm worked up, don't you get it?
-Sit. Back to work.

257
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,320
Shall we inform Mrs. Arada?

258
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,840
It's okay. Let's not bother Mrs. Da.

259
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,640
Ms. Rung seems to need rest. Let her rest.

260
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,840
I'll give her 15 minutes at most.

261
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,760
After that, I won't back down.

262
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,240
Okay.

263
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,000
Dr. Chat!

264
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,960
Why are you hiding away
to eat by yourself?

265
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,640
Why didn't you invite me?

266
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,440
It looks rather delicious.

267
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,480
All guys are the same.
They're all obsessed with breasts.

268
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,080
I'm full. I need to get back to work.

269
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,280
Hold on. Stay and have some fruit with me.

270
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,680
If you don't finish the fruit
that I prepared,

271
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,120
I won't let you get back to work.

272
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,160
Open wide.

273
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,440
Delicious, isn't it?

274
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,720
Oh my gosh! Snake! There's a snake!

275
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,320
Help, the snake is aiming for my neck.

276
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,560
It's not a snake.

277
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,720
-It's a vine.
-Vine?

278
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,840
I'm scared of vines.

279
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,680
I'm so scared.

280
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm scared.

281
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,280
I'm scared.

282
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,080
Has Ms. Rung come down yet?

283
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,320
She refused to come down.

284
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,320
Did you tell her it's time to get ready?

285
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,960
I did tell her, but she wouldn't listen.

286
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,440
Especially now that Mr. Wit is coddling
her in her room, what more can I do?

287
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Are you referring to Mr. Attawit?

288
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,440
Who else?

289
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,960
Be it old or new models,
he never misses a single one.

290
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,320
Ms. Kej,

291
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,160
what should we do now?
Mrs. Da will be arriving soon.

292
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,320
I'll go get Ms. Rung myself.

293
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,600
This batch is so damn good.

294
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,760
It sure as hell hits the spot.

295
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,280
No wonder Kevin didn't want to share.

296
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,000
Who is Kevin? What a weird name.

297
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,440
You don't need to know.

298
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,720
It's almost time.
You should head downstairs.

299
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,880
It'll be a pain if we get caught.

300
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,280
Hey, that's enough.

301
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,080
Are you out of your mind?

302
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,680
You could easily overdose.
This stuff is potent.

303
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,360
Just a little more. My limbs are weak.

304
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,760
My head is hazy.

305
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,840
I can't walk down the catwalk.

306
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,040
Just a little sniff, okay?

307
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,600
That's enough. You've got work to do.

308
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,080
Hey. Not now.

309
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,960
You have work downstairs.

310
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,320
You're so strict.
You work me like a slave.

311
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,720
When you go back to Bangkok tomorrow,

312
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,520
don't forget to take my plush bear.

313
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,840
I won't forget.

314
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,160
Don't worry.

315
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,600
No one will inspect my belongings.

316
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,600
That's why

317
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,480
I'm giving you such an important task.

318
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,080
Quickly finish your walk.

319
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,360
We'll have our fun after.

320
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,640
Don't fall asleep
or I'm going to kill you.

321
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,320
I won't.

322
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,960
Come back quickly.

323
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,200
Okay.

324
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,560
Ms. Kej.

325
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,520
I was coming to get you.

326
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,720
I thought you might be sleeping.

327
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,480
Since when did you come in?

328
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,640
I just entered the room and saw you
coming out of the bedroom.

329
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,840
We should get going.

330
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,080
-You!
-Yes, it's me.

331
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,760
Why are you here?

332
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,240
This is where I stay. Have you forgotten?

333
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,800
You're right.

334
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,040
Your brother left with the mobile unit.

335
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,400
He's very concerned.

336
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,240
He asked me to take care of you.

337
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,800
Is there a problem?

338
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,760
You seem out of sorts today.

339
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,400
What's the problem?

340
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,480
Can you tell me?

341
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,600
I heard you.

342
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,800
What's the rush?

343
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,760
What's up, sweetheart?

344
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,280
That was a bit rough, babe.

345
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,680
-Do you have any clue what you've done?
-Hey.

346
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,480
-What?
-You're a total idiot.

347
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,480
-What? Why are you insulting me?
-Why can't I?

348
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,920
You ruined the plan.

349
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,560
What are you talking about?

350
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,160
You must be so high
you didn't even notice.

351
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,560
Ms. Kej came in here to get Rung.

352
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,680
We have to do something.

353
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,120
That woman is definitely
going to the police.

354
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,320
The three of us will be sent to jail.

355
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,600
She wouldn't go to the police.

356
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,040
-How would you know?
-I know.

357
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,960
That woman idolizes my mom.

358
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,600
She'd never do anything to tarnish
the boutique's reputation.

359
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,480
You shouldn't act hastily.

360
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,480
We still have plenty of time

361
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,200
to deal her the final blow.

362
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,680
What's your plan?

363
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,840
Easy.

364
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,440
We bring her over to our side.

365
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,880
Easier said than done.
She'll never switch to our side.

366
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,160
I have a way

367
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,760
to bring that woman to our side.

368
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,560
Even better,

369
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,400
we might have a new courier
to replace Rungrawee.

370
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,880
Trust that I'll get it done.

371
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,760
These must be your dengue leaflets,
right, Fon?

372
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,560
-Yes, Doctor.
-Okay. So we've got everything.

373
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,920
There are two variations.
Prevention and treatment.

374
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,160
Hey, Mali. I was wondering
where you might have gone.

375
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,520
It's Menie.

376
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,080
Got it, Menie.

377
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,720
Can I please have that?

378
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,440
What?

379
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,120
The leaflets that we'll be giving out.
Take some.

380
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,200
This afternoon, we'll be handing out
leaflets on health education.

381
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,520
What about Dr. Chat?

382
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
-He went--
-He had already left with the leaflets.

383
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,160
He should have waited for me.

384
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,920
-Which way did he go?
-That way.

385
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,320
Let's tidy up our things, shall we?

386
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,080
Hey.

387
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,680
Why did you lie to her?

388
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,760
He went for a walk by the river.
He'll be back soon.

389
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,400
Why would I tell her
so she could follow him?

390
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,280
I'm just looking out for Tai.

391
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,600
That Mali girl can't be trusted.

392
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,560
I noticed her attaching herself
to Dr. Chat's side this morning.

393
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,240
She's so annoying.

394
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,080
Are you basically her wingwoman then?

395
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,960
I'm my own wingwoman as well.

396
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,120
When you talked to Mali,
why were you making googly eyes at her?

397
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,480
-Was I?
-Yes, you were. Jerk.

398
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,800
I wasn't. Ouch, that hurts.

399
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,880
-One more time?
-Jeez.

400
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,960
Let's get our things together.

401
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,720
-I'll carry those.
-Thank you.

402
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,760
Playing pranks on people
is so much fun, right?

403
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,440
What are you saying?
I wasn't playing pranks.

404
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,800
Where are you going? Let's have a chat.

405
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't have anything to say to you.

406
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,160
You don't, but I do.

407
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,560
You think I didn't know
you threw that snake at Menie?

408
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,800
I didn't do it.

409
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,680
What if the snake went and bit Menie?

410
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,640
You seem very concerned about her.

411
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,600
Vines don't bite.

412
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,560
If it wasn't you,
how did you know it was a vine?

413
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,840
-Where are you going?
-Let go!

414
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,480
Dr. Chat!

415
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,560
Dr. Chat!

416
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,560
Dr. Chat!

417
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,400
Dr. Chat!

418
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,360
Where has he gone?

419
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,760
Dr. Chat!

420
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,520
Dr. Chat!

421
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,520
Dr. Chat, can you hear me?

422
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,600
What?

423
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,600
No one's here.

424
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,800
Am I hearing things?

425
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,520
I'm sorry. I didn't plan that.

426
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,960
-Ready for photos?
-Yes.

427
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,680
-Please smile for the camera.
-Look this way please.

428
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,720
-This camera, please.
-Please hold.

429
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,840
Nice. Beautiful.

430
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,960
One more.

431
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,960
Nice. Beautiful.

432
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,040
Look this way, please.

433
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,160
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

434
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,120
Thank you.

435
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,040
Ms. Rung, can we take
some shots of just you?

436
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,960
-Right there.
-Okay.

437
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,680
-Good.
-One more.

438
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,720
Thank you so much.

439
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,360
The show went off without a hitch.

440
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,640
If you'd been here to oversee the show,
it would have come out even better.

441
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,520
Maybe, or maybe not.

442
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,600
Move a little, please.

443
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,440
Are you done exchanging compliments?

444
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,640
The reporters
are waiting for an interview.

445
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,120
Do a turn, please.

446
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,240
-We'll talk more later.
-Of course.

447
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,480
Congratulations.

448
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,680
Ms. Rung, are you going
to join the after-party?

449
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,760
I'm tired and sleepy.
I'm not in the mood for parties.

450
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,320
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

451
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,680
Sumlee.

452
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,440
Sumlee.

453
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,120
I'm not a ghost.

454
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,600
Go home and get some sleep.

455
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,720
I appreciate your help.

456
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,560
But ma'am hasn't woken up yet.

457
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,480
What if she's dead--

458
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,080
Watch your mouth.

459
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,560
The doctor gave her sedatives.

460
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,600
If she wakes up, she'll demand to go home.

461
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,480
Good to hear. Let her get some rest.

462
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,000
We don't want her making a fuss.

463
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,720
-Where's Maiseek?
-He left a while ago.

464
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,840
Maiseek has been acting strange lately.

465
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,840
He just disappears.
He's probably out with some girl.

466
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,280
Does that mean most of our members
are now off the market?

467
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,280
I'll be all by myself.

468
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,480
You should go home.

469
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,640
You're embarrassed, aren't you?
You've gone red.

470
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,240
Tai, are you coming down with something?

471
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,560
I'll be going then.
I don't want to catch it.

472
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,720
Hey. Can you thank Maiseek for me?

473
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,760
If I happen to see him.

474
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,080
I'm leaving now.

475
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,760
Keep your mouth shut, all right?

476
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,040
Right. I'm looking
for a long-term business.

477
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,480
Dad wouldn't let anyone give me any.

478
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,680
I've got you. I'll be your dealer.

479
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,160
It'll be a little expensive though.

480
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,200
I know that. I can afford it.

481
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,360
How about some photos, ladies?

482
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,640
One, two…

483
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,560
-One more, please. Just in case.
-Of course.

484
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,760
-Give me a smile.
-Sure.

485
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,000
One, two, three. Smile.

486
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,440
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

487
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,840
-So…
-Thank you.

488
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,720
I'll be heading out. Thank you everyone.

489
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,960
I hope you have a great time.

490
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,640
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

491
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,720
It's a privilege to have an honorary
photographer here with us. Thank you.

492
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,160
My pleasure.

493
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,800
Have you seen Ms. Kej around?

494
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,760
I think she went to get changed.

495
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,920
I see.

496
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,400
There she is.

497
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,880
-Hi, Ms. Kej.
-Mrs. Da, congratulations.

498
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,480
I really appreciate your help.
Thank you again.

499
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,400
I hope you will enjoy the party.

500
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,240
-I will.
-Good.

501
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,480
Bye.

502
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,720
I'll be going now.

503
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,320
Let's go over there.

504
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,400
Photos?

505
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,720
Finish it.

506
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,680
-Should I?
-Yes.

507
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,720
Please, you two.

508
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,960
Don't act like
there's just the two of you here.

509
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,640
The single ladies have been getting
more jealous by the minute.

510
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,720
Would you mind if I borrowed
your personal photographer for a bit?

511
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,960
You may take him if you want.

512
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,160
Hey, you.

513
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,440
Thank you.

514
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,760
We'll safeguard him well
and keep the girls off him.

515
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,760
We'll return him soon.

516
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,160
-Come.
-Come.

517
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,120
-Come this way.
-Okay.

518
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,640
Where should we go?

519
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,360
Did someone whisk Mr. Park away?

520
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,920
Thank you.

521
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,040
The show today was a great success.

522
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,000
You have my sincere admiration.

523
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,240
I appreciate that.

524
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,960
Here.

525
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,600
Thank you.

526
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,480
If you don't see me come back
to sleep here, don't be concerned.

527
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,320
Where will you be sleeping?

528
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,800
You'll find out tomorrow morning.

529
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,880
I'd rather not say.

530
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,600
Good night.

531
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,280
What's wrong?

532
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,560
It's…

533
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,600
I feel dizzy.

534
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,480
-Why don't you lie down?
-Yes.

535
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,400
-Slowly. Here's the pillow.
-Gosh.

536
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,920
The doctors in this camp are taken.
They don't need distractions.

537
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,800
Sleep tight, Mali.

538
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,520
Where is he?

539
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,000
I'm sorry. I didn't plan that.

540
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,200
You could have made up an excuse
that you didn't want Mali to hear.

541
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,800
Why did you have to confess?

542
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,280
Da.

543
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,840
Mumbling to yourself?

544
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,240
What were you daydreaming about?
Didn't you hear me come in?

545
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,080
The temperature has gone down.

546
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,920
When the saline in this bag is finished,
your mom will wake up.

547
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,160
You'd better be prepared.

548
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,400
I'm sorry about that.

549
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,920
You must have caught something
from your mom.

550
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,600
-How about I get you some medicine?
-I'm good. I'm pretty tough.

551
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,000
How are you feeling, Ms. Kej?

552
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,280
Would you like to rest in your room?
I can take you.

553
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,600
-Shall we go?
-You came alone? Where's your partner?

554
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,440
Be careful.

555
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,880
Walk slowly.

556
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,560
Please walk slowly.

557
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,760
I'm just so lucky

558
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,680
to have a Mom Luang as mine.

559
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,960
-Have the drugs kicked in yet?
-They have. But on your damned wife.

560
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,600
Where are you going? Come here.

561
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,080
Clever, aren't you?

562
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,600
You can't escape from me. Come here.

563
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,440
What the hell?

564
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,120
What the hell?

565
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,640
Come here, you bastard.

566
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,520
You douchebag.

567
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,280
That's enough.

568
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,480
Please stop. I give up.

569
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,680
-I beg you, please stop.
-I have solid evidence.

570
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,080
You won't get away with this.

571
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,960
Ms. Pilai?

572
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,240
She's conked out.

573
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,720
Ms. Pilai?

574
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,160
Ms. Pilai?

575
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,600
Is she dead?

576
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,960
Ms. Pilai?

577
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,920
She's so out of it,
as if she has been drugged.

578
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,880
Drugged, my ass.

579
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,160
It's more likely
that the drugger got the wrong person.

580
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,280
Let's just go.

581
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,480
I'm sorry for not coming
to the rescue sooner.

582
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,640
I had to hold off to get the shots.

583
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,240
He's caught in the act.
There's no denying it.

584
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,960
I could hardly believe that
they'd target me like you said.

585
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,960
You've learned of their secrets.

586
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,920
Surely, they wouldn't let you off.

587
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,080
They have to either silence you
or bring you over to their side.

588
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,520
I owe you a massive thank you.

589
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,440
You've helped me out so many times.

590
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,320
You should thank your brother.

591
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,240
I'm only granting a friend's request.

592
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,840
Is that all?

593
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,680
I am also hoping to get promoted
from being your driver.

594
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,960
This time,
I have to go against your wishes.

595
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,920
I have to tell Chat the truth.

596
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,880
This is no small matter.

597
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,640
You might not be as lucky next time.

598
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,160
We need to have the police arrest them.
We can't keep this from Chat.

599
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,720
You're cute when you're like this.

600
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,640
For your safety, why don't you
stay in my room for the night?

601
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,800
Rest assured, it's sparkling clean.

602
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,200
The cleaner comes by every morning.

603
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,480
Where will you be sleeping then?

604
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,600
Are you taking advantage of me?

605
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,320
As if!

606
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,440
I'm not tempted in the least.

607
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,560
Good night.

608
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,120
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

609
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,480
I'm going home.

610
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,040
Mom, the doctor will help you
remove that. Don't hurt yourself.

611
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,440
Didn't I say I didn't want
to come to the hospital?

612
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,160
How dare you defy my order?

613
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,400
-Let go of me. I'm going home.
-Please come down, Mom.

614
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,520
I'm going home.

615
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,560
Da!

616
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,400
-Mom.
-Didn't I tell you?

617
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,000
Why did you take me to the hospital? Why?

618
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,960
But you were sick, Mom.

619
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,600
-You're hurting me.
-You assumed too much.

620
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,240
I wasn't that sick.

621
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,800
I have a doctor in Bangkok.
I'll go there to get treated.

622
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,040
But Kong isn't here,
how will you get there?

623
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,080
I'll find a way.

624
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,560
Damn you for your meddling.

625
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,800
Go pay all the bills and take me home.

626
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,160
Go now.

627
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,440
I said I didn't want to come.

628
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,880
Hurry up. I want these tubes off me.

629
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,480
Da.

630
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,120
Hey, what's up?

631
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,080
Mom wants to leave.
I didn't bring any money though.

632
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,040
Can you take care of the bills?
I'll pay you back later.

633
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,840
Don't worry about it.
Dr. Chat has got you covered.

634
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,840
I mean he's signed off
the relevant benefits documents.

635
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,320
Why don't you go ahead
and take your mom home?

636
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,760
She's still unwell.
Go be with her in case she faints.

637
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,800
Yes? Did you get it?

638
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,160
-I got it. Thank you.
-No problem.

639
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,360
I almost slipped up.

640
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,760
All sorted, Mom.

641
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,960
Mom.

642
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,120
Mr. Wit!

643
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,920
Who did this to you?

644
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,760
Mr. Wit!

645
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,720
Where were you?

646
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,920
Untie me. Hurry!

647
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,080
Okay.

648
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,840
How the hell could you botch the drugging?

649
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,440
Was that bitch the one who hurt you?

650
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,640
She wouldn't be able
to do anything to me by herself.

651
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,360
It's her damned boyfriend.

652
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:25,200
She tricked me. I didn't even notice
when she switched the glasses.

653
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,720
I passed out and just woke up now.

654
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,360
You fool!

655
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,520
You failed something this easy!

656
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,400
That ass waited for the moment to take
photos when I was all over her as proof.

657
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,560
They set us up.

658
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,640
They are going to have us arrested.

659
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,520
That's why you're tied up.

660
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,240
No. We've got to run.

661
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,880
We've got to run. Now.

662
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,800
What about the drugs?

663
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,600
Rung will handle it.
Don't worry about it now.

664
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,840
Right now, we need to make
our escape. Let's go.

665
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,560
What? Why am I in yesterday's dress?

666
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,280
Where did everyone go?

667
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,320
Dr. Chat!

668
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,440
Dr. Chat!

669
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,480
They're not in the tents?

670
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,160
Where did they go?

671
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,680
Dr. Chat!

672
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,000
Dr. Chat!

673
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,600
-Are you tired?
-I'm good.

674
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,120
Hey.

675
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,840
What happened to me?

676
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,520
What happened?

677
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,040
Why did I go to bed in this dress?

678
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,440
Oh, that. How would I know?

679
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,800
But you're my roommate.

680
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,840
You fell asleep in this dress. That's all.

681
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,120
I figured you probably liked
going to bed dressed like that.

682
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,640
Ridiculous. Who on earth
would wear this to bed?

683
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,960
-Doctor.
-Yes?

684
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,320
-Where's Dr. Chat?
-He went back.

685
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,280
What? Did he go back?

686
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,240
Yes, an urgent matter came up.

687
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,960
But why didn't he wait for me?

688
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:11,720
I'm going back.

689
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,280
Aren't you coming with us
to visit the villagers?

690
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,240
Why do I need to visit the villagers?
They aren't flipping related to me.

691
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,240
Serve you right.

692
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,760
Your fangs are showing.

693
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,280
What did you do? Let me hear it.

694
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,120
Hey, you. Please tell me.

695
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,000
What did you do? Let me hear it.

696
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,320
I'm not telling you.

697
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,880
What prank did you pull on her?

698
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:03,080
I've had my sights set on this temptress
for a long time.

699
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:07,600
I'd like to bring this pendant inside
and show it to you.

700
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,840
Will you allow me?

701
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,760
-Mom, please let go.
-Give it back!

702
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,120
I do want to stay
and help out Mrs. Da for a while longer

703
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,800
until this whole situation settles,

704
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,680
but I don't know how to tell my parents.

705
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,480
They want me back in Bangkok by tomorrow.

706
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,720
I have a plan.

707
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,280
Don't sell drugs to Mr. Sorn again.

708
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,320
Remember that!

709
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,440
It's not wine. It's clearly heroin.

710
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,560
What do we do next?

711
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,680
Let's take this to the police
as evidence against Mr. Songpol.

712
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,920
Tai!

713
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:22,040
