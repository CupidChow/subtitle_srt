1
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,880
Are you going to buy it?

2
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,800
I'm free. Today is fine.

3
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,800
Here's the check.

4
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,440
PAYEE: MRS. MANEE PITAKDEVHA

5
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,600
DEED OF LAND

6
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,120
Thank you, friend.

7
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,960
-Come here. Where are you going?
-Let go.

8
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,560
Ms. Kej!

9
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,800
-What happened?
-Mr. Park.

10
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,520
Do you have a clue about her whereabouts?

11
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,440
Those handsome doctors
from the Jutathep family

12
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,400
are all frauds.

13
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,840
When the mask comes off,
they show their true colors as playboys.

14
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,200
Just leave me alone.

15
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,960
I can't do that.

16
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,760
I'm worried about you.

17
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,160
I want to help you.

18
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,600
I want to see you happy like before.

19
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,240
Great-Grandma,

20
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,600
I want to know more about Mrs. Maratee.

21
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,640
Can you tell me
what you remember about her?

22
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,360
Grab your ready-made meals by Tai,
the longtime favorite.

23
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,960
Better hurry. They're selling out fast!

24
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,480
We've got pork fried rice
and chicken basil. Are you interested?

25
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,240
Is Tai here with you?

26
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,120
After your boss joined the contest,
is she on some sort of promotional tour?

27
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,680
Is that why she's not here?

28
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
What a shame I missed that.

29
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,840
People say
she was even prettier than the winner.

30
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,080
Yes, she was way prettier.

31
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,360
It completely left me in awe.

32
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,680
What promotional tour?

33
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,120
She can't even step outside her house.

34
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,640
Goodness, what's going on?

35
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,480
Is Mrs. Manee grounding Tai
as a punishment?

36
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,960
Exactly. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here
selling in her place every single day.

37
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,800
Why is she being punished?
Tai didn't do anything wrong.

38
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,200
She just entered
the Miss Noppamas Contest.

39
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,680
That's strange.
Most people want their kids to be famous.

40
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
Tai's mom fears
she'll get a husband too soon.

41
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,440
It's that sweet-faced doctor.

42
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,440
Word is spreading
like wildfire in the market.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,080
Do you mean Dr. Chat?

44
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,840
That's right.

45
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,640
Your friend got Tai into this mess.

46
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,320
Tai's mom isn't a fan.

47
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,640
Tell your friend to stay away
to keep Tai out of trouble.

48
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,640
What?

49
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,080
What's really going on
between Tai and Dr. Chat?

50
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,960
It's not true, right?

51
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,840
Tell me it's all just rumors.

52
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,320
From what I've seen, it might be true.

53
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,640
Is Tai actually in love?

54
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,280
-Oh, Da!
-Hey.

55
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,120
It's impossible.

56
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,960
That's right.
Tell your friend to back off from Tai.

57
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,720
Otherwise, her mother might
send her off somewhere else.

58
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,840
-Dr. Chat and you being a couple was fine.
-What? Hey.

59
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,720
-Why are you bringing me into this?
-Let's go. We're just talking in circles.

60
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,320
-Da.
-Go on, sell it elsewhere. I won't buy it.

61
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,360
-Da. Goodness.
-Put away the table too.

62
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,760
-Let's go, Sumlee.
-Da.

63
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,000
Look, Doctor.

64
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,920
-What?
-Da.

65
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,480
-Hey, Da.
-Are you okay?

66
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,480
Mom fell asleep.

67
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,520
She's running a bit hot.
I'm not sure if it's a fever.

68
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,600
Since what happened that day,

69
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,280
Mom has been having trouble sleeping.

70
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,640
Mom went a bit too far.

71
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,400
Kong,

72
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,280
did you already know
about what she said just now?

73
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,640
I did hear from Dad

74
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,080
that Mom had her heart broken
by a doctor from a famous family.

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Was it

76
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,080
the Jutathep family?

77
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,720
That's right.

78
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,200
That must've hurt her deeply.

79
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
So now, she holds a grudge

80
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,320
and just hates all male doctors.

81
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,320
Have you noticed

82
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,880
when she's sick,

83
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,520
she always buys medicine herself?

84
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,280
She never goes to the doctor.

85
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,840
That's so unreasonable.

86
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,360
When isn't Mom like that?

87
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,240
Everything is always centered around her.

88
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,960
Kwan,

89
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,520
get over those feelings if you can.

90
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,280
No matter what,

91
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,960
Mom will never accept Dr. Chat.

92
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,400
Whether or not Mom accepts him…

93
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
it's impossible anyway, Kong.

94
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,360
ARADA BOUTIQUE, BANGKOK

95
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,560
-Waist size 25. Let's take it in an inch.
-Okay.

96
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
-Shoulders are at 16 inches.
-Okay.

97
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,720
Where's Mrs. Da? Is she not in?

98
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,880
She's watching her mother in Chiang Rai.

99
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,040
-Arm length is at 22 inches.
-Okay.

100
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,280
Mrs. Da must really trust you,

101
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,280
letting you help with
the shop opening's fashion show.

102
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,559
Gosh, of course she does, Ms. Rung.

103
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,880
Ms. Kej graduated
in fashion design from France.

104
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,159
And for this year's dress for the final,

105
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,480
Ms. Kej is co-designing with Mrs. Da.

106
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,320
It looks gorgeous and chic,
perfectly suiting you, Ms. Rung.

107
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,960
If I'm the one wearing it,

108
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,360
any dress stands out.

109
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,400
No matter the designer.

110
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,400
Well, where is it?

111
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,640
Where is the dress you want me to try?

112
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm in a hurry. I have other things to do.

113
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,320
At the peak of their career,
they all act like this.

114
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,640
I've seen so many of them.

115
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,600
Hurry and get the dress for her to try on.

116
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay.

117
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
I've got the dress.

118
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,200
Oh, where did she disappear to so quickly?

119
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,240
Oh, my.

120
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,960
Oh, you're leaving already?

121
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,720
Yes, I want more time to rest.

122
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Hey, are you leaving now?

123
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,840
Yes, Mom.

124
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,960
Why not take Kwan
for the catering job with you?

125
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,160
It'll ease my worries.

126
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,240
As the saying goes,
"Having a daughter is a curse."

127
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
If Kwan comes with me,
who will take care of you?

128
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,320
How long will you be gone?

129
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,160
One week.

130
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,040
You won't be back in time for…

131
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,400
In time for what?

132
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
It's nothing.

133
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,760
So where's the catering job this time?

134
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,880
The host must have won the lottery

135
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,600
to throw a three-day,
three-night banquet like this.

136
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,360
It doesn't matter
if it's the lottery or gambling

137
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,040
as long as they hire our boss.

138
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,840
Yes, you're right.

139
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,240
-Oh, hey, Kong, join us.
-Come on.

140
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm good. Please enjoy.

141
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,440
I might take a stroll
around here for a bit.

142
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,720
It's my first time here.

143
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,560
Where can you take a stroll?
We're near the border.

144
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,400
Watch out, or you might end up in Myanmar.

145
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,360
That's right.

146
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,480
Okay, I'll be careful.

147
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,640
I'm going now.

148
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,720
-Don't get lost.
-Okay.

149
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,080
-Hey, cheers!
-And away he goes.

150
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,000
Kavee didn't just fall off the cliff
despite the police's conclusion.

151
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,840
Your dad stumbled upon
their drug-trafficking route,

152
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,880
so Chang Chen and his crew silenced him.

153
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,040
You and Tai must be careful.

154
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,040
I won't let my dad's death
be in vain, Mr. Boon.

155
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,840
I'll expose them

156
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,960
and make them pay.

157
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,520
Hey, Kej, are you done with your work?

158
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,320
Yes.

159
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,760
Is Great-Grandma sleeping?

160
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,160
She just fell asleep.

161
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,640
Speak of the devil,
Great-Grandma was just talking about you.

162
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,400
-I'll come by later.
-Hey, wait.

163
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,600
It's good I ran into you.

164
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,560
Well, when we return to Chiang Rai,

165
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,480
there's a favor I'll need your help with.

166
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,000
That sounds a bit odd.

167
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,480
What's the favor?

168
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,040
Well, where do I start?

169
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,560
Happy birthday to me.

170
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,720
Kwan!

171
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,080
Yes, Mom. I'm done now.

172
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm coming!

173
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,560
Kwan! My gosh.

174
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,920
-Why aren't you done yet? It's too long.
-Yes, Mom.

175
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,520
-Why are you moving so slowly?
-I'm here, Mom.

176
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,880
Do you want more rice?

177
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,680
No, I'm already full.

178
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,480
What?

179
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,440
I thought we were going to eat together.

180
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,560
Why should I wait around to eat with you?

181
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,080
Hey, finish up quickly and do the dishes.
Hurry up.

182
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,120
You're so slow.

183
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,280
Right.

184
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,720
I'll let you sell the food
at the hospital today.

185
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,280
-Seriously, Mom?
-Goodness, hey.

186
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,599
Don't act so eager.

187
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,119
I'm allowing it

188
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,359
because those two can't sell anything.

189
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,240
Their looks are driving customers away.

190
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,160
I'm losing money,
and I won't be able to afford new dresses.

191
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,360
Got it, Mom. I'll make some more food

192
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,720
and make sure to sell it all
to cover the losses.

193
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,720
Good.

194
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,240
Oh, and don't go see that doctor again.

195
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,760
If you see him, just go the other way.

196
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,600
If he approaches you, just walk away.

197
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,080
-Okay.
-I'll believe you just this once

198
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,920
that you and he are just acquaintances.

199
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,520
Don't let me hear
about you and him from anyone.

200
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,560
Or this time, I won't just ground you.

201
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,840
I'll send you off somewhere else.

202
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,680
Okay, Mom.

203
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Hurry and finish up.

204
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,960
I'm going out.

205
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,480
I want to go out now.

206
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,920
I forgive you.

207
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,400
Consider it a birthday gift.

208
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,520
Tai?

209
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,680
Tai, are you in?

210
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,960
Tai?

211
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,840
-Tai?
-Tai, come on out.

212
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,800
Tai, are you in?

213
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,280
Tai?

214
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,720
Come on out.

215
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,120
Why are those two acting so weird today?

216
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,400
-Tai?
-Are you in?

217
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,400
-Come on out.
-Tai?

218
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,600
Tai?

219
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,160
-Tai? Come on out.
-Are you in?

220
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,640
At least these two remember my birthday.

221
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,520
-Tai?
-Tai?

222
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,600
Hey, I'm here.

223
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,920
I'm coming.

224
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,480
-Let's pull a prank on her. Okay.
-As planned.

225
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,120
Thanks a lot, you two,

226
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,720
-for not forgetting--
-Kong's package. I signed for it.

227
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,760
Well, what were you thanking us for?

228
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,280
Nothing.

229
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,520
So you two yelled out
to get me to come out

230
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
just to get this package?

231
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,840
There's more.

232
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,560
Take this to the kitchen.

233
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,560
Look, your mom told me
to make as much food as possible,

234
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,280
so I bought groceries.

235
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,560
-It's heavy. My arms feel numb and tingly.
-Serves you right.

236
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,040
Let the numbness reach your brain.

237
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,600
Bring this to the kitchen yourself.

238
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,040
-She's definitely upset.
-Right.

239
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,240
Gosh, my arms feel numb.

240
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,920
-Here you go. Thank you.
-Here you go.

241
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,720
-Tai!
-Fon!

242
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,240
-I missed you.
-I missed you too.

243
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,200
-Did you just get out of jail?
-Fon, you're exaggerating.

244
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,920
I thought you turned into a beauty queen
and quit selling food.

245
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,480
Don't bring that up, Da.

246
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
I've never felt
more embarrassed in my life.

247
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,440
I only did it for the money.

248
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,280
But you looked very pretty that day.

249
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,280
You make it sound like you were there.

250
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,880
We came back for our shifts together,
didn't we, Doctor?

251
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,560
Someone asked me to give you a compliment.

252
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,720
Goodness.

253
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,720
Today, I've got

254
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,440
chicken fried rice, noodles,
and chicken basil with bamboo shoots.

255
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,600
What would you like?

256
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,320
Wow, everything sounds delicious.
Unfortunately, today, we--

257
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,200
We already have plans.
Someone is treating us.

258
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,040
-Really?
-But you're out here selling it yourself.

259
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,880
-It's going to run out quickly.
-Sure.

260
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,240
Or should I get Dr. Chat
to buy out everything?

261
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,760
Please don't, Dr. Mes.

262
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,800
I don't want to get locked up for good.

263
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm just kidding.

264
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,480
Let's go. We should get going now.

265
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,040
-Hey, I'll buy your food tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.

266
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,240
-I'm going now.
-Okay.

267
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,280
Enjoy it for me.

268
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,520
-I'll eat until I burst!
-Okay.

269
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,880
-I'll be back tomorrow.
-Okay.

270
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
-One chicken basil on rice.
-Okay.

271
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,640
-One chicken basil on rice?
-Yes.

272
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,880
I thought I might not get
to see you today, Mrs. Manee.

273
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,480
You're looking fabulous.

274
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,200
Where are you off to?

275
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,200
I'm just going to the market.

276
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,640
What brings you here?

277
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,760
I've got something for you, Mrs. Manee.

278
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,880
Give me a moment.

279
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,080
The necklace is an antique.

280
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,960
This finely crafted piece is a rare find.

281
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
Is that for me?

282
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,880
Yes.

283
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,600
The delicate details
make it look so sophisticated.

284
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,520
It suits you perfectly.

285
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,680
On what occasion are you giving me this?

286
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,360
No occasion is needed.

287
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,880
If I like someone

288
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,960
or feel like giving, I just do it.

289
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,160
Please accept it.

290
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
Don't hurt my feelings.

291
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,400
Well, thank--

292
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,600
Oh, don't be upset.

293
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,760
Let me give you a ride in my car for once.

294
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,440
Are you going to the market?

295
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Please get in.

296
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,480
Listen, my headache is the only reason
I'm agreeing to a car ride with you.

297
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,480
It's not here.

298
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,520
It's not here either.

299
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,920
Where is it?

300
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,120
I can't find it.

301
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,480
Sorn, come downstairs!

302
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Sorn?

303
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,480
-Sorn!
-Yes, Mom.

304
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,480
What is it, Mom?

305
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,520
Did you just get up?

306
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,680
It's so late now.

307
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,160
Luckily, your dad left for work.
Otherwise, you'd get a good smack.

308
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,720
I went to bed late, Mom.

309
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,440
You told me to sleep
a full eight hours, didn't you?

310
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,800
So I can be smart.

311
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,640
Hey, look at you.

312
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,400
You look like a junkie,
just like your dad said.

313
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,360
Come on, Mom,

314
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,480
you're accusing your son too.

315
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,480
Hey,

316
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,360
just confess.

317
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
Are you using drugs
like your dad says or not?

318
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,400
Mom, I wouldn't dare.

319
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,840
Dad would send me off to reform school.

320
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Mom,

321
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,920
I want to stay with you.

322
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,600
I want to be close to you.
I don't want to be too far away.

323
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,440
I'll miss you too much, Mom.

324
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,680
Hey, get away from me.

325
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,840
I can smell your breath.

326
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,040
Why did you ask me to come down?

327
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,640
Right, did you see your dad's velvet bag
with a gold necklace inside?

328
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,080
I didn't steal it, Mom.
I didn't take it, Mom.

329
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,240
I didn't say you stole it.

330
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,560
Did Dad buy it for you?

331
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,560
I suppose so.

332
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,920
The design seems more suited for women.
Your dad probably won't wear it.

333
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,400
Well, I think if Dad got it
as a surprise for you,

334
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,920
he'd probably keep it hidden, Mom.

335
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,680
Yes, you might be right.

336
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,480
Don't let your dad know I found out.

337
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
It could spoil his plan.

338
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,920
Come on, let's eat.
Gosh, you've gotten a lot thinner.

339
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,880
Hey, whoever is back there,
set the table now.

340
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,200
TELEPHONE

341
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,280
Those two are unbelievable.

342
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,720
Mom finally let me come out to sell food,
and they've decided to disappear

343
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,760
instead of helping out.

344
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,320
I really didn't want to arrive
at the market.

345
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,600
I wanted to stay in the car
with you longer.

346
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,280
Was my driving not smooth?

347
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,920
I noticed you are using the inhaler
the whole way.

348
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,920
I've been feeling dizzy
since this morning at home.

349
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,280
It's not because of your driving.

350
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,120
Hold on.

351
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,160
Put on the gold necklace I gave you.

352
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,920
I want to see how good it looks on you.

353
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,880
Let me help.

354
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,440
There you go.

355
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,800
It suits you perfectly.

356
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,040
If I find another beautiful antique,

357
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,200
can I bring it over and give it to you?

358
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,920
If it's different from what I already own,

359
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,160
I'd probably accept it.

360
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,960
I wouldn't want to offend you.

361
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,200
Sure.

362
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,360
Thank you.

363
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,920
Sure.

364
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,400
I was so startled.
I didn't know who it was.

365
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,320
Who did you think it was?

366
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,240
I thought it was those two.

367
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,160
Why would that startle you?

368
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,400
Hey, who did you really think I was?

369
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,120
Right, where's my present?

370
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,960
My birthday present?

371
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,440
Don't tell me you forgot
your own sister's birthday.

372
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,080
I didn't.

373
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,880
But it's a huge present.
I couldn't bring it.

374
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,360
I'll show you.

375
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,120
But there's a catch.

376
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,840
You have to cover your eyes.

377
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,520
Why?

378
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,840
Why? Or you won't be surprised.

379
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,600
Is there a surprise?

380
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,040
-Are we there yet?
-Yes, we're here.

381
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,320
Kong, give me a hand.

382
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,080
-Okay, get off slowly.
-Okay.

383
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,400
-Okay, give me your leg.
-Okay.

384
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,480
Okay.

385
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,520
Where did you bring me?

386
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,840
You'll find out soon.

387
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,080
-Hey!
-Hey, be careful.

388
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,000
I don't like surprises anymore.

389
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,400
Just a bit further.

390
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,800
-Watch your step.
-Okay.

391
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,160
Are we there now, Kong?

392
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,240
This is it.

393
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,120
Then uncover my eyes.

394
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,240
What's going on, Kong?
Why did you bring me here?

395
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,320
Go on ahead. Let's go.

396
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,560
Kong, does this mean…

397
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,440
It's your birthday present.

398
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,160
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

399
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,320
-Hey.
-Hey.

400
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,120
Hey, you two,

401
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,120
I'm coming for you.

402
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,000
-She's coming for us.
-Come on, Tai.

403
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,040
-Come up, Tai.
-Come up.

404
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,679
Hurry.

405
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,239
-Hurry up.
-Come quickly.

406
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,960
-You must be excited.
-Hey.

407
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,360
You guys are such troublemakers.

408
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,639
Wait, everyone,

409
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,719
what's going on? Why are you all here?

410
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,960
-I'm confused.
-Don't be. Blow out the candles now.

411
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
-Yes.
-Yes.

412
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,560
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KWANRUETAI

413
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,880
-Yay!
-Yay!

414
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,320
-Here, I'll take it.
-Come on.

415
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,360
We just saw each other.

416
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,680
Hey, you were so tight-lipped.

417
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,800
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a surprise!

418
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,680
She might be wondering who I am.

419
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,880
Let me clue you in.

420
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,640
I was in charge of the house renovation.

421
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,040
See, that only made her more confused.

422
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,520
Come, Kwan,
let's go see what's inside the house.

423
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,680
Let's go.

424
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,480
Wow.

425
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,680
If Tai finds out
Mr. Chat is behind today's plans,

426
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,840
do you think she'll be happy or mad?

427
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,560
That's a difficult question to answer.

428
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,760
Wow, your house is absolutely beautiful.

429
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,560
Though it has got more of a woman's style
and might not be your thing.

430
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,880
Hey, you two.

431
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,840
Tai is a woman.

432
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,720
The decorations should have
a sweet and cute look.

433
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,560
She's not the unruly type like you two.

434
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,280
All the credit goes to Kej.

435
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,360
She picked out
all the materials and decorations.

436
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,160
Tai, how about letting me stay over?

437
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,280
I can help with cleaning, watering plants,
and keeping the garden beautiful. Okay?

438
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,560
It's not my house anymore.

439
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,120
My mother sold it.

440
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,680
I'm the one who bought it.

441
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,520
Your brother can confirm that.

442
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,280
But I got it for someone else.

443
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,920
And that person gave you this

444
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,720
as a birthday gift.

445
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,680
Come on inside, Mr. Chat.

446
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,040
You've done so much for her.
You can't hide behind the curtain.

447
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,840
Tai is over the moon.

448
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,520
She won't be upset enough to kick you out.

449
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,080
At worst, she might throw
a few cutting remarks.

450
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,360
It might not be just a few.

451
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,840
She already told me off for meddling

452
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,320
and causing trouble for her.

453
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,400
Loving a younger woman
takes a bit of courage, Mr. Chat.

454
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,480
Hey, it's not like that.

455
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,560
-I'm just making amends.
-Just making amends?

456
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,560
What's with the blush then?

457
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,120
He's feeling a bit shy.

458
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,600
GRANTOR: KAVEE PITAKDHEVA
GRANTEE: KWANRUETAI PITAKDHEVA

459
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,080
I can't accept it.

460
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,200
Don't pull that typical
Thai female lead act.

461
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,080
You love this house.

462
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,880
You bawled your eyes out.

463
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,520
-Now that it's back, just accept it.
-Right.

464
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,680
Just see it as a birthday gift, Tai. Okay?

465
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,120
It's not like the house
is only worth a hundred or two.

466
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
Don't worry.
It barely put a dent in Chat's pocket.

467
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,200
Kwan, Chat's carrying a lot of guilt.

468
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,600
Ever since that day,
he has been stressed out.

469
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,920
He keeps blaming himself
for the troubles you've faced,

470
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,120
including losing the house.

471
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,840
Chat planned everything today for you

472
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,080
as a way to apologize.

473
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,520
The rest of us are here to help out

474
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,520
because we all love you.

475
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,240
Accept this birthday gift, Kwan.

476
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,600
Chat will be very glad

477
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,640
and so relieved.

478
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,600
GRANTOR: KAVEE PITAKDHEVA
GRANTEE: KWANRUETAI PITAKDHEVA

479
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,200
Where's Mr. Chat now?

480
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,000
He's probably lurking around here

481
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,200
but doesn't dare to come in.

482
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,640
-What?
-Where are you going? Cut the cake first.

483
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,200
Tai!

484
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,320
-Cutting the cake? Things are tense here.
-Ouch! Why did you hit me?

485
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,240
Hey, everyone.

486
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,320
Tai and Dr. Chat just have
a small misunderstanding, right?

487
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,240
Nothing more is going on
between them, is there?

488
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,360
You're not lying to me, are you?

489
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,160
Come on.

490
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,800
-Let's eat the cake.
-Let's eat the cake. Kong.

491
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,880
Hey, have you seen Mr. Chat?

492
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,080
-Briefly.
-No.

493
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,960
Doctor.

494
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,800
Well, he just left.

495
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,080
Tai.

496
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,560
Doctor, why did you tell her?

497
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,480
Mr. Chat will be upset with me.

498
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,080
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

499
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,240
Will she catch up with him?

500
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,920
You didn't even gift it to me yourself.

501
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,760
What a coward.

502
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,920
I wanted to give it to you myself,
but I was afraid you wouldn't accept it.

503
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,600
I'm taking it.

504
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,080
I might be proud, but I'm not dumb.

505
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,640
Do you think
you can just throw in this much

506
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,760
and I'll just forgive you?

507
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,440
It won't be that simple.

508
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,360
I don't expect your forgiveness.

509
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,800
I just want you to accept the house.

510
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,960
I'm the reason you lost it.

511
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,440
I'll feel guilty for the rest of my life

512
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,040
if I can't return it to you.

513
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,880
You got that right.

514
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,520
I didn't want to show up

515
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,640
because I was afraid
your mother might see me.

516
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,720
It could cause more problems.

517
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,440
I wanted to give you the deed in person.

518
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,440
I wanted to see you smile

519
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,640
and be happy again.

520
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,120
The last time we met,

521
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,400
I saw you cry because of me.

522
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,320
I've decided

523
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,960
I don't want you in trouble because of me.

524
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,800
From now on,

525
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,120
I'll cancel the meal services.

526
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,920
I won't go out to buy your food.

527
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,240
If I ever crave your cooking,

528
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,400
I'll ask Ms. Da to pick it up for me.

529
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,560
Starting today,

530
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,040
I'll stay away from you.

531
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,360
I won't show my face again.

532
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,280
If your mother is still uneasy…

533
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,440
I'm going to submit
a request for a transfer.

534
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,880
Happy birthday.

535
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,040
Do you think this will make
for an easy ending?

536
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,560
You've been gone for days,

537
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,640
and someone missed you.

538
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,280
Seeing a cute house like this
makes me want to have my own family.

539
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,840
Let me know if you need help

540
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,480
-designing your family home.
-Thank you.

541
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,360
But I'm more interested in a groom

542
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,320
who owns an interior design company.

543
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,600
Shooting two birds

544
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,680
with one shot.

545
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,080
What, Da?

546
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,680
Where are you keeping Dr. Chat then?

547
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,440
Hey, why ask such a thing?

548
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,960
Even if nothing lasts forever,

549
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,280
my legendary love will endure.

550
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,640
That one will always
have a place in my heart.

551
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,400
And this one

552
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,160
has already been set up by his mother.

553
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,280
Oh, my, look at them flirting.

554
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,640
Did you cut the cake?

555
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,240
Where's Kwan?

556
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,080
Can I still use your meal services then?

557
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,600
-I don't know.
-I don't need to request a transfer?

558
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,320
I don't know.

559
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,200
This is going to be
the best year for my sister.

560
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,360
-What?
-You're asking for it.

561
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,280
Come on, after that good deed,

562
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,800
are you going to hurt your brother?

563
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,960
Don't even start.

564
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,080
You sided with someone over your sister.

565
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,240
Hey, let me explain.

566
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,680
After what went down,

567
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,400
my first thought was to deal
with that Dr. Chat for you.

568
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,520
But then he revealed that

569
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,240
he bought your house,

570
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,320
and he was trying to return it to you.

571
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,000
He was afraid you'd refuse.

572
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,760
So I suggested

573
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,360
he give it on your birthday.

574
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,360
I see, so you're the mastermind.

575
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,720
-Seriously, Kong?
-Hey, wait.

576
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,720
I made it back for your birthday,

577
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,400
I have to head back to work soon.

578
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,120
Are you really

579
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,560
going to hurt your dear brother?

580
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,720
My dear brother?

581
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,480
Now that I think about it,

582
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,440
this year has been good for my sister,

583
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,800
getting both a house

584
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,680
and a boyfriend.

585
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,680
I can't help but feel jealous.

586
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,680
-Kong!
-Ouch!

587
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,080
-I have to run!
-Get back here! You can't get away!

588
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,560
So, does Chat really like that Kwan girl?

589
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,400
You can ask your friend about it.

590
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,640
Will you call Kwan big sister-in-law
or little sister-in-law?

591
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,800
The whole family dynamic is confusing.

592
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,040
How is that any of your business?

593
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,680
Well, you know, just in case our mothers

594
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,000
successfully set us up,

595
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,600
I'd know what to call her.

596
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,800
Dream on.

597
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,040
I'll be the one to decide,

598
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,880
not my mother.

599
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:17,960
I'm heartbroken.

600
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,720
Just kidding. Don't take it seriously.

601
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,640
Here is fine. You talk too much.

602
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,120
It's annoying.

603
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,560
I spoke with Rung.

604
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,880
It shouldn't be a problem.

605
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,800
Don't get too careless, Mr. Wit.

606
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,720
If we're caught,

607
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,880
we could end up dead in prison.

608
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,240
Your model will get dragged in too.

609
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,000
Relax,

610
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,480
I'm sure of it.

611
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,000
The police won't dare search a model.

612
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,360
It's a lose-lose for them.

613
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,080
They could end up facing a complaint.

614
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,360
Most importantly,

615
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,880
we've pulled this off many times before.

616
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,440
I'm still uneasy about it.

617
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,840
I have a bad feeling about this one.

618
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,480
Come on, you're overthinking.

619
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,360
Trust me.

620
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,400
Everything will work out.

621
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,440
Just wait comfortably for your share.

622
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,400
Here's your coffee, Mr. Wit.

623
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,080
Ms. Kej,

624
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,840
where did you go?
I've been waiting for quite some time.

625
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,040
I'm sorry.
I had to run errands for my brother.

626
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,680
What can I do for you?

627
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,440
Well, my mother wants
to adjust the fashion show a bit

628
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
and discuss it with you.

629
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,880
Should I visit Mrs. Da at home?

630
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,680
Let me give you a ride.

631
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,280
It might be safer if I drive there myself.

632
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,200
I'll go see Mrs. Da now.

633
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,520
That's what you deserve.

634
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,600
Don't be jealous.

635
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,680
That woman is our new gold mine.

636
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,960
That Mom Luang won't fall for you.

637
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,960
She won't be as easy as those models.

638
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,320
We won't know until we try.

639
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,800
She acts uninterested,

640
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,840
but they always get hooked.

641
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,760
Pilai,

642
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,520
can I borrow 2,000 baht?

643
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,520
Gosh, what now?
You still owe me from last time.

644
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,720
-What more are you trying to extort?
-Pilai.

645
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,880
I'm really broke right now.

646
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,320
Mom!

647
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,160
Mom.

648
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,640
-Mom.
-What's going on?

649
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,560
What are you doing?

650
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,120
Mom, you're burning up.
You might have a fever.

651
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,320
Let's see a doctor.

652
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,840
I'm not going.

653
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,440
I'll be fine with some fever medicine.
Just go and get it.

654
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:06,720
-Mom, I think you should see a doctor.
-Hey, listen.

655
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,800
Are my words not getting through?
Go and bring the medicine.

656
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,600
-Go now! Gosh!
-Okay, I'll go.

657
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,320
Don't get worked up.
You might faint again.

658
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Gosh, I haven't fainted in ages.

659
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,960
It's just because it's your birthday.

660
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,520
Gosh.

661
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,640
It brings me bad luck.

662
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,960
Your fortune really hurts me, Kwan.

663
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Goodness.

664
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,760
Why are you smiling?

665
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,760
Give me the medicine. I see.

666
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,440
You're enjoying that I'm sick, right?

667
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,640
Let me tell you,

668
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,920
someone like me

669
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,240
won't kick the bucket so easily.

670
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,600
-Ouch.
-Mom!

671
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,160
Mom,

672
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,880
let's just go to the doctor.

673
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,240
You're not okay.

674
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,400
I'm not going.

675
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,600
Hey, what part aren't you getting?

676
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,320
I don't trust country doctors.

677
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,120
For someone like me,
I have to go to Bangkok. Get the inhaler.

678
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,160
I'm dizzy.

679
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,280
Mom, Kong's not around.

680
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,480
Can't we go to a local doctor?

681
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,160
If you don't like hospitals,
I can take you to a clinic.

682
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,120
Hey, you're getting on my nerves.

683
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,240
I already said I'm not going.

684
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,080
I'll be fine with the medicine.

685
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,640
Get me the medicine. When can I take it?

686
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,160
Okay.

687
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,040
Give it to me.

688
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,600
What? So where's the water?

689
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,240
Where's the water?

690
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,480
Gosh.

691
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,160
You might be quiet, but you know
how to pick the best of them, Mr. Chat.

692
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,320
Will you stop teasing me?

693
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,480
Mr. Chat, you have a sharp eye.

694
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,520
You saw through Tai
to her true golden self as Kwan.

695
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,720
Do you want to run alone?

696
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,760
Okay, I'll stop teasing.

697
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,080
But is she the one you'll marry?

698
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,080
Mes!

699
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,640
Oh, dear.

700
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,080
Are you feeling shy, Mr. Chat?

701
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,000
What's the hurry?

702
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,480
Hey, Tai.
Why the double tiffin carriers today?

703
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,040
Well…

704
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,600
Here.

705
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,600
Give this to your friend.

706
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,320
Which friend?

707
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,720
Whichever one you want to give it to.

708
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,960
I see.

709
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,200
Is it the tall and handsome one

710
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,280
with the sweet face?

711
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,480
-Take that!
-I was just joking. Why hit me for real?

712
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,160
-Here, I'm leaving now.
-It hurts.

713
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,120
There's no need.
You can give it to him yourself.

714
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:44,880
He should be here soon.

715
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,280
See you tomorrow.

716
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,400
Tomorrow?

717
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,640
That's such a long wait.

718
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,400
What, feeling shy?
You're turning into quite the lady, Tai.

719
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,720
Doctor, stop talking.

720
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,360
You're smiling.

721
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,760
Keep those feelings off your face,
or the whole village will catch on.

722
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,240
Hey, Mr. Chat?

723
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,000
You're staring without blinking.

724
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,160
Tai must have spiked your food
with a love potion.

725
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,520
With two tiffin carriers today,
you'll be full.

726
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,520
Full in your heart.

727
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,600
Mom?

728
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,880
Mom?

729
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:21,760
Mom?

730
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,120
Mom, are you sleeping?

731
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,640
Mom?

732
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,280
Mom?

733
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,840
Mom?

734
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,000
Mom, can you hear me?

735
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,360
You're burning up.

736
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,360
You're really burning up.

737
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,360
You've been gone for days,

738
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,440
and someone missed you.

739
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,960
Give this to your friend.

740
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,400
Which friend?

741
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,560
Whichever one you want to give it to.

742
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,160
I see.

743
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,400
Is it the tall and handsome one

744
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,520
with the sweet face?

745
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,560
-Take that!
-I was just joking. Why hit me for real?

746
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,440
-Here, I'm leaving now.
-It hurts.

747
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,000
There's no need.
You can give it to him yourself.

748
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,000
He should be here soon.

749
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,200
Hello?

750
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,480
It's me. I don't know what's wrong.
My mom is burning up and won't wake up.

751
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,840
What should I do?

752
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,720
Stay calm.

753
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,280
Wipe her down to bring down the fever.

754
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,480
I'm on my way.

755
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,040
Her temperature is quite high,
38.5 degrees Celsius.

756
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,560
Her pulse is normal.

757
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,200
It looks like typical cold symptoms.

758
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,600
Then why is Mom sleeping so deeply?

759
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,480
When older people catch a cold,

760
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:22,160
they tend to feel more fatigued
than young people.

761
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,360
Did you say your mother
has a pre-existing condition?

762
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,240
Yes, she has high blood pressure.

763
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,800
Kong has to take her to the hospital
in Bangkok two or three times a month.

764
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,080
Don't worry, I can treat her.

765
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,080
But we need to take her
to get an IV at the hospital.

766
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,400
We can't.

767
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,880
If we take her to the hospital,
she'll cause a big scene.

768
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,280
Isn't there another way?

769
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,840
-My mother doesn't like--
-Doctors.

770
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,760
Your mother hates me.

771
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,960
You have to trust me.

772
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,320
Even though your mother doesn't like it,

773
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,400
I'm confident

774
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,280
I can handle it.

775
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,880
Okay.

776
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,040
Prepare clothes and personal items
for your mother.

777
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,120
And don't forget her ID card.

778
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,560
What's that for?

779
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,600
To create her patient ID card.

780
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,760
Okay.

781
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,080
A copy of Mrs. Manee's ID card.

782
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,840
"Mrs. Manee Pitakdheva."

783
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,720
Open wide.

784
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,280
-Oh, my gosh!
-You seem very concerned about her.

785
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,720
Vines don't bite.

786
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,960
How do you know it was a vine?

787
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,960
-Where are you going?
-Let go!

788
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:32,800
No one's here.

789
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,200
I'm just so lucky

790
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,960
to have a Mom Luang as mine.

791
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:36,120
