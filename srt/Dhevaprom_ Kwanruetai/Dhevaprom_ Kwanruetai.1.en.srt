1
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,600
Put your personal gain second

2
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,480
and the well-being of others first.

3
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,200
Merit, wealth, and recognition

4
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
will naturally follow

5
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,200
when you stay true
to the principles of your profession.

6
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,160
1992

7
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,480
A soldier's duty

8
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,840
is to be devoted to the nation,
religion, and the king.

9
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,680
As army doctors,
our duty is twice as exhausting,

10
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,880
and we must always remember that

11
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,440
we're responsible for caring
for the sick without taking sides.

12
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,160
I urge everyone to crouch down.

13
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
Crouch down.

14
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,360
We peacefully resist.

15
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,920
Please sit down.

16
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,720
Please sit down.

17
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,520
The military and police, armed with guns,

18
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,880
are securing the area
around the Democracy Monument.

19
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,040
At 10:00 p.m., about 40,000 participants
have joined the demonstration.

20
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,240
They're trying to push back

21
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,200
the military and police forces
who are securing the area.

22
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,480
That day was chaotic.

23
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,520
My subordinates and I went
to help the students in the protest

24
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,760
and took them to hide in nearby houses.

25
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,200
Without the help of the locals,

26
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,320
things could've been really bad.

27
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,200
Things like this shouldn't happen.

28
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,200
Right now, we all need to work together
and follow the royal guidance

29
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
to turn to each other
and solve our problems.

30
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,520
Otherwise, our country could fall apart,

31
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
and it would open the door
for outsiders to cause trouble.

32
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,520
You're right, Petch.

33
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,640
Our country has been through so much.

34
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,920
It's time for a reform.

35
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,920
I think we should hold off
on politics for now.

36
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,560
It's already been stressful enough.

37
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,520
Chat,

38
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,840
how are things
at Phramongkutklao Hospital?

39
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,760
People keep coming in with injuries.

40
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,720
Army doctors are on full duty.

41
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,400
All sides are affected by this.

42
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,760
I don't see anyone benefiting from it.

43
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,680
That's true. We're all Thais.

44
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,880
We shouldn't harm each other.

45
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,120
Sometimes, I get tired of it.

46
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,560
Or maybe it's time for me

47
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
to resign…

48
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,960
and come home to help Dad out.

49
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,680
I understand, Petch.

50
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,480
I'm overwhelmed too.

51
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,960
I'm transferring
to the army hospital in Chiang Rai.

52
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,760
Have you thought it through?

53
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,280
Yes, it's been approved.

54
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,680
Hold on, Chat.

55
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,920
Have you told your parents
and Great-Grandma Orn yet?

56
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,520
Hey.

57
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,760
You're all grown up now.
You can't kiss your mom like that.

58
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,720
If a woman sees it,
they might think you're a momma's boy.

59
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,040
Well, that's good.

60
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,000
That means
I can stay with you for a long time

61
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,320
and I don't need a girlfriend.

62
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,640
Aren't you quite the smooth talker?

63
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,760
Why did you come home today?

64
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,360
Dad, when did you arrive?

65
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,240
Before you did,
I hugged your mom before you too.

66
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,280
He's boasting, Mom.

67
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,800
Let's eat.

68
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,880
I think there must be something urgent,
that's why you came home.

69
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,000
You know me well.

70
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,280
The thing is,

71
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,080
I just turned down
the teaching position at the department.

72
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm planning to work
at the army hospital in Chiang Rai.

73
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,320
That's a big deal.

74
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,120
I think it's a good idea to give
Great-Grandma Orn a heads-up.

75
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,480
She might be taken aback by it.

76
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,240
I love you dearly, Chat.

77
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,160
I don't want you to be far from me.

78
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,360
And Kej is just back from France.

79
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,040
Instead of having
all the siblings together,

80
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,000
the older one leaves
while the younger one returns.

81
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,640
It's my duty, Great-Grandma.

82
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,280
I have to carry out my duty
as an army doctor after graduating.

83
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,320
If you feel that strongly about it,
I won't stand in your way.

84
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,120
Listen, if you have a chance,

85
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,360
don't forget to look for the women
of the Dhevaprom family for me.

86
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
So…

87
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,360
are you still worried about that letter?

88
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,680
If I can't make amends,

89
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,160
I won't find peace, my dear.

90
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,920
Don't talk like that, Great-Grandma.

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,200
It's not all our fault.

92
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,680
I want to know

93
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,240
how those two sisters are doing.

94
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,080
Chat, you have to help me, dear.

95
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,200
Of course, Great-Grandma. I promise

96
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,120
to look for M.L. Maratee
and M.L. Vilairumpa for you.

97
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
If I find them,

98
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,720
I'll help them as best I can.

99
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,760
Thank you so much, dear.

100
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,520
I'm glad you've transferred to work here.

101
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,480
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
anyone to talk to.

102
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,400
Is the workload at the hospital heavy?

103
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,720
It's heavy,
but it's about to get even heavier.

104
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,720
Why's that?

105
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,200
Because now,
I have to schedule women for you to meet.

106
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,680
-That's a bit much.
-It's not, Mr. Chat.

107
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,680
The whole district is waiting for you now.

108
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
I hear you're quite charming yourself.

109
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,360
Haven't you been making moves all over?

110
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
My gosh, Mr. Chat,
what are you talking about?

111
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,920
Am I wrong, though?

112
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,240
From operating room nurses to ward nurses.

113
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,200
Your girlfriend will be upset
if she finds out about it.

114
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,880
Mr. Chat, you're just teasing me.

115
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,240
I don't have a girlfriend.

116
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,800
I'm just a good-looking single guy.

117
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,760
Do you want to die?

118
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,640
I see, it's just Tai, Mr. Chat.

119
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,120
Do you know her?

120
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,480
Everyone knows her, Mr. Chat.

121
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,840
She's the big shot around here.

122
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,360
She's probably chasing down
some drug runners.

123
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,480
Do you mean illegal drugs?

124
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,920
Yes, Mr. Chat.
Tai keeps an eye out for the police.

125
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,120
Without her on the lookout,

126
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,440
more teenagers in the village
would be addicted to drugs.

127
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,760
How was it, Tai?

128
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,320
My bike feels so smooth with the wind--

129
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
It was fine.

130
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,880
Come on, Tai,

131
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,200
Sorn is very protective of this bike.

132
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,280
I get kicked if I get close.

133
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,680
You're the only one who can touch it.

134
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,120
-That's right.
-Don't you know?

135
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,600
Thank you.

136
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,400
I'm leaving.

137
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,360
I'll help you.

138
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,360
Do you want
to get kicked that badly, Sorn?

139
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,400
I was just trying to help you, Tai.

140
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,560
Tai.

141
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,320
Let me take you home, Tai.

142
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Tai, let me take you home. Please, Tai.

143
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,520
I saw it coming. I get it a lot.

144
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,200
Take that!

145
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,320
If you get it a lot,
maybe you should learn from it.

146
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,440
Learning from pain is for humans,.
Enduring pain is for me.

147
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Sorn, you're asking for it, right?

148
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,400
Get out of the way! I'm going home!
Hurry up!

149
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
-Tai, calm down!
-Sorn!

150
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,800
Lay low for now. Okay, I'm hanging up.

151
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,120
Sir,

152
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Pae can't make the delivery.

153
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,520
What?

154
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,240
He can't even handle
a simple task like this?

155
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,880
Get out of the way! I'm going home!
Hurry up!

156
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,640
-Tai, calm down!
-Sorn!

157
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,480
It was Tai again.

158
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,480
Ouch! Tai.

159
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,680
Ouch! Tai, calm down.

160
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,440
Ouch! I just wanted to ask you

161
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,000
where you rode my bike to.
That's all. Ouch!

162
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,440
-Tai.
-To chase down Pae!

163
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,120
You know him well, right?

164
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,920
Ouch! No, I don't!

165
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,920
I've never heard that name before, Tai.

166
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,480
Sorn!

167
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,320
Come here.

168
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,600
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

169
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,880
I have to apologize, Mr. Chat.

170
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,560
We had a short circuit the other day,

171
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,520
and it burned parts of the panel.

172
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,480
It's all right. It's no big deal.

173
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
I can sleep in the on-call room.

174
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,880
No, you can't.

175
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,240
The commander just called to instruct me

176
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,760
to take the best care of
the Commander-in-Chief's nephew.

177
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,400
How can I let you
sleep in the on-call room?

178
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Then I can stay with Porames.

179
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,240
We were close back in medical school.

180
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,400
That sounds good.

181
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,240
The electricians will have more time.

182
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,000
It should be done in a few days.

183
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,240
By the way, I was wondering
if you'd like an air-conditioning unit.

184
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,720
But I'm not sure
if there's an official budget for that.

185
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,520
There's no need. I'll be fine.

186
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,960
Please treat me like everybody else.

187
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,120
How can I do that?

188
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,960
You're the Commander-in-Chief's nephew

189
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,680
and part of the royal family.

190
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,880
Please don't think like that.

191
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,600
Even though I'm from the Jutathep family,

192
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,480
now I'm just an ordinary person.

193
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,520
If we compare our ranks, I'm under yours.

194
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,560
Uncle Phee wouldn't be comfortable

195
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,920
with me using his connections
for special treatment.

196
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,960
I had the wrong idea about you.

197
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,200
My dad taught me to know my duty.

198
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,000
Now, I'm an army doctor.

199
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,520
I have the duty to serve the country.

200
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,440
I shouldn't be thinking
about special treatment.

201
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,120
Where on earth did you go?

202
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,760
I…

203
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,880
I went to see Sumlee.

204
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,720
Gosh, all you care about
is to joke around.

205
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,480
I'm not feeling well. Do you ever
think about caring for me? Never.

206
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
Is Kong not here?

207
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,040
If Kong was here,
why would I call for you?

208
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,240
I wouldn't want
to count on someone like you.

209
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,280
Mom,

210
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,800
I got you apples and Asian pears.

211
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,000
Jeez, I thought I'd have to wait
until my next life.

212
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,760
Go. Peel them and put them in the fridge.
I want them nice and cold.

213
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,200
Hey, why are you still standing here?

214
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,920
Go deliver the food.
The tiffin carriers are ready.

215
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,560
Okay.

216
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,040
Tai!

217
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,960
Tai, are you home?

218
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,240
Tai!

219
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,960
What does this mean?
You said you just went to see him.

220
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,400
-Well? What does this mean?
-Go deliver the meals now.

221
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,760
Well? Gosh.

222
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,880
Tai!

223
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
What do you want?

224
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,920
What's with all the yelling, Sumlee?

225
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,440
How many times do I have to tell you

226
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,480
not to shout on my property?

227
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,840
Can't you understand simple language?
I don't like it.

228
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,640
I'm sorry, ma'am.

229
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,760
-I was a bit careless.
-You can't be careless.

230
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,000
Hey, get that through your thick skull.

231
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,280
If you want to keep socializing
with people in this house,

232
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,720
try to act more like noble people.

233
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,440
All that noise and shouting,

234
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,000
save it for your own place,

235
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,960
understand?

236
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,480
Yes.

237
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,520
Try talking then.

238
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,560
Well, hello.

239
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,720
All right, what's next?
Try asking for her again.

240
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,200
Is Tai home?

241
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,640
Has she left to deliver the food?

242
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
Good.

243
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,640
-Thank you.
-Good.

244
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,880
That must have cost a lot.

245
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,000
It's okay.

246
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,560
We can make more money.

247
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,080
If Mom wants to eat something,
let her have it.

248
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,040
She's sick.
This way, she won't get annoyed.

249
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,880
-Take these two.
-Okay.

250
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,080
-I'm off now.
-Okay.

251
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,560
Kwan,

252
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
pick up the laundry
at Dr. Mes's place too.

253
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,400
He said that

254
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,640
it would be in front of his bedroom.

255
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,520
If he's not back yet,
you can go in and get it.

256
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,240
Okay, I'm off now.

257
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,560
Next time, keep your voice down a bit.
Don't get too worked up.

258
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,880
Mom doesn't like that.

259
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,600
Sorry, Tai. I was careless.

260
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,520
So did you catch Pae?

261
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,880
He got away.

262
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,560
I have no evidence.

263
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,280
-I'll make the delivery first. Talk later.
-Okay, I'll help you.

264
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,600
-Ride safely.
-Okay.

265
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,080
-Ride safely, Tai!
-Okay!

266
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,200
-Here you go.
-Thank you, Tai.

267
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,000
-Sure thing.
-Ride safely.

268
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,760
Maiseek.

269
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,280
Aren't you done yet?

270
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,320
Just waiting for Mom to finish up,
and then we'll leave.

271
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
Can you bring it inside for me?

272
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,960
Where else do you need to go?

273
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,160
Dr. Mes's.

274
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,320
Hey, I saw a new doctor
at Dr. Mes's house.

275
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,120
-He might be gay.
-Come on.

276
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,880
I doubt that. He's an army doctor.

277
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,200
He was so handsome,
fair-skinned, with a sweet face.

278
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,160
He looked really soft.
Something felt a little off.

279
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,920
Who would look rough like a bandit
like you and Sumlee?

280
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,760
But I think he must be gay.

281
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,880
Many people in the capital
are like that nowadays.

282
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,560
It feels creepy thinking about it.

283
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,280
-I'm off now.
-Hey, Tai, don't go yet.

284
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,240
What?

285
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,920
If you see anything, spread the word.

286
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,160
That's crossing the line.

287
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,480
Is he home? Is he in the house?

288
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,880
Dr. Mes, are you in?

289
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,680
Hey, I need to get the basket too.

290
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,280
I should just go in.

291
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,240
Dr. Mes, are you in?

292
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,640
Wow,

293
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,960
check out that luxury car.

294
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,040
Doctors are freaking well-off.

295
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,960
I'm so jealous.

296
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,840
Dr. Mes!

297
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,920
Dr. Mes, are you in?

298
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,760
Dr. Mes, I'm here to pick up the laundry.
Are you in?

299
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,520
Dr. Mes?

300
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,280
He's in the shower.

301
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,480
Where's the basket?

302
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,640
Is it in the room?

303
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,040
Hey.

304
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,480
I should just get out of here.

305
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,800
What should I do?

306
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,400
No.

307
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,880
I'll just use my foot.

308
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,040
Today, I have only you

309
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,800
I'll always have you

310
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,720
I'll keep loving you

311
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,120
No matter where you are

312
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,640
I'll follow you

313
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,440
-I'll find you
-Wow.

314
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,800
He's singing a love song too.

315
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,760
-Just you, I have only you…
-I've got chills.

316
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,400
I'll always have you

317
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,240
-I'll keep loving you
-Hey, I can't stay here any longer.

318
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,200
Mes!

319
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,560
Get me a towel!

320
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,600
Mes!

321
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,000
Get me a towel!

322
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,720
Mes!

323
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,840
Aren't you in the room?

324
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,280
Please don't come out naked.

325
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,800
Mes, where's the towel?

326
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,600
-What's going on, Mr. Chat?
-Someone came into the bedroom.

327
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,320
Gosh, I've got chills.

328
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,120
Oh, it's Tai.

329
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,520
She must have come to get the laundry.

330
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,680
She saw me come out
of the bathroom and ran out.

331
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,440
Tai must have gotten
the wrong idea about us.

332
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,240
How so?

333
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,280
Two single guys together in the nude.

334
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,640
What else could people think, Mr. Chat?

335
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
I hope she won't say
anything damaging about us.

336
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,160
You can trust Tai.

337
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,200
It will be the talk of the district.

338
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,080
Hey, I've never seen
anything like this before.

339
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,800
It's too raunchy.

340
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,040
I'm still getting chills
just thinking about it.

341
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,480
I told you. See, Tai?

342
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,680
They must be together.

343
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
Hey.

344
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,200
So what did you see, Tai?

345
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,680
Exactly. Tai, what did you see?

346
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,560
I saw two guys naked together.

347
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,840
-Oh, my goodness.
-Dr. Mes?

348
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,200
Dr. Mes and the new doctor

349
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,160
must be a couple from Bangkok.

350
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,600
Isn't it just a misunderstanding, Tai?

351
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,280
Dr. Mes seems manly.

352
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,240
Fon, I saw those two

353
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,960
showering together,

354
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
soaping and rubbing each other's backs.

355
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,800
How is that manly?

356
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,480
Hey, you and…

357
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,840
Maiseek!

358
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,880
What's wrong with you?

359
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,120
I got turned on thinking about it, Tai.

360
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,520
Are you crazy?

361
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,160
How could you see that?
You weren't in the bathroom with them.

362
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,160
Look, even if I didn't see it,
it felt like I did.

363
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,120
Hey,

364
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,240
there's another thing.

365
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,360
I saw it with my own eyes.

366
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,240
In the bedroom, all the clothes

367
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,000
were left lying around,

368
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,480
and the underwear…

369
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,440
Gosh, I can't continue.

370
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,160
Please continue, Tai.
I'm already picturing it.

371
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,120
Continue.

372
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,080
The underwear of the two doctors,

373
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,680
they were taken off in a rush,

374
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,480
twisted like a figure eight.

375
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,720
Can you imagine
what they were in such a hurry to do?

376
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,640
Gosh.

377
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,720
And the bedsheet

378
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,880
was all crumpled up like…

379
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,400
Like what?

380
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,480
-I don't know.
-What?

381
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,880
From now on,

382
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,120
I won't do laundry runs
at that doctor's house anymore.

383
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,760
Why are you blushing, Tai?

384
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,720
Well, I saw the two of them

385
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,120
walking around naked.

386
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,360
-What?
-The images are burned into my eyes.

387
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,240
Come on, you two,
you're coming shopping with me.

388
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,560
-Okay.
-Okay.

389
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,520
Hey, you two.

390
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,400
-Hey, you haven't paid again!
-Tai, wait for me.

391
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,880
Your tabs are piling up.

392
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,280
This can't be happening, Dr. Mes.

393
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,200
Follow me, Doctor.

394
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,800
Right this way.

395
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,040
Right this way.

396
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,480
What is your queue number?

397
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,960
Doctor, please come this way.

398
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,880
The doctor is so handsome, like an actor.

399
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,680
Sweet-faced, more like a woman.

400
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,000
This way, please.

401
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,040
Sorn,

402
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,360
you should've kept your voice down.
The doctor heard you.

403
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,280
Well, it's true, Mom.
I'm way more handsome than him.

404
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
I could just…

405
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,160
ROOM 6

406
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,120
Da!

407
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,880
Fon, why are you so late?

408
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,200
-I took a coffee break.
-What?

409
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,280
Is the new doctor here?

410
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,880
Yes, he's here.

411
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,240
He's so handsome. I lost my voice.

412
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,800
He's as handsome as any actor.

413
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,360
And just now in the emergency room,

414
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,520
we had a patient with a broken arm.
He set the bones and put on a cast

415
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,120
so neatly.

416
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,920
He's both handsome and talented. I want…

417
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
I admire him.

418
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,200
Things may not be as they seem.

419
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,440
Why?

420
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,240
What is it?

421
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,640
Come here.

422
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,400
Why? What did you hear?

423
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,120
Tai saw Dr. Mes and the new doctor

424
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
showering together.

425
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,920
And they continued
to make out on the front deck.

426
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,360
They're together, Da.

427
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,680
Shush.

428
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,480
I think Tai must have
misunderstood something.

429
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,680
Hey, Doctor.

430
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,680
I'm dropping off the laundry.

431
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,200
I asked my sister to pick it up yesterday.

432
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,080
-It seems she forgot.
-No, Tai didn't forget.

433
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,080
There was a little
misunderstanding yesterday.

434
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
What was it about?

435
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,640
Tai thinks Dr. Chat and I are a couple.

436
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,760
-What?
-But I can explain.

437
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,880
Doctor, are you new?

438
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,760
I haven't seen you before.

439
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,840
Yes,

440
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,440
it's my first day making rounds.

441
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,360
Do you have a wife?

442
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,000
The ladies in front of the room
wanted me to ask.

443
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,440
No, I'm not looking for one right now.

444
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,159
Are you not looking for one,
or just don't like them?

445
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,560
Doctor, are you a transexual?

446
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,639
Let's check your blood pressure.

447
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,480
Dr. Chat is an orthopedic surgery graduate
and is doing a three-year service here.

448
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,240
Goodness, did he just arrive from Bangkok?

449
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,360
He just got here yesterday.

450
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,440
He's got such great features and skin.

451
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,120
How could he not?

452
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,800
He's a Mom Luang.

453
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,600
Is that true?

454
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,720
Mom Luang Chatklao Jutathep.

455
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,520
Do you know him?

456
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,840
No, not at all.

457
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,560
I don't know him.

458
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,480
Ms. Sunant, please come this way.

459
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,400
Mom, it's your turn now.

460
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,200
I've got a stomachache.

461
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,720
-You can call the next person in the line.
-Are you sure?

462
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,640
-Come, son.
-What, Mom?

463
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,360
Come now. Come with me.

464
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,320
We've been waiting for a long time.
Why are you having a stomachache now?

465
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,600
Just come.

466
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,760
-Come.
-Mom.

467
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,280
-What?
-The restroom is over there.

468
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,560
I'm going home.

469
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,520
What, Mom?
Are you suddenly afraid of the doctor?

470
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,720
Yes, I'm afraid. I don't want to see him.

471
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Come on, Mom. I even came with you.

472
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,880
My goodness.

473
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,840
I know who you're really here to see.

474
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,560
You're not that concerned about me.

475
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,640
If you want to stay, then stay.
I won't come back to this hospital again.

476
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,920
I'm going home.

477
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,520
-What?
-Gosh!

478
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,840
What's with her?

479
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,080
Let's check if Tai is here yet.

480
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,360
Bring it over.

481
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,960
Dr. Mes said that
they showered in different bathrooms.

482
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,120
He used the smaller one,

483
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
and the new doctor used the ensuite.

484
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,520
What about the underwear?

485
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,040
And the crumpled-up bed?

486
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,360
That's Dr. Mes's.

487
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,320
No time to tidy up.

488
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,960
The new doctor moved in suddenly.

489
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,200
His own place needs fixing.

490
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
I'm not buying it.

491
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,680
He probably spent all night
coming up with that excuse.

492
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,840
I believe what I saw.

493
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,360
I won't be doing laundry runs
to Dr. Mes's place anymore.

494
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,000
You can ask Maiseek to handle it.

495
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,440
What, Tai?

496
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,880
Aren't you worried I'll get violated?

497
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,680
Come on,
you're quite the catch, aren't you?

498
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,560
Enough of that. Pack up quickly,
or we won't make it in time for lunch.

499
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,280
Dear Buddha,

500
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,720
may I never have to see him again.

501
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,240
So obscene.

502
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,080
-What are you staring at?
-I'm waiting for that.

503
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,680
Doctor!

504
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,720
Have you eaten?

505
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,640
Is there anywhere you recommend?

506
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,560
You can take mine.
I have fried rice and basil on rice.

507
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,520
I don't usually eat much.
I just couldn't decide.

508
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,440
Tai is good at cooking all sorts of food.

509
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Who does the cooking?

510
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,600
Tai.

511
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,920
You might not know her yet.

512
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,200
The woman who dresses like a man

513
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,920
and rides a motorbike, right?

514
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,120
That's right.

515
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,560
Oh, right.

516
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,280
But take anything she says
with a pinch of salt.

517
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
You can't fully trust it.

518
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,640
-Even I--
-Where does she sell her food?

519
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,920
Over there.

520
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,600
Doctor, take this. Take mine.

521
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,640
One basil, two pork fried rice, right?

522
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,360
That's the last of the pork fried rice.
Thank you.

523
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,000
I only have chicken basil on rice left.
This is the last one. Do you want it?

524
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,080
We're closed.

525
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,760
Hey, hold on.

526
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Hey, what?
I need to talk to you about something.

527
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,360
What?

528
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,360
Hey, you!

529
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,560
-Hey!
-Why is he following me?

530
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
Hey, let go of me!

531
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,960
I need to talk to you about something.

532
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,920
But I don't! Give it back!

533
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,960
You've misunderstood me and Mes.
We're not what you think.

534
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,760
Whether you like men or women,
it has nothing to do with me.

535
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
Give it back!

536
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,720
Give it back! Stop! Ouch!

537
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,120
-Hey.
-Give it back.

538
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,680
Give it back!

539
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,400
Give it back!

540
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,640
What are you doing?

541
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,440
Hey.

542
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,920
Give me back my cap!

543
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,520
Promise me first

544
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,920
you won't say anything damaging
about me and Mes again.

545
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,600
People have been giving me weird looks.

546
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,040
-Take that!
-Hey.

547
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,520
Why are you tossing food like that?

548
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,200
What kind of soldier harasses people?

549
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,200
Give me back my cap now!

550
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,760
Hey!

551
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,360
-Give it back!
-If you don't promise, I won't.

552
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,360
I said that…

553
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,440
You sweet-faced doctor,

554
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,440
I'm coming for you.

555
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,200
Ew!

556
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,360
-Tai.
-Fon.

557
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,080
Tai, the new doctor
who lives with Dr. Mes,

558
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,640
is it Dr. Chat?

559
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,320
I don't know his name,

560
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,760
but I remember his face clearly.

561
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,080
Is it a handsome,
sweet-faced, and tall doctor?

562
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,440
Gosh, I have no idea.

563
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,680
I heard it's the new doctor
who just arrived in Chiang Rai yesterday.

564
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,960
His appearance is just as you described.

565
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,680
I don't see how that's handsome.

566
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,960
Honestly, his face is even
sweeter than a woman's.

567
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,960
Dr. Mes might just have fallen for that.

568
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,280
I can't believe
Dr. Mes is open to anything.

569
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,080
Tai, think back carefully.

570
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,720
Is it possible you were shocked
and misunderstood the whole thing?

571
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,520
Maybe it wasn't like that.

572
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,760
Right?

573
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,680
What do you want, Mr. Chat?

574
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,640
Pork fried rice
or chicken with basil on rice?

575
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,560
There's no need
for this much service, Mes.

576
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,120
People might really get the wrong idea.

577
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,880
Why, Mr. Chat?

578
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,240
If I did like you,

579
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,280
would it be so wrong?

580
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,360
That can't be true.

581
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,480
I must be imagining things.

582
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,880
Do you want a beating?

583
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,800
Mr. Chat, don't worry about it.

584
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,880
Time will prove that we're both

585
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,560
completely straight.

586
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,840
You should go for the pork fried rice.

587
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,400
The fried basil is tasty,
but Tai makes it on the spicier side.

588
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,720
Is this the food Tai sells?

589
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,720
That's right.
You might see her acting tough,

590
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,320
but her cooking is quite good.

591
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,440
It's on par with
famous restaurants, Mr. Chat.

592
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,400
The meal you had yesterday

593
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,800
was also prepared by Tai.

594
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,560
If I wanted to sign up
for Tai's meal services too,

595
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,720
would that be possible?

596
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,800
I didn't actually see it, Fon,

597
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,840
but many things led me to think that way.

598
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,200
I won't try to undo
what's already been said.

599
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,120
If it's not true, people will move on.

600
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,480
Fon, I should get…

601
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,160
going.

602
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,400
Wait, Tai.

603
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,240
Dr. Chat wants to sign up
for your meal service.

604
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,840
-Your sweet-faced doctor boyfriend?
-Tai.

605
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,720
Don't talk nonsense.

606
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,040
People might get the wrong idea again.

607
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,520
Just look at Namfon,
she's suddenly upset with me.

608
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,720
You must've fed her
some untrue stories about me.

609
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,960
He can't sign up for my meal service.

610
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,640
I can't handle any more right now.
Just let your friend know.

611
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,080
Oh, well, that's a shame.

612
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,120
Dr. Chat really loves your cooking.

613
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,120
He couldn't stop praising
the meal you made yesterday.

614
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,960
He just had the fried rice and praised it
from the first bite to the last.

615
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,400
Poor Dr. Chat.

616
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,680
He's new in town and doesn't know anyone.

617
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,000
Even finding good food is hard.

618
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,400
When he finally finds something he likes,
the seller is playing hard to get.

619
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,040
How about this?
When Dr. Chat is off his shift,

620
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,000
you can turn him down yourself.

621
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,600
I'm just relaying the info.

622
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,240
I'll get back to work.

623
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,240
Mr. Chat, are you really
signing up for Tai's meal services?

624
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,480
Yes, that's why I want to know
the background before deciding.

625
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,640
Honestly, she's a good kid.
She works hard to make a living.

626
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,320
She just acts tougher than most women.

627
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,880
She likes to act like a pack leader,

628
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,920
but she's actually harmless.

629
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,760
-She must be close to her dad.
-Tai doesn't have a dad.

630
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,480
He passed away from malaria.
She lives with her brother and mother.

631
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,560
I've got gossip about her mom.

632
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,320
This woman, Manee, doesn't work.

633
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,320
All she cares about is dressing up
and she lets her kids support her.

634
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,000
She likes to put on airs

635
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,440
just because she's from Bangkok.

636
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,080
She's even taught her children
not to use the northern dialect.

637
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,480
And she looks down on us as hicks.

638
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,480
Oh, dear!

639
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,240
Is the whole district sick?

640
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,400
This way, please, Doctor.

641
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,200
He's so fair-skinned.

642
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,760
These gossiping women spread
the news about a hot doctor so quickly.

643
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,080
Over my dead body.

644
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,120
-Hey!
-That's enough, Sorn.

645
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,400
-That's enough, Sorn.
-Gosh!

646
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,160
-Let go of me!
-Sorn!

647
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,120
I'm upset! I'm annoyed!

648
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,560
I'm hurt! I need to let out my emotions!

649
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,280
-Let go of me!
-Calm down, Sorn.

650
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:06,040
You let your emotions out, but I'm the one
who has to clean up and do the replanting.

651
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,920
If you're going to do this,
it's better you kick me instead.

652
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,640
You told me to do it!

653
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,600
He crushed my heart.

654
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,960
I haven't even had the chance
to touch Tai's fingertips.

655
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,280
He's only been here for a day
and already got to kiss her on the lips.

656
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,000
I need to get my revenge.

657
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,200
Do you want to sign up
for my meal service?

658
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,200
Yes.

659
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,600
My place should be fixed up in two days.
I don't want to bother Dr. Mes anymore.

660
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,680
It's 2,500 baht a month.
Can you afford that?

661
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,560
Dr. Mes said it was 1,500 baht.

662
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,520
Do you want it or not?
If not, I don't really care.

663
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,960
Let's go with that.

664
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,320
What happened today

665
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,000
was an accident.

666
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,080
Don't you ever tell anyone about it.

667
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,960
About what?

668
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,680
Do I need to spell it out?

669
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,040
I won't talk about it.

670
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,240
No one meant it,

671
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,040
and no one saw it.

672
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,640
It's a secret.

673
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,280
Good, there's still a bit
of a gentleman in you.

674
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,120
And you, you shouldn't gossip
about Dr. Mes and me anymore.

675
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,720
Okay, I'll try.

676
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,680
If someone happened to see you

677
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,320
jump and kiss me,

678
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,920
they wouldn't be able
to think of anything else.

679
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,960
If I started rumors about it,

680
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,400
what would you say?

681
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,440
You can tell them

682
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,920
it's not what it looked like.

683
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,960
Like Dr. Mes and I have been trying
to tell you, but you wouldn't listen?

684
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,440
Fine, I won't talk about it anymore.

685
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,440
You too.

686
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,960
Keep your mouth shut.

687
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,520
Let me know
when you want the meals delivered.

688
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,440
I'm Chat.

689
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,560
I didn't ask.

690
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,520
I just wanted to tell you.

691
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,000
Why are you smiling?

692
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,480
I'm not. That's just how my face is.

693
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,160
Gosh.

694
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,400
What the heck?

695
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,480
Darn it.

696
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,440
What's wrong with it?

697
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,800
The key.

698
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,000
You have to turn it.

699
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,520
Why are you still smiling?

700
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,680
Doctor!

701
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,480
Doctor!

702
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,360
Help me, Doctor.

703
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,320
My grandmother fell down the stairs
and broke her leg.

704
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,800
Where is your grandmother now?

705
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,640
Hey, Tai.

706
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,120
-Ah Go, here you go.
-Okay.

707
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,480
Thank you.

708
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,080
-Should I pay you now?
-No need.

709
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,720
You can deduct it
from the drinks I put on the tab.

710
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,640
-Okay.
-I have to run. I've got meals to deliver.

711
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,720
Okay.

712
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,440
You're such a hard worker, Tai.

713
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,240
-I'm off now, Ah Go.
-Okay, ride safely.

714
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,960
Sweet-faced doctor? Somchai?

715
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,000
This way, Doctor.

716
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,720
Grandma, the doctor is here!

717
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,760
Grandma, the doctor is here!

718
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,720
Please hurry, Doctor.

719
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,720
Grandma, the doctor is here!

720
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,560
Kid!

721
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,920
Kid!

722
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,120
Wait for me.

723
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,680
Please walk straight on the path, Doctor!

724
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,720
I've got you now.

725
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,720
Tai.

726
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,560
Where's the doctor?

727
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,200
What doctor? I don't know anything.

728
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,040
I saw that sweet-faced doctor
on the back of your bike heading here.

729
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,280
Where did you take him?

730
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,920
Well…

731
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,960
Somchai.

732
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,200
Talk!

733
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,240
-What doctor?
-You're still playing dumb? Talk now!

734
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,560
I only saw a dog.

735
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,880
A dog? You're a dog!

736
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,920
I saw with my own eyes.

737
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,240
Talk now.

738
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,920
-Tai.
-Talk now!

739
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:08,920
Kid!

740
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,560
Kid!

741
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,080
Which house is your grandmother in?

742
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,880
Doctor, watch out!

743
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,280
Damn!

744
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,880
Tai.

745
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,200
My beloved Tai.

746
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,360
Sorn!

747
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,200
Sorn, put me down right now!

748
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,920
Sorn, put me down right now!

749
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,920
If I can get down, you're dead!

750
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,600
-Hey, take it easy. You're hurting me.
-Shut up!

751
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,840
This is too tight.
You'll see when I get down.

752
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,520
Where's Sorn? Sorn!

753
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,000
Sorn, get back here!

754
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,440
Sorn, get back here!

755
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,360
-Let me down!
-Hey, you're hurting me.

756
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,440
-You son of a bitch! Shut up!
-Hey, take it easy.

757
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,200
-Help me!
-Hey.

758
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,320
-Somebody help me!
-Hey.

759
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,880
Is anyone around here?

760
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,400
Help me! Sorn!

761
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,640
-Ouch!
-Dad.

762
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,160
Ouch! What the hell?

763
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,320
Dad.

764
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,680
It's just you two.

765
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,360
I was scared for a moment.

766
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,600
What are you running from?

767
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,920
It's none of your business.

768
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,560
Help me!

769
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,200
That's Tai's voice, Dad.

770
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,840
-I'm going.
-Hey!

771
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,160
What did you do to her?

772
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,080
Dad, let's go.

773
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,000
Help! Somebody help!

774
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,280
Don't get closer. Get away from me!

775
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,600
Help me!

776
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,560
Help me!

777
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,120
-Tai!
-Tai!

778
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,280
Uncle Boon! Pon!

779
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,920
Please hurry and help me! I'm up here.

780
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,040
Please hurry!

781
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,760
-What are you playing up there?
-Come down!

782
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,040
I'm not playing. I can't get down.
Please hurry and help me!

783
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,760
-Ouch!
-Pon, do it slowly.

784
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,840
-Slowly.
-Oh, my goodness.

785
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,200
-Down.
-Oh, my goodness.

786
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,760
-Hey!
-Hey!

787
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,600
-Ouch!
-Tai, are you all right?

788
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,720
Leave me alone.

789
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,120
-Thank you, Uncle Boon.
-Are you all right?

790
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,840
How did someone like you
end up in a trap, Tai?

791
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,720
There's not even
a single wild rabbit around here.

792
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,040
Who would set up such a huge trap?

793
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,840
-It's that jerk Sorn's doing.
-What?

794
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,600
And who is he?

795
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,520
Hello, I'm a new doctor
at the army hospital.

796
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,920
Hey, Tai, are you cold?

797
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,400
No, I'm not.

798
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,600
I'll go deal with Sorn first.

799
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,600
Don't say anything you shouldn't, okay?

800
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,920
I didn't mean it.

801
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,120
Well, I didn't feel like
I touched you there at all.

802
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,720
You didn't feel it? What an insult.

803
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,040
-I did feel it.
-You felt it?

804
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,400
That's creepy and dirty!

805
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,320
Look, no matter what I say now,
you'll probably find it irritating.

806
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,360
What happened earlier and just now

807
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,320
were accidents.

808
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,160
I just call it bad luck.

809
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,080
One on top of another because I met you.

810
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,240
Hey!

811
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,680
Hey, wait for me!

812
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,640
Stay there. Don't follow me.

813
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,200
I don't know how to get back.

814
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,680
Hey!

815
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,440
Don't worry, Doctor.

816
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,160
I'll have Pon take you back.

817
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,520
Thank you.

818
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,400
Tai's like a sister to me, Doctor.

819
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,640
I've known her since she moved here.

820
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,520
My dad took her hunting a lot,

821
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,440
so she's got tons of survival skills.

822
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,880
So Tai's not from Chiang Rai?

823
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,680
No, she moved here from Bangkok.

824
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,840
And her dad?

825
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,880
Mr. Kavee passed away.

826
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,240
And he wasn't Tai's real dad.

827
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,280
She's his stepdaughter.

828
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,160
-Chai!
-Ouch!

829
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,680
-Sorn.
-Where the hell were you?

830
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,240
Sorn, I'm sorry.

831
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,320
Why didn't you warn me
that Tai was coming?

832
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,280
When did I have time to warn you?

833
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,920
I was lucky enough to be able to get away.

834
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,040
You got away on your own
and left me behind?

835
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,280
-Chai, you!
-Sorn!

836
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,040
Hey! Tai, my dear. Tai, please calm down.

837
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,080
Tai, please calm down. No!

838
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,600
The boss lady is here.
Every man for himself.

839
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,120
Oh no, Chai!

840
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,120
-Chai!
-Sorn,

841
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,200
why did you do it?

842
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,160
Tai, calm down. I did it

843
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,800
to get back at the new doctor for you.

844
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:41,880
Get back at him for what?

845
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,120
For him kissing you at the hospital.

846
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,240
Did you see that?

847
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,280
Yes.

848
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,600
It was an accident.

849
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,280
Don't ever mention it to anyone, got it?

850
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,320
-Got it?
-Yes.

851
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,200
Well, I just saw you

852
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,000
trying to take the cap

853
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,240
and the doctor turned around,

854
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,640
so you guys kissed.

855
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,320
All right! Stop talking
and don't talk to anyone about it.

856
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,360
Keep your mouth shut.

857
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,400
Tai, you're not mad at me--

858
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,880
Ouch! Tai! My arm is going to break!

859
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,640
And when you pulled up the trap,
what else did you see?

860
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,560
My arm is going to break! Ouch!

861
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,880
I saw you getting pulled up
with that doctor.

862
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,800
What else?

863
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,520
What do you want me to say?

864
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,000
Don't mess with me, Sorn. Just answer.

865
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:38,040
I only saw the doctor's back.
He's so huge, he blocked everything out.

866
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,280
Let go of my son right now!

867
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,760
A woman should act with more grace.

868
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,520
I don't like this brazen behavior.

869
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,880
Everything is fine.
We're just messing around, Mom.

870
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,080
Shut it, Sorn.

871
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,680
Don't even try to cover for her.

872
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,880
Go inside and eat now.
Your dad's been waiting.

873
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,200
Go now.

874
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,520
See you tomorrow.

875
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,000
-Wash up quickly and come down for dinner.
-Okay, Mom.

876
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,760
What were you shouting about?

877
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,520
What else?

878
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,800
It's Sorn and Tai.

879
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,200
Jeez.

880
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,720
There are countless women out there,

881
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,640
but he had to fall
for that unladylike one.

882
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,840
Actually, Sorn has a pretty good eye.

883
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,200
Tai has good features and a nice figure.

884
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,400
She's pretty like her mom.

885
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,240
Who's prettier than me in this district?

886
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,280
I'm just repeating what people say.

887
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,920
Since Kavee died,
I haven't seen Manee again.

888
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,000
She must have aged
and become all wrinkled by now.

889
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,400
She can't compare to my wife.

890
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,200
Goodness.

891
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,520
Come to think of it, since she moved here,

892
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,520
I have never seen her.

893
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,240
She acts like she's above us,
a city woman not associating with anyone.

894
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,080
I'm from Bangkok too,

895
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,120
but I don't look down
on people like she does.

896
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,960
Don't talk about other people
and ruin your mood. Come on, let's eat.

897
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,320
So how did your visit to the doctor go?

898
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,240
Do you know who the new doctor is?

899
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,080
-The one from Bangkok?
-That's right.

900
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,880
M.L. Chatklao Jutathep.

901
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:05,920
Jutathep.

902
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,400
How is he related
to Commander-in-Chief Ronnaphee?

903
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,600
He's his direct nephew.

904
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,080
He's a real nephew.

905
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,400
When I found out his name, I rushed home.

906
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,880
If he recognizes me,
it might cause problems.

907
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,640
I don't want to be the subject of gossip.

908
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,960
You worry too much.

909
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,920
I don't think he remembers.
It was a long time ago.

910
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,880
How can you be sure?

911
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,960
You want to see your wife
get her past dug up and exposed.

912
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,080
He's about the same age
as General Pinit's children.

913
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,960
They could be close.

914
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,720
It's best not to take any risks.

915
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,480
What's more concerning

916
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,280
is that he's
the Commander-in-Chief's nephew.

917
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,000
Here you go!

918
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,000
You startle easily, Mr. Chat.

919
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,160
You came in quietly.
Anyone would be startled.

920
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,240
I've been watching you for a while.

921
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,120
You've got this strange smile.

922
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,520
Are you falling for a Chiang Rai girl
or something?

923
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,400
Who would I fall for so quickly?

924
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,080
Don't tell me it's my Fon, Mr. Chat.

925
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,320
I won't try to take
what you hold so dearly.

926
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,880
It's definitely Panadda then.

927
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,760
Why didn't you say you like older women?

928
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,080
Are you crazy? She's not my type.

929
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,240
Just go away. Go.

930
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:41,920
Go now.

931
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,520
You must like someone younger.

932
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,720
It's Tai.

933
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,160
Right?

934
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,880
Just thinking about it gives me bruises.

935
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,280
Wow.

936
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,560
He's handsome, but his taste
is so unusual. What's up with that?

937
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,160
Hey.

938
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,960
-Sorry for interrupting.
-You're at it again.

939
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:27,760
Mr. Chat, you're the best.

940
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,760
Kwan is your own blood.

941
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,040
That girl is bad luck.

942
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,560
I don't even see her as my child.

943
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,840
What a shame. It should have been
you in my belly instead of her.

944
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,240
-Hey!
-Let's go!

945
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,000
Follow them!

946
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:27,359
