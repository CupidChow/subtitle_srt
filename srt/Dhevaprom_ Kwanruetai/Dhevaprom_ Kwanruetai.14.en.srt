1
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,560
200 joules. All clear.

2
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,800
Still no heart rate.

3
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,920
Time of death: 05:45.

4
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,640
You said I'd be your last.

5
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,480
Why did you buy a house
for that old hag then?

6
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,280
-Holy shit.
-Step back.

7
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,520
Would you rather have a loving family

8
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,720
or be all alone

9
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,280
because of your resentment?

10
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,840
The choice is yours.

11
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,960
Forget who my parents are
and who your mom is.

12
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,600
No Jutathep. No Dhevaprom.

13
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
Only the two of us.

14
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,600
It's no use.

15
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
We are never meant to be.

16
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,560
I want to be a nurse like you.

17
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
Please let me go back to school.

18
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,320
Goodbye, Dr. Chat.

19
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
What do you think? Is the room okay?

20
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,480
The room is very nice.

21
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,040
Your brother gave me
a three-month advance.

22
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,360
If you leave sooner, let me know.
I'll return the money.

23
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,800
I'll let you know.

24
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,920
Have you eaten?
There's food in the kitchen.

25
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,760
I stopped off for food earlier.

26
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,080
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

27
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If there's anything you want my help with,
please let me know.

28
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,000
I can do everything. Doing the laundry,
mopping the floor, ironing clothes.

29
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,600
I can do all the chores.
I can cook as well.

30
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,720
What about Thai desserts?
Do you know how to make them?

31
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,440
Yes, I do.

32
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,960
That's fantastic.

33
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,160
You'll be a great help to me.

34
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,120
What's your name again?

35
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,960
I'm Kwan. My full name is Kwanruetai.

36
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,280
A pretty face with a beautiful name.

37
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,680
Kwan.

38
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,640
It's quite hard to pronounce.

39
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,320
Can I call you Tai instead?

40
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,680
What's wrong?
Don't you like being called Tai?

41
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,880
Not at all.

42
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,320
It's just that many of the people
who called me Tai

43
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,160
have disappeared from my life.

44
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,080
But it's okay.

45
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,080
Having you call me Tai
is probably a good idea.

46
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,560
Are you tired?

47
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,320
Can you help me write a letter?

48
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,440
I've been straining my eyes
and my back is aching.

49
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Of course.

50
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
-Come this way.
-Okay.

51
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,040
My nephew lives all alone.

52
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,880
He works in the countryside
and only comes home once in a while.

53
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,480
He likes to receive my letters.

54
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,800
Why don't you call each other?

55
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,040
There's no phone in this house.

56
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
I didn't have it installed
since it's unnecessary.

57
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,880
It costs a lot of money too.

58
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,200
If you want to call home,
you'll need to use the public phone.

59
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,960
Okay.

60
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,960
Do you want me to continue
from where you left off?

61
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,440
Yes. Where did I leave off?

62
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,120
"I received your parcel."

63
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,720
I received your parcel.

64
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Please write down what I say.

65
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,760
Okay.

66
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,280
Everything is fine on this side.

67
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,640
Everything is fine on this side.

68
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,280
You don't need to worry.

69
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,520
You don't need to worry.

70
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,160
I miss you a lot too.

71
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,200
I miss you a lot too.

72
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,360
-Before I go to bed…
-Before I go to bed…

73
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,080
I'll think of you every night.

74
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,680
Do you want that written down?

75
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,960
Yes, please. My nephew is a sweet boy.

76
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,360
I've raised him since he was young.
I know his character.

77
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,880
Before I go to bed,
I'll think of you every night.

78
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,760
Take care of your health.

79
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,000
Take care of your health.

80
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,880
Love always.

81
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,440
-Love always?
-Yeah.

82
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,280
Love always.

83
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,280
What a sweet letter.

84
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,840
I'd like you to put this ring on.

85
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,320
It's just an ordinary ring
that doesn't cost much,

86
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,840
but I'd like you to put it on…

87
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,000
for me.

88
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,960
This ring will be my substitute.

89
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,200
It will be with you everywhere,

90
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,920
always.

91
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,440
Here's a letter from Kwan.

92
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,680
Why are you excited?

93
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,680
She writes to us every month anyway.

94
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,440
Why should I care?

95
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,880
Hello?

96
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,640
Yes. We just received your letter today.

97
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,000
Is that Kwan on the line?

98
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,360
Yes.

99
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
Hey.

100
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Are you going to write letters or call?
Pick one.

101
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,280
Do you have money to spare or what?

102
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Kwan, Mom has been saying she misses you.
She wants to see you.

103
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,760
I'll make time to take Mom to visit you.

104
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
By the way,

105
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,000
how is your study?

106
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,480
Is it hard?

107
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,560
Study well.

108
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,000
So you can boast to Mom.

109
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,360
Mom? She seems happy.

110
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,200
I take good care of her.
She's well-fed and comfortable.

111
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,320
Mom was grinning.

112
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,840
-What?
-Nothing.

113
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
I wasn't doing anything.

114
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,400
Ma'am, there's a letter for you.

115
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,960
Read it out loud for me.

116
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,560
Okay.

117
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,840
-Shall I read now?
-Yes.

118
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,720
"Dear beloved Aunt Lamai,

119
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm doing well

120
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,200
but very lonely.

121
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,640
I'm working tirelessly to suppress
the ache in my heart."

122
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,760
Your nephew is a sweet talker.

123
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,360
If I didn't know,
I'd have thought he was your lover.

124
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,320
It's the sweet tone he adopts
with his girlfriend.

125
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,400
Does your nephew have a girlfriend?

126
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,080
Yes, he has. His girlfriend
is very pretty actually.

127
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,000
But they live far apart.

128
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,080
I feel sorry for them.

129
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,880
They love each other.

130
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,480
However, there are
so many obstacles in the way.

131
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,640
I hope that your nephew will be able
to marry the woman he loves.

132
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,320
What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?

133
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,080
Between him and I, it's not meant to be.

134
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,440
I don't understand.
Why are you not meant to be?

135
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,440
Is he married?

136
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,440
It's a matter regarding our parents.

137
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,160
What does it have to do with them?

138
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,360
Are they getting married as well?

139
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,560
Do you…

140
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,680
love your boyfriend?

141
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,800
Don't lie to me.

142
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,560
I love him.

143
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,120
I wish you the best.

144
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,280
Let's write a reply
to my nephew, shall we?

145
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,560
Okay.

146
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,640
Let's do it.

147
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,080
Dear beloved Suchat…

148
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,120
Dear beloved Suchat…

149
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,280
A nursing student named Tai
is staying with me.

150
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,240
She's hard-working and kind.

151
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,040
She helps me with all the chores.
She also helps me make desserts.

152
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,200
I can't help but wish to have her
as my niece-in-law, but it's a pity.

153
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,800
Tai said she's already
in love with someone.

154
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,760
He's a doctor.

155
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,520
Did Tai come by at all?

156
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,200
I haven't seen her.

157
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,200
She's probably deterred
by your relatives from Bangkok.

158
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,880
I'm also afraid.

159
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,760
Afraid I can't stop my heart from falling.

160
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,280
All of them are so handsome.

161
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,000
Let's get you fed.

162
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,640
Here you go.

163
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,920
You have a male visitor.
Please enjoy your conversation.

164
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
Excuse me.

165
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,360
I'm glad you're okay.

166
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,400
Thank you.

167
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,240
How is Tai doing?

168
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,600
I came to tell you about her.

169
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,680
What is it?

170
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,360
She passed the entrance exam
for a nursing course in Bangkok.

171
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,880
She planned not to tell you.

172
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,120
She was hoping

173
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,600
to just cut all ties.

174
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,000
I'll tell them that
you know her brother, Kongphop.

175
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,040
Please take care of her.

176
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,080
Not to worry.

177
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,240
Mrs. Krongkaew made sure
I got the message.

178
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,040
Speaking of which,
is she the girl you want to marry?

179
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,040
I sure hope so, but she's headstrong.

180
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,480
Can you help me with one thing though?

181
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,000
I get it.

182
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,880
You want me to pretend
to write letters to my nephew,

183
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,119
not letting her know that it's you.

184
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,040
You miss her, don't you?

185
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:17,079
Even though you can't see her,
at least you'll see her handwriting.

186
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,520
You're smitten, you know that?

187
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,960
Stop teasing me, please.

188
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,680
Please write a sweet and loving reply.

189
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,640
It'll help me from feeling lonely

190
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,920
and keep me going at work.

191
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,880
I've got you.

192
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,160
See you in Bangkok.

193
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
I can hardly wait.

194
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,400
Love and miss you always.

195
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,240
I finally have the pleasure
of meeting you in person.

196
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,280
I was afraid Kej would never
introduce you to me.

197
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,080
I had been a bundle of nerves,
fearing she wouldn't bring me here.

198
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,000
Today, you're picking her up
to take her for a meal with your family.

199
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,200
Next time, you should
come here for a meal, okay?

200
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,400
I'd be happy to, Great-Grandma.

201
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,960
Whenever is convenient for you,
I'll be here.

202
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,040
I wonder when Chat is going to
introduce his girlfriend to me.

203
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,120
I've heard about her from several people.

204
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,240
It has been some time already.

205
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,360
It won't be long now, Great-Grandma.

206
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,040
I guarantee that you're going to love her.

207
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Who are her parents?

208
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,640
Can you give me a hint?

209
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,320
Chat forbids us from telling you.

210
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,360
You'll hear it from him soon enough.

211
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,240
I guarantee that you'll be taken
by a complete surprise.

212
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,200
You guys sure like to tease an old lady.

213
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,120
I don't want to know anymore.

214
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,440
You'd better head out for your meal.

215
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,240
You shouldn't keep Her Grace waiting.

216
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,600
All right?

217
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,240
I'm relieved. That's one more hurdle down.

218
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,720
Who says that?

219
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,280
You're assuming too much.

220
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,640
You're being unsupportive right now.

221
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,480
Your mom and mine teamed up to set us up.

222
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,560
So no resistance from them.

223
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,040
That leaves your dad as the final hurdle

224
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,520
and then the wedding.

225
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,680
Not yet.

226
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,280
I'll wait until after Chat's wedding.

227
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,480
Come on. If we wait for Chat to marry,
won't I be old and gray by then?

228
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,800
Will you reconsider?

229
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,400
Please, Kej.

230
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:51,080
PRIVATE TAXI

231
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,480
We've arrived, Mom.

232
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:04,920
DHEVAPROM MANSION

233
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,640
DHEVAPROM MANSION

234
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,120
Why would you bring me here?

235
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,160
Didn't you say
you're taking me to see Kwan?

236
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,480
I heard from Dr. Chat
that your dad is unwell.

237
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,520
He's physically ill and heartsick.

238
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,800
-You still--
-It's a chronic illness, I heard.

239
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,440
It's as if he's lacking the will to live.

240
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,120
Do you not want to see him?

241
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,240
Sir.

242
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,840
Sir.

243
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,640
Mrs. Maratee is here to see you.

244
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,600
Maratee?

245
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,960
Yes, Mrs. Maratee.

246
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,400
Maratee.

247
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,080
Is it really you?

248
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,120
Maratee.

249
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Come.

250
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,000
Come closer.

251
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,360
Let me see you clearly, my girl.

252
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,200
Maratee.

253
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,120
Dad.

254
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,560
Dad.

255
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,680
Why did you

256
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,200
never come to visit me?

257
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,000
I've missed you so much, do you know?

258
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,800
I thought

259
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,040
this day would never come.

260
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,480
I was afraid that

261
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,400
I might take my last breath

262
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,680
before getting to see you
for the last time.

263
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,880
Don't say that, Dad.

264
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,840
Don't say that.

265
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,120
Maratee.

266
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,400
I want…

267
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,040
to apologize to you.

268
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,520
Don't say that, Dad.

269
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,080
Everything was my fault.

270
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,760
You can be angry or hate me…

271
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,600
all you want.

272
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,000
It's all because of me.

273
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,160
It's all because of me.

274
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,400
It's all my fault.

275
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,600
Forgive…

276
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,360
Forgive me.

277
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,240
Forgive me.

278
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,680
Please.

279
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,880
Please.

280
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,400
Dad, I'm sorry.

281
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,280
I'm sorry.

282
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,760
I'm sorry, Dad.

283
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,720
You've been gone

284
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,280
for over ten years.

285
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,600
Tell me everything.

286
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,800
Dad.

287
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,320
Excuse me.

288
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,320
The man who came with Mrs. Maratee
said someone is here to see you.

289
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,240
Okay.

290
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,640
Mom, someone wants to see you.

291
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
Mom.

292
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,720
Kwan.

293
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,920
Kwan.

294
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,880
I've missed you.

295
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,400
I've missed you too.

296
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,640
How have you been?

297
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,640
Dad,

298
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,280
her name is Kwanruetai.
She's my daughter, your granddaughter.

299
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,560
Go. Pay respect to your grandpa.

300
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,480
Yes, Mom.

301
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,160
You are our princess.

302
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,840
Today…

303
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,760
am I dreaming?

304
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,000
Today is such a good day.

305
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,120
I get to meet my daughter
and my granddaughter.

306
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:10,160
Let me see my granddaughter up close.

307
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,800
You're as beautiful as your mom.

308
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,800
Why don't you move back in?

309
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,240
We can all be together at long last.

310
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,120
Okay?

311
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,080
I can't come back to stay.

312
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,160
There are things I need to take care of.

313
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,480
You shouldn't worry though.

314
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,040
We are doing well.

315
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,880
I have a house and a car.

316
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,480
My bedroom even has an air conditioner.

317
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,840
It's true, Grandpa.

318
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,240
If you have time, please come visit us.

319
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,240
All right.

320
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,040
If that's what you prefer,

321
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,400
I won't go against your wish.

322
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,040
We have a lot to learn

323
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,040
from the past mistakes

324
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,240
that we shared.

325
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,760
I'll no longer be selfish

326
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,400
and exploit the love that you have for me…

327
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,440
to satisfy my own needs.

328
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,440
Kwanruetai.

329
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,880
Yes?

330
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,720
Remember…

331
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,920
Dhevaprom Mansion

332
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,720
is always open to you.

333
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,760
You are my granddaughter.

334
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,720
When you have free time,

335
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,880
you should come to visit me
whenever possible.

336
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,080
I don't want my death to be lonely…

337
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,960
with me all by myself.

338
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,280
I'll do that.

339
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,720
Hello, ma'am.

340
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,719
It has been a long time.

341
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,960
Have you been well?

342
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,920
I'm fine.

343
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,159
I've been in good health.

344
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,840
This house is being put up for--

345
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,639
Don't bother making excuses.

346
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,840
Kong told me everything.

347
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,000
Not to mention, him taking me
to Dhevaprom Mansion.

348
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,760
You're quite a schemer.

349
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,560
I should thank you though.

350
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,720
I wouldn't have had the nerve
to go see my dad.

351
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,240
I wouldn't even dare to think about it.

352
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,720
If I hadn't gone there that day,

353
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,960
I wouldn't have known

354
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,520
that he had been waiting for me.

355
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,160
He still loves me and embraces my faults.

356
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,280
I shouldn't have used my hatred
to force Kwan to do my bidding.

357
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,600
I'm exploiting the love
that my daughter has for me.

358
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,480
Dad's remark made me think.

359
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,240
I don't want my later years
to be like his.

360
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,720
I don't want to be abandoned, all alone.

361
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,000
Tai loves you very much.

362
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,560
I fully believe

363
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,560
that she'll never abandon you.

364
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,640
You must have already gotten over her.

365
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,120
That's not true.

366
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,160
Why haven't you visited her?

367
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,360
I've been waiting for your permission.

368
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,240
Waiting?

369
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,080
What's the point of waiting?

370
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,720
My daughter's lost so much weight
from being heartsick.

371
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,040
What are you implying?

372
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,120
If you missed my daughter,

373
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,960
why wouldn't you make the effort
to find out where she's living?

374
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,280
I know where she's living,

375
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,320
but I haven't visited because

376
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,320
you didn't want us to be together.

377
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,200
Hey, watch what you say.

378
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,400
When did I do such a thing?
Don't be so naive.

379
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,640
My daughter is so far out of sight.

380
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,000
If you two had secretly met up,
how would I have known?

381
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,280
Are you giving me permission to marry Tai?

382
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,920
I give you an inch, and you take a mile.

383
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,120
I haven't said a word about
entrusting my daughter to you.

384
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,120
But…

385
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,160
if I'm the reason to separate her
from someone as decent as you,

386
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,840
I'll probably feel guilty
for the rest of my life.

387
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,520
I'm in love with Tai.

388
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,240
I give you my word that

389
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,840
I'll look after her the best I can.

390
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,000
She'll come before my own life.

391
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,440
Open it.

392
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,240
GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK
SAVINGS BANK BOOK

393
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,080
It's Tai's bank book.

394
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,640
NAME: KWANRUETAI PITAKDHEVA
BALANCE: 580,000

395
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,760
The exact balance
is the price of this house.

396
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,000
I deposited the money in her name
when we sold the house.

397
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,120
You must have taken me for a selfish,
money-grabbing person all this time.

398
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,760
Why are you giving it to me?

399
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,440
Give it to Kwan.

400
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,840
When she has to meet your relatives,

401
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,840
she can buy some nice dresses
and necklaces for herself,

402
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,200
so she won't be looked down upon.

403
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,760
Why are you just standing there?

404
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,080
Why don't you hurry to see her?

405
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,680
She might have wasted away
from loneliness at this point.

406
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,360
Thank you, ma'am.

407
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,920
I'll get right on it.

408
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,800
Go.

409
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,480
Kavee.

410
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,880
I made the right choice, didn't I?

411
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,560
My daughter can finally be happy
with the person she loves.

412
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,120
Come on in.

413
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,800
Is your nephew here?

414
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,720
Hello.

415
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,240
Hello.

416
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,960
-The toilet is over there.
-Thank you.

417
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,200
He's not your nephew?

418
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,000
He's a plumber.

419
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,040
-What?
-Have you waited long?

420
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,480
Dr. Chat?

421
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,800
What are you doing here?

422
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,120
Well, he's my nephew.

423
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,120
He's the one I've had you write
replies to these past several months.

424
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,080
Ma'am! You're in cahoots with him?

425
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,080
I used to be Mrs. Krongkaew's chambermaid.

426
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,480
She sent me to assist Mr. Chat.

427
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,320
Mr. Chat really misses you.

428
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,520
He said if he couldn't see your face,
he'd be satisfied with your handwriting.

429
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,200
You don't have to tell her everything.

430
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,600
I can't hold back.
I don't want Tai to be angry with me.

431
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,480
Mr. Chat ordered me

432
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,440
to get you to write sweet
and loving paragraphs.

433
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,520
He said they'd keep him going at work.

434
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,800
Lamai.

435
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,600
Did you finally get a green light
from Mrs. Maratee?

436
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,200
Is that why you came?

437
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,520
Mom?

438
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,920
Are we going or not?

439
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,920
What?

440
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,880
Let's go.

441
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,760
Maratee.

442
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,560
Is it really you, Maratee?

443
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,560
Yes, Grandma Orn.

444
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,240
How have you been?

445
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,960
I'm delighted to see you again.

446
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,600
How did you two cross paths?

447
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,520
It's a long story, Great-Grandma.

448
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,440
Why don't we sit down and talk?

449
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,800
That's a good idea. Come.

450
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,240
Lay it all out for me.

451
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,960
After you lost the case, where did you go?

452
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,640
Do you like it here?

453
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,760
I don't like the person living here.

454
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,000
You're quite a schemer.

455
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,320
Everything that I did was for you.

456
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,040
Sweet talker.

457
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,440
To win the heart of
a fearless girl such as yourself,

458
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,800
I had to put an intricate plan together.

459
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,080
Let's go inside.
Great-Grandma Orn is waiting to see you.

460
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,840
Okay.

461
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,080
Let me see.

462
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,480
You have your mom's beauty.

463
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,720
You have good eyes, Chat.

464
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,560
I love her dearly, Great-Grandma.

465
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,600
You're sweet-talking her
in front of her mom?

466
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,440
I'm used to it, Grandma Orn.

467
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,280
I've heard him say that many times.

468
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,760
Since he convinced me, I doubt
this girl isn't already under his spell.

469
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,440
You're normally reserved,
but you play a good game, don't you?

470
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,560
It seems that the promise
between the two families

471
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,280
has finally been fulfilled
by the third generation.

472
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,960
I'm fortunate to still
be alive to witness it.

473
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,760
The only thing left is Vilairumpa.

474
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,760
I wonder how she's doing
and if she's well.

475
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,200
Have you not heard from her at all?

476
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,880
Not at all, Grandma Orn.

477
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,160
Dad is worried as well.

478
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,800
If I hear any news about her,
I'll let you know right away.

479
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,760
That'd be great. Thank you.

480
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,960
I'm very happy for you two.

481
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,800
You've overcome the hurdles
and you've gotten to this point.

482
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,920
I've always believed that only when
husband and wife are bound by love

483
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,480
would the marriage stay strong.

484
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,240
Seeing you two puts my mind at ease.

485
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,840
Now we only need to wait
for the right date and time.

486
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,320
Why don't you sit on the chair?

487
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,640
Thank you.

488
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,280
Has Mrs. Maratee left?

489
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,120
Kwan told me you were waiting out here.

490
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,840
I wanted to come and say hi.

491
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,000
What business do you have with me?

492
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:21,240
I'd like to offer you my thanks

493
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,640
for allowing the two of them
to be together.

494
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,080
I think I might understand
what you're feeling.

495
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,160
Deep down, you probably
want to separate them.

496
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,360
But the love for your daughter

497
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,600
made you choose this course.

498
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,480
I'm sorry about what happened.

499
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,760
And I'd rather let sleeping dogs lie.

500
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,840
I can only hope that

501
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,360
from today on

502
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,480
we can take a step forward together

503
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,880
and focus on our children's happiness.

504
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,000
That's all I have to say to you.

505
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,080
I won't trouble you further.

506
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,600
Krongkaew.

507
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,200
We'll see each other again
on the day of the proposal.

508
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,320
I'm all by myself over here.
The food is not to my liking either.

509
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,000
When will you graduate?

510
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,360
I'll bring Dad
to ask for your hand in marriage.

511
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,560
I'm all by myself over here.
The food is not to my liking either.

512
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,720
When will you graduate?

513
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,640
I'll bring Dad
to ask for your hand in marriage.

514
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,560
Flimsy excuse.

515
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,120
We don't need to be married
for me to cook for you.

516
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,800
Will you marry me?

517
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,240
Yes.

518
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,080
I can't help but feel jealous
when I see other couples.

519
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,400
I want to experience that moment too.

520
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,720
Give me that.

521
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,520
Your brother is quite the flirt.

522
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,960
I have a special delivery for you.

523
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,760
Smells good. What do we have here?

524
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,960
Glutinous rice balls
and sweet egg in coconut milk.

525
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,400
He's all dressed up to deliver the meal
to the new teacher.

526
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,000
He charges her a cheaper monthly fee
than his own brother-in-law.

527
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,920
I brought you dessert.

528
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,360
Thank you.

529
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,320
What is it? Looks delicious.

530
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,920
Baked mung bean custard.

531
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,160
Wait. Hold on.

532
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,640
Our hair got tangled up.

533
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,520
We have the same hair.

534
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,120
-Yeah, curly.
-Right?

535
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,960
It hurts a little.

536
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,480
You're quite the charmer yourself.

537
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,840
I heard you've been buttering up my mom.

538
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,160
That's enough.

539
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,360
Since I love the daughter,
I should win over the mom first.

540
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,280
Don't you think so?

541
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,160
Do you want more?

542
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,440
-No, thank you. Not yet.
-Please have some more.

543
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,960
-Let me get you some more.
-Okay.

544
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,160
That's enough.

545
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,840
It's delicious.

546
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,840
When will you return to Chiang Rai?

547
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:26,440
I miss you.

548
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,440
What am I thinking?

549
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,120
Tai.

550
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,840
What is this?

551
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,000
Now that you've completed your study,
you have a promise to fulfill.

552
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,520
Will you marry me?

553
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,040
I need to think it over.

554
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,800
You're already wearing my ring.

555
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,360
Are you still going to turn me down?

556
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,800
All right, I'll marry you.

557
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,240
What are you daydreaming about?

558
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,320
Are you done?

559
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,120
Yes.

560
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,360
Let's go. We've kept Mom waiting.

561
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,400
Where's the ring that I gave you?

562
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,760
Why aren't you wearing it?

563
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,840
I've been carrying it with me
all this time.

564
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,200
Are you happy now?

565
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,520
Let's go.

566
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,760
Chat.

567
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,680
There's no need to rush.

568
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,040
I'd rather spend time with you,
just the two of us.

569
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,040
Chat.

570
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,160
You need to be punished
for keeping me waiting.

571
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,040
Chat, that's enough.

572
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,960
Will you promise me

573
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,480
that you'll marry me
right after your graduation?

574
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,280
I promise.

575
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,920
Words aren't sufficient.

576
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,200
We need to seal it with a kiss.

577
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,240
Chat!

578
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,840
I won't let you go otherwise.

579
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,400
Close your eyes first.

580
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,640
I promise.

581
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:57,520
THE END

582
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,480
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

583
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,840
Hello?

584
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,760
Hey, Chat.

585
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,480
Is that you, Jak?

586
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,160
What's up?

587
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,880
I'm in Chiang Rai.

588
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,680
What are you doing here?

589
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,920
I'm on a secret mission.
