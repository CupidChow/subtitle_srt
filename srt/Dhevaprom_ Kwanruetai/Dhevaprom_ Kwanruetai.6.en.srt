1
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,560
There are scratches on Pon's lips

2
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,400
and there's also blood.

3
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,640
Do you think Pon might have been killed?

4
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,640
How dare you touch me?

5
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,280
Don't lower yourself
to associate with this family, Doctor.

6
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,560
Doctor?

7
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,720
Doctor?

8
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,120
Just wait and see.
If I can't find her today,

9
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,400
I'll file a report with the police

10
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,560
and have that sweet-faced
army doctor arrested.

11
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I give you my word.
I'll keep this a secret.

12
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,840
Kwan!

13
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,640
Your threats don't scare me.

14
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,480
If I'm listening to you,

15
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,440
it's only to prevent more trouble for Tai.

16
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,480
Do you love my daughter?

17
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,440
Mom, Dad gave it to Kwan.

18
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,960
You're his real son.

19
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,280
He didn't even give you anything.

20
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,240
If you want it, you can take it.

21
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,440
Then go get me the deed.

22
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,480
Go!

23
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,079
Let me help.

24
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,160
How is Tai doing?

25
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,960
She's grounded.

26
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,160
I shouldn't have followed her here.

27
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,160
I feel guilty for being the cause
of her getting grounded.

28
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,760
She told me everything.

29
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,720
Being grounded is trivial

30
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
compared to Mom's demand
to put the house up for sale.

31
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,920
URGENT SALE

32
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,040
I'm sorry, the shop is closed.

33
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,400
I'm looking for Pilai.

34
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Well.

35
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,560
I'll go get her for you.

36
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,920
Pilai?

37
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,920
Mr. Attawit is here to see you.

38
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,640
Chat, why aren't you answering the phone?

39
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,600
Mr. Park?

40
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Ms. Kej.

41
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Is the rascal home yet?

42
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Pilai isn't here.

43
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,560
I know.

44
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,760
What do you want?

45
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,480
I left something here.
I came back to fetch it.

46
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,680
I'm about to leave.
Why don't you close up?

47
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
Please show some respect.

48
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,840
You're fierce.

49
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,240
Please don't be mad at me.

50
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,400
I'm just playing around.

51
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,720
What you did is not just playing around.

52
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,640
A gentleman shouldn't be playing around
with the opposite sex like that.

53
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,600
Your eloquence is showing itself.

54
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,960
It's hard to understand.

55
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,320
Since you graduated from abroad,
I was going for the Western gestures.

56
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,320
Starting with shaking hands,

57
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,760
followed by a hug

58
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,720
and a peck on the cheek.

59
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Please don't be so quick to leave.

60
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,280
Since today was your first day at work,

61
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,120
you haven't gotten used to
the running of things here.

62
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,760
Pilai herself must have been
reluctant to teach you.

63
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,320
How about

64
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,560
the two of us find somewhere
to sit down and chat?

65
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,520
I can explain your job in detail,

66
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,480
not missing a single nook or cranny.

67
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,360
I'm professional like that.

68
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,360
Where are you going?

69
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,880
Let go!

70
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,400
Let go of me! Let go!

71
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,800
-Ms. Kej!
-Let go!

72
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,920
-Come here. Where are you going?
-Let go.

73
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
Ms. Kej!

74
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,640
Ms. Kej!

75
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,440
Please let me go. I want to go home.

76
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,280
What's the hurry?
There's only you and me in this shop.

77
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,320
What if we…

78
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,960
You bitch!

79
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,960
-Ms. Kej!
-Mr. Park!

80
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,160
-What happened?
-Mr. Park.

81
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,720
Who the hell are you?

82
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,640
I'm a friend of her brother's.

83
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,240
I came to pick her up.

84
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,200
I see. Why didn't you tell me
your driver was coming?

85
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,280
I'm leaving.

86
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,560
About your offer to train me,
there's no need.

87
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,200
I don't want to change my career
to a gambling addict.

88
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,760
Watch your mouth, bitch.

89
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,920
That jerk.

90
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,120
He was going to assault you,
but you still went and said that.

91
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,280
Even if you hadn't come,
I would have made it out.

92
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,280
Do you think so?

93
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,440
Just now, some lady
with a pale face and trembling lips

94
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,080
was rushing straight to me.

95
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,720
I appreciate your help.

96
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,000
Do you still have my card?

97
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
Did it occur to you to call me?

98
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,240
I gave Chat a call first,
but he wasn't at home.

99
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,520
Then I thought of you,

100
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,880
but I couldn't find your card.

101
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,280
I couldn't recall your number.

102
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,240
You'd better memorize my number now.

103
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Memorize my personal phone number as well.

104
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,040
Although it rarely works here,
but just in case.

105
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,080
Can you promise me you won't tell Chat?

106
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,720
I still want to work here.

107
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,600
-But that punk--
-He rarely drops by.

108
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,720
I promise that I'll take
better care of myself.

109
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
I'll even let you take me
to work and back every day.

110
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,840
Have you asked
if I'd be willing to do that?

111
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,560
How about this?

112
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,080
I won't tell Chat,

113
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,760
but you must memorize my contact numbers.

114
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,960
Do it now.
By the way, my room number is 801.

115
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,840
801.

116
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,440
There's also the hotel's landline.

117
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,640
The hotel's landline as well?

118
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
If you don't remember
the hotel's landline,

119
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,400
how will you reach my room?

120
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,240
Fine.

121
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,960
0-5-3…

122
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,040
0-5-3…

123
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,080
Ouch. Jeez.

124
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,120
Isn't this what you want?

125
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,080
What I want?

126
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,240
I warned you this girl is not easy
like those models.

127
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,640
Whatever.

128
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,880
She can't escape from me.

129
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,040
You can't be serious. Are you going to
make her your wife and kick me out?

130
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,280
I'd never treat my dear wife like that.

131
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,920
How would I know? She's pretty and rich.
What do I have compared to her?

132
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,920
I already proved myself with Rungrawee.

133
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,560
I'm only doing this to earn us some money.

134
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,320
They are temporary.

135
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,120
That girl is a local nobody model,

136
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,760
not a noble from such a prominent family
like the Jutathep.

137
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,880
Other girls are just toys to me,

138
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,720
but I'm serious about you.

139
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,680
Am I not someone you take for granted?

140
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,600
I love you.

141
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,480
Ouch!

142
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,760
If you love me, promise me that you'll
rein in your spending in the casino.

143
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,520
Promise.

144
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,240
As for this month's share, I get half.

145
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,960
-Half?
-Yes.

146
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,400
Isn't that too much?

147
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,360
Well…

148
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,960
we are partners, aren't we?

149
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,960
What are you going to do, Mr. Chat?

150
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,720
What else can I do?

151
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,840
I concluded too hastily

152
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,560
that Pon's cause of death
was heart failure and respiratory arrest.

153
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,520
His body has already been embalmed.

154
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,360
Ordering a postmortem is useless.

155
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,360
As I told you, this is the doing
of notorious criminals.

156
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,320
They are a syndicate.

157
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,600
Tai claimed that Mr. Songpon was involved.

158
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,640
I'll find a chance to talk to her.

159
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,640
Are you sure you want to pursue this?

160
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,880
It makes me feel uneasy.

161
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,480
Mes, we are soldiers.

162
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,920
Our duty is to protect the citizens.

163
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,440
I'll never stand to the side
when the people are mistreated.

164
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,400
Then I'll be your support.

165
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,600
I'll see what I can find out
from the soldiers in our camp.

166
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,960
Thank you.

167
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,880
Phu, the sapphire ring we saw just now,
looked like an antique.

168
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,720
Would you like to have it?

169
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,000
No, thank you.

170
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,400
We've been looking for months.
I'm still exhausted from it.

171
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,560
There's no sapphire ring in the world

172
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,080
that holds an appeal for me.

173
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,600
Because you're waiting
for the diamond engagement ring

174
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,200
between M.L. Rachanon and Ms. Sroifha?

175
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,960
Phu.

176
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,120
Aren't we paying
a surprise visit to Ms. Kej?

177
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,480
-Let's hurry along.
-Let's do that.

178
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,200
Did Mr. Attawit drop by yesterday?

179
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,160
Yes.

180
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,880
He didn't touch you inappropriately,
did he?

181
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,360
I'd rather forget about it.

182
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,440
That's good.

183
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,640
He usually comes in late evening, tipsy.

184
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,640
He's been aggressive with me as well.

185
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,680
I didn't tell Mrs. Da though
because I didn't want to worry her.

186
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,920
Noted.

187
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,080
ARADA

188
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,880
Phu!

189
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,680
What brings you here?

190
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,080
Just a moment, please.

191
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,120
Do you know each other?

192
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,760
He's my older brother.

193
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,120
Do you have two brothers?

194
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,120
Good looks do run in the family.

195
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,680
Phu is my cousin.
He's the son of Uncle Rachanon.

196
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,040
M.L. Rachanon Jutathep?

197
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,720
The owner of JT Center?

198
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,240
Correct.

199
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Hello, my name is Pilai.

200
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,880
I work as an accountant for the boutique.

201
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,000
Why don't you take a seat?
Would you prefer coffee or tea?

202
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Neither, thank you.

203
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,000
You can't say no.

204
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,840
How about coffee? I'll get it for you.
I'll be right back.

205
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,040
Let's have a seat, shall we?

206
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,840
We had business to tend to in Chiang Rai
and decided to drop by for a surprise.

207
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,640
Would you like the boutique
to start working on your wedding dress?

208
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,640
You little rascal.

209
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,920
I even made time to pay you a visit

210
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,480
and you're trying to get a sale out of it.

211
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,120
Since you're here anyway, you might
as well kill two birds with one stone.

212
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,080
We haven't set the date yet.

213
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,960
If you dawdle, who knows,
Chat's wedding might arrive before yours.

214
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,480
Our Chat, you mean?

215
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,080
You must be joking.

216
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,800
The idealistic doctor has given in
and now has a girlfriend?

217
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,320
Only if my intuition isn't off.

218
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,880
He's adamant nothing is going on,

219
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,280
but he has definitely fallen.

220
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,240
Is she from Chiang Rai?

221
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,120
Yes. What's more, she's only 19.

222
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,840
Is the doctor robbing the cradle?

223
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,920
I heard Dr. Chat wanted
to order a postmortem on Pon's corpse,

224
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,320
but Chalam and Nuch wouldn't allow it.

225
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,720
Both of them must be
fearing the consequences.

226
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,040
Who wouldn't?

227
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,560
Dr. Chat must be looking
to get justice for Pon.

228
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,440
What can he do though?

229
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,800
He has no connections.

230
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,320
He might be a doctor from Bangkok,

231
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,000
but prying into this
will still get him gunned down.

232
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,400
I feel so bad for Pon.

233
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,800
He didn't deserve to die.

234
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,320
Do you think I don't feel bad?

235
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,560
But if we don't keep a low profile,
the next target will be us.

236
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,240
We are insignificant bystanders.

237
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,640
This is basically
a David and Goliath situation.

238
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,840
Pon's killer must have fled
to Myanmar by now.

239
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,160
They're getting away with murder.

240
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,000
Kwan, I care for you

241
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,240
and I'm concerned for Mom's safety.

242
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,120
Before you do anything, think of Mom.

243
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,360
Don't cause trouble for her.

244
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,920
For Dr. Chat as well.

245
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,880
If anything, you should warn him.

246
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,240
Why me though?

247
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,560
He causes me a lot of trouble.

248
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,200
If you want to warn him, you do it.

249
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,320
Don't drag me into it.

250
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,600
He seems pretty concerned
about you though.

251
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,560
Where the heck is everyone? Where are you?

252
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,360
Are you deaf?

253
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,960
The phone has been ringing for a while.
Why didn't you answer it?

254
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,200
-I'll get it.
-Okay.

255
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,840
-I'm coming, Mom.
-You'd better come.

256
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,720
It's best that you stay put.

257
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,360
Don't go out to flirt around.

258
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,800
I have never done that, Mom.

259
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,760
I'm sure you have.

260
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,680
Do you think you can fool me?

261
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,560
You're a silent flirt.

262
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,600
-Mom.
-Yes?

263
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,000
-The caller wants to buy the house.
-What? Really?

264
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,800
Tell them to hold the line. I'm coming.

265
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,720
I can't lower the price.
We already set it very low.

266
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,840
What's more,
the property is not landlocked.

267
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,840
Before long, a road will be built.

268
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,680
It's a beautiful piece of land

269
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,320
located next to a natural pond
where the Loy Krathong Festival is held.

270
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
If folks from the capital see it,

271
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,800
it'll undoubtedly become a hot commodity.

272
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,560
For sure.

273
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,320
Are you going to buy it?

274
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,080
I'm free. Today is fine.

275
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,320
I want to sell it as quickly as possible.

276
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,760
Not a problem. Give me a moment.

277
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,680
Kong, will you talk to them for me?

278
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,480
Decide on the location, time,

279
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,760
and what preparation is needed,

280
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,200
-okay?
-Sure.

281
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,640
Hello?

282
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,560
What documents do we have to prepare?

283
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,040
The deed.

284
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,440
A copy of the house register.

285
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,280
National ID card.

286
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,240
Hey.

287
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,400
What brings you here? Why didn't you call?

288
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,160
The residence is new and clean,
and the atmosphere is welcoming.

289
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,800
I sense a woman's touch.

290
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,400
It wouldn't have been
this sparkling clean otherwise.

291
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,640
Your insistence on setting me up
is commendable.

292
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,960
How are you finding
your workplace, Ms. Kej?

293
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,680
I like it there.
Mrs. Arada is extremely talented.

294
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,280
She doesn't hold anything back
when teaching me.

295
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,320
Talented but unlucky.

296
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,440
Before long, the wealth she's accumulated
will have been used up by her gambler son.

297
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,240
The two daughters have no interest
in their mother's business.

298
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,000
They only care about the inheritance.

299
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,760
Do you know the family as well?

300
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,760
Yes, I have run into her daughters
at some parties.

301
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Gotcha. Were the two ladies
trying to flirt with you?

302
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,320
Mind you, Ms. Laor could
pull your ear as a punishment.

303
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,560
It's not my ears I'm worried about.

304
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,840
I'm worried she'll use a gun.

305
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Hey, Phu.

306
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,920
Watch it.

307
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,480
Do you see that?

308
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Oh, and if you have anything
for Great-Grandma, you can give it to me.

309
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,880
Thank you for the offer.

310
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,520
But I'll be going to Bangkok with Kej
at the end of the month.

311
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,800
I have a fashion show to organize
for the boutique.

312
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,320
A certain someone misses home,
so he's coming with me.

313
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,520
That's terrific.
A family get-together is long overdue.

314
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,800
May I ask you for a favor?

315
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,920
You're not a stranger.

316
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,720
Whatever help you need, I'm all ears.

317
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,840
Could you help me look
for Mrs. Maratee's old photographs?

318
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,880
Do you have a clue about her whereabouts?

319
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,040
Not quite, but I have my suspicions.

320
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,840
That's why I want a collection
of Mrs. Maratee's photos for reference.

321
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,080
The one photo that Great-Grandma
gave me is pretty worn out.

322
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,800
Who do you suspect?

323
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,520
I sent my men to convince
Chalam and her daughter.

324
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,360
As long as they insist
on no further investigation,

325
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,320
that guy has no authority.

326
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,400
Which guy, sir?

327
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,440
The new doctor who's recently
transferred to the army hospital.

328
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,120
He has got the M.L. title.

329
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,840
What of the M.L. title?

330
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,040
Do not underestimate the Jutathep.

331
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,640
Who are they? I've never heard of them.

332
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,720
Haven't you heard

333
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,760
about the five Jutathep heroes
assisting the heir of Viengphukhum

334
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,680
in the quest to reclaim the throne?

335
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,520
M.L. Ronnaphee is the current
Air Force Commander in Chief.

336
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,240
You wouldn't want any conflict
with his family members, no?

337
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,360
I get it now.

338
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,160
I suggest you take your men
out of the city

339
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,200
and lay low till this dies down.

340
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,560
Don't take any action
or else things could blow up.

341
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,880
The guy who took Pon's life
had already fled to Myanmar.

342
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,040
You may rest easy.

343
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,560
I myself got a big job in Chiang Mai.

344
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,480
I won't be bothering you for a while.

345
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,720
That's great. I do need a breather.
I've had non-stop issues as of late.

346
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,160
Issues caused by your son, right?

347
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,120
Not only is he a gambling addict,
he's also a drug user.

348
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,200
Why don't you caution your son

349
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,240
to cut down his usage?

350
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,440
He could be overdosing any day.

351
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,120
Here's my order.

352
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,520
Stop selling drugs to my son.

353
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,560
Forbidding me is pointless.

354
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,440
Your son is really stubborn.

355
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,080
You'd better deal with your son
before he becomes an addict.

356
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,240
You know very well
how potent our merchandise is.

357
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,160
After a taste, anybody would be hooked.

358
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,240
I wonder why she chose to take part
in Miss Noppamas.

359
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,040
I don't know either.
Why don't you ask if you're curious?

360
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,160
-You ask.
-But you're the one who's curious.

361
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,600
-You're also curious.
-You're the one who's curious.

362
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,880
What are you gossiping about?

363
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,200
We aren't gossiping. We're just curious

364
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,480
what could have gotten into you
and driven you to join the contest?

365
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,240
Nothing got into me.

366
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,120
I needed the money. Is that clear?

367
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,080
Yes, crystal clear. My bad.

368
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,880
Everyone was saying that
you were such a knockout.

369
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,600
If ma'am hadn't made a scene on the stage,
you'd have won the title of Miss Noppamas.

370
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,280
Our boss lady
is quite a beauty, isn't she?

371
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,920
-Precisely.
-Stop bringing it up.

372
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,760
I want to forget about it.

373
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,880
-I got it.
-I'm sorry.

374
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Can you go over the documents again?

375
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,880
Okay.

376
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,080
-Maiseek, take over for me.
-All right.

377
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,880
Have you thoroughly checked
all the documents?

378
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,720
Has Kwan signed all the required pages?

379
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,080
I don't want to go back and forth,
wasting time.

380
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,920
Check carefully.

381
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,320
-All good.
-Is that everything?

382
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,160
Put them in the folder
and we'll get going.

383
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,880
-Are you sure that's everything?
-Yes.

384
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,160
Thank you for bringing in
a lump sum for me.

385
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,040
Now don't leave the house, understand?

386
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,120
Maiseek. Sumlee.

387
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,280
-Come over here.
-Yes, ma'am?

388
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,320
Keep an eye on your boss lady.

389
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,840
If she runs off, you two are fired.

390
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,480
You'll also be barred from setting foot
in this house, you hear me?

391
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,360
-Loud and clear.
-You can count on us.

392
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,360
The two of us will take good care of Tai.
We won't let her leave our sight.

393
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,400
-What he said.
-Good.

394
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,720
Let's go, Kong.
We shouldn't keep them waiting.

395
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,160
This must be why

396
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,920
my left eye has been twitching
for the past few days.

397
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,160
A windfall is coming my way.

398
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,920
Don't go anywhere, got it?

399
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,960
Let's go.

400
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,440
I'm in a good mood.

401
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,920
I'm sorry.

402
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,440
It's all right. It's just a property.

403
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,880
At least the money will go
to Mom's savings.

404
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,480
I've got your back.

405
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,640
I'll be scouring
for Mrs. Maratee's photos.

406
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,600
Thank you, Phu.

407
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,520
-See you in Bangkok.
-See you there.

408
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,280
Aren't you coming with me
to see the two of them off?

409
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,200
I have an errand to run.

410
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,880
Have a safe journey.

411
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,120
See you later.

412
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,720
I'll be going then.

413
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,199
POWER OF ATTORNEY

414
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,639
Ms. Kwanruetai, the owner of the deed,
couldn't come,

415
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,960
so she signed over the power of attorney?

416
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,600
She's otherwise engaged.

417
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,639
I'm her mother, and he's my son, Kongphop.

418
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,800
Rest assured, this isn't a scam.

419
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,840
Did my daughter miss a page?

420
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,440
No, she didn't.

421
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,720
Here's the check.

422
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,920
PAYEE: MRS. MANEE PITAKDEVHA
AMOUNT: 580,000 BAHT

423
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,200
Why didn't we meet
at the land office to transfer it?

424
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,080
My employer is in no hurry.

425
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,040
Please sign the receipt.

426
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,800
AMOUNT:
FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND

427
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,840
Are we done here?

428
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,880
I'll be heading out now.

429
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,080
Yes, we're done.

430
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,440
-Thank you.
-No problem, sir.

431
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,400
Do I have to finalize
the transfer at the land office?

432
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,680
Don't worry. I'll handle the rest.
You can go back to work.

433
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,120
-Please excuse me then.
-Thank you.

434
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,280
I'm calling about the house
by the pond that's for sale.

435
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,160
What's your asking price?

436
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,600
Oh, can't you lower it?
There's no road in and out of the area.

437
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,360
I can't lower the price.
We already set it very low.

438
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,560
What's more,
the property is not landlocked.

439
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,760
Oh, okay.

440
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,640
Hello?

441
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,960
The house transaction is settled.

442
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,480
Thank you very much.

443
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,360
I was afraid we might be too late.

444
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,760
What made you want to buy that house?

445
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,280
Your family already owns
gigantic family homes.

446
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,000
Are you using it as a hiding place
for your young lover?

447
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,360
You may be quiet,
but you've got game, friend.

448
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,000
Park, I'm hanging up.

449
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,040
Thank you for your help.
I'll transfer you the money.

450
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,720
Tai, please get back in the house.

451
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,000
What? I'm just seeing you off.

452
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,520
-If you lie, the house is on fire.
-Yours is on fire.

453
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,400
Just leave, will you?

454
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,920
Sumlee, why don't you go?
I'll stay with Tai.

455
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,840
I should stay.
You can't take her on in a fight.

456
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,040
Whoever stays gets no pay.

457
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,200
-I'll go.
-I'll go.

458
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,080
Both of you should go.

459
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,600
You're planning to escape, aren't you?

460
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,560
Even with you two here,
do you think you can stop me?

461
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,800
-Why don't we just go?
-Fine, we're leaving.

462
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,480
Let's go.

463
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:10,520
URGENT SALE

464
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,000
What are you doing here?

465
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,760
Your mother made quite a mess here.

466
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,200
I stopped by to clean it up.

467
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,320
This is not your concern.

468
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,000
Do you even know

469
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,200
how much this house means to me?

470
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,400
It's my safe haven.

471
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,600
If only you hadn't come into my life,
hadn't followed me here,

472
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,120
this house would still be mine.
It wouldn't have been sold by Mom.

473
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,480
Tai.

474
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,320
I really want to know.

475
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,080
What is it that you want from me?

476
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,800
Why are you messing with me?

477
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,240
I just want to help you.

478
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,760
That's not necessary!

479
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,280
I don't want your help.
Go help other people.

480
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,920
Since I met you,

481
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,920
my life has become a complete mess,
all because of you.

482
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,600
I'm begging you.

483
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,720
Just leave me alone.

484
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,440
I can't do that.

485
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,720
I'm worried about you.

486
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,760
I want to help you.

487
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,680
I want to see you happy like before.

488
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,760
I don't understand

489
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,840
why I worry so much about you either.

490
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,920
What are you saying?

491
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,600
A doctor's words are as hard
to understand as their handwriting.

492
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,360
I don't want to lose…

493
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,760
I don't want to lose our friendship.

494
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,040
I want to see you again.

495
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,440
Maiseek.

496
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,440
What's up with you? Where's the ice cream?

497
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,160
Are you still concerned about food?
Ma'am is here.

498
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,600
-What? Ma'am is here?
-That's right.

499
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,400
Tai hasn't come back yet.

500
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,480
Exactly. We'll be getting
a serving of foot instead of ice cream.

501
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,760
-You go hold her off.
-I got it.

502
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,040
Ma'am, why are you back so quickly?

503
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,680
It's so goddamn hot.

504
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,720
Why don't you sit down and rest?

505
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,160
-What's all this?
-Come.

506
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,280
-Come and sit.
-Why are you touching me?

507
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,640
Please sit here.
The breeze is nice and refreshing.

508
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,160
-Hands off. Jeez.
-I'll get you some water.

509
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,440
What has gotten into you?
What's with the special treatment?

510
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,600
Well…

511
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,080
Where's Kwan?

512
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,600
In her room.

513
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,920
Ma'am, where are you going? Ma'am.

514
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,960
Ma'am.

515
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,480
I still look so manly in this pajamas.
How am I going to fool her?

516
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,760
I'm so fired.

517
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,840
Kwan!

518
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,600
Kwan!

519
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,080
Kwan, where are you? Kwan!

520
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,040
Kwan!

521
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,160
Kwan!

522
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,280
Open up.

523
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,320
-Did Kwan go out?
-Yes.

524
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,600
She went out right after you left.

525
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,720
Kwan!

526
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,240
Open up.

527
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,400
Good luck to you, Maiseek.
I'm leaving. I have things to do.

528
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,840
-Open up.
-Mom.

529
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,680
-Kwan, I said open up.
-Mom.

530
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,040
She might be sleeping.

531
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,360
Do you really believe Sumlee?

532
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,840
That girl must have gone out
to meet the pretty doctor.

533
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,840
Kwan! I'm telling you to open the door.

534
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,360
I'm telling you to open the door.

535
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,920
What's the matter, Mom?

536
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,680
Where'd you go?

537
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,960
I was tired,
so I came up here to take a nap.

538
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,760
Did you manage to sell the house?

539
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,160
Poor girl. You have nowhere else to go.

540
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,400
You must stay here
to serve me until I die.

541
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,160
You deserve this. Your birth
completely ruined my life, you bad luck.

542
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,760
Kwan, where did you go?

543
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,560
Did you go to the house?

544
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,200
Maiseek, you can come out.

545
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,920
Are you an idiot or what?

546
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,840
Putting on my clothes?
Look at your belly hanging out.

547
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,080
If I hadn't climbed up in time,
you'd have been done for.

548
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,040
By the way, why is your mom so fixated on
the idea of you being involved with him?

549
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,160
Could it be that you
and Dr. Chat are in love?

550
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,600
-Shut it.
-Oops.

551
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,480
I think…

552
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,600
you'd make a good couple.

553
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,080
-Hey.
-Mercy.

554
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,480
A guy with a sweet face

555
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,720
and a manly girl.

556
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,560
Aren't you a pair?

557
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,880
-You're so dead.
-Ouch.

558
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,480
-What are you even saying?
-Ouch. I'm sorry.

559
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,120
-Don't ever say that again.
-I won't.

560
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,480
I'm sorry.

561
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,640
I won't forgive you
any time soon, you annoying doctor.

562
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,680
DEED OF LAND

563
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,680
Thank you, friend.

564
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,160
What is all this? I'm confused.

565
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,400
You paid the mother, but why is the deed
still in the name of the daughter?

566
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,960
It's not that big of a deal.
I was the instigator of their argument.

567
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,920
Her mother forced her
to sell the property, so I bought it.

568
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,400
What an impressive display of generosity.

569
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,560
It was my fault.

570
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,760
Perhaps you're trying to buy her love.

571
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,880
What nonsense.

572
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,280
Eat up. This meal is on me.

573
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,720
You really like her, don't you?

574
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,560
I'm much older than her.
She's only what? 18? 19?

575
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,240
You didn't answer my question.

576
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,400
Let's not talk about the impossible.

577
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,200
Well, then.

578
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,320
What's in there?

579
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,800
Photos of contestant number nine,
Krongkaew Arada.

580
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,120
-You don't want them, do you?
-Wait.

581
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,000
Let me smack you just this once.

582
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,160
I'm curious to know what's more stubborn,
your head or your mouth.

583
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,760
Do you want them or not?

584
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,560
You're so eager.

585
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,960
All right, take it.
I'm taking pity on you.

586
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,760
Kong, are you done?

587
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,560
-I'm done.
-Hurry.

588
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,840
Hey, what's going on?

589
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,080
Where are you going, Kwan?

590
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,560
I'm delivering the meal boxes, Mom.

591
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,560
Remember the punishment?
You are still grounded.

592
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,520
Do you not understand?

593
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,320
Mom, if I had to do everything by myself,
I wouldn't be able to get it all done.

594
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,480
I'll be going with her. Don't you worry.

595
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,600
Make sure to keep a close eye
on your sister.

596
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,720
Don't let her prance around
flirting with guys, got it?

597
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,760
Noted, Mom. We'll be going now.

598
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,880
As the saying goes,
"Having a daughter is a curse."

599
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,640
I totally agree with it.

600
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,600
Let's go.

601
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,120
You do the meal delivery,
I'll return the laundry.

602
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,400
We'll meet up at Ah Go after.

603
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,720
Aren't you coming to stand guard over me?

604
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,160
I trust you more than myself.

605
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,320
Is that an extra set of meal boxes?

606
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,720
No extras. I've got the correct number.

607
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,640
I'm going.

608
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,080
Watch out!

609
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,400
Hey, you.

610
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,360
You again? How much longer
do you plan on stirring up trouble?

611
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,520
Isn't my life messed up enough?

612
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,720
I have something important to discuss.

613
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,520
Stop saying it's important.

614
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,600
Pon is dead.

615
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,640
I know that.

616
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,680
They're really meeting up in secret.

617
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,960
If ma'am finds out, she's dead meat.

618
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,440
We both know that.
So keep your mouth zipped, okay?

619
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,960
I love Tai as much as you do.
I won't say a word.

620
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,200
From what I have observed,

621
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,640
these two seem to like each other,

622
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,040
but both of them are stubborn as a mule.

623
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,720
The day has finally come for you, Kwan.

624
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,440
The police concluded
that the causes of death

625
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,880
were acute heart failure
and respiratory arrest.

626
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,760
But I don't believe that.

627
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,800
You know who the perpetrators were,
don't you?

628
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,280
What did Pon say to you?

629
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,440
I don't know.

630
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,400
I know that you know.

631
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,160
You're trying to hide the truth.

632
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,840
I don't know.
I said I don't know and I mean it.

633
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,000
You're wasting my precious
money-making time.

634
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,760
You and Pon were thick as thieves.

635
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,000
Pon was murdered,
yet you aren't going to do anything?

636
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,160
Hey, there. You must have watched
way too many dramas.

637
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,880
Who'd have such power in this day and age?

638
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,200
You know full well.

639
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,160
You even brought up
the Red Dragon gang not long ago.

640
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,760
Shouldn't you be fighting
to get justice for Pon?

641
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,920
But what are you doing now?
You're hiding the truth.

642
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,520
Do you realize that you're letting them
go unpunished by doing this?

643
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,040
What do you know?

644
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,280
The life of the poor like us
is barely worth a dime.

645
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,240
We also live in a time
when bullets are cheap.

646
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,120
Don't think that an army doctor
like yourself can give us protection.

647
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,040
Hear this. It's not possible.

648
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,000
If you want to stay and work in this town
for a long time, stay out of our business.

649
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,960
You should just focus on your job.

650
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,400
The justice that you're seeking
doesn't exist in this world.

651
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,600
Where did you go?

652
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,200
I was out having a chat
with some friends, Dad.

653
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,920
Really? Chatting with your friends?

654
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,360
Were you using drugs?

655
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,480
Come on, using what?

656
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,840
Do you take me for a fool?

657
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,160
I know all that's happening
in this district.

658
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,520
You're a goddamn failure.

659
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,960
-You couldn't graduate. You have no job.
-Dad.

660
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,120
Not only do you frequent the casino,
but you're also a drug user!

661
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,480
How do I deal with you?

662
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,040
Please, Dad.

663
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,120
Please take a minute to calm down.

664
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,520
I was using a little just for fun.

665
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,240
For fun?

666
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,600
Don't you know that the damn drug
gets you hooked on the first try?

667
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,920
I'm sending you to rehab

668
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,640
to get fucking treated.

669
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,960
Please don't send me there, Dad.

670
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,720
-I'll be a laughing stock. Please, Dad.
-You are fucking going!

671
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,720
-I said you're fucking going.
-I don't want to go, Dad.

672
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,600
-Dad.
-What's with the commotion?

673
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,320
-Mom, please.
-Hush.

674
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,040
Dad beat me up, Mom.

675
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,440
-What the hell?
-What are you doing to my son?

676
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,880
You're enabling him. Don't you know that?

677
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,160
Mark my words,
he'll turn into a thug someday.

678
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,120
No. I'll never become like that, Mom.

679
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,640
Why would your own son turn into that?
It's not true, Mom.

680
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,000
Right. You won't turn into some thug

681
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,880
because you'll be beaten to death today.

682
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,760
-No!
-Go to your room. Now.

683
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,840
-I'll talk to your dad.
-You'd better quit using it.

684
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,960
If I catch you using,
no one can fucking save you.

685
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,840
There must be a misunderstanding.

686
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,040
Do you know what? Our son is going
to overdose because of your enabling.

687
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,880
Where are you going?

688
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:00,920
Caught you!

689
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,760
What are you playing at, Jak?

690
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,960
I thought you'd like my playful greeting
since your girlfriend is barely legal.

691
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,600
You shouldn't believe what Phu said.

692
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,000
Are you saying I'm a liar?

693
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,400
Hello, Petch.

694
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,240
Defendant, you may now plead your case.

695
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,960
Have they corrupted you as well?

696
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,400
Saruj, you didn't fall for what Phu said
like everyone else, did you?

697
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,200
She just graduated high school.
Seriously, what trick did you use?

698
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,960
Saruj!

699
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:44,080
Petch, Saruj, how about we make it
a competition to date someone young?

700
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,680
They're pretty lively, don't you agree?

701
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,040
No response.

702
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,160
Awkward.

703
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,200
That's our champion.

704
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,960
What champion?

705
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,160
I'll go say hi to Great-Grandma Orn.

706
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,800
Bro, you're acting all shy.

707
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,720
It must be true then, Phu.

708
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,000
When are you going to
introduce your girlfriend to me?

709
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,440
You should ignore what Phu said.

710
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,840
He makes a lot of assumptions.

711
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,760
I heard about this from Jak actually.

712
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,760
That guy is even worse.

713
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,920
He's fond of telling tall tales
and elaborate fantasies.

714
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,600
Mind your words.

715
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,360
You shouldn't be
badmouthing him like that.

716
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,000
But it's the truth, Great-Grandma.

717
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,880
He wasn't even there, but he went
and exaggerated what he heard from Phu.

718
01:00:54,840 --> 01:01:00,520
As the old saying goes,
"There's no smoke without fire."

719
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,520
Right.

720
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,800
Fine, I'll stop teasing.

721
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,440
I have always trusted your decisions.

722
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,880
I trust that you'll find a nice girl
who treats you well.

723
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,960
Thank you for your blessing.

724
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,400
-Great-Grandma.
-Yes?

725
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,840
I want to know more about Mrs. Maratee.

726
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,720
What did you find out?

727
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,640
I'm not 100% sure.

728
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,480
I met a woman.

729
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,680
She's from Bangkok.

730
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,280
She followed her new husband
to Chiang Rai.

731
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,800
She has an air of superiority
about her and is quite arrogant.

732
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,160
She's a long-standing customer
of Arada Boutique.

733
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,600
She hates doctors with a passion.

734
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,560
Especially male doctors.

735
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,200
She went ballistic when her daughter
joined Miss Noppamas as a contestant.

736
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,720
She went so far as to make a scene
on the stage to stop her daughter.

737
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,840
The stage name that Mrs. Arada
gave that daughter was Krongkaew.

738
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,760
That woman is definitely her.

739
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,520
It must be her.

740
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,960
It seems Maratee still holds a grudge.

741
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,640
She hasn't gotten over it.

742
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,040
This is only my speculation.

743
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,320
Her appearance doesn't quite resemble

744
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,040
the photo of Mrs. Maratee
that you gave me.

745
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,400
I remember now.

746
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,440
Someone attacked her with acid.

747
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,960
She could have had plastic surgery.

748
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,760
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

749
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,280
I never knew that.

750
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,680
That will only complicate things.

751
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,120
Take me to see her.

752
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:59,360
Whatever surgery she might have had,
I'm positive I can still recognize her.

753
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,040
We shouldn't be hasty.
It's only a possibility that she's her.

754
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,720
We don't have enough proof.

755
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,640
It could all be a coincidence.

756
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,360
I asked Phu to help gather more photos,
articles, and info on Mrs. Maratee.

757
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,600
We need more proof
to ascertain that it's her.

758
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,720
Great-Grandma,

759
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,640
I want to know more about Mrs. Maratee.

760
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,840
Can you tell me
what you remember about her?

761
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,320
Both the good and the bad.

762
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,480
I need to know everything.

763
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,720
Here you go.

764
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,080
It took you a long time to come out.

765
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,320
Since you don't like seeing my face,

766
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,680
I was waiting for you
to finish your meal first.

767
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,480
You're so insolent.

768
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:29,160
You should eat more. You've lost weight.

769
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,160
I sent Sumlee to find out.

770
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,360
That doctor took a leave of absence
and went back to Bangkok.

771
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,200
Why are you telling me that?

772
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,680
I see.

773
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,640
So you knew already
that your beau was going away?

774
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,720
Mom. Will you stop accusing
me of being a slut?

775
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,520
I'm reaching my limit.

776
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,160
Are you reaching your limit?

777
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,240
What are you going to do to me then?

778
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,600
Are you going to slap me or what?

779
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,120
I wouldn't dare.

780
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,960
At best, I'll run away from here.

781
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,520
Kwan.

782
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,720
Kong, did you see that?

783
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,440
Did you hear what she said?

784
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,080
She's planning to run away
with that doctor.

785
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,360
Exactly as I predicted.

786
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,480
I have news for you.

787
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,960
Don't go falling for their good looks.
I was once a victim of it!

788
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,880
Those handsome doctors
from the Jutathep family

789
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,240
are all frauds.

790
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:46,280
When the mask comes off,
they show their true colors as playboys.

791
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,640
I wouldn't have had
the fucking fall from grace

792
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:52,840
if not for the two of them.

793
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,320
Do you hear me? I despise them.

794
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,080
I despise them. That fucking bitch
and her asshole husband!

795
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,360
-I hate their guts.
-Mom.

796
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,280
-Mom, please calm down.
-Damn it!

797
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,320
-You fucking hear me?
-Mom.

798
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,200
They ruined my life.

799
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,080
-Do you hear me?
-Mom.

800
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,600
-Dammit.
-It's all over.

801
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,600
That goddamn couple.

802
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,160
I hate their guts.

803
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,040
Let go of me.

804
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,120
Do you hear what I'm saying?

805
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,920
Why don't you get some rest?

806
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,920
The necklace is an antique.

807
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,760
This finely crafted piece is a rare find.

808
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,640
-What are you saying?
-It's your birthday gift.

809
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,080
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

810
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,320
I was in charge of the house renovation.

811
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,960
It's not like the house
is only worth a hundred or two.

812
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,400
Don't worry.
It barely put a dent in Chat's pocket.

813
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,560
You didn't even gift it to me yourself.
What a coward.

814
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,000
I wanted to gift it to you myself,
but I was afraid you wouldn't accept it.

815
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:41,040
Starting today, I'll stay away from you.

816
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,600
I'm going to submit
a request for a transfer.

817
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,480
Happy birthday.

818
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,960
Mom!

819
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:40,040
