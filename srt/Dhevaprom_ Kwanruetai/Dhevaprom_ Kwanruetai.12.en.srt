1
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,640
She's our little sister.

2
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,400
How can I be your sister?

3
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,560
Because we share the same dad.

4
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,120
This is Lt. Col. Parkpipat,
my second brother.

5
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,120
Kong.

6
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,040
Is that Attawit?

7
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,960
I've been meaning to ask if you heard

8
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,960
that your mom has become
Mr. Songpol's mistress.

9
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
My life has to be better than this.

10
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,040
I refuse to grow old and die
as some hick woman.

11
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,280
I've been wanting to see her face.

12
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,640
What a shameless, husband-stealing bitch.

13
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,080
Manee, others might not
be a match for you, but I am.

14
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,000
You have no idea what's coming.

15
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,360
-Let's go, Mian.
-Okay.

16
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,400
I'm glad that you volunteered
to help the army.

17
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,480
It's what I should have
been doing all along.

18
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,400
I was hesitant because I didn't want
to cause trouble for my family.

19
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,320
You made the right choice.

20
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,600
We are suppressing them
for future generations.

21
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,040
How are things with you and Kwan?

22
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,160
To be frank, she ended things with me.

23
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,520
But I'm not going to give up.

24
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,000
I love her.

25
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,959
She'll put up a fight.

26
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
She'll never do anything to hurt Mom.

27
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,240
Let's not talk about it now.

28
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,800
I won't give up so easily.

29
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,640
After I've fulfilled
my military duty, we shall see.

30
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,560
I also don't want to lose
a brother-in-law like you.

31
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,200
I want to help.

32
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,040
Let's go.

33
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,840
Ah Go, is Mom with Mr. Songpol?

34
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,880
Where is that house located?

35
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,880
Mom.

36
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,880
I've missed you so much.

37
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,440
Not now.

38
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,240
I can't wait until tonight.

39
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
It's still bright out.

40
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,360
-Hey.
-Yes?

41
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,800
What if other people see us?

42
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,480
If you're afraid other people might see,

43
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,720
why don't we go inside?

44
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Come now.

45
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,520
Bad timing, as always.

46
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,120
Please excuse me.
I need to answer this call.

47
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,000
By all means, go ahead.

48
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,760
I'll be waiting for you in the house.

49
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,440
All right.

50
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,960
Got it.

51
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,280
I'll be on my way.

52
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
See you.

53
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,720
Hold on, Kevin.

54
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,520
Can you tell Big Boss that
I'll confirm the news ASAP?

55
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,800
He can rest easy.

56
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,480
Okay, see you later.

57
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,280
Kevin?

58
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,520
Big Boss?

59
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,000
It smells delicious.

60
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,520
Come eat, it's still piping hot.

61
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,960
Well, honey.

62
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,840
I won't be able to stay for the meal.

63
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,800
An urgent matter came up.

64
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,920
It's all right, I understand.

65
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,360
You're the best wife ever.

66
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,560
I've made a great pick for a life partner.

67
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,320
After I've taken care of things,
I'll rush back to see you.

68
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,600
Don't forget to wash up and spray on
a nice perfume while you wait for me.

69
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,240
I'll do that.

70
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,559
Everything looks delicious.
I'll be going now.

71
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,960
Why is he in such a rush?

72
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,280
He didn't even close the gate.

73
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,000
Ma'am, it's this house.

74
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,640
-Is it this one?
-Yes, this one.

75
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,480
-Are you sure?
-I am sure, ma'am.

76
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,200
Let me see the bitch
who doesn't know her place.

77
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,120
Sunant.

78
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,040
Why do you look so familiar?

79
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,800
Maratee.

80
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,680
Hey, where are you going?

81
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,760
-What are you doing?
-Stay put.

82
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,320
Let go of me. Why are you gripping
my arms, you stinky old hag?

83
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,080
If smelling nice equals husband stealer,
I'll pick stinky armpits, shameless bitch.

84
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,920
You changed your name, but you haven't
ditched your old habits.

85
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,040
I detest you with a passion, Maratee.

86
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,640
Why did you come here?

87
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,640
I should be the one asking
how you came to live here.

88
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,440
This is my house.

89
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,280
You really are his mistress?

90
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,760
Who's the mistress?

91
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,520
You, obviously.

92
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,920
I'm his one and only legal wife.

93
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,080
What a pitiful woman.

94
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,280
You can only come second to me.

95
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,720
Could you not have seduced any other man?

96
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
We shared a husband when we were young.

97
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,440
And even now, we are still
sharing the same husband.

98
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,320
Shut your mouth, Sunant.

99
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,680
So what? You have no right
to order me around.

100
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,000
Scared I would spread your secret?

101
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,160
I even thought
a woman such as M.L. Maratee

102
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,000
must have already
become the wife of some noble.

103
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,280
But in fact, you're just like me,
hiding away in the countryside.

104
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,840
I'm telling you to shut your mouth.

105
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,720
I won't stop. I'm going to talk.

106
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,080
You must be aware that
he's married and has a child.

107
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,920
Yet, you're still shameless
enough to seduce him.

108
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,400
Damn you.

109
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,600
Let go of me.

110
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,640
Let go!

111
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,480
Mr. Songpol loves me.

112
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,240
He bought this house for me.

113
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,440
Every single one of his mistresses
is given a house, mind you.

114
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,040
Also, signing a marriage certificate
is the same old cliched trick.

115
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,080
The registrar's name is Budt.

116
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,200
He's a TV repairman
who lives next door to me.

117
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,360
Liar!

118
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,280
Shameless fool!

119
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
Let me tell you this.

120
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,560
He's never serious with any of you.

121
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,680
When he wants a woman in his bed,
he gives her a house.

122
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,880
When he's bored, he kicks her out
and seizes back the house.

123
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,520
For a mistress like yourself,
he'll kick you out in under a month.

124
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,680
You're lying.

125
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,760
He said he's already divorced you.

126
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,800
We've signed a marriage certificate.

127
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,280
Did he? You stupid fool.

128
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,040
Do you actually believe him?

129
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
You are a goddamn fool, really.

130
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,160
Why didn't you put your experience
as General Pinit's mistress to good use?

131
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,640
It's all a lie.

132
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,160
There was never a divorce.

133
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,720
When he dies,

134
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,240
we won't get a penny from him.

135
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,120
What are you saying?
You're definitely lying.

136
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,240
It's not possible. I don't believe you.

137
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,400
You're so pathetic.

138
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,920
You must have slept with him, haven't you?

139
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,640
You'd do well to remember this
in your featherbrain.

140
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,240
Mr. Songpol will never divorce me.

141
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,240
Because I'm the mother of his only son.

142
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,600
When he gets bored, you'll end up
abandoned like an old dog.

143
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,600
If you want to stay in this house,
be my guest.

144
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,320
I'll think of it as charity
for a homeless person.

145
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,160
-Let's go, Mian.
-Not yet, ma'am.

146
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,800
Are you not going to slap her even once?
I'm so ready for it.

147
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,960
Why should I hurt my hand slapping her?

148
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,960
I've come a long way from that low point.

149
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,720
I'm the legal wife.
I have a marriage certificate.

150
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,960
I'll simply let the mistress keep fooling
herself with that fake certificate.

151
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,640
-Let's go.
-Yes, ma'am.

152
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,320
You're no other than a mistress.

153
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,160
Sunant!

154
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,600
My guess is something important prompted
those two to come back to Chiang Rai.

155
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,920
Hey, are you listening?

156
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,920
Isn't that Kwan?

157
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,160
You're right.

158
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,000
Why is she heading that way?

159
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,560
Sir.

160
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,520
Let's talk inside.

161
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,840
Don't be alarmed.

162
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,040
I just finished a job.

163
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,720
Who did you take out this time?

164
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,880
Don't worry about it. It's insignificant.

165
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,240
I have a more pressing matter.

166
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,760
That's why I asked you to come here.

167
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,560
What's the problem?

168
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,200
Our mole sent a message.

169
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,040
The border patrol and ground troops will
be raiding our production base tonight.

170
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,280
-Does Big Boss know this?
-He knows.

171
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,960
They changed their plan.

172
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,400
They were planning to do a raid tomorrow.

173
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,079
They can't fool us though.

174
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,960
Big Boss is planning
a welcome party for them.

175
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,960
You guys can't be reckless.

176
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,240
The troops are well-trained.

177
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,160
They've been through battles
and mastered strategies.

178
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,560
No matter how skilled they are,

179
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,560
they won't be able
to escape from our trap.

180
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,800
They'll die a dishonorable death.

181
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,280
A trap?

182
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,720
They have no idea
the entrance will become their graves.

183
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,960
So you've planned it all out?

184
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,120
Big Boss wants to know
the exact raid time.

185
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,720
It's your job to find out.

186
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,880
Gosh.

187
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,120
That's classified info.
I can't guarantee it.

188
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,320
You have extensive connections
with the police and army generals.

189
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,960
How could you not find out?

190
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,760
Must I remind you that
we're in the same boat?

191
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Should anything go wrong,
you're no less done for.

192
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,960
We'll draw them into the camp

193
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,680
and take them all out.

194
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,960
With the weaponry we have,

195
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,200
we could easily
decimate their entire company.

196
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,720
Why don't you wait outside?

197
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,720
No, I'm coming with you.

198
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,240
That's Kwan.

199
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,200
Are you looking for a room?

200
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,120
What's the commotion?

201
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,080
There are dead bodies inside.

202
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,960
Don't let anyone enter.

203
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,040
-I'm calling the police.
-Okay.

204
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,080
Who did you take out this time?

205
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,440
Don't worry about it. It's insignificant.

206
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,800
Wait, aren't you going to count the money?

207
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
I trust you.

208
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,000
They must have been silenced
by the drug cartel.

209
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,360
Could they have been tipped off?

210
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,400
Kwan can't possibly be planning
to follow them, right?

211
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,480
This doesn't feel right.
I'll call to let Poom know, just in case.

212
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,920
Let's go.

213
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,360
Big Boss is planning
a welcome party for them.

214
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,280
You guys can't be reckless.

215
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,680
The troops are well-trained.

216
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,560
They've been through battles
and mastered strategies.

217
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,840
No matter how skilled they are,

218
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,960
they won't be able
to escape from our trap.

219
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,040
They'll die a dishonorable death.

220
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,520
They have no idea
the entrance will become their graves.

221
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,640
So you've planned it all out?

222
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,560
We'll draw them into the camp

223
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,080
and take them all out.

224
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,400
With the weaponry we have,

225
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,600
we could easily
decimate their entire company.

226
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,280
I couldn't reach Poom.

227
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,520
They must have gone deep into the forest.

228
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,960
Can you give Uncle Phee a call?

229
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,240
I'm worried about Kwan.

230
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,400
If she's following the drug cartel,
she could be in danger.

231
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,560
I'll do that.

232
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,960
There's an armed group setting up camp.

233
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,800
The location must be correct.

234
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,560
Get ready. Wait for the order to charge.

235
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,720
We'll catch them by surprise.

236
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,120
Yes, sir.

237
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,320
Why does the fuel have to run out now?

238
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,560
What did Uncle Phee say?

239
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,040
He said he'll contact his friends
in the Royal Thai Army.

240
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,880
Uncle Phee, Petch, and Jak will be making
their way up here as soon as they can.

241
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,160
Why did they park and go on foot?

242
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,960
Could it be a trap?

243
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,600
Roger that.

244
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,800
There has been a change of plan.

245
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,920
We have a civilian joining us
on this mission.

246
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,360
Who is it?

247
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,480
Our sister.

248
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,400
Tai?

249
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,760
There's no way.
My sister never defies my orders.

250
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,480
Why is she following us?

251
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,800
She's coming from another entry.

252
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,960
According to our intelligence,
both Attawait and Pilai were murdered.

253
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,520
Park and Ms. Kej saw Kwan
following a pickup truck.

254
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,600
Our troops found Kwan's motorbike

255
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,600
left with no fuel by the forest edge.

256
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,440
I think Tai must have
found out something, so she rushed here.

257
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,640
If she's following them,

258
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,960
why would they choose that entry point?

259
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,360
It's a longer route
with no vehicle access.

260
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,560
You have to go on foot for half an hour.

261
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,640
Could our raid plan have been leaked

262
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,880
and they're turning the tables on us?

263
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,560
I'll go check it out.

264
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,960
It's almost time for the raid though.

265
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,680
Our plan is to attack on all fronts.

266
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,400
I know that.

267
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,560
I won't be long.

268
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,720
Can I bring a radio soldier with me?

269
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,320
In case it's a trap, as he suggested.

270
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,840
I give you half an hour.

271
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,440
If you're not back by then,
we'll proceed as planned.

272
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,240
Yes, sir.

273
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,360
I'm going with him.

274
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,520
I'm worried about Tai.
I want to see for myself.

275
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,760
I can't wait for you.
I'm pressed for time.

276
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,960
If you think I'll slow you down,
you're wrong.

277
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Army medics get the same training
as other soldiers.

278
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,480
I'll watch your back.

279
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,480
Kwan was here.

280
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,280
She left us clues to follow.

281
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,040
These must be their footsteps.

282
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,280
They were here not long ago.

283
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,520
Is Tai still safe?

284
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
I think so.

285
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,240
I have a feeling that Kwan
wants us to see something.

286
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,760
-Let's keep moving.
-Let's go.

287
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,200
This is a strategic location.

288
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,200
Deep in the forest with multiple entries.

289
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,880
They're armed to the teeth.

290
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,400
What's in that box?

291
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,960
Is it explosives?

292
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,400
Can I have the radio, please?

293
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,840
Alpha Two, come in.
The radio operator has been shot.

294
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,040
Alpha Two.

295
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,400
Tai?

296
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,360
Kong, are you okay?

297
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
Just a scratch.

298
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,520
We need to contact the troops
or they'll fall into their trap.

299
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,160
The radio is out.

300
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,400
It's too late, the troops are charging in.

301
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,320
I'm too late.

302
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,160
You two wait here for your safety.

303
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,800
I'm heading back to the medic unit.

304
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,800
Wait.

305
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,960
You're injured. You wait here.

306
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,560
Kwan, are you going with Dr. Chat?

307
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,120
No,
I'm going to plant explosives for them.

308
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,560
Have you lost your mind?

309
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,960
They're planting explosives
by the entrance.

310
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,680
There will be casualties.

311
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,160
If we don't attack from the back,
the troops have no chance.

312
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,400
Why don't you take His Grace
to wait at the medic unit?

313
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,280
I'll handle this side.

314
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,880
I won't allow you to take on
something so risky by yourself.

315
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,080
I won't have it either.

316
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,520
You two don't know about explosives,

317
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,920
but I do.

318
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,520
I'll take care of this.

319
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,960
Cover!

320
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,120
We're under attack.
Requesting immediate reinforcement.

321
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,239
The soldiers were hit by explosives
at the entrance. Several casualties.

322
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,639
They are in disarray.

323
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,960
Tell our men to go out and kill them all.

324
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Yes, sir.

325
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,040
Make sure none of them make it out alive.

326
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,720
Kwan, are you hurt?

327
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,120
Kong!

328
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,280
Kwan.

329
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,320
Kong.

330
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,920
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm good.

331
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,880
Kong.

332
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,720
Tai, are you okay?

333
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,440
I'm fine.

334
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,480
But Kong's wound got hit.
He's badly injured.

335
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,520
Let me see.

336
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,480
I'm all right.

337
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,320
Let's split up to plant explosives
around their factory.

338
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,360
-We don't have time.
-Sure you're okay?

339
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,880
I've got this.

340
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,040
Let's go.

341
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,960
Let's go.

342
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,840
Their target is possibly not only
to destroy our production base.

343
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,880
I think they're also aiming
to capture you, Big Boss.

344
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,520
To be on the safe side,
you should get out of here.

345
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Why should I?

346
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,800
Do you not have confidence
that our force can confront them?

347
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,440
That's not the reason, sir.

348
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,840
We can definitely take them on.

349
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,640
But better safe than sorry.

350
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,320
You're our lynchpin, Big Boss.

351
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,160
I'm not going anywhere.

352
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,600
If you fear them that much,
go and deal with them right this minute.

353
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,840
I'm waiting here. I'm not leaving.

354
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,760
All good?

355
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,240
What's that?

356
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,840
Who has blown up the factory?

357
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,960
I don't know.

358
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,760
Didn't you say they couldn't barge in?

359
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,560
Wait here, sir. I'll go have a look.

360
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,320
Are you okay, Kong?

361
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,200
Do you think you can just run away
like this is a playground?

362
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,840
Kong!

363
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,800
Kong!

364
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,640
Watch out!

365
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,760
Dr. Chat.

366
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,480
Please get up.

367
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,840
Dr. Chat.

368
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,200
Dr. Chat.

369
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,640
-Are you okay?
-Tai.

370
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,320
Let's keep going.

371
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,440
Tai!

372
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,560
Dr. Chat.

373
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,360
Dr. Chat.

374
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,120
Dr. Chat.

375
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,440
Dr. Chat, wake up!

376
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,960
Dr. Chat, please wake up!

377
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,280
Dr. Chat!

378
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,880
Hello.

379
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,440
Mian? What's the matter?

380
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,360
That can't be true.

381
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,440
How could my husband
be part of some international drug cartel?

382
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,960
Where did you hear that?

383
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,160
I don't know anything.

384
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,440
They can't seize my assets
or put me in jail. I'm innocent.

385
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,120
Talk to you later. I'll call you back.

386
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,200
Where is your boss?

387
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,320
I don't know, ma'am.

388
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,320
How could you not know?
You're his right-hand man.

389
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,360
I really don't know.

390
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,280
You're covering up for him, aren't you?

391
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,520
What are you doing here?

392
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,040
Getting stuff for Mr. Songpol.

393
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,240
What stuff?

394
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,480
Why are you taking the passport?

395
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,680
Is he running away?

396
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,320
I don't know.

397
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,560
The rumor is true, isn't it?

398
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,520
Is he really part of a drug cartel?

399
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,400
-Sorn!
-Sorn?

400
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,680
What's wrong, Sorn?

401
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,680
-Sorn.
-Help!

402
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,480
-Sorn.
-Sorn!

403
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,160
Sorn, please hang in there.

404
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,720
Anybody, please help.

405
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,440
Sorn!

406
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,640
Sorn!

407
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,600
Give me the drugs.

408
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,720
Sorn!

409
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,920
I want the drugs.

410
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,480
-Sorn!
-Sorn.

411
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,880
Sorn!

412
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,480
Sorn, what's wrong?

413
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,960
Sorn.

414
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,400
-Sorn.
-My stomach hurts.

415
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,840
Sorn.

416
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,640
-Sorn.
-Sorn.

417
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,640
Somchai, what's wrong with Sorn?

418
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,600
He's craving drugs.

419
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,880
What? Are you really on drugs?

420
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,320
Sorn.

421
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,920
Sorn, please hang in there.

422
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,320
You'll be okay.

423
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,920
My head hurts. It goddamn hurts.

424
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,800
Sorn. Is he going to die?

425
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,760
-Watch your mouth. Gosh.
-Sorn!

426
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,520
Sorn!

427
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,640
Go get him the drugs
or his withdrawal could get worse.

428
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,320
Where do I get it?

429
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,360
Maiseek is dead. Boss also forbids
anyone from selling to him.

430
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,960
What? Your boss is a drug dealer?

431
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,600
Please don't let him know
that you found out from me

432
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,240
or he's going to kill me.

433
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,920
Sorn, please hang in there.

434
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,560
Sorn, please hang in there.

435
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,680
-Sorn.
-Stay with him, I'll go get help.

436
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,840
Okay.

437
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,760
Sorn.

438
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,280
Sorn, please hang in there. Sorn.

439
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,280
Sorn.

440
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,840
Sorn, please hang in there.

441
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,920
Anyone, please help.

442
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,360
Sorn.

443
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,880
Sorn.

444
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,160
Sorn.

445
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,160
Sorn. Anyone out there, please help.

446
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,880
Sorn, I'm here. I'm right here.

447
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,360
Please don't leave me. Please.

448
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,840
Please.

449
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,960
I'm right here, Sorn.

450
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,120
Please stay strong.

451
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,080
Sorn.

452
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,080
Sorn.

453
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,600
-Sorn.
-Sorn, I'm so sorry.

454
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,720
-Sorn.
-I'll find someone to help you.

455
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,680
Sorn.

456
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,920
Sorn.

457
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,720
Sorn, please hang in there.

458
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,840
Sak, wait.

459
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,200
Sorn has gone still.
I can't tell if he's dead.

460
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,280
Why are you telling me?
Go tell his damn dad.

461
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,360
Where is Mr. Songpol?

462
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,560
What's taking him so long?

463
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,080
Somchai?

464
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,400
Why did you come?

465
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,600
-Please help Sorn.
-What happened to him?

466
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,320
He's having serious withdrawals.

467
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,800
Why not have his mom
take him to the hospital?

468
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,520
Ma'am packed her clothes and fled.

469
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,400
Please hurry to help Sorn.

470
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,600
Where is Sak?

471
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,840
I don't know.

472
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,160
CHIANG RAI ARMY HOSPITAL

473
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,240
Dr. Chat.

474
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,360
Dr. Chat.

475
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,920
Emergency case.
He has been shot. Prep the OR.

476
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,240
-Don't leave me.
-Yes, Doctor.

477
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,840
Please don't leave me, Dr. Chat.

478
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,560
Please help him.

479
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,760
Don't leave me.

480
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,200
Tai, you can't go in.

481
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,120
Tai.

482
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,120
We'll wait here together.

483
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,680
Sak?

484
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,280
-Get out.
-Don't shoot me.

485
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,560
Wait, ma'am.

486
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,240
What's in the bag?
You're hugging it so tightly.

487
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,320
So what? It's not your concern.
Give it back.

488
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,360
Are you fleeing by yourself, ma'am?

489
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,760
I'm hiding it for my husband.

490
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,680
It's mine. Give it back.

491
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,160
I'm going to tell my husband
to kick you out. Give it back.

492
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,720
Let me borrow it.

493
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,840
Wait! Give it back!

494
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,160
-No heart rate, Doctor.
-CPR.

495
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,240
-Prep the defib.
-On it.

496
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,280
-150 joules.
-150 joules.

497
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,600
All clear.

498
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,920
No heart rate.

499
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,400
-200 joules.
-200 joules.

500
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,600
All clear.

501
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,080
I'm safe now.

502
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,480
And rich.

503
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,840
Stop.

504
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,480
Put the bag down.

505
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,880
Now.

506
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,720
Turn yourself in.

507
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,560
You can't escape.

508
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,720
Sorn.

509
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,800
Sorn!

510
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,840
Sorn!

511
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,680
Hey, kid.

512
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,280
I suggest you turn yourself in.

513
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,080
Trust me.

514
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,840
Please help my son.

515
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,680
Sergeant.

516
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,160
I'm sure Chat will be okay.

517
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,760
Kej.

518
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,920
Petch. Jak.

519
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,520
What is Chat's condition?

520
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,320
He's not out of the operating room yet.

521
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,000
And this is…

522
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,400
This is Kwan.

523
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,520
Kwan, he's our oldest brother, Petch.

524
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,960
Don't bother with the greeting.

525
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,400
My name is Ronnajak. You can call me Jak.

526
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,960
We are Chat's cousins.

527
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,920
Kwan, why are you crying?

528
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,120
It's my fault.

529
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,960
I'm the reason he's in this state.

530
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,880
Don't blame yourself.

531
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,680
I'm sure Chat was happy to do his duty.

532
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,280
It was my idea

533
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,840
to infiltrate their hideout.

534
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,080
Then he put himself

535
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,680
in front of me to take the bullet.

536
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,720
Stop blaming yourself.

537
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,920
It was his desire to protect you.

538
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,960
Right now, why don't we all
pray for Chat's safety?

539
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,240
It's the only thing we can do now.

540
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,640
He's a good man. A good soldier.
He's going to pull through.

541
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,720
The heavens will grant him blessings
to survive and come out stronger.

542
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,880
May I ask if you are Kwanruetai?

543
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,280
The two of us are too different.
We're not meant to be.

544
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,160
Forget who my parents are
and who your mom is.

545
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,520
No Jutathep. No Dhevaprom.

546
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,880
Only the two of us.

547
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,840
We were never meant to be.

548
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,760
Goodbye, Dr. Chat.

549
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,480
Maratee.

550
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,680
