1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Wanwan, you're back.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,440
You're Wanwan's friends.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,160
We're Wanwan's good friends.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,600
She asked us to visit you

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,200
and bring you some food.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,040
Wanwan said she's been doing well lately.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,920
She asked you not to miss her.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,280
Okay.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,600
You can stay here tonight.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,760
Come on in.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,600
Wanwan,

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
come with me.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,600
Sit down.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
I'll get you some water.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,240
My Lady,

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,840
Li Guafu is so pitiful.

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,280
When I went to his kitchen,

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,880
there was no grain in the jar.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,000
The food on the table

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,200
was mixed with soil and branches.

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,000
Is this how the Marquis's Mansion treats him?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
It's already kind enough

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,440
to let him live.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,200
Should we still ask him for help?

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,800
Even if we don't ask him,

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,200
the Marquis's Mansion will not let him off.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,000
Send someone to write a letter

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,480
and find someone to put him in the mansion

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,600
to take care of him.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,280
Okay.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,200
My Lady,

32
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,000
My Lady,

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,800
My Lady, what's wrong with you?

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
My Lady, My Lady,

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,400
hold on, My Lady.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
My Lady.

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,400
Help!

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Help!

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,200
Zhang Xinyi is finally dead.

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,400
All of his property

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
is ours now.

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,800
He's rich.

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,600
The wealth of the Marquis is really abundant.

44
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,400
Even the dowry he brought

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
is gone.

46
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
He's gone.

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
He's gone.

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
He's gone.

49
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
He's gone.

50
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,800
Even the dowry he brought

51
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,000
is all real.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:22,400
It's my husband's

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
This is my house.

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,200
When I came home,

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,800
the Crown Prince was not welcome.

56
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,200
I still feel

57
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,000
that I'm not disappointed

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,200
that you didn't kill me.

59
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
Who wants to kill you?

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Aren't you fine here?

61
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
If you don't have any evidence,

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
don't slander me.

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,800
This sword

64
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,600
is the evidence.

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
What are you saying?

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
With just one sword,

67
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,200
you can set the evidence.

68
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,400
I have the evidence.

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
This sword

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,400
is the dowry I brought

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,800
when I married into the Marquis's Mansion.

72
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,200
It's not for killing.

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,600
What do you mean?

74
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,200
I went to Tanping Town today

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,200
just to test you.

76
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,400
I didn't expect you to

77
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,000
take action because you were afraid of the secret.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Impossible.

79
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
I was scared when I saw you.

80
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
How could you...

81
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Instead of asking me,

82
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
I'd rather ask you

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,200
how you got to this point.

84
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
It's all your fault.

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
It's all good.

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Xi,

87
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,800
I'm the Ghost Star Sect.

88
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
I was wrong.

89
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,200
Let's start over, okay?

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
I'll fix your wish right away.

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Let's start over, okay?

92
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
What are you saying?

93
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Shut up!

94
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Let's start over, okay?

95
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I won't kill you.

96
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
I knew it.

97
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
I knew it.

98
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,200
I'll make you die.

99
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Hong!

100
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Marquis Jing An's Mansion

101
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
was killed by Zhang Xiyin.

102
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
It's a serious crime.

103
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
But you're the only one in the family.

104
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
I'll take all the blame

105
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,200
and send you to prison.

106
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
You're so cruel.

107
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
You've ruined our family.

108
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
You can't die.

109
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
It's all your fault.

110
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
This is not right.

111
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
It's not right.

112
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Everyone,

113
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,200
I'm here to send you to prison.

114
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Zhang Xiyin,

115
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
have you had enough?

116
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
I've prepared a gift for you.

117
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Marquis Jing An's Mansion was killed by a woman.

118
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,200
He's a vicious man.

119
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Good!

120
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Zhang Xiyin,

121
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
you've ruined our family.

122
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
What else do you want?

123
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Li Yuowan,

124
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
I bought this mansion from you

125
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
with 200,000 cans.

126
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Now I've sold

127
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
600,000 cans.

128
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
You're so cruel.

129
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
You're so cruel.

130
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
You've tried to get my money.

131
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,200
I don't care at all.

132
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Zhang Xiyin,

133
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
since you don't want it,

134
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
why do you force us to return it?

135
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
The money of our family

136
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
is used by the people.

137
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
It's the foundation of our family.

138
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
I want you to pay me back.

139
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
It's the justice of the world.

140
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
How dare you talk to me like that?

141
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Please come with me

142
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
and send them to prison.

143
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Let's go.

144
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Let's go.

145
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Let's go.

146
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Let's go.

147
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Let's go.

148
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Let's go.

149
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Let's go.

150
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Let's go.

151
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Let's go.

152
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Let's go.

153
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Let's go.

154
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Get out.

155
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Get out.

156
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
How is it?

157
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
Your Highness,

158
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
all the people in the mansion

159
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
have been sent to prison.

160
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Prince Ji is in charge.

161
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Duan Jianlin and Zhang Xiyin

162
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
are going to the mansion.

163
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Your Highness,

164
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
you failed to assassinate them.

165
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
His Majesty just gave an order

166
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
to send you to the prison.

167
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Jianli,

168
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
you called everyone in.

169
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
But they didn't come.

170
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
They didn't come.

171
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
They didn't come.

172
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
They didn't come.

173
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
They didn't come.

174
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
They didn't come.

175
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
They didn't come.

176
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
You called everyone in.

177
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
What's the matter?

178
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Brother,

179
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
I must tell the Empress

180
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
to change the blood of the royal family

181
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
for the sake of power.

182
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
What?

183
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
19 years ago,

184
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
the Empress was not born a prince.

185
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
She was a princess.

186
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,200
This woman is Liu Yuewan.

187
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Ridiculous.

188
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
How could my child be her?

189
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Uncle,

190
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
do you have any evidence

191
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
to prove it?

192
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
This is what Ding Anhuo

193
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
left for his son.

194
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
I am trapped in the mystery of the city.

195
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
How bright your eyes are.

196
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,200
The hatred is entwined with the heart.

197
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
The night is like a crisis.

198
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
The sun is shining.

199
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,200
The pride is under the disguise.

200
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
It's full of sadness.

201
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
When will a ray of light

202
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,200
spread through the fog

203
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,200
and be my sun?

204
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,200
You are my light.

205
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
The endless darkness

206
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
guides me to the future

207
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,200
and runs towards the light.

208
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
You are my light.

209
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
You light up my way.

210
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Let's fight together.

211
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
The flying of time

212
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
is getting smaller and smaller.

213
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
It's in my heart.

214
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
The direction you are in

215
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
is bright and bright.

216
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,200
The power that gives me strength

217
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
is spreading through the crowd.

218
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I am walking towards

219
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,200
your side step by step.
