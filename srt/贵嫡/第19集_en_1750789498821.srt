1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And now, let me invite her to join me in this episode.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's you.

3
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,440
What?

4
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,120
You saw her as a teacher

5
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,240
and you came to her?

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,200
Why didn't you say that Zhou Yihong locked me up here

7
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,160
and wanted to start over with me?

8
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,000
How is that possible?

9
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,440
Zhou Yihong also said

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,600
he had no feelings for you.

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
He was just pretending to be in love with you

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,040
for the sake of the Queen.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,240
You

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,880
couldn't even stand a man.

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,440
Poor you.

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,320
I'll kill you now!

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,360
Take me to see Duan Xuanming.

18
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
You're dreaming!

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,880
I'll say it again.

20
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,080
Take me to see Duan Xuanming.

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,480
Zhao Xiyin,

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,960
let the Queen go.

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,440
Didn't you say you only had feelings for her?

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,960
Why did you keep her?

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Zhou Yihong,

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,200
he made you a man.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,120
You still want to be with him?

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,680
Shut up! Stop causing trouble!

29
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,680
Zhao Xiyin,

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,840
let the Queen go.

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
You're crazy.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Zhou Yihong,

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,560
I've sacrificed so much for you.

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,960
How could you betray me when you have no conscience?

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
Zhou Yihong,

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,640
didn't you say you only loved me?

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Prove it to me.

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Kill him.

39
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,880
I'll agree to be with you.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Zhou Yihong,

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,440
I've sacrificed so much for you.

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,200
How could you kill me for this bitch?

43
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Xiyin,

44
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,040
let's start over.

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,600
Let's start over.

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Let's start over.

47
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Let's start over.

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Let's start over.

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
I want you to die.

50
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
I can't live.

51
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,960
Don't you want to live?

52
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Xiyin,

53
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,520
let's start over.

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Let's start over.

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Isn't this Uncle?

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
How did you end up like this?

57
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Duan Xunming,

58
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
I knew you couldn't hold it in.

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
You really came to die.

60
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
I said,

61
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,080
when I saw you like this,

62
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,080
I remembered your mother.

63
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,080
She was willing to drink my mother's blood.

64
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
She was willing to drink my mother's blood

65
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
to protect your future.

66
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
You're so great.

67
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Duan Xunming.

68
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Shut up, you bastard.

69
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
What did you say?

70
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
What?

71
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
I said it wrong.

72
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
When you were in the Great Yu,

73
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
you were a prince,

74
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
but you couldn't do anything.

75
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Even His Majesty was punished because of the King.

76
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
Shut up!

77
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
When you arrived in Western Liang,

78
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,560
you thought you could be the son of the Crown Prince?

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
The King of Western Liang refused to see you.

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,040
He refused to let you live in this little mansion.

81
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
It seems that Western Liang doesn't want to admit your identity.

82
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Zhang Xiyin, you're looking for death.

83
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Xiyin, I've avenged my mother.

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
How is it?

85
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
How is it?

92
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
According to the report,

93
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,520
the eldest prince and the princess are gone.

94
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
Your Highness, please forgive me.

95
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,520
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
I didn't protect his son well.

97
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
Your Highness,

98
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
now is not the time to cry.

99
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
The King of Western Liang won't blame you.

100
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,520
What about Duan Jianli and Zhang Xiyin now?

101
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,520
They will definitely come back from the Zhang family's wound.

102
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
The people who passed the message to us

103
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,520
must let them die halfway.

104
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
Yes.

105
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Stop.

106
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
Your Highness, hold on.

107
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
The capital is ahead.

108
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
They are too many to be killed.

109
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
After I kill them,

110
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,520
you can leave at once.

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
No, we must die together.

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I won't die.

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Trust me.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Kill them.

115
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Jianli.

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't cry.

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Actually,

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
sometimes I think

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
it would be great if we could see each other earlier.

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Would you be happy

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
if we could see each other earlier?

122
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Would you be happy

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
if we could see each other earlier?

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You said you would marry me

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and take care of me forever.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You are so stupid.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You are so stupid.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You are so stupid.

130
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
I can't live refused.

131
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Don't lie to me.

132
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
Sorry.

133
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
I can't

134
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
understand it.

135
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Really?

136
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Your Highness.

137
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Take her away.

138
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Take her away.

139
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Hurry!

140
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Your Highness.

141
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Your Highness.

142
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Your Highness.

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Your Highness!

144
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Your Highness!

145
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Your Highness!

146
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,560
Your Majesty,

147
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,080
Prince Ji and I have found out

148
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,320
that Duan Xuanming is a disciple of the King of Western Liang.

149
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,880
Back then, the late Li Xinwan and the King of Western Liang

150
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,240
had a daughter and a son.

151
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,320
They married to the throne

152
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,960
and took over the country.

153
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,520
This Li Xinwan!

154
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,560
How dare he!

155
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Lady Zhang,

156
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,240
why did you save her?

157
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Where is Jianli?

158
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
She's dead.

159
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
What?

160
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,000
She was killed by the man who took her away.

161
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Impossible.

162
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,720
Jianli is the God of War of Great Yu.

163
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,680
Hundreds of thousands of enemies killed her.

164
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,160
How could she die so easily?

165
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,840
Impossible.

166
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Your Majesty!

167
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,360
It's all my fault.

168
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,600
She was abandoned in the palace.

169
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,840
I couldn't stop her.

170
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,800
Now she's dead.

171
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,680
I can't protect her.

172
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,320
I'm not mad at her.

173
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Go!

174
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,200
Get Li Xinwan here!

175
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
No need.

176
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,520
Your Majesty, you don't have to invite me.

177
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
I'm here.
