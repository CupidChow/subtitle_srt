1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh

2
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,760
oh

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Lee

4
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,800
What do you mean, Changxin Yin?

5
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
What did you take?

6
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Or you didn't enjoy the party?

7
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
You dare to mention it again?

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
You deliberately made fun of me and embarrassed me.

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
You lied to me that you would buy 200,000 pieces of it.

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
200,000 pieces?

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
A pot of rotten tangerine flowers costs 200,000 pieces?

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
If it wasn't for you,

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,800
why would I buy those tangerines for Her Majesty?

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Changxin Yin, this is your fault.

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
You handle it.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Are you deaf?

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800
I bought the flowers.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
How does it concern me?

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
You are the wife of my family.

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Your money is the money of my family.

21
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Yes, sister.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Why do you say that?

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,800
You are the one who paid the last.

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Who said I paid?

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
You are a rich family.

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
You are the young mistress of my family.

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Shouldn't you do something for my family?

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Besides, you have so many shops.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
It's enough to just buy some.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Are you out of your mind?

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,800
How does my shop have anything to do with your family?

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
If you don't support my family,

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
how can you have those shops?

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Ridiculous.

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
I work in the business department of my family.

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Why do I need your support?

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Anyway, Sansi Army has sent the princess to the palace.

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,800
In a few days, Princess Jingyang will send someone to get the money.

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
If you don't get the money,

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
you will lose your wife.

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
I don't understand what you are saying.

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,800
People saw that you bought the flowers.

43
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
You gave the title.

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,800
You should be the one who lost the woman.

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,800
I have reminded you to be considerate.

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
But you didn't listen.

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,800
So I have to take the money.

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
You are pretending to be confused.

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
We had a wedding a few days ago.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
We spent more than half of the money.

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
You have more than 500 yuan.

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Where did you get 200,000 yuan?

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
I have no money.

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
I think the mansion of the duke

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
is the best place in the capital.

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,800
You can get 200,000 yuan from it.

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Bullshit.

58
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
I have a lot of money.

59
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
If you have a better idea,

60
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,800
you can lose the man.

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,800
The royal family will not make you suffer because of the money.

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
You can save 200,000 yuan.

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Brother Hong,

64
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
we don't have enough money.

65
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
If we can't,

66
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
we can take the mansion.

67
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
You are lying.

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
I will find a way.

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Zhang Xiyin is so stingy.

70
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Brother Hong doesn't understand me.

71
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
He keeps blaming me.

72
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Please calm down.

73
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,800
You can ask the empress to lend you the money.

74
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
No.

75
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
What should we do?

76
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
We don't have enough money.

77
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,800
He must pay the 200,000 yuan.

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Xiyin, we are family.

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
You can't just leave us.

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
We are brothers.

81
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
I can lend you the money.

82
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,800
But what do you want?

83
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
I have nothing.

84
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Can you give me some interest?

85
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
We only take the money.

86
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
If you don't have it,

87
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
I can only live in silence.

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Wait.

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
I will use the mansion's property as the mortgage.

90
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
I will lend you 200,000 yuan.

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Is that enough?

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Okay.

93
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
But as far as I know,

94
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
you don't have the estate.

95
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
I have it.

96
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Then you can go and get it.

97
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Okay.

98
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
I will go.

99
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Xiyin,

100
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
we have finished our deal.

101
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I have something else to do.

102
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
I won't go with you.

103
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Isn't this Miss Li?

104
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Miss Li, long time no see.

105
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Miss Li, do you remember us?

106
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Who are you?

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
I don't know you.

108
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Who is here to disturb the wife of Duke Ding'an?

109
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
The wife of Duke Ding'an?

110
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Miss Li,

111
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
you are the fiancee of Duke Ding'an.

112
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
You are the heir of Duke Ding'an.

113
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
What fiancee?

114
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
I don't know you.

115
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Don't talk nonsense.

116
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Li Yuewan,

117
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
you left the border overnight.

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
You didn't even pay us the money.

119
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Now you pretend you don't know us.

120
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
If you don't make it clear, you don't want to leave.

121
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Xicun, drive them away.

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Yes.

123
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
You are so rude.

124
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
You don't pay us the money.

125
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
You are so rude.

126
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
You are so rude.

127
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
You are so rude.

128
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Prince Jin is here.

129
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Who is making trouble here?

130
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
My lord,

131
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
can you give us the decision?

132
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Duke Ding'an is going to kill someone.

133
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Yes.

134
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
You are still alive.

135
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Thank you for coming in time.

136
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Yes.

137
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Or they would have killed him.

138
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Greetings, my lord.

139
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Did you meet any trouble?

140
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
I just met them when I came out with my wife.

141
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
They said they were in the border.

142
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
They are here to kill someone.

143
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I just met them when I came out with my wife.

144
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
They said they were in the border to work for you.

145
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

146
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
There is no misunderstanding.

147
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
He has lived there for half a year.

148
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
My lord, it's about your wife and Duke's reputation.

149
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Please investigate it.

150
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
No need.

151
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
It's nothing.

152
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Don't bother.

153
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Please rest assured.

154
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
I will find out the truth.

155
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
I will find out the truth.

156
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I will give her justice.

157
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Chi Shu.

158
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Take them to the court.

159
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Yes.

160
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Take them away.

161
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Why are you so careless?

162
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I came back to find you.

163
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I just need to give them money.

164
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I usually give them something.

165
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
I didn't know they would come.

166
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Even if they came,

167
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
they shouldn't know our relationship.

168
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
I am a woman.

169
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,800
It's not good to tell others that I met a man in the middle of the night.

170
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
I just said you are my fiancee.

171
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Enough.

172
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
If those two ladies tell you the truth,

173
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
we will be fooled.

174
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Hong, go to Xiyin later.

175
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
You should talk to her.

176
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Maybe it will be over.

177
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
I know.

178
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Xiyin.

179
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Xiyin.

180
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Why am I so nervous?

181
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
We are husband and wife.

182
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
It's not necessary.

183
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
I will go.

184
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
You dare to enter my lady's room?

185
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
How dare you!

186
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
I am a prince.

187
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
You are a prince.

188
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
You should be in my room.

189
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Stop!

190
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Xiyin, throw this rabbit out.

191
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Go.

192
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Let go of me.

193
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Let go of me.

194
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
What's wrong with him?

195
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
What's wrong with him?

196
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
What's wrong with him?

197
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Hong.

198
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Hong.

199
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Hong, why are you here?

200
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
What are you waiting for? Untie me.

201
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Hurry.

202
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
What are you looking at?

203
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Get out.

204
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Zhang Xiyin, you dare to fool me.

205
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
You beat me like this.

206
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
You tied me up and threw me out.

207
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
I was lying on the food table for a night.

208
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
You are too much.

209
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Hong, why did you go to him last night?

210
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Why are you talking about me?

211
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
It's all because of you.

212
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Wanwan, you should understand me.

213
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
I can't give you two away.

214
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
What should I do?

215
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
So,

216
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
you were a prince last night.

217
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
I told the court yesterday.

218
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
It's your secret.

219
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
You beat me up.

220
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Zhang Xiyin, if you don't know how to control me,

221
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
I will help you.

222
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Come on, drag me out.

223
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
I will serve you.

224
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
You are my maid.

225
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
You can't be the crown prince.

226
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
You can teach me.

227
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
You are my maid.

228
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Take her.

229
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
The Crown Prince is so brave.

230
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
I dare to beat him.

231
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
You are my maid.

232
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
