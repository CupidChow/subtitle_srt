1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
bitch

2
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,080
bitch

3
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,080
oh

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:28,580
my

5
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,580
Go.

6
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,580
Bring the Ding'an family here.

7
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,580
Your Majesty, the dungeon is flooded.

8
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,580
The Ding'an family has been burned to death.

9
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,580
What?

10
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,580
Your Majesty, I'm not afraid of confrontation.

11
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,580
It's just that the Ding'an family is all gone now.

12
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,580
I wonder if Your Highness has any other evidence.

13
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,580
I'm afraid that Your Highness has been killed by the Empress.

14
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,580
You can't talk nonsense.

15
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,580
Just with a piece of broken cloth,

16
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,580
you're going to accuse my mother of being a traitor.

17
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
You said that she was a traitor.

18
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,580
You have to find evidence.

19
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,580
Your Majesty, I have evidence.

20
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,580
When the princess was born,

21
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,580
the Ding'an family gave her to this woman.

22
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,580
Your Majesty, please investigate.

23
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,580
This is what the princess was born with.

24
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,580
I've been keeping it well.

25
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,580
Bring it here.

26
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,580
This is the gold chain I ordered

27
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,580
to be made for your daughter.

28
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,580
Didn't you say that you lost the gold chain?

29
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,580
The Empress did not care about the court's rules

30
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,580
and deceived the king to change the daughter.

31
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,580
Her heart can be killed.

32
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,580
Your Majesty, please calm down.

33
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,580
Ming'er, Ming'er is really your child.

34
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,580
It's just that Li Yuowan is also your daughter.

35
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,580
Your Majesty,

36
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,580
the Empress was born with a child.

37
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,580
If anyone knows,

38
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,580
the princess will be in danger.

39
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,580
I don't care about your objection,

40
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,580
and sent her to the Ding'an family to recuperate.

41
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,580
If it's really just to recuperate,

42
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,580
why did you kill all the people who set up the trap?

43
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,580
Shut up!

44
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,580
Don't slander me for something I haven't done.

45
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,580
Your Highness, if you really haven't done it,

46
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,580
why do you keep killing me?

47
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,580
The fire of the Hualuang Temple.

48
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,580
Someone wanted to burn Zhang Xin and my royal family.

49
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,580
I understand.

50
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,580
These arrows were taken from the rocket at that time.

51
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,580
Zhang Xin was stabbed again during the banquet.

52
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,580
That knife was pulled down from the assassin at that time.

53
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,580
The arrow was also taken from the assassin

54
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,580
at the dinner at the Ding'an mansion.

55
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,580
What's funny is that they have the same pattern.

56
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,580
Just with this pile of broken arrows,

57
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,580
what can it prove?

58
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,580
They can be forged anywhere.

59
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,580
These arrows are the drawings of the current Empress of the Great Yu.

60
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,580
Who dares to fabricate them?

61
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,580
Father, this...

62
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,580
Enough!

63
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,580
There are witnesses and evidence.

64
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,580
What else do you have to say?

65
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,580
Yes, I want to kill Zhang Xinying.

66
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,580
Lin Yuewan is my daughter.

67
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,580
I protect my own daughter.

68
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,580
What's wrong with that?

69
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,580
Zhang Xinying has been provoking me.

70
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,580
Shouldn't she die?

71
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,580
Your Majesty.

72
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,580
You...

73
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,580
Li Xinwan.

74
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,580
You are so disappointing.

75
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,580
From today on,

76
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,580
you will be removed from your post and be confined to the Ancestral Palace.

77
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,580
Without my order,

78
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,580
you are not allowed to step out of the palace.

79
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,580
As for you,

80
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,580
since you don't know about this,

81
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,580
just take it as your mother's death.

82
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,580
Father, father.

83
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,580
Please take back your order.

84
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,580
Father, please take back your order.

85
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,580
Step aside.

86
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,580
Step back.

87
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,580
Ming'er.

88
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,580
Mother, I killed her.

89
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,580
There's no need to take the blame for me.

90
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,580
I will go and explain to father.

91
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,580
Ming'er.

92
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,580
Li Yuewan's mission has failed.

93
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,580
I have already sent someone to send her to a safe place.

94
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,580
You still have more important things to do.

95
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,580
You must leave Zhang's family

96
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,540
and get the complete map of the

97
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,540
Ancestral Palace.

98
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,540
Map of the Ancestral Palace?

99
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,540
Only the emperor of each realm can have this map.

100
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,540
I must get it.

101
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,540
From now on,

102
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,540
I can only rely on you.

103
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,540
Mother,

104
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,540
when I become the emperor,

105
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,540
the whole world will be yours.

106
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,540
Why do you need that map?

107
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,540
For our future,

108
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,540
for the real world.

109
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,540
Xiyan.

110
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,540
Xiyan,

111
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,540
why did you suddenly come here?

112
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,540
Father,

113
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,540
you still don't want to tell me the truth?

114
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,540
Why is the empress keeping an eye on our family?

115
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,540
Xiyan.

116
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,540
The empress has always been reluctant to let us go.

117
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,540
I have been thinking about it.

118
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,540
Maybe it's because of our map of the Ancestral Palace.

119
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,540
If that's the case,

120
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,540
the Zhang family will be in even more danger.

121
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,540
Forget it.

122
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,540
At this point,

123
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,540
I will not hide it anymore.

124
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,540
This is...

125
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,540
This is the key to our map of the Ancestral Palace.

126
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,540
But why is it missing?

127
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,540
The key to the map of the Ancestral Palace is divided into three parts.

128
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,540
The most important part is the one in your hand.

129
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,540
The other two are in the hands of me and Shou'an.

130
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,540
Shou'an knows you are coming,

131
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,540
so she will take the other part

132
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,540
and give me the other part.

133
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,540
This map is the emperor's personal gift.

134
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,540
Only the emperors have it.

135
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,540
It is a very secret transport route

136
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,540
that goes through the whole of the Great Yu and Western Liang.

137
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,540
Then it can be used for military purposes.

138
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,540
That's right.

139
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,540
The map of the Ancestral Palace is only for the emperor and us.

140
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,540
No one knows where it is.

141
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,540
So we have to guard this emperor's position for generations.

142
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,540
What does the empress want?

143
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,540
Could it be...

144
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,540
You bunch of assholes!

145
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,540
You can't even take down a few wounded people!

146
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,540
Brother Xuanming, why are you so angry?

147
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,540
Go, go, go.

148
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,540
I'm just angry with Zhang Xi.

149
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,540
He's taking advantage of his power to guard the emperor.

150
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,540
He's always fighting against me.

151
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,540
You're a bitch.

152
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
There are many ways to deal with him.

153
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,540
Brother Xuanming, why are you so angry?

154
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,540
I'm in charge of the Ministry of Revenue.

155
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,540
It's hard for me to make more money for the various palaces.

156
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,540
Brother Xuanming, don't worry.

157
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,540
As a royal merchant,

158
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,540
you have to take down all the food and clothing in the palace.

159
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,540
If you make a mistake,

160
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,540
you can just step on him to death.

161
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,540
If so,

162
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,540
you've worked hard.

163
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,540
Miss, this wine smells really good.

164
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,540
You can choose it yourself.

165
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,540
His Majesty's birthday party should be a good one.

166
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,540
You're right.

167
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,540
Stop!

168
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,540
What a bunch of assholes!

169
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,540
How dare you not bow to the princess of the Yong family?

170
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,540
I, Zhang Xin, bow to the princess of the Yong family.

171
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,540
Good.

172
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,540
So you're Zhang Xin, who has always been in charge of the position of the emperor.

173
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,540
The position of the emperor is gained by Zhang Jia靠's strength.

174
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,540
He's not in charge of it.

175
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,540
How dare you!

176
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,540
Whatever I say is true.

177
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
What are these?

178
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,540
These are the wine for His Majesty's birthday party.

179
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,540
Open it.

180
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
How dare you!

181
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,540
How dare you give these low-grade wine to His Majesty!

182
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,540
His Majesty is really not good at choosing.

183
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,540
He can't even make wine.

184
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,540
I'm not even a dry water.

185
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,540
Come on.

186
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,540
Zhang Xin sent the wine to the palace.

187
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,540
He's not in the mood to drink it.

188
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,540
He's just going to smash all these dry water for me.

189
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,540
Princess,

190
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,540
these wines, whether they're raw or made, are all very good.

191
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,540
Princess, why don't you try it yourself?

192
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,540
How dare you let the princess taste such a bad wine?

193
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,540
You, Zhang Jia, are a very good person.

194
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,540
You're not even a royal.

195
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,540
How dare you let the princess taste such a bad wine?

196
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,540
How many heads of your family have you cut off for me?

197
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,540
Since the wine is so good,

198
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,540
why don't you try it for me first?

199
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,540
I'm the second-ranked high-ranking lady of His Majesty's personal title.

200
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,540
If I'm guilty, it's because His Majesty punished me personally.

201
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,540
If you do this, it's because you're a musical instrument.

202
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,540
I don't need you and Jianming to teach me how to do things.

203
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,540
I'll teach you.

204
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,540
I'll do it myself.

205
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,540
Forget it.

206
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
You can't even drink this wine.

207
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,540
How dare you give it to His Majesty?

208
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,540
Open your eyes and look clearly.

209
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,540
What do you need to fight for?

210
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,540
What are you not able to offend?

211
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,540
Let's go.

212
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,540
My Lady.

213
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,540
My Lady.

214
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,540
My Lady.

215
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,540
My Lady.

216
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,540
My Lady.

217
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,540
My Lady.
