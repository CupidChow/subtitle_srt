4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Miss, be careful.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What's wrong?

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My lord, my lady is...

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My lord, I have a friend today.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that my family will worry about me.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But I'll stay in your mansion for a while.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Uncle, go to the cup of sobering wine.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Didn't you say you have a friend?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why are you so embarrassed?

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not drunk.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm so happy that I fell down.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Are you hurt?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What's wrong?

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It hurts.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's all because of that bastard's classmate.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What classmate?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll go to him tomorrow.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No, I'll take him away.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't want to see him again.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, let's all take him away.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The End

Episode 1

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
My lord, what are you doing at midnight?

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm going to find my tombstone and drink some wine this afternoon.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm not a good friend.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I should find you a drink, too.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What are you doing?

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No, don't come here.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No, don't come here.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
My lord.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
My lord, I'm sorry.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Please don't come here.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't dare to come here.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't dare to come here.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
My lord.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is the first time.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is the last time.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's go.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Next time.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My lord.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I've met Princess Yongning.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I heard that you like orchids.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I made them for you.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It smells so good.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The orchid is in the scent.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
As long as you like it,

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
you'll have a good smell.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm glad you like it.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I like this dress very much.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's good that you like it.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Have you solved the problem of drinking water?

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't worry, my lord.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I've changed the new one.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's good.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Wait.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This dress is good.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's not as special as my dress.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But it's not as good as mine.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I want this dress.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's not as good as mine.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I like this dress.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll give you the dress.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I want this one.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Princess Yongning,

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
this dress is made for you.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you like it,

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
you can make another one for me.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Shut up.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This is not what you are talking about.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I want this one.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll give you the dress.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You can have it.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll give you the dress.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're so great.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're so great.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I've never got what I want.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let go.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Give it to me.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Princess fell down.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Come here.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Come here.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you okay, princess?

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What's going on?

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Father,

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
sister is looking at my dress.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I won't give it to her.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
She pushed me down.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I didn't.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
She fell down.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If you don't push me,

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
how can I fall down?

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Bastard.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
For this dress,

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
you should do this to your own sister.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Father,

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
it's not me.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's her.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's her doing the good thing.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What does she do?

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's all because of Zhang Xinyin's intention.

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
She gave Yongning a better dress.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Princess,

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the clothes that the civil servants gave to the palace

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
are all made for the masters.

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
There's no reason to say it.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Huang Qi,

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I was supposed to wear this dress

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
on Father's birthday banquet.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I've always been a little girl.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can't stand the fact that you stole my clothes.

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
can you let me go this time?

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Shut up.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
How can you ask me to do this?

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
My mother is a concubine.

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You should shut up.

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They are all my children.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Why do you come to the high ground to kneel?

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You are so cruel to this dress.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I apologize to your sister.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Apologize?

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm not a friend.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's all because of Zhang Xinyin's intention.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Father,

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
you should do it for me.

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
She's so stubborn.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why did she do it for you?

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
She did it to revenge me.

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Princess,

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't know why the civil servant

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
is going to revenge you.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You know it.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know it.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I just remember that day when I blamed you for drinking.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What's the point of blaming you for drinking?

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I dare not say it.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What are you afraid of?

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll punish you.

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Say it.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That day,

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Mrs. Zhang was sent to the palace for drinking.

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But she was stopped by the emperor.

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
She was in a difficult situation.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
She even drank that wine.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
She was forced to drink it.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
She did it wrong.

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
She should be punished.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You bastard.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
She is the emperor of the election.

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
When will you be the one

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
to teach the civil servant?

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't dare.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You don't dare?

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I see your courage is great.

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
As a princess,

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you don't only love and hurt the people,

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
but you are also a coward

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
who is too weak to you.

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You are also a coward.

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Guards.

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes.

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Send the civil servant to the palace.

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Send him back to the palace.

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You are not allowed to enter the capital

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
from now on.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No, father.

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't drive me away.

176
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't go back to the palace.

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't drive me away.

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry, father.

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Father.

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's her.

182
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
She is a victim.

183
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Father.

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I really know what to do.

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Father.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Miss, you are so great today.

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Princess Yongjiang is always so strong.

188
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I heard that many people

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
are angry at her.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Now she is back to the capital.

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
She is a big person.

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But Miss,

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
how do you know

194
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
that she will rob Yongning's clothes?

195
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Are you sure

196
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
that this method will definitely take Yongjiang?

197
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
As long as you cooperate with her,

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
you can do it.

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
She has left the palace

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and only has one princess left.

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
In the future,

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
you can see her face again.

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay.

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I will cooperate with you.

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
She can have her own clothes

206
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
today.

207
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes.

208
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
My lord.

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Your Majesty,

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I have already helped you to get married.

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
In a few days,

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
you will be here with me.

214
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Why didn't you tell me

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
about the family matter?

216
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's a small matter.

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I can solve it myself.

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Your matter is not a small matter.

219
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
My lord,

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
why are you here today?

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Do you have something to tell me?

222
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This token

223
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
can move the royal family.

224
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Seeing this token

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
is like seeing me.

226
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You don't need

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
to be afraid of anyone

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
in the whole of Da Yu.

229
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
My lord.

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You are really good to Xia Shu.

231
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I am good to you.

232
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I am good to you?

233
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Is it just because of this?

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Of course not.

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I am not a grasshopper.

236
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
My lord,

237
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you are so kind to me.

238
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I don't know how to do it.

239
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Then I ask you,

240
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Xi Yan,

241
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
when are you going to

242
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
remember my heart?

243
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
When everything is settled,

244
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
when evil is achieved,

245
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
everything will return to normal.

246
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay.

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I will wait for you.

248
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I will wait.

249
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Take out Zhang Xi.

250
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Duan Xuanming,

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you dare to break into the royal family?

252
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Uncle Huang,

253
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Zhang Xi is a emperor.

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He is not good at the military service.

255
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Su Ping ate his fulinggou

256
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
last night.

257
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He was lucky to have the imperial doctor

258
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
to save him in time.

259
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He was safe.

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I sent him to get it.

261
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I hope that uncle Huang

262
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
will be safe.

263
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Every palace has fulinggou.

264
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Why did Su Ping get into trouble?

265
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The imperial doctor has already tested it.

266
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Su Ping got sick

267
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
because of his fulinggou.

268
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I just sent the fulinggou

269
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
to the Inner Court.

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The Inner Court has

271
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
a lot of guards

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
in every place in the palace.

273
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The prince is a good boy.

274
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I am the one who is in charge of the imperial operation.

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's like a disaster.

276
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You are crazy!

277
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I am the prince.

278
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You can use the disaster

279
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
to frame you

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
for a strange business.

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right.

282
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That Dingdu is a spy.

283
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But I think

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
you are going to kill him.

285
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
My lord,

286
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I am willing to cooperate with the investigation.

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I will do my best.
