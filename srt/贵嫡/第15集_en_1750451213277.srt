00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,680
The queen

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,140
Selected in the people

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,800
Half of them are prince

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,500
Officer the big king is afraid of having a baby

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,560
He doesn't know what to say

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,860
uy string

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,980
It starts

13
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,560
kind of

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,840
Every winner should choose 3 stages.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,480
Each one should be able to get in and out of the conquest.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,120
Lastly, the king should enjoy all the diversity,

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,460
take care of the inner reviews and shopping Attations,

18

and gather all items~~~

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,720
By the dusk,

20
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,960
this competition shows the sheer and clear performance of both Dieu andizin

21
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,180
Based on items,

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,300
we could judge

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,360
how much we have put on the Award

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,840
as the right Hua Ka Laom Lees

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,220
Therefore, it is time to decide

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,220
The first time I saw a man with a gun.

27
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

28
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

30
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

31
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

32
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

33
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

34
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

36
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

37
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

38
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

39
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

40
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,220
I thought he was a man with a gun.

41
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,220
How great!

42
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,700
Yeah, the updated version.

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,480
OK.

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,400
Good

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Yeah

46
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,300
Find out what the second one is.

47
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,760
Otherwise someone'll know it beforehand.

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,920
Don't worry, Your Highness.

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,520
His Majesty has ordered me to change all the items of the second level today.

50
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,880
What?

51
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,840
These are all prepared in advance.

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,320
No one will know.

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,520
Father, what a coincidence.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,480
I didn't even think about it.

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,040
Now, the second level.

56
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,960
The test is to know the accuracy of all kinds of sold goods.

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,160
You just need to do the price of the items you see.

58
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,360
Write the price on the paper.

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,480
The closest price is the most.

60
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
The price of the items is the most.

61
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
The price of the items is the most.

62
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
The price of the items is the most.

63
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
The price of the items is the most.

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
The price of the items is the most.

65
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
The price of the items is the most.

66
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
The price of the items is the most.

67
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
The price of the items is the most.

68
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
The price of the items is the most.

69
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
The price of the items is the most.

70
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
The price of the items is the most.

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
The price of the items is the most.

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
The price of the items is the most.

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
The price of the items is the most.

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
The price of the items is the most.

75
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
The price of the items is the most.

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
It's ready.

77
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Let's give it a go.

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,760
It's so cool!

79
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,540
Read what we answered today!

80
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,040
These are ridiculous things!

81
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,720
Tell me how much is each workout worth?

82
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,700
Two algunits plates!

83
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,880
What is this?

84
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480
I've been a business man for a long time.

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,680
I've never seen it before.

86
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,080
It's divided into two halves.

87
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,280
I think you know it.

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,040
It's like a palace lock.

89
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,080
A palace lock?

90
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,680
How could a cheap thing like this

91
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,880
be so cheap?

92
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,080
Give me your silver blindfold.

93
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,680
Some time.

94
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,800
Well, well, well.

95
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,760
And so on.

96
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,120
Much farther and much farther.

97
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,080
It's considered a palace lock in the future.

98
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,560
Isn't it an absolute rule to forget

99
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,720
Do you have a storefront to celebrate the so called

100
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,400
global world,

101
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
which only pretend to be the capital

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,800
people exercise.

103
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,640
I started to Sleeping wirals

104
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,880
at that time.

105
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,200
After leaving the ancient AUDIA there,

106
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,760
potatoes,

107
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,120
warm water was used to wash food.

108
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,760
Garlic,

109
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
The last test is coming up.

110
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,760
The emperor needs to deliver the goods to the palace every year.

111
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,760
So this test is related to the delivery.

112
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,760
We have already arranged three batches of goods outside the palace.

113
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,760
You can arrange your own personnel.

114
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,760
We only need to deliver these goods in two boxes.

115
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
And we will win.

116
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,760
This is the goods you are going to deliver.

117
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
Thank you.

118
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
You can do your best.

119
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Xiaoji, isn't this test very simple?

120
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
As long as the carriage is running fast,

121
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
we will not be far from the destination.

122
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,760
We will definitely deliver it.

123
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,760
The process of the test seems to be simple.

124
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,760
It seems that this time we will not deliver it easily.

125
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
Show me the map of the capital.

126
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
This is the capital.

127
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,760
This is the capital.

128
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Show me the map of the capital.

129
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Here.

130
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
There are four roads from here to the capital.

131
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,760
The road to the capital is the shortest.

132
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
But there are many people.

133
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
It is easy to happen.

134
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,760
The road in the east is on the way.

135
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,760
The west is a few miles away from the capital.

136
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Many merchants meet the robberies after the crossing.

137
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Maybe it is the farthest.

138
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
There is no one on this road.

139
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,760
It is too late to go around the capital.

140
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,760
The two masters of the capital

141
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
will probably choose the water-sweeping one.

142
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
What about us?

143
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Let's go.

144
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Water-sweeping.

145
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
I have already taken it.

146
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
You are so generous.

147
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
You are so strong.

148
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
Look at what you have done.

149
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Stand up.

150
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
Hurry up.

151
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Take it easy.

152
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Hurry up.

153
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
You are so stubborn.

154
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Do you know how much I have done?

155
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Hurry up.

156
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
Hurry up.

157
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,760
I am too old to remember myself.

158
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Hurry up.

159
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
Hurry up.

160
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Hurry up.

161
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Hurry up.

162
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,760
Hurry up.

163
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Hurry up.

164
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Hurry up.

165
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
Hurry up.

166
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Hurry up.

167
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Hurry up.

168
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Don't grab it.

169
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Don't grab it.

170
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Hurry up.

171
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Hurry up.

172
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Put it down.

173
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Miss, what if the robberies are taken away?

174
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
What should we do?

175
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
The mission is not over yet.

176
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Put the box down.

177
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Let's go.

178
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Okay.

179
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Come on.

180
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
What is this?

181
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
What is this?

182
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
What is this?

183
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
What is this?

184
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
The goods are not in the box.

185
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
There is only one box left.

186
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Please take a rest.

187
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
When the people arrive,

188
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
I will announce the result.

189
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
I heard that another old carriage is broken.

190
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
I am afraid it won't come.

191
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
How can this broken carriage be broken?

192
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
The emperor chose to take it.

193
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
You really think it is a gift?

194
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Yes.

195
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Zhang Xinyi is not here yet.

196
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
You are a fool.

197
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
How can we lose?

198
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Right?

199
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
If the old carriage arrived,

200
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
it would be a waste of money.

201
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
But it would be a waste of life.

202
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
This...

203
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
One more.

204
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
One more.

205
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
One more.

206
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
One more.

207
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
I will enter this underground shack.

208
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
I will think it over soon.

209
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Please.

210
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,840
I will add one more.

211
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Three are gone!

212
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Okay.

213
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,760
The tent is not opened.

214
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
I need to use some better tools.

215
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,380
RADIO

216
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,920
Yu''r, how do I look?

217
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:46,560
Not bad, AC女

218
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
What's going on?

219
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,560
Sir, I'll pretend to be a water-dryer and end the fire.

220
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,560
Lord You Lang, send the goods to the south to the site.

221
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Uncle Shi.

222
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Yes.

223
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Oh, no!

224
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,560
This is not only possible to avoid the possibility of getting married,

225
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,560
but also to play the ear-pick to deliver the goods safely.

226
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,560
Mr. Zhang, you're really smart.

227
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Thank you.

228
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,560
The third round is about the only person who will get all the goods successfully.

229
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,560
So this time, the emperor chose the only person who wins.

230
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
We won! We won!

231
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
That's great!

232
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,560
The third round is about the only person who will get all the goods safely.

233
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
So please, don't worry.

234
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
I'll get the goods safely.

235
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
Thank you.

236
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,560
The third round is about the only person who will get all the goods safely.

237
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,560
The third round is about the only person who will get all the goods safely.

238
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,560
The third round is about the only person who will get all the goods safely.

239
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,560
The third round is about the only person who will get all the goods safely.

240
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,560
The third round is about the only person who will get all the goods safely.

241
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,560
The third round is about the only person who will get all the goods safely.

242
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,560
The third round is about the only person who will get all the goods safely.

243
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,560
The third round is about the only person who will get all the goods safely.
