00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Music

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Music

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Music

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Music

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Music

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Your majesty

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Today is the family dinner

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You don't have to be present

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sit

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Marquis Jing An's heir is here too

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Greetings to your highness

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
To be honest

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I did the best in the two marriages of the heir

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But I never had the chance to see your wife

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
They are all here today

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Your highness

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They are here

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Greetings to your majesty and empress

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Luoluo is generous

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
She deserves the title of wife

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why are you alone?

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Where is Zhang?

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Before sister left, she received news from her mother

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Said there was a business meeting

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm afraid she can't come

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is a family dinner

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If she doesn't come, even his majesty will not take it seriously

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Your highness, please calm down

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Sister is in the family of Shanggu

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She used to be the first

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We can't persuade her

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Greetings to your majesty and empress

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Your majesty

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I prepared a gift for you

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry for the delay

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What gift did you bring me?

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You are late

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Please don't misunderstand

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
With words

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
To show off your majesty and empress

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The words on the scroll are not written by one person

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Madam, what do you think?

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Your highness is wise

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The words of blessing are made by the people

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you for your majesty's grace

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Thank you for your majesty's grace

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Our people can live and work in peace

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
People are willing to do it

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm here to give you my blessing

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I hope you can take it

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
People know your will

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Your majesty is safe and sound

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Brother, this is the blessing of the country

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The blessing of the people

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The country is safe and the people are safe

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Your majesty is wise

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Long live your majesty

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Long live your majesty

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Long live your majesty

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Long live your majesty

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Good

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The wedding ceremony

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Madam, by the order of empress

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Please go to Qian Kun palace

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Please lead the way

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Xiyin, you are here

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Greetings, your highness

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Please be at ease

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm the one who made your marriage

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I never asked you

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How is your life in Ding An's mansion?

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Your highness

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Marriage is not something to be forced

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You only have me

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And I have to obey

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The advice of my father and wife

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you upset?

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Or dissatisfied?

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Since you asked

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll ask you for a decree

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
A divorce letter

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How dare you!

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I made your marriage

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If you insist

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You are against me

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You should know

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Marriage is not happiness

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You don't agree with me

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Is it because of my wife?

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Or you have other purpose?

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm doing this for you

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But this marriage

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Is for your family

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Especially your family

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's the best

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
All right, get out

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm leaving

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Madam Jun

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Madam Jun

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Princess asked you to talk with her

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Please lead the way

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The one who picked me is not Princess Jingyang

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Who ordered you to bring me here?

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Go

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Go

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What?

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
An assassin?

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's going on?

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Your highness

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I just came out from the palace

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And a maid said Princess Jingyang was looking for me

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And I was taken to a deserted place

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If you didn't arrive in time

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm afraid I would have been

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't know who I offended

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
When I first came out

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You have to kill me like this

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Zhang Xin is not only the emperor

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But also the lady

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How dare he do this

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He doesn't even care about the law of the Great Yu

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Your majesty

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I didn't summon Madam Jun

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He took advantage of my name

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And committed suicide

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm afraid he has other purpose

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Lock the palace door immediately

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
No one is allowed to enter or exit

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Jianli, take her to investigate

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Your majesty

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This woman has been poisoned

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Madam Jun, look

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Is it her?

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Your majesty

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's her

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Which palace maid is she?

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I just checked

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She didn't register

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If I want to know, it's hard

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Find out who is behind her

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Your majesty

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
When I was a woman

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This fell out of her body

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't know if it's useful

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Isn't this the leaf of the fushang flower?

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Fushang flower is a tribute to Nanjiang

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The whole palace

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Only in sister-in-law's place

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Jinyang, you mean

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm harming Madam Jun

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This person has the flower in your palace

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Even if you didn't do it

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's also made by your palace

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I know my mistake

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You and your imperial guards

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Imperial guards are not good at searching

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The person who is in charge of the duty

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Has to be punished by 20 times

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Your majesty

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
General Chou is only responsible for outside the palace

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But this palace maid is from the palace

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
General Chou is not innocent

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You are so arrogant

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
How dare you interrupt the conversation

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I forgot

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Madam Jun is also going to plead for her

172
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
No

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The country has its own rules

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
General Chou should be punished

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Since he made a mistake

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The Zhang family has always been good

177
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Like this kind of rich family

178
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm afraid a lot of greedy people

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Will think about it

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I guess

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
They need a strong backer

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know if I'm qualified

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Is this what Prince Ji said

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Didn't he never get along with the government

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Didn't he hear wrong

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Your highness

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You are

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
They say the farmer is the merchant

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Compared to those virtuous and loyal ministers

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm afraid it's the most ungrateful

191
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
For our country

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The same kind of rich family

193
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't want such a loyal minister

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
To be buried

195
