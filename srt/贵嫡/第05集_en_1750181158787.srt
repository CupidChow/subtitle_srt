1
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,780
See hit

2
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,540
Oh

3
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,820
She had an idea

4
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,120
Yeah

5
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,180
For博 differs

6
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,360
包是娘不好

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,360
I apologize to you today.

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
I'm too young to be a mother.

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
Xinyi, look.

10
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,360
I made this soup myself.

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,360
It's made of the best ingredients.

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
You've been treating me like this.

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
I'm treating you like this.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,360
You must appreciate it.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
This soup is too hot.

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
I'll drink it when it's cool.

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Here, sister.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
Have some cake to soothe your fatigue.

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
Thank you, sister.

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
If you have something to say,

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
just say it.

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,360
I don't know how to say it to you.

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,360
Then think it over before you tell me.

24
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,360
I'm done.

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,360
Sister.

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Sister, you're the head of the household.

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
But you need to recuperate now.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
I'm in a hurry to get married.

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,360
I'm embarrassed to let you work for me.

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
So...

31
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
So, sister,

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:02:13,440
why don't you leave the

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
house?

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Zhang Xinyi, you bitch.

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Why is the box empty?

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
No.

37
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Wanwan, stop looking.

38
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,360
Did she hide the money in the house?

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
Wanwan, I...

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
I'll go ask her for the account book.

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
If she dares to hide the money,

42
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Brother Hong will have to fix it

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
and make it look good.

44
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
No.

45
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
No.

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Li Yuanyuan is here.

47
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Sister, I was just thinking about it.

48
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,360
How could you hand over the money so quickly?

49
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
You've already emptied the house.

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Sister, why don't you check the accounts

51
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,360
and see what the expenses are for?

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,360
You've already made a false account.

53
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,360
You want to ruin Brother Hong's wedding, right?

54
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Your Highness,

55
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,360
I'll be the one to tell the truth.

56
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
You tell the truth to your sister.

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Shut up.

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Don't try to get in my way.

59
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Wanwan, let's go.

60
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
I'm not going.

61
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,360
I won't leave until I make it clear.

62
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Look at you.

63
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
You don't know that the house

64
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
is empty.

65
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Impossible.

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,360
How could the house be empty?

67
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Since I married into the family,

68
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,360
they've been living in the house.

69
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,360
I used the dowry to pay off their debts.

70
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Then I used my mother's house to pay off the debt.

71
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
Now I'm living with the Crown Prince.

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Naturally, the accounts will be divided.

73
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
What she said is true?

74
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,360
The official's care is a waste of money.

75
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,360
It's a waste of money.

76
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
What about our wedding?

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
You're asking the right questions.

78
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
The wedding is about to start.

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,360
If the whole city knows about it,

80
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,360
I'm afraid that no one will know your identity.

81
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
I'll think of a way to get married.

82
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,360
I'll ask my mother to help me.

83
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,360
You're going to marry someone else?

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,360
What if the news spreads?

85
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
No.

86
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
I can't borrow money from my wedding.

87
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
How can you call me a concubine?

88
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
I know.

89
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Let's discuss this, okay?

90
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Hurry.

91
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
Close the door if you're late.

92
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Yes.

93
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Miss, Li Yuewan went into the palace.

94
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Wait for his good news.

95
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Miss, the day of the first day of the next month

96
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,360
is the day of my wedding with Brother Hong.

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Congratulations.

98
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,360
The city is the property of the royal family.

99
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,360
Congratulations.

100
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Please come in.

101
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Please come in.

102
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Congratulations.

103
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
You're here.

104
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Please come in.

105
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
Congratulations.

106
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,360
You're so handsome.

107
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,160
My estaburn aprender rather little.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,660
Why hasn't Zhang Xing arrived?

109
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,760
The Secondary Princessusst had come!

110
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
It's really a lot of work.

111
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
It's really a lot of work.

112
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
It's really a lot of work.

113
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Sister, please have some tea.

114
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Sister, I'm sorry.

115
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
I didn't mean to.

116
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
It's okay.

117
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Sister, your hairpin...

118
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Your hairpin...

119
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
The one on the hairpin is a phoenix.

120
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
The phoenix is the favorite of the empress.

121
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
The phoenix is the favorite of the empress.

122
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Young Master, you've made a big mistake.

123
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
You've made a big mistake.

124
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
This is a capital crime.

125
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Sister, you're trying to steal the phoenix.

126
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
You're trying to kill the whole family.

127
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Zhang Xiyin, you're so vicious.

128
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Go and take off your headband.

129
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Don't let him ruin my son's wedding.

130
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Everyone, the hairpin on my head is a golden bird, not a phoenix.

131
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,360
The phoenix has three tails, and the golden bird has only two.

132
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
A tail?

133
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Young Mistress, I heard that you don't have gold here.

134
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,360
I brought you a headband.

135
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Miss, how could Li Yuanyuan give you such a beautiful hairpin?

136
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Look again.

137
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
It's a phoenix.

138
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Only the empress can wear it.

139
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Miss, this is a capital crime.

140
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
Take this picture and find the craftsmen outside.

141
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Help me to get a headband.

142
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
It's really a golden bird.

143
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,360
No, the bride's wedding dress is embroidered with phoenix.

144
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
It's really a phoenix.

145
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Look, it's really a phoenix.

146
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,360
The phoenix is the princess's wedding dress.

147
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Could it be that you're the princess?

148
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Or you dare to pretend to be the princess?

149
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Nonsense! I made this up.

150
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Don't slander me.

151
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Everyone, I'm Zhang Shi, the emperor.

152
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,360
I'm the princess of the royal family.

153
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,360
If I say something wrong, it will implicate Zhang Shi.

154
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,360
How could I slander you with the whole family?

155
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
Zhang Xi, have you had enough?

156
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Enough.

157
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Go to the bridal chamber with Wanwan.

158
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Mother, the wedding dress of Princess Sizizhuo is a crime.

159
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,360
If this is spread out and the people know about it,

160
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm afraid it's hard to protect my reputation.

161
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,360
And sister, your hairpin...

162
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
and rouge are also the royal family's goods.

163
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
How dare she do that?

164
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Is it because you brought your sister from the border?

165
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Yes.

166
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,360
She's a victim of a major crime.

167
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Your Highness,

168
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,360
I've been wondering since you brought your sister back from the border.

169
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,360
How could a weak girl like you save your sister?

170
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
You...

171
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
You don't know your identity.

172
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Are you a spy from the Western Liang?

173
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
No, I was born in the capital.

174
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
When did you come to the capital?

175
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
What's your name?

176
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Did you have the imperial seal when you were born?

177
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Zhang Xi, are you crazy?

178
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Prince Ji is here.

179
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
The night is like a crisis.

180
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,360
The proud disguise in front of the eyes.

181
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,360
The sadness under the disguise.

182
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Why is there a flash of light.

183
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:53,360
The light of my sun is spreading.

184
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,360
You are my light.

185
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Open the endless darkness.

186
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Guide me to the future.

187
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,360
You are my light.

188
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Let me light up the road.

189
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Let's meet again.

190
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,360
The wind of time is breaking.

191
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
I'm in my heart.

192
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,360
The direction you are in is like a flame.

193
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Give me the power to fly.

194
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:29,360
I'm walking towards you.

195
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,360
I'm walking towards you.
