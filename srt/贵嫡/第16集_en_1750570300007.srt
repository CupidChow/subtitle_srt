1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,280
to find.

2
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
You've done your job?

3
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
Yes.

4
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
Living here,

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
is there anything wrong?

6
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
No.

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,280
You're helping me.

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,280
Besides, I never care about other people's comments.

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
Okay.

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,280
This time, Duan Xuanming lost his right to be the Emperor.

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
He will do it again to get the map.

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
Do you have any countermeasures?

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
My business told me that Duan Xuanming's Qingfeng Town

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,280
has been hit by a storm.

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
The grain is the foundation of the country.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
I plan to use this opportunity

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
to completely take it down.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
Okay.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
But this time,

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
I must be with you.

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
I must be with you.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,280
Duan Xuanming's eyes are everywhere.

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
You must be very careful.

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Let's go.

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
Mother, I'm hungry.

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Mother, I'm hungry.

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
I'm so hungry.

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Man Tou, Man Tou.

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Have pity on me.

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
Give it to me.

31
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Man Tou.

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Man Tou.

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Man Tou.

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Give it to me.

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Man Tou.

36
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Man Tou.

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Man Tou.

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Man Tou.

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
I didn't expect that

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
there is such a terrible disaster in the Great Yu State.

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
The First Prince is responsible for protecting the people.

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
He really did not care about such a terrible disaster.

43
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
It seems that we can only change the method

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
to help the people.

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
What? You want five cans of rice for 500 yuan.

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
Why don't you go and grab it?

47
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
That's right. Five cans of rice for 500 yuan.

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
One family is not enough for two days.

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Do you want to let people live?

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
This year, the disaster was caused by the natural disaster.

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
The harvest is not good.

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
The rice price is rising.

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
It's normal.

54
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
The court has ordered that one bag of rice

55
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
must not exceed three cans.

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

57
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,280
Who told you to catch the disaster?

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
The court is here.

59
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
He is also from this family.

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Now the First Prince is in charge of the Ministry of Revenue.

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
He has always...

62
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
Now this family is under the order of the First Prince.

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
The First Prince?

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
The First Prince is a bad person.

65
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
He is not good enough for the people.

66
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
He is a bad person.

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
He is a bad person.

68
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
You are a bad person.

69
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
How dare you make trouble here?

70
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
Beat him!

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
How dare you beat him?

72
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
Come on, take him away!

73
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Sir, these people made trouble in the rice shop today.

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
We just want to ask for a favor.

75
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Why should they arrest us?

76
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Yes, let us out!

77
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
How dare you!

78
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
You are poor.

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
You can't afford to make trouble.

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
What's the point of living?

81
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
It's best for you to die.

82
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Do it!

83
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Sir, you are so powerful.

84
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,280
Sir, you are so powerful.

85
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,280
Prince Ji, open the door!

86
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Prince Ji, I deserve to die.

87
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,280
I should arrest you.

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
I will let you out now.

89
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
You are right.

90
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
I am the one who made trouble.

91
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Sir, I am sorry.

92
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
I am sorry.

93
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
I am sorry.

94
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,280
You are under the order of the First Prince.

95
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
You are under the order of the First Prince.

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
You are under the order of the First Prince.

97
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
You are under the order of the First Prince.

98
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
What's the point of being punished?

99
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Sir, you are joking.

100
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
It's all a misunderstanding.

101
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
How about...

102
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
How about you come out first?

103
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
I should tell His Highness.

104
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,280
What?

105
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Uncle is in the dungeon?

106
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Yes.

107
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Why did he go to Qingfeng Town?

108
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
He is the one who made trouble.

109
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Good.

110
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
You want to use the Liang family to overthrow me.

111
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Do it secretly.

112
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Kill them all.

113
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Yes.

114
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Let's go.

115
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Your Majesty, please save His Highness.

116
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
What's wrong?

117
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
There is a situation in the area

118
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
where the Prince is deliberately killing the Mi Family.

119
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
The people are in danger.

120
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
They want to resist, but they are suppressed by the military.

121
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Prince Jin saved him

122
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,280
and was locked in the dungeon.

123
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
If you don't do it,

124
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
the people will be in danger.

125
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
Really?

126
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
It's a matter of life. I dare not speak.

127
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280
Your Majesty, this is the testimony

128
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,280
collected by Prince Jin and me.

129
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
It's evidence of the killing of the Mi Family.

130
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,280
He is really a traitor.

131
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
How dare he do such a thing?

132
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Prepare the horse.

133
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
I want to see

134
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
how capable

135
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
my good son is.

136
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
I'm going to kill him.

137
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
It turns out that my son is going to kill me.

138
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
Uncle,

139
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
why are you so stubborn?

140
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
I'm waiting for you here.

141
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
His Majesty is coming.

142
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
You traitor, stop!

143
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Your Highness, are you okay?

144
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
I'm fine.

145
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,280
I'm late.

147
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,280
You came just in time.

148
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
You fool!

149
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
How many times have I told you

150
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
to kill Zhang Xiyin?

151
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Don't touch Prince Jin.

152
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
Father, he has been to prison.

153
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
He knows everything.

154
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
He won't let me go.

155
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Mother, what should I do?

156
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
What should you do?

157
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
You are so good at killing others.

158
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
But you are so good at killing people.

159
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
You know how His Majesty

160
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
values you.

161
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
I know

162
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
you are a filial child.

163
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Now that

164
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
it has come to this,

165
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
I'm not satisfied.

166
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
You are actually

167
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
the son of Prince Xi Liang.

168
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
If you want to live,

169
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
you have to give up everything.

170
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
What do you mean?

171
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Go back to where you should go.

172
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
I'll be back.

173
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Your Highness,

174
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,280
it's him.

175
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
He sent Duan Xuanming out of the city.

176
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Tell me.

177
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
What's your relationship with the Queen?

178
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Don't kill me.

179
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
I'm just the empress's nanny.

180
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
I was sent out of the palace

181
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
a few years ago.

182
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
What's your relationship with the Queen?

183
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Well...

184
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
I mean,

185
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
20 years ago,

186
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Xi Liang lost the war.

187
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
He sent the prince to our country

188
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
to be the hostage.

189
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
The empress and the hostage

190
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,280
loved each other.

191
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
They were the current Prince Xi Liang.

192
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
But his father

193
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
broke up with him.

194
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Then the Prince Xi Liang

195
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
left.

196
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
The empress only went to the palace as a concubine.

197
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,280
What's the relationship

198
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
between Duan Xuanming and the Prince Xi Liang?

199
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,280
He's the son of the Prince Xi Liang.

200
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Before the empress was born,

201
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
she took the son of the Prince Xi Liang

202
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
into the palace

203
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
and exchanged him with her daughter, Li Yuowan.

204
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
She changed the son of the Prince Xi Liang

205
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,280
into her own child.

206
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
She did that

207
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
to help him ascend the throne

208
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
and help...

209
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Help Xi Liang

210
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
control the imperial jade.

211
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Your Highness, Your Highness,

212
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm just following the order.

213
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Please spare my life.

214
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
Go to the prison.

215
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Your Highness, please spare my life.

216
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Your Highness, please spare my life.

217
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
Your Highness,

218
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
His Majesty asked us to find the Prince as soon as possible.

219
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
It's been seven days.

220
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
I'm afraid it's too late.

221
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
It's too late.

222
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
Your Highness,

223
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
we can reach Xi Liang as soon as possible

224
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
according to the route of the傷到途.

225
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Song Ming fell

226
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
I'm trapped in the maze of the city

227
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
How bright your eyes are

228
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,280
The hatred is entwined in the heart

229
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
The night that seems to be in danger

230
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
The sun shines in front of the eyes

231
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
The proud disguise

232
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
The summer is covered in sadness

233
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
When will the snow fall

234
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
and the light shine again

235
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
The sun that shines on me

236
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
The sun that shines on me

237
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
You are my light

238
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
Open the endless darkness

239
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,280
Guide me to the future

240
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Run towards the light

241
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
You are my light

242
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Let me lead the way

243
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Sing with me

244
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,280
The wind of time

245
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
You are the fall

246
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
You are the light

247
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Let me lead the way

248
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Give me the power to fly

249
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Through the crowd

250
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
I walk towards you

251
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
I walk towards you

252
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,280
