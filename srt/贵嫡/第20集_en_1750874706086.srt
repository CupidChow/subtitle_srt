1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,960
Let's all

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You are not allowed to invite me in person.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am here, aren't I?

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Li Xingwan, you want to rebel?

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Twenty years.

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You should have enough of this position.

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What on earth do you want?

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I want you to get out of your own place.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
How dare you!

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Do you know that I am not a person who can be killed?

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Do you know that this is a crime against the Zhu family?

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
To my family, I am just a pawn.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They never treated me as a human.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why should I care about their lives?

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Duan Jianli is dead.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No one in the Great Yu can resist the Western Liang army.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I will take your dog today.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I will take over the six palaces.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I will see who dares to talk more.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You!

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Cheng Xiyin?

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What are you doing?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You don't think that someone will come to save you?

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I advise you not to waste your energy.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My people have surrounded the outside.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Duan Jianli is dead.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Even if you break your bones,

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
no one will come to save you.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You!

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You!

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jianli!

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Forgive me for being late.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's great that you are alive.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You are still alive.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are useless.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How can I die?

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This time,

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
there will be no trouble.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The useless will send someone to kill us.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's right.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So we have to prepare in advance.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We have a way.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If he doesn't want to kill us,

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
let's play a show.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I will be the one to kill him.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I will be the one to kill him.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We have to play a show.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Then we will beat him.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I have an idea.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have sent the letter to Chi Shu and Feng Dage in advance.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let them go to the street.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have prepared a iron-like armor.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We will all wear it.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So what?

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Even if you are lucky to live,

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
what can you do?

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The surrounding is surrounded by us.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Even if I die today,

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
you will fight against the Western Liang Army.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You will dream.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Are you talking about the useless people outside?

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Impossible.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
These are the good generals I have trained.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Take the people who are useless and all the rebels.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You...

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Your Highness,

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
there is still an army outside.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Kill them.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Wait.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There are Western Liang Army outside.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Of course.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
For this day,

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have prepared for more than ten years.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Your Highness,

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
do you remember the scene we saw in Western Liang?

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The people there are the same as the people in the capital.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There are old and young rebels in the family.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
They shouldn't be sacrificed for the greed of the upper class.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Your Highness,

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
you have fought in the battlefield for many years.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Isn't it for peace?

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If you kill them,

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
everything will be in vain.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Xiyin,

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
do you want me to stop killing them?

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The only way is

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
to make all of them

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
belong to us.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I will try.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Soldiers,

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
you have seen it.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No matter how much we resist,

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
we are still the traitors.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We will not resist,

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
but we will not give up.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We will kill them all.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Who says there is only one way?

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
As long as you give up your weapons,

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
His Majesty will let you leave the palace.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We are all Western Liang people.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We have no place to live.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You don't need to worry about it.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I promise you on behalf of the Zhang's Merchant House

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
to fight in the Zhang's Palace.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You have a mission to accomplish.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You have a lot of people in your family.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Is it to bring peace to the family,

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
or to destroy the family?

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I believe you have made a good choice.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If we can really go out and accomplish a good mission,

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
we don't have to fight every day.

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We don't have to be afraid anymore.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We are afraid of dying on the battlefield.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I will obey His Majesty.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Long live the Emperor.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Long live the Emperor.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
My Lady,

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
the Queen is dead.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
When the Western Liang King is in action,

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
the King of Ji will lead the army to fight.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
When he is victorious,

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
we will not have to be afraid anymore.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Chi Shu,

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I heard that the King is collecting supplies recently.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What do you need to tell me?

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The main thing is clothes and medicine.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The border is far from cold.

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Once the war starts, the supplies are in great loss.

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Even if there is a broadcast from the court,

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
it will be too late for the soldiers to get it.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
How did you get through before this?

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The King often sells the goods in the mansion.

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Otherwise, the soldiers will die.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's a common thing.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
No wonder the King's mansion has very few family members.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Xiao Ye,

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
go and invite the two managers of Zhang's Shopping.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
My Lady,

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
what do you mean?

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's a formal greeting.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I asked the two managers to come today

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
because I want to gather some supplies

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
to give to the King of Ji.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Give them to the soldiers.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How much do you want?

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
One million.

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That much?

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Your Highness,

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
this amount can be used for three or five years.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I think you all know

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
what happened to me a while ago.

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If it weren't for the King of Ji,

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I wouldn't be standing here right now.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Then we have to repay the kindness.

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The sand is the battle field.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The border soldiers gave up their lives

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
to defend the territory.

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We can do business at ease.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So helping them is helping us.

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Don't worry, Master.

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We will do our best.

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The medicine is sufficient in the shop,

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
but it's not easy to transport it.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If we can make a drug store,

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
it can keep the drug effect,

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and it's easy to transport,

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
but it takes time.

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll give you seven days to prepare.

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
As for how to do it,

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I only want the result.

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't worry, Master.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
My Lady.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
My Lady, Princess Jingyang sent this.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Did she leave anything behind?

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Her Highness heard that the Princess was preparing

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and said that if you need help,

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
go to the Princess's Mansion.

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Xiyin is here.

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Greetings, Princess.

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Sit.

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I heard that Her Highness

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
often cares about the people,

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and cares about the state affairs.

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I am deeply sad

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
that Xiyin is a merchant of the Great Yu.

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I didn't see the wrong person.

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If you need any help,

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
just tell me.

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I will send the goods to Prince Ji's Mansion as soon as possible.

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I believe that His Highness will be happy

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
when he receives them.

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You don't have to tell him about this.

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm afraid...

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Xiyin, do you know that

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
after Jianli went to the border,

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
he never returned to the capital.

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I heard a little bit about it.

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Actually, it's my fault.

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We were too young at that time.

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
In addition to the provocation of my sister-in-law,

206
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I was confused to kill my mother

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
because of her.

208
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Mother!

209
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's you!

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's that little prince who starved the Princess Dowager.

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The Princess Dowager is always healthy.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
She will start to complain after she is born.

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That year, he was only six years old.

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He went to the border with the general.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Actually, I have been to the border to find him

216
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
for years.

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But he didn't want to see me

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
or take my things.

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If it wasn't for my brother's order,

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
he wouldn't have come back.

221
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I always owe him an apology.

222
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I hope His Highness doesn't want to see you.

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I believe he must have his difficulties.

224
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm relieved to have a colleague like you.

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Your Highness,

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I need your help.

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Tell me.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I bought a batch of flowers a few days ago.

229
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But I can't plant them in the right place.

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I want to ask you to give me some advice.

231
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay.

232
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You woke up so early.

233
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I prepared some gifts for you.

234
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Do you want to see?

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
These?

236
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And...

237
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Guess what's in the box.

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Cotton.

239
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Your Highness, you can open it.

240
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's cotton.

241
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's wool.

243
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's light and warm. It's also very absorbent.

244
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So the soldiers at the border

245
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
don't have to suffer from colds.

246
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And these shoes

247
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
are wool and goose feathers.

248
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Although they are heavy,

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
they can keep you warm.

250
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
When did you prepare them?

251
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Seven days ago.

252
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You prepared so much in seven days?

253
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Of course, it's not my own contribution.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Your Highness is smart.

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Can't you guess who the person is

256
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
who is the person?

257
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
My sister?

258
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Princess Jinyan has been thinking about you.

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
She knew I was going to prepare some supplies.

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So she helped me.

261
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Since you and Princess Jinyan are both thinking about each other,

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
why don't you open your heart today?

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I have to prepare some snacks.

264
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'll leave you alone.

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Sister Hong.

266
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The night is dark.

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
In front of the eyes,

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
the proud disguise

269
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
is covered with sadness.

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Why is there a flash of light

271
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
that pierces through the fog

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and the sun that shines on me?

273
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You are my light.

274
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The endless darkness

275
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
guides me

276
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
to the future

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and rush to the light.

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You are my light.

279
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You light up my way

280
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and guide me to the future.

281
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The sound of time

282
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
is breaking into my heart.

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The direction you are in

284
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
is like a flame

285
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
that gives me the power to fly.

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Through the crowd,

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I walk towards

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
your side.

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The light is breaking through my heart.

290
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The direction you are in

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
is like a flame

292
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
that gives me the power to fly.

293
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Through the crowd,

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I walk towards

295
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
your side.

296
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The direction you are in

297
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
is like a flame

298
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
that gives me the power to fly.

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Through the crowd,

300
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I walk towards

301
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
your side.

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The direction you are in
