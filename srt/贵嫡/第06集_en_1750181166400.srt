The Long Ballad

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My son, Zhang Xin,

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
is having an affair.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Please...

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Dian Qian Si?

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Marquis Ding An,

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Old Madam,

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
long time no see.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You are...

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Prince Ji?

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Greetings, Prince Ji.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Young Madam, don't bother.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You saved the life of my family.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I heard that you have a marriage to attend to,

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
so I came to congratulate you.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But,

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Old Madam said

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
you caused some trouble.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Is that true?

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well...

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Then I will tell you the truth.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Prince Ji,

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I am old,

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and I am confused.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It was that new wife

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
who made trouble there.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Thanks to Xiyin,

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
she has been protecting the reputation of our family.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, some small things happened.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Right, Xiyin?

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Is that so?

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Xiyin is virtuous,

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but Wanwan is stupid.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Then I have to pacify Wanwan.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't let any trouble happen to her.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I will go now.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I will go now.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Xiyin,

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
if there is anything,

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
just tell me.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I will help you.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If Marquis Ding An keeps protecting her,

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
how can he have the tongue of a snake?

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But don't worry.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I will protect her.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I am so sorry for your loss today.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Please forgive me.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Not only that,

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
you can drink with me.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I have to thank you for tonight.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No need.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What you asked me to check last time

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
has been found.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Princess, look.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is he telling my background to Prince Ji?

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We are going to be finished.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He is a cheap woman from Shanggu.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What can he know?

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Princess, don't scare yourself.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Go.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Go and ask someone to send a bottle of wine

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
to Prince Ji.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Zhang Xiyin,

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I will make you lose your reputation.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Prince Ji, Young Madam.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is the jade and silver spring from the mansion.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's a gift for you.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Please forgive me for not treating you well.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Put it down.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I will pour it for you.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Please.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I am in the room

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to talk with Prince Ji.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is a serious matter.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Are you sure?

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What are you doing?

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What's wrong?

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Prince Ji is a guest in the mansion.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I am introducing him to father.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Is there anything wrong?

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Wait.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There is something wrong with this wine.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This wine

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
is too strong to be drunk.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It will make you lose your reputation.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Then,

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
it's too strong to be drunk.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Impossible.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's impossible.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's impossible.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's impossible.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's impossible.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Impossible.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I saw you two were having an affair.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Younger Sister,

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
this is Prince Ji.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You are so honest.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Are you going to...

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Fool.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Prince,

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
this is totally wrong.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This mansion is quite old.

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you have any other questions,

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
you can come to my mansion.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Brother Hong,

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
they are really having an affair.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Enough.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Stop talking.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
When Prince Ji asks about the wedding,

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
we should all be killed.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Prince.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Prince,

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I am really grateful to you.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But I am not doing this for my own sake.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Prince,

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I really want to be your servant.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Prince,

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
you don't have to rush to return to the mansion.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I can wait.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's go.

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and ignore the royal system

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and deceive the emperor.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,040
It's a

128
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
execution

129
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,040
of the imperial court.

130
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Impossible.

131
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
What execution?

132
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
I want to see my mother.

133
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
She will save me.

134
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Why do you need to go to the palace to see the empress?

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's their fault.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Please let us go.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Please let us go.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's their fault.

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll do whatever you want.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Please spare us.

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Spare us.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Kill.

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Don't kill me.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What's wrong, baby?

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What's wrong?

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Qu Jiangniang

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
is going to kill us.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
She wants to deceive the emperor and kill us.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Wanwan.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You are scared by what happened today.

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's okay.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Go to Jiangniang.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Mother.

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Zhang Xiyi must have known something.

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
When Li Mao changed the crown prince,

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
only the empress and my husband knew.

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Wanwan, don't think too much.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
When you took me out of the palace,

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
did no one see it?

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Did father do something wrong?

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Father has always been a good man.

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
How can you doubt him?

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Brother Hong.

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm worried about the marquis and my mother.

165
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Once my identity is exposed,

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
it will be too late.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We are all guilty of death.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Brother Hong.

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why don't you take a rest?

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No.

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Before we get all the goods of the Zhang family,

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
we can't rest.

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Wanwan, don't worry.

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
After the empress's work is done,

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
we will make a decision.

176
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay?

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No.

178
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The guests who were in the wedding last night

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
seem to know my identity.

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I want to enter the palace.

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
After I take over, I will kill Zhang Xiyi.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't worry.

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The Zhang family's business

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
will definitely be ours.

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You are in such a hurry

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
to enter the palace for such a small matter?

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Mother.

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Your Highness.

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This is a matter of life and death.

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This Zhang Xiyi

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
has many tricks.

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Good girl.

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Listen to me.

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Leave the palace first.

195
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
When the Mid-Autumn Festival is over,

196
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I will invite the people of the Ding'an Mansion

197
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
to have dinner together.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
After that,

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
the Zhang family

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and Zhang Xiyi

201
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
will be the next Qiong.

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Thank you, mother.

203
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Can they hear our mother and daughter talking?

204
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
They can't hear it.

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Miss, the court is in a hurry.

206
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We have to go now.

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Miss, a letter from the court today.

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The Ding'an Mansion

209
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
is willing to participate in the palace's Mid-Autumn Festival.

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But this dinner

211
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
is not always

212
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
held in the royal family

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
before it can be attended.

214
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I heard that

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
it was the palace of the Crown Prince.

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The Empress invited you.

217
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You and the Crown Prince

218
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
are still husband and wife.

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm afraid you have to attend this dinner.

220
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Then go.

221
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But this is our first time entering the palace.

222
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The Empress will definitely make it difficult for you.

223
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If I don't go this time,

224
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
she will have thousands of ways

225
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
to make it difficult for me in the future.

226
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Miss, why are you shaking?

227
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Silly girl, I'm happy.

228
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We are finally going to meet,

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Your Highness.

230
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The rain turns into flowers,

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
how bright your eyes are,

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
the grudge surrounds the heart.

233
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The night is like a crisis,

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the sun is in front of me,

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
under the pretence of being proud,

236
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm holding this sadness.

237
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
When will there be a snow and a light,

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
breaking through the fog,

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
being my sun.

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You are my light,

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
breaking through the endless darkness,

242
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
guiding me to the future,

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
running towards the light.

244
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You are my light,

245
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
leading me to the bright future,

246
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
accompanying me to the future.

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The flying of time,

248
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
one year after another,

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
falls on my heart.

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The direction you are in,

251
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
is like a firefly,

252
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
giving me the power to fly.

253
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The moon is shining,

254
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
the whole world is blinding,

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm walking towards your side step by step.

256
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The sky is dark,

257
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
the moon is bright,

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the moon is in front of me,

259
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
the sky is in front of me,

260
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
the moon is in front of me,

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the moon is in front of me,

262
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
the moon is in front of me,

263
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
the moon is in front of me,

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
the moon is in front of me,

265
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the moon is in front of me,

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
the moon is in front of me,

267
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the moon is in front of me,

268
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
the moon is in front of me,

269
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
the moon is in front of me,

270
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
the moon is in front of me,

271
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
the moon is in front of me,

272
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
the moon is in front of me,

273
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
the moon is in front of me,

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the moon is in front of me,

275
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the moon is in front of me,

276
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
the moon is in front of me,

277
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
the moon is in front of me,
