1
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,580
When you don't love me,

2
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,380
show no mercy until death.

3
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,780
Dissipation,

4
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,740
the princess phi from the distribution

5
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
The bride's father was on the border, and he was called to the border at the wedding night.

6
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,740
There was no mutual affection between us.

7
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,740
I know the melon is not sweet,

8
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,740
but because my father and mother are very grateful to me,

9
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,740
I can't help but listen to my father and mother's teachings.

10
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,740
So I thought of this way to break the curse.

11
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,740
That's great!

12
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,740
Xiangye,

13
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,740
I always think of the balance.

14
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,740
Since there is no meaning, let's sign the marriage agreement now.

15
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,740
My Lord, Madam, and Your Highness, Eunuch Fang is here to announce the marriage agreement.

16
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,740
Hurry, go out and win. It must be my son's reward. Hurry!

17
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,740
Miss, the crown prince is too much.

18
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,740
How can you agree to them?

19
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,740
I heard that the crown prince has made a contribution to the border,

20
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,740
and he will definitely be promoted to the official position.

21
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,740
After you enter the mansion, you serve their family and also take home-made subsidies.

22
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,740
Now you are separated, it's good to ask him to finish the battle.

23
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,740
Who says that is the crown prince's blessing?

24
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,740
Is the wife of Duke Ding'an here?

25
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,740
Is the wife of Duke Ding'an here?

26
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,740
I am here.

27
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,740
You are the wife of the Duke of Ping, Li Yuewan?

28
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,740
The wife of the Duke of Ping is like a concubine, the wife of the Duke of Ping is like a concubine.

29
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,740
How dare you agree to the marriage agreement?

30
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,740
The wife of the Duke of the Marquis, Zhang Shi, Zhang Xiyin, receive the edict.

31
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,740
Zhang Shi is here.

32
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,740
Please forgive me for calling you the wife of the Duke of Ping.

33
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,740
The emperor has given the edict.

34
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,740
I am here to pay homage to the wife of the Duke of the Marquis, Zhang Shi.

35
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,740
She is a good wife, a good wife, and a virtuous wife.

36
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,740
She is the most beautiful woman in the capital.

37
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,740
She is the second-class wife of the Duke of Ping,

38
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,740
and she is very kind and kindhearted.

39
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,740
She is a very good wife.

40
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,740
The wife of the Duke of Ping is very kind and kindhearted.

41
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,740
She has a beautiful face and is rich.

42
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,740
She has a beautiful face with ten thousand pieces of jewellery.

43
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,740
She is 20 jin of gold and 3,000 pieces of gold.

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,740
Here is the edict.

45
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,740
Thank you, eunuch.

46
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,740
Xiyin, we are a family, right?

47
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,060
You are the wife of the Marquis,

48
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,340
and you deserve such honor.

49
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,300
We are all happy for you, right?

50
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,140
Come here.

51
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,460
Take these things back.

52
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,380
Wait.

53
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,020
Hurry up.

54
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,860
Mother,

55
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,860
His Majesty gave this to me.

56
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,260
I just signed the marriage agreement with the Crown Prince.

57
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,020
I will take these gifts back to the Zhang family.

58
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,020
Xiuang Yi.

59
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,740
Xiyin,

60
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,380
you are not concerned about the friendship between the two families.

61
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,420
I and the Crown Prince are just husband and wife.

62
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,660
What friendship?

63
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,340
Guards,

64
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,740
take these things away.

65
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,580
This...

66
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,620
My Lady,

67
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,940
how did you know that the reward was not for the Crown Prince?

68
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,940
You must be confident in your life,

69
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,740
and then you will be blessed with a good marriage.

70
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,340
I can let you marry him,

71
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,580
but I still need you to find the Prefect of Defense.

72
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,580
My father-in-law?

73
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,140
The Prefect of Defense will supervise the officials.

74
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,580
He will definitely help you.

75
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,900
Please tell His Majesty

76
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,900
that Zhou Yihong is not concerned about the marriage agreement

77
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,260
and will give him the reward.

78
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,660
But I am willing to let Li Yueman be my wife

79
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,340
and repay my kindness.

80
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,140
In this case,

81
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,180
my sister is virtuous

82
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,740
and may get the reward.

83
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,420
Husband,

84
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,460
father, mother,

85
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,940
His Majesty will not give him the reward for no reason.

86
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,980
What did he do?

87
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,020
The father-in-law of the Zhang family is the Prefect of Defense.

88
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,860
Wanwan,

89
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,500
you need to investigate the consequences of this matter

90
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,020
to the Empress.

91
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,660
Don't forget my son's reward.

92
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,460
At least,

93
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,260
you have to keep his position as the Imperial Guard.

94
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,580
Okay, father, don't worry.

95
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,700
I will go early tomorrow morning.

96
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,380
Zhang Xiyin promised you to be my wife.

97
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,740
I thought he was sensible.

98
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,820
But he took the reward back to the Zhang family.

99
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,420
He must not want to be used by my family anymore.

100
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,100
Everything in the Zhang family is my family.

101
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,620
Everyone wants to leave my family.

102
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,420
Qicun.

103
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,740
Qicun,

104
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,780
pick some good ones at home.

105
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,780
The ones who get the reward

106
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,220
will be back soon.

107
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,620
Yes, Madam.

108
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,620
I will go and buy them now.

109
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,180
Be careful with the fire.

110
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,500
It's not a good way.

111
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Leave the things here.

112
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,220
Why are you still standing there?

113
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,060
You, who are sensible,

114
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,260
leave the things here.

115
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,460
Brother,

116
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,540
we are just giving some things to our family.

117
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,220
Please let us go.

118
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,300
We can leave the goods here.

119
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,020
Somebody, there's a robbery!

120
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,020
Shut up!

121
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,820
Somebody, help!

122
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,500
I said shut up!

123
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,620
Do you hear me?

124
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,900
My face!

125
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,340
Stop fighting!

126
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,340
Stop fighting!

127
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,060
There's a robbery here!

128
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,340
Your Highness.

129
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,220
It seems that you already know who I am.

130
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,140
Your Highness, you are so wise.

131
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,500
No one knows that

132
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,300
my reward was stolen by the bandits.

133
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,580
Please help me to justice.

134
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,260
It's really a coincidence.

135
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,060
It happened under my nose.

136
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,260
Not only did I prepare some things to protect myself,

137
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,820
I also put some powder on the carriage.

138
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,500
My Lady,

139
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,660
why do we have to put powder on the carriage?

140
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,420
How can we ignore the situation of the King of Qin entering the palace?

141
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,500
The powder will shine in the dark.

142
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,260
It's hard to wash it off if it gets on the clothes and skin.

143
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,700
If there are bandits who want to steal our rewards,

144
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,380
we can catch them.

145
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,020
We are all weak women.

146
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,100
How can we catch them if there are bandits?

147
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,700
I have arranged for tonight's night.

148
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,380
We will go back from Tianshui Town.

149
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,380
Okay.

150
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,300
I remember that King Ji hasn't returned to the capital yet.

151
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,660
He must have other plans to come back early.

152
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,060
I can talk to him about cooperation

153
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,380
while we are married.

154
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,660
It's not a coincidence.

155
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
There are bandits who want to harm me.

156
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,460
I prepared some things to protect myself

157
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,460
and came to seek your protection.

158
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,460
I'm sorry that I can't help you.

159
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,460
It's a limited business.

160
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,460
But I can make the whole mansion speechless.

161
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,900
What do you mean?

162
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,460
If I guess it right,

163
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,460
the person you want to catch is in the mansion.

164
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,460
What are you guessing?

165
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,460
I want to help you.

166
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,460
You want to help me?

167
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,540
You want to use me?

168
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,540
You can use me too.

169
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,540
The secret agents of West Liang are all dead.

170
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,540
Only one escaped.

171
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,540
I've checked everywhere.

172
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,540
I've checked Ding'an Mansion and didn't see them.

173
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,540
Listen up.

174
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,540
Today, His Majesty's reward is a robbery.

175
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,540
He has sent someone to the mansion.

176
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,540
The whole mansion is in danger.

177
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,620
I'll ask the money from the money store to investigate.

178
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,620
If anyone doesn't cooperate...

179
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,620
Shen.

180
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,620
What are you doing?

181
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,620
My husband, I just met the bandits

182
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,620
and took all the rewards.

183
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,620
I've been looking for them

184
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,620
and found them in the mansion.

185
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,620
I suspect they are traitors.

186
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,620
So I brought them here to investigate.

187
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
If they are traitors,

188
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,700
they will come to Ding'an Mansion.

189
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,700
They don't need to be guarded.

190
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,700
They are bold

191
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
and brave.

192
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,700
They are not a threat to His Majesty.

193
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
I advise Ding'an Mansion and Madam

194
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,700
to leave him to the police.

195
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
They don't need to cover up.

196
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
If they don't cooperate,

197
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
they will be killed.

198
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,700
My lord, I dare not.

199
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,700
But

200
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,700
you can only use the words of Xiyin

201
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,780
to search the mansion.

202
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,780
Otherwise,

203
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,780
you don't take my mansion seriously.

204
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,780
It's good to find out.

205
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,780
If you can't find out,

206
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,780
you will ruin my mansion's reputation.

207
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,780
What will you do?

208
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,780
Don't worry, I've already told you.

209
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,780
I put my soul on the reward.

210
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,780
I'll be careful when I get close.

211
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,780
If the bandits are in the mansion,

212
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,780
they won't escape.

213
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,780
You are a man of your word.

214
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,780
If you can't find out,

215
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,860
I will take all the losses

216
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,860
and the loss of Xiyin.

217
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,860
I'm tired of running to the light.

218
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,860
You are my light.

219
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,860
Shine on me.

220
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,860
Let's go through the rain together.

221
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,860
The time flies.

222
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,860
The time flies.

223
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,860
The time flies.

224
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,860
The time flies.

225
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,860
The time flies.

226
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
The time flies.

227
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,860
The time flies.

228
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,860
The time flies.

229
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,860
The time flies.

230
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,860
The time flies.

231
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,940
Behind you.
