1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,500
I had Zapמׁк mile Randy

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Episode 15

3
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Your Highness, we've checked.

4
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
The palace is indeed from the Western Liang.

5
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
It seems that the palace has been shielded by them.

6
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
The Western Liang has been beaten by you and retreated to the border.

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
What else do they want?

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Now we need to know who sent them to the palace.

9
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
Only then can we know their purpose.

10
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
I'll investigate it now.

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
The maid who assassinated you is from the Western Liang.

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Why would the Western Liang kill you?

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,500
In theory,

14
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
you have no connection with the palace.

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
You were assassinated when you came out of the Qian Kun Palace.

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Could it be that the Empress did it?

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
It shouldn't be her.

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
How is that possible?

19
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
I know my mistake.

20
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Your Highness, I'm sure you can see that

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
the Empress confessed so easily just now.

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
It seems that she's covering up someone.

23
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
The palace is full of enemies.

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Li Yuewan is a lowly concubine, but the Empress is a lowly concubine.

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Could it be that it's her?

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Why did she kill you?

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
I guess it's because

28
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Li Yuewan is the Empress's biological daughter.

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,500
What?

30
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
I guess you know that

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
Li Yuewan saved Zhou Yihong at the border.

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Then she was promoted to the Empress's concubine

33
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
and became Zhou Yihong's concubine.

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
And the Empress has been in the palace for a long time.

35
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Why would she be so sad about a border girl?

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
And she even prepared her dowry in person.

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Don't you think it's strange?

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
From what I've observed,

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
the Ding'an House is very careful about her.

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
The whole family is worried about her.

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
They're afraid that she'll offend her.

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
If Li Yuewan is the Empress's biological daughter,

43
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
then the identity of the eldest prince

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
may not be the legitimate enemy.

45
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Even if it's as you said,

46
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,500
it's not necessary to steal the position of the wife of Li Yuewan.

47
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
She's in the palace, in a place with a deep barrier.

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
She's trying to kill you.

49
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,500
So I'm afraid there's a bigger conspiracy behind them.

50
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Since they can't wait to do it,

51
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
I'll have to do it.

52
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
My Lady.

53
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Just now, many of the officials

54
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
sent these invitations and gifts.

55
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
They asked you to go to the residence.

56
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
My Lady, I don't quite understand.

57
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Since we have Prince Ji as our guest,

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
why don't we let him directly solve the Empress and the Marquis' problem?

59
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Of course, I have to solve my own problem.

60
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Isn't that very troublesome?

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Silly girl.

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
The Empress has a great power.

63
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Prince Ji has been in the capital for years and has a unstable foundation.

64
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
It's easy to bring down the Empress.

65
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
So, we need more leverage.

66
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Look at these chrysanthemums.

67
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
I personally made them.

68
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
They're very beautiful.

69
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Who is the lady that the eldest princess is pulling?

70
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
I've never seen her before.

71
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Zhang Xinying.

72
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,500
She's the lady that Prince Ji recognized as Mu Lian.

73
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
It's her.

74
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Greetings, First Princess.

75
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

76
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
All rise.

77
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Jin Yang.

78
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,500
The chrysanthemums in your garden are very beautiful.

79
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Why is Sister-in-law free today?

80
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Please have a seat.

81
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Thank you.

82
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
So beautiful.

83
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
So beautiful.

84
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,500
The legendary Three-Word-Position is indeed very famous.

85
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
You're indeed the princess who loves to act like a fool.

86
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
You actually prepared such beautiful chrysanthemums.

87
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Even a commoner like me would like to send them home.

88
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
But, Lady Yi Jun is here.

89
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Don't think about it.

90
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
She must have taken the Three-Word-Position away.

91
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Are you trying to hint that I'm going to quit?

92
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
I...

93
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Are you trying to take the Queen away

94
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
but you're afraid that I'll compete with you?

95
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
It seems that everyone likes my Three-Word-Position.

96
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Then, let's start selling it.

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,500
This autumn festival is free to sell.

98
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Some of the sales are handed over to the state.

99
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Some are used to settle the refugees.

100
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,500
The price of this Three-Word-Position is 500 pieces.

101
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
The highest price is...

102
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
600.

103
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
700.

104
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
800.

105
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
1000.

106
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
1200.

107
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
5000.

108
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
I'm willing to use 5000 pieces to take the Three-Word-Position away

109
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
and give it to the Queen.

110
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
May the Queen be blessed with good health

111
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
and all the best.

112
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Jin Yang, what do you think?

113
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,500
If Lady Sourire says so, who would dare to bargain with her?

114
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Isn't she talking to the Queen?

115
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,500
The Queen only deserves such a treasure.

116
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
But, 5000 pieces are really too few.

117
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,500
I'm willing to give 100,000 pieces to the Queen.

118
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
100,000 pieces?

119
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
100,000 pieces?

120
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
That's too cheap.

121
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Compared to that, Lady Sourire's price is too cheap.

122
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
110,000.

123
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
150,000.

124
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
160,000.

125
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
180,000.

126
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Stop shouting. We really don't have...

127
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Lady Sourire, if you don't have money, don't bargain.

128
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,500
After all, it's more embarrassing to pretend to be fat than to have no money.

129
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
200,000 pieces.

130
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
200,000 pieces.

131
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
If that's the case, I won't bargain with you.

132
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
After all, we are family.

133
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Your feelings are my feelings.

134
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Sister, you're scheming against me.

135
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Sister, why do you say that?

136
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
You paid the price yourself.

137
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
It has nothing to do with me.

138
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Congratulations.

139
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Your Highness, I've been investigating Li Yuewan and the Crown Prince.

140
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
I've seen Li Yuewan and the Crown Prince at the border.

141
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
I've seen the Crown Prince and the Crown Prince at the border.

142
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Your Highness, we have no choice.

143
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Your Highness, please investigate it.

144
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Miss, a letter from Prince Ji.

145
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Your Highness, please.

146
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Did you two serve Li Yuewan at the border?

147
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
This is Mrs. Jun.

148
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Tell her everything you know.

149
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Okay.

150
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
My name is Dan Hong.

151
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
I'm here to meet Yue Gui.

152
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
When we were in the capital,

153
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,500
he rented our house and served us.

154
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
But then, I don't know why,

155
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
he moved away overnight.

156
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Yes, he didn't even pay us the rent.

157
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Do you have a certificate?

158
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Yes.

159
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
This is our identity document

160
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,500
and the contract for the house that Miss Li rented.

161
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
So you knew he was from the capital?

162
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Yes.

163
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
He said he was from the capital.

164
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
He even showed us that

165
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
he brought everything he could bring from the capital.

166
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
He often said that

167
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
he was a very good stepmother.

168
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
He loved her and treated her so well.

169
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
At first, we didn't believe him.

170
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
We thought he was a young lady

171
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,500
raised by a rich family in the capital.

172
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
When His Highness found us,

173
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
we found out that

174
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
his stepmother was the Crown Prince of Tian'an.

175
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
The Crown Prince of Tian'an, Zhou Yihong,

176
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
was a refugee at the border.

177
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
His wife, Wan, didn't care about his innocence

178
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
and kept her in the room.

179
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
That's why she hid from us.

180
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Do you know about this?

181
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
How is that possible?

182
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Our house is right next to the Crown Prince's house.

183
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
How could a refugee dare to do such a thing?

184
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Is this a mistake?

185
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Miss Li was raised by her fiance.

186
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Can we still see her fiance

187
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
and visit her?

188
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Do you mean it?

189
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Of course.

190
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Madam, we dare not lie.

191
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Li Yuemin and Zhou Yihong have obviously had an affair.

192
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,500
They had a fight and had a private operation.

193
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
And they lied to you about marrying them.

194
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Would you two like to help me?

195
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Of course we would.

196
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
I need you two to play a show with me.

197
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
After the show is over,

198
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
I will allow you to work in Zhang's shop

199
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
and live a carefree life.

200
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
That's great.

201
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Thank you, Madam.

202
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Thank you, Madam.

203
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Thank you, Madam.

204
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
The sun is shining in the distance.

205
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
The proud disguise

206
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
is covering the sadness.

207
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
When will you say goodbye?

208
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
The coldness is spreading.

209
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Be my sun.

210
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
You are my light.

211
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Push open the endless darkness.

212
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Guide me to the future.

213
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Run towards the light.

214
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
You are my light.

215
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Guide me to the future.

216
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Sing with me.

217
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
The time flies.

218
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
I am in my heart year by year.

219
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
The direction you are in is so bright.

220
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
The wind is blowing.

221
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Give me the power to fly.

222
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Through the crowd,

223
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:50,500
I am walking towards you.

224
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,500
