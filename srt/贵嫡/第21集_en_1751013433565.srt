6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm fine.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I always think of you.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I was young and ignorant.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I blamed my mother's death on you.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't have left so many years ago.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's my fault as a sister.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Huang Jian.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Actually,

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I haven't blamed you for so many years.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Then why don't you want to see me?

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Because I'm afraid I'll get you into trouble.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You!

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Someone poisoned you again?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
These people are really heartbroken.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Mother is already gone.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
They won't let you go.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's just a rumor from the Death Sword.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They put a black hat on you.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's so despicable.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is a black mantou.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This flower is the most difficult to raise.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The petals are like a lotus knife.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And it's poisonous.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So many people don't like to raise it.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But it can save your life.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Huang Jian, don't you eat?

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've eaten. I'm not hungry.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm full.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Huang Jian.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I've grown up.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
From now on,

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll be your mother.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's been so long.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It seems that I've been hit by someone again.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What are you talking about?

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can't control yourself now.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then,

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
it's good to become a family.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I've been bothering you for a long time.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll go first.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you for this time.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You don't have to thank me.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm happy to see you and the princess get along.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The expedition is coming soon.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Wait for me.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The expedition is coming soon.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Wait for me.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm happy to see you and the princess get along.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The expedition is coming soon.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Wait for me.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm happy to see you and the princess get along.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The expedition is coming soon.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Wait for me.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm happy to see you and the princess get along.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The expedition is coming soon.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Wait for me.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm happy to see you and the princess get along.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The expedition is coming soon.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Wait for me.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm happy to see you and the princess get along.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The expedition is coming soon.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Wait for me.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is for you.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Wait for me.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm happy to see you and the princess get along.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The expedition is coming soon.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Wait for me.

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm happy to see you and the princess get along.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's been three months.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
See the old Fengchun again.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
There are endless things outside the Mo's Sky.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Long live the emperor.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Miss.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Xiangye,

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I told you to deliver the goods to the Imperial Household Department.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, I have sent them there.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I am here to deliver the letter.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Didn't you say that

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I would inform you when I heard about the news of the border?

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Is there news of the border?

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The King of Jin led troops to attack the Western Liang Palace at night

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and killed the King of Western Liang to get back the power.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The war between our Dayu and Western Liang has ended completely.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There is no Western Liang in the world after this.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's great.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What about the Prince? When will he return to the capital?

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It should be only these days.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now the news is spreading slowly.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
When I knew it, it was already three days ago.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Miss.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Shi Shou,

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
why are you back?

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Then the Prince...

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The Prince asked you to go to the city building.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This way, please.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Go.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Prince.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You are here.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I thought you would come back in a few days.

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But I have an urgent matter to attend to.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why don't you hurry up and finish it?

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The war has ended.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Is there anything else urgent?

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Your life-long great cause.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Shi Shou, understand.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Prince, this is...

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Your wedding gift.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Xinyin,

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I have always loved you.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I am willing to marry you today.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I entrust you with my life.

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
With you,

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I can live a life of love.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My heart can be filled with heaven and earth.

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I, Duan Jianli,

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
swear to be the one who will marry everyone in the city.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I swear to be the one who will marry everyone in the city.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I swear to be the one who will marry everyone in the city.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I swear to be the one who will marry everyone in the city.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I will love you alone in this life.

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I will never give up on you.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Lady Zhang,

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
you should agree to this.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In my territory,

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I can be a poet and a poet.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can't kill my enemies for the country.

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I am a good dancer and a good dancer.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I can't find another good husband

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
even if I have to go to the whole country.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Lady,

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Prince is a talented man.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If you marry him,

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I will be at ease.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Lady,

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you should agree to this.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you marry him,

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I will be at ease.

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I agree.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What did you say?

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I agree.

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Good!

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Good!

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Good!

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Good!

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Good!

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Time flies.

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It falls one by one.

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You are in the direction of my heart.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The light in front of the tree.

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The reason for my flying.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I pass through the crowd.

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Sister,

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I am one step away from you.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Sister,

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I thought I was destined to be a hero.

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Thank you.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
God bless me.

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I met you.

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's my life's pleasure to marry you.

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's also my life's pleasure.

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I swear,

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
all the bad things you've encountered before,

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I won't let it happen again.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You are my light.

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The endless darkness.

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It guides me to the future.

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I run towards the light.

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You are my light.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You light up my way.

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Accompany me to the journey.

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The light of the snow.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You are in the direction of my heart.

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The light in front of the tree.

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The reason for my flying.

185
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I pass through the crowd.

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I am one step away from you.

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's my life's pleasure to marry you.

188
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's also my life's pleasure.

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I met you.

190
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's my life's pleasure.

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I swear,

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
all the bad things you've encountered before,

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I won't let it happen again.

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You are my light.

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The endless darkness.

196
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It guides me to the future.

197
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I run towards the light.

198
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You are my light.

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You light up my way.

200
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Accompany me to the journey.

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The light of the time.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You are in the direction of my heart.

203
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The light in front of the tree.

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The reason for my flying.

205
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I pass through the crowd.

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I am one step away from you.
