1
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,506
Just straight through there.

2
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,941
Hello!

3
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,418
Hello! Hello!

4
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:23,707
Welcome rose.

5
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:26,277
- There. Oh, who else? Who else?
- Morning!

6
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:28,779
Good morning to all of you.

7
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:31,132
This is for you.

8
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:32,856
There.

9
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,597
Good morning, everyone!

10
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,312
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

11
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:38,081
You all seem unenthusiastic.

12
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,520
- Huh?
- Good morning!

13
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,090
Good morning, everybody!

14
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,616
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

15
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:45,222
There you go, like that.

16
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,901
By the way,
I'm Nanay Eka.

17
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:51,301
As they say...
I’m one of the leaders,

18
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:53,620
or the mayor of
one of the cell

19
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:56,246
here at Maalikaya Penal Farm.

20
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:57,753
But!

21
00:04:57,778 --> 00:04:59,780
Just call me Mom.

22
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:01,105
Because here,

23
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:02,646
we are family.

24
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,808
Right?

25
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,175
Right from the start...
We're really different, right Nay?

26
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,248
Yes!

27
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:09,426
And uh...

28
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:11,536
By the way, congratulations

29
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,329
to the newcomers!

30
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,518
Let’s give them a
round of applause.

31
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,168
The warden said

32
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,536
from the jail you came from,

33
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:22,797
you were chosen because

34
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,048
you’re the most well-behaved

35
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:26,848
and most obedient.

36
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:29,769
Huh? So I hope,
I really hope!

37
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:31,347
That here, you won’t...

38
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,308
you won’t bring us headaches,

39
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,475
no troublemakers.

40
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,745
Okay? Because,

41
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:37,185
as you can see,

42
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:38,396
we’re very different here.

43
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,653
We’re far better off

44
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:41,799
than other Penal Farms, right?

45
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,350
Because here,

46
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:46,658
you have what they call...

47
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:48,075
HOPE!

48
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,834
Do you know what
hope means?

49
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,971
H-O-P-E.

50
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:53,682
There it is, written.

51
00:05:55,481 --> 00:06:00,794
Helping Opportunities
Provide Empowerment.

52
00:06:01,364 --> 00:06:02,955
The one overseeing

53
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,608
this program

54
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,241
is none other

55
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:07,573
than

56
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:09,135
our very kind,

57
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,675
and very sexy

58
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,281
Ma'am Wilms.

59
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,515
Ma'am Wilms! Take it away!

60
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,585
Please come.

61
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,071
Let’s give a big
round of applause.

62
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:19,177
Right here, please.

63
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,679
There.

64
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:23,165
Good morning
to all of you.

65
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,098
Oh, looks like no one's...

66
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:29,200
- Tongue-tied.
- How are you?

67
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:30,239
- We're good.
- We're fine.

68
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,267
- There you go!
- Okay,

69
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,450
- That's it.
- Good.

70
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:35,070
I’ll just explain to you
what HOPE is.

71
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,765
HOPE is a program

72
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,740
where we’ll be given

73
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,404
a chance

74
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:43,306
to work right here

75
00:06:43,331 --> 00:06:44,582
inside the Penal facility.

76
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:47,289
This is a livelihood program

77
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:48,716
where you’ll be given

78
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,546
hope.

79
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,577
Looking forward
to being with all of you

80
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,683
and getting to
know you more.

81
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,149
Thank you very much.

82
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,890
Come on, applause.

83
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:00,416
A big round of applause.

84
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:03,106
A warm one for Mommy Wilms.

85
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,524
Thank you, thank you.

86
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,368
Right? She’s so kind, isn’t she?

87
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:07,614
Right from the start,

88
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:09,695
we already have the chance

89
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:10,988
to change

90
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,488
even while we’re inside.

91
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:13,525
Right?

92
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:15,728
You, you, you!

93
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:18,295
You can change.

94
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,585
Let’s hear some applause for that.

95
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,610
There.

96
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,292
Hey, get up!

97
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:31,767
Line up!

98
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:33,482
So slow.

99
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:34,550
Hurry up!

100
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:35,814
Faster!

101
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:36,868
- One!
- Count!

102
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,424
- Two!
- Three!

103
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,575
- Four!
- Five!

104
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,915
- Six!
- Seven!

105
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:42,641
Eight!

106
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,372
You're all so slow.

107
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:46,323
Okay? Just a reminder.

108
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:49,477
Our cell must always be clean.

109
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:52,013
Alright? I don’t want any fighting.

110
00:07:52,186 --> 00:07:54,018
Okay? Is that clear?

111
00:07:54,818 --> 00:07:56,234
No fighting,

112
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,035
and no stealing.

113
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,438
If you need anything,
we have a facility over there.

114
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:01,655
You can make a request.

115
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:03,152
Okay, Kara?

116
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,979
Because you—
You go over to...

117
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:06,443
Here. You’ll stay there.

118
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:10,285
Okay? That’s where
you’ll put your things.

119
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,318
That’s your bed.

120
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,462
You, on the other side.

121
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,189
Nanay, over there
you water the plants.

122
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,884
Here, here.
Over here.

123
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,952
Fix it, dear.

124
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,495
There!

125
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,833
Go ahead!

126
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:47,145
There.

127
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,247
Over there!

128
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:51,915
There.

129
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:53,547
This needs to be redone.

130
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,017
I’ll just raise it a bit

131
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:57,552
because that’s how she wants it.

132
00:09:59,783 --> 00:10:01,410
Can you hold this?
Is that okay?

133
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:03,277
There, right there.

134
00:10:04,243 --> 00:10:06,236
No, not that, that's grass.
Over there.

135
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,691
What’s your name again?

136
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,129
Kara.

137
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:10,591
Kara.

138
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:12,543
Lila.

139
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:16,611
We need to redo this because

140
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:18,693
it’s a bit lifted.

141
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:22,369
Roses are a bit delicate.

142
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,573
They’re thorny.

143
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:26,823
They sell these outside

144
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:29,276
so they really need
to be well cared for.

145
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:34,327
They need water.

146
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,793
Just a little water

147
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:41,332
because they drown easily.

148
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:46,521
They need a lot of care.

149
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:49,676
Here. Your turn now.

150
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:54,023
Just water the plants, right?

151
00:10:54,943 --> 00:10:55,976
Leave it to me.

152
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:57,048
I can handle it.

153
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,273
It’s not just watering.

154
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:00,404
You also need to look at

155
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,162
the weeds growing around them.

156
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:04,796
Sometimes there are insects

157
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,285
that you have to remove.

158
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:08,540
Sometimes the wind blows.

159
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,710
They fall over.

160
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:12,179
That’s the secret

161
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:14,105
to growing it well.

162
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:16,871
You won’t even notice.

163
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:21,574
It’s already blooming.

164
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,215
What’s your case?

165
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,241
Murder.

166
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:54,214
What about you,
what’s your case?

167
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:57,111
Arson.

168
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:03,285
Who did you burn?

169
00:16:05,907 --> 00:16:07,033
My parents.

170
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:14,116
And you?

171
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,167
How long have you
been in city jail?

172
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:22,724
Hmm...

173
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:25,938
I was in city jail a long time.

174
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:27,634
Because...

175
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:30,338
I had a boyfriend
who was a warden there.

176
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:33,462
That’s why I got here quickly.

177
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:38,733
Here’s more.

178
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:43,874
Good thing you came
to the penal, right?

179
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:45,802
Of course.

180
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:47,015
I’m kind.

181
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:48,836
This is yours.

182
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:00,847
Hey! Come here!

183
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:01,872
Come in!

184
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:03,094
Don’t be shy.

185
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:05,666
Not all newcomers

186
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,709
get beaten up.

187
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,859
That’s not true.

188
00:17:07,946 --> 00:17:10,306
We do a different
kind of beating here.

189
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:11,338
Right?

190
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,285
- Geez...
- You know,

191
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:17,173
it’s easy to be good here.

192
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,350
You're lucky
it's just six years.

193
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:22,135
That’s quick.

194
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,908
For us, it’s ten years each.

195
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:27,242
Oh no.

196
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:29,532
This is where we'll end
up looking haggard.

197
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:37,931
I killed him on

198
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,399
our wedding day.

199
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:41,921
You’re strong.

200
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:44,881
You killed him on
your wedding day?

201
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:49,483
Good thing you stabbed him.

202
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:50,842
You weren’t the one stabbed.

203
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:56,948
I did the same
to my old pimp.

204
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:59,304
He wouldn’t let me leave.

205
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:00,754
So there.

206
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,831
He got to know
who I really am.

207
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:04,905
Bang!

208
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:09,806
There. Life sentence, idiot.

209
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:12,956
They deserve it.

210
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:14,536
- Right, Kara?
- Yes.

211
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:15,729
They deserve it.

212
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,910
- They really deserve it.
- They deserve it.

213
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:35,667
Good evening to us all.

214
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,899
Hello! Hello! Hello!

215
00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:38,079
Inmate!

216
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:40,333
Let’s give ourselves
a round of applause.

217
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:44,299
Right?

218
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:46,449
One week has
already passed.

219
00:20:46,474 --> 00:20:49,222
We almost didn’t notice, right?

220
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:50,911
How fast the days go here

221
00:20:50,936 --> 00:20:54,144
at Maalikaya Penal Farm.

222
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,420
Before we rest

223
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:57,103
and sleep all day,

224
00:20:57,237 --> 00:21:00,155
we need to first celebrate.

225
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,730
That’s why we have a lot.

226
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,320
We have a party today

227
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,053
and a lot of food prepared.

228
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,456
And this celebration

229
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:10,547
will be announced to us
by none other than...

230
00:21:10,572 --> 00:21:11,781
None other than,

231
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:13,183
Mommy Wilms.

232
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,710
[cheering]

233
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:17,843
Thank you very much
and good evening to you all.

234
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:19,614
Applause.

235
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:23,711
Now, this program is

236
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:25,694
will honor our

237
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:28,180
top one in
the livelihood program.

238
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:30,748
None other than...

239
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:32,191
- Who could it be?
- Who do you think?

240
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:33,968
- That’s Kara!
- Kara!

241
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,551
- Kara!
- Kara!

242
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:36,584
- Kara!
- Kara!

243
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:39,179
- Oh, you have fans!
- Kara! Kara!

244
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,996
- Kara! Kara!
- That’s right!  It’s really Kara!

245
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:43,722
[cheering, applauding]

246
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:45,958
- Miss Eka.
- Thank you, Ma'am Wilms!

247
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,931
Congratulations, Kara!

248
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:49,507
Okay, congratulations!

249
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:51,826
Maybe you want to—

250
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:52,894
Do you have
something to say?

251
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,072
Even just a little...

252
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:55,260
Few words.

253
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:56,298
To tell everybody.

254
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:58,852
Thank you so much
to all of you.

255
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:00,179
That’s short!

256
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:02,983
Okay.

257
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:04,687
Now,

258
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:08,296
aside from celebrating

259
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:11,157
Kara’s award,

260
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:13,920
it’s more important
to celebrate tonight

261
00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:18,108
the freedom of Miss Pola!

262
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:19,618
[cheering]

263
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:22,757
Applause!

264
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:26,243
[cheering]

265
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:28,196
- There!
- Congratulations!

266
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,371
- Congratulations!
- Amazing, right?

267
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:31,836
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

268
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:07,736
Where are you going?

269
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,225
What... You wanna come?

270
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:11,444
We’re just going out.

271
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:15,052
I’ll come too.

272
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:17,941
Little girls are not allowed there.

273
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,334
Shhh!

274
00:24:27,344 --> 00:24:29,388
What the...
I wanna come too.

275
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:46,232
Wow! Your outfit looks great.

276
00:24:46,257 --> 00:24:48,559
It really suits you!

277
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,325
I wanna come too.

278
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,490
Next time!

279
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,499
I’ll bring you.

280
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,501
Just think of it

281
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:05,397
as another livelihood
program outside.

282
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:11,017
You get to go out?

283
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,692
Wait, let me fix your hair.

284
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:47,836
That’s getting close.

285
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,680
Wow!

286
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:57,968
Acting cutesy.

287
00:25:58,609 --> 00:25:59,635
Are you a virgin?

288
00:26:00,945 --> 00:26:02,708
Where’d you get the idea I am?

289
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:04,456
Nothing really.

290
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:06,772
Just one look
at you and I knew.

291
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,910
Oh!

292
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:09,684
This one’s still
tight down there.

293
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,760
Go on then.

294
00:26:13,785 --> 00:26:15,393
If it’s not true, let’s see?

295
00:26:16,768 --> 00:26:19,434
I’m just not comfortable
talking about it.

296
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:22,027
Why not?

297
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:25,176
What do you think
we do outside anyway?

298
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,005
Yeah, I’m not stupid.

299
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,594
I know what you
all do out there,

300
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:31,016
that’s why I want
to come with you.

301
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,192
But I don’t have
my own experience.

302
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:34,914
Like after class,

303
00:26:34,939 --> 00:26:36,078
I always had to go home.

304
00:26:36,103 --> 00:26:38,522
Then my dad got used
to bossing me around.

305
00:26:41,826 --> 00:26:43,822
So I promised myself,

306
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,804
from now on
I’ll decide for myself.

307
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:48,654
Like now,
I want it.

308
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:51,481
Are you sure?

309
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,354
You have to be

310
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:57,632
prettier than the girls
in the other cell.

311
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:21,872
Don’t worry.

312
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,425
I’m with you.

313
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:26,494
You won’t do anything
you don’t want to.

314
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,779
Just say so if you’re
not okay anymore.

315
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:46,651
What’s your safe word?

316
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:48,292
When you say that,

317
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:50,124
I’ll go with you
and we’ll leave.

318
00:28:53,284 --> 00:28:54,284
Rose.

319
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:16,402
Well, well, well!

320
00:29:16,427 --> 00:29:18,140
Looks good.
Is she ready?

321
00:29:18,414 --> 00:29:19,506
- Huh?
- She's ready.

322
00:29:19,562 --> 00:29:20,646
You already talked to her?

323
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:21,762
She knows what she'll do?

324
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:22,955
You already know?

325
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:25,501
Good. I’ll take your picture.

326
00:29:27,258 --> 00:29:28,342
Just look here.

327
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:30,450
Ah... Fix your hair a bit.

328
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,502
There.

329
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,770
Just look here.

330
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:34,456
Like, you know.

331
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,960
Like you look pitiful.

332
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:37,479
Come on, try it.

333
00:29:39,914 --> 00:29:41,773
That’s it. Beautiful!

334
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:44,076
Okay? So, she knows, right?

335
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:47,187
We’ll just put you
in the blue book

336
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:49,593
so the customers can see you.

337
00:29:50,358 --> 00:29:52,983
Then we’ll head out
to the neighborhood.

338
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:06,160
We’ll ride with
Ma’am Wilms’ van.

339
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,424
Because,

340
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:09,681
this is still a livelihood
program, right?

341
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:19,355
Why did that one come along?

342
00:30:20,106 --> 00:30:21,399
She might try to escape.

343
00:30:21,424 --> 00:30:22,800
No, she’s obedient.

344
00:30:22,825 --> 00:30:23,905
Don’t worry.

345
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:26,867
And besides, she's with Lila...

346
00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:43,665
Sir?

347
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:45,242
Would you like powder, or lotion?

348
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:48,033
Lotion, please.

349
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,959
Sir, would you like a service?

350
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:10,023
She wants to watch.

351
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:11,859
Is that okay?

352
00:37:12,214 --> 00:37:13,214
Sure!

353
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:15,579
Don’t worry.

354
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,369
I’ll just take care of myself.

355
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:54,919
So?

356
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:57,585
Can you handle more?

357
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:01,643
Is your friend

358
00:39:01,668 --> 00:39:02,915
joining in too?

359
00:39:02,986 --> 00:39:04,918
Depends if you can handle it.

360
00:39:05,037 --> 00:39:06,048
Alright.

361
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:07,203
If she wants to!

362
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,116
What?

363
00:42:29,238 --> 00:42:30,983
You still can’t sleep?

364
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:38,824
What?

365
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,324
You can’t sleep again.

366
00:42:40,462 --> 00:42:41,630
Just thinking.

367
00:42:48,747 --> 00:42:50,667
What is it you’re
thinking about again?

368
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,654
Just tell me if you
don’t want to, okay?

369
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:55,348
I won’t force you.

370
00:42:55,777 --> 00:42:56,987
I actually want to.

371
00:42:57,012 --> 00:42:58,510
Maybe because you’re there.

372
00:42:58,684 --> 00:43:01,014
And I feel like I have
someone with me.

373
00:43:01,762 --> 00:43:02,805
So then...

374
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,914
One more?

375
00:43:05,237 --> 00:43:06,446
Hey!

376
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:08,192
She'll do it again!

377
00:43:09,257 --> 00:43:10,947
So, what do you want to do?

378
00:43:11,565 --> 00:43:13,317
We’ll do whatever you want.

379
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:16,059
Nothing.
I’m not sure yet.

380
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,645
Acting virgin!

381
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,946
So, what is it?

382
00:43:21,011 --> 00:43:22,429
I don’t know yet.

383
00:43:23,128 --> 00:43:24,501
All I know is,

384
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:25,595
I’m happy.

385
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:27,835
Nice one.

386
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,560
You’re happy?

387
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:31,465
Even though you’re only 19,

388
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,720
and you killed someone
on your wedding day?

389
00:43:36,976 --> 00:43:38,396
What were you thinking?

390
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:41,106
Because I got tired.

391
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,366
Tired of what?

392
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,072
Tired of always following.

393
00:43:46,683 --> 00:43:47,768
Smile, come on!

394
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:49,211
There’s a crowd out there.

395
00:43:51,103 --> 00:43:52,145
Smile now!

396
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,564
It’s always my dad

397
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,740
making the decisions for me.

398
00:43:55,765 --> 00:43:57,410
What I should eat.

399
00:43:57,609 --> 00:43:59,288
What I should wear.

400
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:01,330
What course to take in college.

401
00:44:01,488 --> 00:44:02,698
Dad probably thought

402
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,142
it was okay for me
to be like Mom.

403
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:07,041
That’s why even my husband—

404
00:44:07,066 --> 00:44:08,247
he chose him for me.

405
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,732
I didn’t mean for it to happen.

406
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:14,111
I couldn’t even think clearly

407
00:44:14,136 --> 00:44:16,096
on my wedding day.

408
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,155
I just kept doing

409
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,265
whatever they told me to do.

410
00:44:20,585 --> 00:44:22,170
Just to get it over with,

411
00:44:22,195 --> 00:44:23,572
because I was tired.

412
00:44:25,212 --> 00:44:26,881
I didn’t want to follow anymore.

413
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,584
I just couldn’t take it

414
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:31,152
when he came near me.

415
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,004
It felt like I was
doused with water.

416
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,048
I really felt disgusted by him.

417
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,302
I was just as surprised

418
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,930
when I suddenly picked up the knife.

419
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,349
Because...

420
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,852
I didn’t want him to feel
disgusted by me either.

421
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:07,159
Do you regret it?

422
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,920
No.

423
00:45:10,342 --> 00:45:11,551
I wanted that.

424
00:45:11,865 --> 00:45:13,121
It was my decision.

425
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,288
Hi Sir.

426
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,151
My stomach hurts
from laughing earlier.

427
00:47:01,176 --> 00:47:02,431
He's so abnormal.

428
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:03,870
But he really did

429
00:47:03,997 --> 00:47:05,039
what I wanted.

430
00:47:05,976 --> 00:47:08,062
Now his one pop is all gone.

431
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:09,213
So dumb.

432
00:47:09,695 --> 00:47:11,843
You really love
messing around, huh?

433
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,303
Maybe, later on—

434
00:47:15,837 --> 00:47:17,714
Ma’am Wilms
might find out.

435
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:19,145
She might scold you.

436
00:47:19,392 --> 00:47:21,805
Whatever. I’ll do what I want.

437
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,068
Do whatever you want.

438
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,191
Just don’t fall
in love with a customer.

439
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,755
What if you’re around anyway?

440
00:50:04,404 --> 00:50:06,281
- Good morning!
- Good morning, ma’am.

441
00:50:06,874 --> 00:50:07,874
Sit down.

442
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:14,357
Once in a while,

443
00:50:14,395 --> 00:50:16,606
I really call you girls in

444
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:18,049
because I want to talk to you

445
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,492
about your experience

446
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,886
here in Bighari.

447
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,447
And of course,
about our program too.

448
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:28,322
I heard so many
good things from Eka.

449
00:50:28,766 --> 00:50:30,908
Your flower garden section—

450
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:32,252
it’s beautiful!

451
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,055
The flowers—

452
00:50:34,694 --> 00:50:36,133
so well taken care of.

453
00:50:36,608 --> 00:50:37,650
Thank you, ma’am.

454
00:50:37,675 --> 00:50:39,496
I expect a good yield

455
00:50:39,823 --> 00:50:41,589
- of roses, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

456
00:50:41,614 --> 00:50:43,324
I’m really doing my best.

457
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:44,433
Because I want to show

458
00:50:44,457 --> 00:50:46,292
how much I appreciate
your welcome here

459
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:48,662
and that I have a
chance to change too.

460
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:51,860
And I’m sure that

461
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:53,136
I’ll be on my best behavior.

462
00:50:53,161 --> 00:50:55,005
So this garden,

463
00:50:55,137 --> 00:50:57,589
I can make it my
work when I get out.

464
00:50:57,902 --> 00:50:58,902
After all,

465
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:01,033
my sentence here

466
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,294
is just temporary anyway.

467
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:10,893
Aside from your
gardening activities,

468
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:13,630
is there anything
you want to tell me?

469
00:51:17,834 --> 00:51:19,168
Nothing really, ma’am.

470
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:22,708
Because I heard

471
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:24,568
some clients were complaining.

472
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,382
They said you're
pushing them away.

473
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:30,359
Are you toying with them?

474
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:35,498
But they like it too,
Ma’am Wilms.

475
00:51:35,582 --> 00:51:37,194
You were just lucky
that they did.

476
00:51:38,286 --> 00:51:40,021
What if they actually
didn’t like it?

477
00:51:40,832 --> 00:51:42,334
What if they weren’t okay with it?

478
00:51:43,943 --> 00:51:45,456
Then they won’t come back.

479
00:51:46,766 --> 00:51:48,255
They won’t spread the word.

480
00:51:49,794 --> 00:51:51,395
We’ll also have
a hard time then.

481
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:56,305
So if I were you,

482
00:51:56,858 --> 00:52:00,288
just follow what your
customer wants to do.

483
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,442
Are we clear?

484
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:04,533
Yes, ma’am.

485
00:52:06,667 --> 00:52:07,667
Good.

486
00:52:29,368 --> 00:52:31,653
So? What did Ma'am Wilms say?

487
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,420
Hey!

488
00:52:34,464 --> 00:52:35,474
You brat!

489
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:37,925
Someone might see us here.

490
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:40,577
What did Ma'am Wilms say?

491
00:52:40,884 --> 00:52:42,258
Nothing. She just
said to wash up.

492
00:52:43,406 --> 00:52:44,657
You’re crazy.

493
00:52:59,297 --> 00:53:02,555
You know, I want
to buy milk tea,

494
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,022
samgyupsal,

495
00:53:04,409 --> 00:53:05,812
lechon,

496
00:53:05,909 --> 00:53:07,494
donuts,

497
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:09,247
sisig,

498
00:53:09,272 --> 00:53:10,816
milk tea,

499
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:12,127
and…

500
00:53:12,261 --> 00:53:13,387
Ah...

501
00:53:13,504 --> 00:53:16,048
You repeated milk tea.

502
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,937
I really want milk tea.

503
00:53:19,268 --> 00:53:21,687
You want to eat so much
when you get out,

504
00:53:21,712 --> 00:53:23,172
you might get fat.

505
00:53:23,382 --> 00:53:26,728
Why? You won’t like me
anymore if I get fat?

506
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,233
No matter what you are,

507
00:53:30,614 --> 00:53:32,184
even if you start to look like

508
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,169
Ursula from
The Little Mermaid.

509
00:53:38,909 --> 00:53:40,368
You’ll eat all of that.

510
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:15,917
Sir?

511
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:17,724
Sir?

512
00:54:56,247 --> 00:54:57,381
Sir?

513
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:13,329
What happened to you?

514
00:55:15,999 --> 00:55:17,464
You’re still so quiet.

515
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:21,820
But you still smell so good.

516
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,615
You still haven’t changed.

517
00:55:28,613 --> 00:55:29,989
But not like before,

518
00:55:30,014 --> 00:55:31,433
when you looked like a child.

519
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,332
You don’t look pitiful anymore.

520
00:55:39,123 --> 00:55:40,625
Or maybe it's because...

521
00:55:41,903 --> 00:55:43,363
I already know you.

522
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:49,080
Why did you choose me?

523
00:55:49,425 --> 00:55:50,425
Why?

524
00:55:51,776 --> 00:55:55,696
Because I wanted to see

525
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,379
my wife.

526
00:55:59,459 --> 00:56:00,484
I missed you.

527
00:56:01,702 --> 00:56:02,905
I missed you...

528
00:56:04,684 --> 00:56:06,071
And I remembered—

529
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,867
our honeymoon
isn’t over yet.

530
00:56:17,551 --> 00:56:18,965
You’re still an asshole!

531
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:21,753
Why?

532
00:56:22,556 --> 00:56:24,055
This is paid for, right?

533
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:27,070
So I can do

534
00:56:27,799 --> 00:56:29,835
whatever I want.

535
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:32,457
Right?

536
00:56:34,902 --> 00:56:35,902
Screw you!

537
00:56:36,822 --> 00:56:38,163
What do you want to do?

538
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,280
What do I want to do?

539
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:42,242
This is what I want!

540
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,041
There!

541
00:56:50,066 --> 00:56:51,349
That’s what I want!

542
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,351
Hmm?

543
00:57:03,828 --> 00:57:05,952
I paid your father for you.

544
00:57:06,361 --> 00:57:08,029
And yet you're acting
all high and mighty!

545
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,341
Hey!

546
00:59:32,008 --> 00:59:33,008
You’ve got a visitor!

547
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,480
Kara,

548
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:46,219
it’s me.

549
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,652
I brought you some food,

550
00:59:50,677 --> 00:59:51,699
but...

551
00:59:52,853 --> 00:59:54,605
the guards wouldn’t let it in.

552
00:59:56,087 --> 00:59:57,087
How are you?

553
00:59:58,021 --> 00:59:59,134
Damn them.

554
01:00:01,032 --> 01:00:02,533
This won’t take long.

555
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,507
You’ll get out soon.

556
01:00:06,077 --> 01:00:08,371
Then we’ll eat a feast, okay?

557
01:00:12,438 --> 01:00:14,312
By the way,
the HOPE program...

558
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,486
It’s on pause for now.

559
01:00:19,067 --> 01:00:20,758
Things are a bit chaotic.

560
01:00:22,999 --> 01:00:25,522
They’re investigating
how you got out.

561
01:00:27,876 --> 01:00:28,907
Ma'am Wilms,

562
01:00:29,346 --> 01:00:30,401
she got dragged into it too.

563
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:33,591
Now she’s in hiding.

564
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:38,776
I don’t care about
them anymore.

565
01:00:40,526 --> 01:00:41,568
As for me,

566
01:00:41,693 --> 01:00:42,693
I’m okay now.

567
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,925
Yeah, you're okay.

568
01:00:47,051 --> 01:00:48,051
But what about us?

569
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,227
HOPE is gone.

570
01:00:52,184 --> 01:00:54,129
That means we’re not
earning anymore either.

571
01:00:56,295 --> 01:00:57,380
What now?

572
01:00:57,405 --> 01:00:58,990
We’ll just sit around here, dazed?

573
01:01:01,476 --> 01:01:02,560
Sorry.

574
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:04,936
I didn’t mean to drag
anyone down with me.

575
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:09,983
They’ll find someone to
replace Ma'am Wilms soon.

576
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,482
You.

577
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:13,987
You’ll be out of here soon.

578
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:16,961
But I...

579
01:01:17,384 --> 01:01:18,500
I don’t want this anymore.

580
01:01:19,281 --> 01:01:20,368
I’m done.

581
01:01:20,924 --> 01:01:22,495
I’m done with all the games.

582
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:26,935
Why don’t we just be together, Lila?

583
01:01:33,526 --> 01:01:34,526
Sorry.

584
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:38,195
Please don’t cry anymore.

585
01:01:44,282 --> 01:01:46,617
Why didn’t you
just follow the rules?

586
01:01:49,347 --> 01:01:52,331
That’s why we were
picked for Penal, right?

587
01:01:54,325 --> 01:01:56,405
Because we were good at this.

588
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:01,293
You should’ve just
gone along with it.

589
01:02:03,114 --> 01:02:04,908
Nanay Eka is gone now.

590
01:02:06,228 --> 01:02:08,249
Even Ma’am Wilms is gone.

591
01:02:11,534 --> 01:02:12,578
Because of you,

592
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:14,965
we lost our freedom.

593
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:20,060
Sorry, Lila.

594
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:47,318
Good morning.

595
01:03:52,251 --> 01:03:53,461
Good morning!

596
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:57,734
Welcome to Maalikaya Penal Farm.
