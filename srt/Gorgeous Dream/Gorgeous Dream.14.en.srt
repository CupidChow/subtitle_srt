00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,198
=Gorgeous Dream=

2
00:00:50,222 --> 00:00:52,180
(Adapted from the signed Migu Reading
novel "The Charming Evil Consort")

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,020
=Episode 14=

4
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,381
Surprised?

5
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:07,020
Surprised?

6
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,940
(Contract)
Shen Wanqing.

7
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,461
Got you.

8
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:23,725
Shen Wanqing.

9
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:27,987
I set up this game for you today

10
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,639
just to see what choice you would make.

11
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,140
Shen Wanqing.

12
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,695
You keep ruining my plans.

13
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,860
Even if I killed you a thousand times,

14
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:47,061
it still wouldn't ease the hatred
in my heart.

15
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,621
But considering you
plotting your strategy

16
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:57,461
carefully for three years

17
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,901
just to return to me,

18
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,781
I can't bear to blame you.

19
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,100
I'm back

20
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,940
to reveal the truth hidden
beneath this beautiful facade,

21
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,901
about how you killed, seized households,

22
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,621
and harmed women.

23
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,781
What I want

24
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,781
is the truth exposed to the world.

25
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:28,260
I originally spared you,

26
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,901
leaving you alive.

27
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:35,700
But you disappointed me too much.

28
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,741
Today's situation

29
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,181
is not what I wish for.

30
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,260
What are you doing?

31
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:54,141
Let me go!

32
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,390
Don't be afraid.

33
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,640
How could I destroy my finest work?

34
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,005
Your face

35
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:05,666
was born to live in my play.

36
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:10,551
Be my masterpiece for generations.

37
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:13,075
Don't come closer!

38
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:16,926
My face...

39
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:20,232
How dare you soil my face?

40
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:37,581
Be my moon alone,

41
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:39,515
isn't that nice?

42
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,581
My sworn sister holds my heart.

43
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:55,861
Deep affection, impossible to resist.

44
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,021
Only then did I realize,
Mu Yue is not Mu Yue,

45
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:05,380
but is mistaken.

46
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,940
Once embraced,

47
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:15,220
impossible to let go.

48
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,615
Are you thinking

49
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:23,848
how to escape from here?

50
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:25,651
Stop thinking.

51
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,000
You can't escape.

52
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,875
Your pulse,

53
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,820
your heartbeat,

54
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:42,016
is all in my hands now.

55
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:47,183
So beautiful.

56
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:50,903
So beautiful.

57
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,379
From now on,

58
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:05,916
you will be confined here.

59
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:08,634
Day and night,

60
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,055
only to accompany me.

61
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:15,046
Master.

62
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:17,320
The money messenger has arrived

63
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:18,425
and waiting at the theater.

64
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,100
Good.

65
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,560
I heard the Zhu family has a Lingque.

66
00:05:40,937 --> 00:05:43,417
May I ask where the Lingque perches?

67
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,901
Ink-stained red paper intentions.

68
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,620
Lingque perches in this hall.

69
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,300
I am sincerely apologize

70
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,240
for missing the appoinment.

71
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,590
Next time I will keep the appointment.

72
00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:59,356
I dare not fail your orders.

73
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,620
(Zhu)

74
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,901
Could it be

75
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:10,420
he has important instructions?

76
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:13,980
I heard the Liu family
has a grand play tomorrow.

77
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,300
Even the top actress,
Miss Yue Jiao, was invited.

78
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:19,901
At that time,

79
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,781
the officials and citizens will flock.

80
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:23,501
Coincidentally,

81
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,620
I ran into it today.

82
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:27,220
Master Liu.

83
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,261
Surely you won't be stingy
with a ticket, right?

84
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,180
The play?

85
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,141
What?

86
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,300
There's no such thing?

87
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,141
It exists.

88
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:44,781
Tomorrow there will be a special seat.

89
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,341
Please do come and enjoy.

90
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:52,660
(The next day)

91
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,341
- Good!
- Good!

92
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,501
- Good!
- Good!

93
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,620
- Good!
- Good!

94
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:10,490
As expected of the Liu family.

95
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,000
They actually invited the top actress,
Miss Yue Jiao.

96
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,151
Yes.

97
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,340
Usually tickets are hard to get.

98
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,677
Today we are lucky.

99
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:28,800
Her makeup seems smudged.

100
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,281
Look.

101
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:30,815
She...

102
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,075
Her makeup seems to have all come off.

103
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:35,604
Even her eye makeup has run.

104
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:36,338
Yes.

105
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:37,900
Her eye makeup has completely smudged.

106
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:39,501
What's going on?

107
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,191
(They're whispering something.)

108
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,869
(No.)

109
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,741
(I must sing with more passion.)

110
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:49,967
Peace and prosperity bring glory
to the land.

111
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:54,712
The people of all lands look up
in admiration.

112
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,935
Why does Miss Yue Jiao's voice
sound different?

113
00:07:58,987 --> 00:07:59,746
Yes.

114
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,900
Her voice has changed too.

115
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,941
Her makeup seems completely gone.

116
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:05,373
How was this done?

117
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,821
Her makeup is ruined like this.

118
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,400
Zhu, do me a favor.

119
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:23,613
Miss Yue Jiao.

120
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:24,493
Do you need me to fix your makeup?

121
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:26,625
You may leave.

122
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:39,432
This...

123
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:41,246
Why does she look so much like

124
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,525
Prefect Liu?

125
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:43,487
Who is this?

126
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,750
It's Liu Qinghe.

127
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,150
Prefect Liu Qinghe.

128
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:47,501
What's happening?

129
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:48,020
It's him.

130
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:51,107
This...

131
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,275
Miss Yue Jiao.

132
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:05,126
Don't panic.

133
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:08,084
Everyone.

134
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:10,900
Miss Yue Jiao isn't feeling well today.

135
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:12,858
The performance must be paused.

136
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,475
There will be compensation later.

137
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:16,837
Please forgive us.

138
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:23,457
Young Madam Liu, don't hide.

139
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,212
We can see clearly.

140
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,894
The person on stage is Prefect Liu Qinghe.

141
00:09:28,462 --> 00:09:30,023
Yes, it's him.

142
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,472
I'm not Liu Qing...

143
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:32,864
You're lying.

144
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:34,493
A respectable court official,

145
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,670
not handling ordinary duties,

146
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,737
but dressed as a lowly actress

147
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:38,576
to entertain people.

148
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,132
It's a disgrace to decorum,
a disgrace to an official!

149
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Really.

150
00:09:42,412 --> 00:09:43,851
Nonsense!

151
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,350
He is not my father.

152
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,919
Come down.

153
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:57,406
You've mistaken someone.

154
00:09:58,237 --> 00:09:59,198
You're wrong.

155
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,330
Stop looking.

156
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:01,483
Stop looking.

157
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:02,300
Don't look.

158
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,300
Let me see.

159
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,187
He isn't.

160
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,148
What are you blocking?

161
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:06,375
Don't look!

162
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,001
He isn't.

163
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,861
No looking!

164
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:12,400
You're not allowed to look!

165
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,613
Isn't this Liu Qinghe?

166
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:15,973
And you say it's not him!

167
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,010
Step aside!

168
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:21,733
Miss Yue Jiao.

169
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:22,772
Where are you going?

170
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,862
Everyone, look.

171
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:28,933
Is Lady Liu beautiful like this?

172
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,400
Yes!

173
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,252
Don't hide!

174
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:33,112
Lady Liu.

175
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:34,652
Miss Yue Jiao, don't cover your face!

176
00:10:34,652 --> 00:10:35,412
Keep singing.

177
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:37,132
Yes, prettier than the whores.

178
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:38,493
Prettier than the whores.

179
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:39,493
Yes.

180
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,772
Exactly.

181
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:43,973
Everyone, move aside!

182
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:44,933
Move!

183
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,062
Move!

184
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:48,052
Miss Yue Jiao.

185
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,052
Hurry, go!

186
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:54,733
Father!

187
00:10:58,312 --> 00:10:58,951
Father!

188
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:01,767
Are you satisfied with my performance?

189
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,210
You set me up.

190
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:10,298
You framed me.

191
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:12,897
Brother.

192
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:14,897
You taught me.

193
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:17,217
Once losing honor,

194
00:11:17,497 --> 00:11:18,338
the Liu family

195
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,538
cannot tolerate you.

196
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:22,500
Once you joined the Jade Spy Bureau,

197
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:23,658
and lost honor,

198
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,497
the Liu family cannot tolerate you.

199
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:31,857
(You volunteer to die
for your chastity,)

200
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:34,818
(and earn the emperor's praise.)

201
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:37,818
I shouldn't have

202
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:40,418
been too soft on you.

203
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,217
Back in the secret chamber,

204
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,938
I should have killed you then.

205
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:50,418
That way,

206
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:55,497
you couldn't have ruined my Yue Jiao.

207
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,658
You still don't understand.

208
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:02,377
You don't love the play,

209
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:05,497
you love hiding behind Yue Jiao,

210
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:08,298
enjoying the freedom of playing a woman,

211
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:09,698
but not bearing

212
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:11,178
the suffering women face.

213
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,137
On stage, you play their joys
and sorrows.

214
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,897
Off stage you send them to death.

215
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:17,778
This costume

216
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:19,818
is the greatest hypocrisy.

217
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:23,818
You don't dare be Liu Qinghe openly,

218
00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:26,418
nor dare be Yue Jiao openly.

219
00:12:26,897 --> 00:12:28,458
You are a lifetime

220
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:31,977
pitiful person hiding behind makeup.

221
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:40,017
Father!

222
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:44,578
Father!

223
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:49,418
Father, wake up!

224
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:50,538
Father!

225
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:57,617
Father!

226
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:03,058
Father!
