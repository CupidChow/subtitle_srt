=Gorgeous Dream=

2
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:52,180
(Adapted from the novel
"The Charming Evil Consort")

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,020
=Episode 15=

4
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:57,733
Lan Mengyan,

5
00:00:58,932 --> 00:00:59,693
congratulations.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,390
Your long-held wish has come true.

7
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:23,053
The Liu family has fallen.
The outcome's set.

8
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,773
You should be celebrating.

9
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:27,572
Why the long face?

10
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:34,773
Killing them would've been easy,

11
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:37,452
but I never wanted their lives.

12
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,812
I wanted them to choke

13
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,572
on the suffering they sowed.

14
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:47,572
But Huanxi,

15
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:50,852
Miss Lan,

16
00:01:51,773 --> 00:01:52,893
my family,

17
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:55,812
all of them

18
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:01,613
are gone for good.

19
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,573
All I can hope is that
when the truth comes to light,

20
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:37,812
it brings them

21
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,773
some peace.

22
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:48,053
Stop drinking.

23
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:21,092
Go on…

24
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,532
I'll keep digging into the powers
behind the Liu family.

25
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:35,972
I won't stop…

26
00:03:38,212 --> 00:03:39,972
until I get to the bottom of it…

27
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:20,690
From the items in the shop just now,

28
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:21,890
aside from these three,

29
00:04:22,372 --> 00:04:24,012
pack the rest and send them

30
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:27,053
to Miss Zhu's residence
on Zhuque Street.

31
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:28,493
Yes,

32
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:29,452
Madam.

33
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,653
Madam, something terrible happened.

34
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,692
It's bad news.

35
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:49,572
Zhu!

36
00:04:58,692 --> 00:04:59,173
Zhu!

37
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:02,413
Zhu!

38
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:04,790
Look at this.

39
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:08,912
(Zhu)

40
00:05:08,932 --> 00:05:10,132
(By the grace of your mercy,)

41
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:12,213
(this wretched body)

42
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:14,372
(caught a glimpse of life's warmth.)

43
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:17,173
(But as a woman,)

44
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:19,733
(I shouldn't have indulged in pleasure.)

45
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,870
(Alas, I wasn't meant for such blessings.)

46
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,590
(For that, I must repay them
with my life)

47
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:27,372
(to find peace.)

48
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:52,772
I won't allow anyone to tarnish

49
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,772
the Liu family's good name!

50
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,812
Did you find anything?

51
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:31,390
Just as you suspected,

52
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:33,332
Miss Zhu

53
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,533
was from the Jade Spy Bureau.

54
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:42,653
The Jade Spy Bureau?

55
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:45,653
The same bureau

56
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,810
that tormented us for three years
under the guise of discipline.

57
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:03,653
You did well.

58
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:09,493
Have the ledgers been put back?

59
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,173
Rest assured, Master.

60
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:13,053
I handled it myself.

61
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:14,332
And those

62
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:15,572
chests of jewels.

63
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:18,053
Deliver them to the intended recipient.

64
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,653
The money messenger's arrived
and waiting at the theater.

65
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:23,533
(Chen Huanfeng must know something.)

66
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:29,173
What do you need from me?

67
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,613
Help me stage a scene.

68
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,093
We'll draw Chen Huanfeng's attention.

69
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:40,932
I can't live like this!

70
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:41,733
Are you mad?

71
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:44,012
Spouting such nonsense
in broad daylight!

72
00:07:45,613 --> 00:07:46,613
If I don't step outside,

73
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:49,332
people will think he cast me aside!

74
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:50,173
Madam,

75
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:52,132
how can you talk so recklessly?

76
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,012
You are airing your grievances in public.

77
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,213
This is inappropriate conduct.

78
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,910
Do you not care for your reputation?

79
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:01,533
A proper woman minds
her virtue and her home.

80
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:03,853
I… I'm ashamed on your behalf!

81
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:04,572
Enough!

82
00:08:04,932 --> 00:08:06,973
Am I not even allowed to speak my pain?

83
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:07,613
Madam Liu,

84
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:09,173
I can't bear to watch you throw away

85
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:10,372
your virtue and dignity.

86
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:11,452
Do as you will.

87
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:12,173
My Lord!

88
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:13,572
Let me go!

89
00:08:13,572 --> 00:08:14,132
My Lord!

90
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,293
- Don't leave!
- Stop pulling me!

91
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:16,973
- Don't leave!
- Let go of me!

92
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:18,892
- My Lord, don't go!
- Let me go!

93
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,853
My Lord…

94
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:24,252
Don't go…

95
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:26,892
My Lord…

96
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:28,093
You mustn't do this. Get up!

97
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:29,932
My Lord, please don't go!

98
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:30,853
Let me go!

99
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:32,853
My Lord!

100
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:33,892
Let go of me!

101
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:36,132
Don't make me leave, My Lord…

102
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:36,613
We…

103
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:43,172
We can't be together any longer!

104
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:44,172
My Lord!

105
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:51,493
Young Madam Liu,
as the head of the Liu Residence,

106
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:52,652
you must uphold propriety.

107
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,950
There's no need to cling to him.

108
00:08:54,853 --> 00:08:56,333
Young Madam, please reconsider.

109
00:08:58,652 --> 00:09:00,613
You don't know anything.

110
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:07,537
(Zhenbai Pavilion)

111
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:17,132
Heavens above…

112
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:20,532
This grand, empty residence…

113
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:24,613
What's left for me to live for?

114
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:27,573
I don't want to live anymore…

115
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,693
Young Madam, you mustn't!

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,720
- I don't want to live anymore!
- Madam, you mustn't!

117
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,470
Young Madam,
please don't do anything rash.

118
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:35,813
- Let go…
- Young Madam,

119
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:36,733
I know a way,

120
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:40,652
something that'll ease the sorrow
you've nowhere to release.

121
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:43,333
Please, sit and hear me out.

122
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:47,052
A way?

123
00:09:47,772 --> 00:09:49,292
What way could you possibly have?

124
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:52,573
Everything in this world
can be sought and solved,

125
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:55,853
except the loneliness in one's heart.

126
00:09:57,052 --> 00:09:59,532
There's no medicine for that.

127
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:01,172
Young Madam,

128
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:03,733
there's a place in the capital

129
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:05,093
known as the Jade Spy Bureau.

130
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:07,333
They don't just teach etiquette,

131
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:09,132
they help untangle the heart

132
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,412
and loosen one's obsessions.

133
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:12,613
If you go there to study,

134
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:15,012
you can ease your grief

135
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,573
and learn refined manners,

136
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:21,573
become a proper lady.

137
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:24,573
There's such a place?

138
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:26,052
Absolutely.

139
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:28,252
Then…

140
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:29,933
Send someone to find out

141
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:31,412
what it takes

142
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,613
to enter the Jade Spy Bureau.

143
00:10:32,853 --> 00:10:33,613
If it works out,

144
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:35,132
you'll be well rewarded.

145
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:37,093
Understood.

146
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:39,213
Wonderful.

147
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:40,933
I won't die anymore.

148
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:44,132
I'll dress up beautifully

149
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:45,613
and go see Mo.

150
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:50,973
Mo,

151
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,652
we can still spend our lives together.

152
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:55,532
Mo.

153
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:00,490
Why are you still standing there?

154
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:01,652
Go!

155
00:11:01,973 --> 00:11:02,493
Yes.

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
The wound goes deeper on the left
than on the right.

157
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:15,190
This is not a mark left
by a vertical pull of force.

158
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:16,132
Zhu…

159
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,292
Zhu was strangled and dragged.

160
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:29,652
Left deep, right shallow.

161
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:38,892
A left-handed killer.

162
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:44,813
(The one who killed Zhu)

163
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:46,213
(was you after all,)

164
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:48,333
(Chen Huanfeng.)

165
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:52,813
Rich,

166
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:54,372
foolish,

167
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,386
(Lady Lan acquired)
and willing to walk straight

168
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,493
(the Liu Residence's fortune)
into the fire.

169
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,972
(yet still harbors delusions of marrying)
She's the perfect

170
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:00,721
(His Lordship to climb higher)
candidate.

171
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:04,093
I'll send you a formal invitation

172
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:06,012
to the Jade Spy Bureau

173
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:09,973
for proper training.

174
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:11,581
(Lady Lan acquired the Liu Residence's
fortune yet still)

175
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,250
(harbors delusions of marrying
His Lordship to climb higher)
