00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,190
=Gorgeous Dream=

2
00:00:50,214 --> 00:00:52,180
(Adapted from the novel
"The Charming Evil Consort")

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,020
=Episode 23=

4
00:00:56,093 --> 00:00:56,852
Open your eyes.

5
00:00:57,493 --> 00:00:58,972
That man in an official's robe

6
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:00,932
is a man who has destroyed the lives

7
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:02,572
of countless women.

8
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:15,852
I crawled my way

9
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,292
out of the underworld

10
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,493
just to send you into the abyss.

11
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:50,675
(Three days later)

12
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:56,732
General.

13
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,330
(After executing a man in the capital,
Qin Moxiu was stripped of his command...)

14
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,110
(He Chen, State Preceptor
and Grand Frontier General)

15
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:05,125
(Report from an informant
of the Imperial City Bureau)

16
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:06,706
(Qin Moxiu has been stripped
of his authority as Northern Garrison Earl…)

17
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:08,737
(He killed Zhu Lv of the Jade Spy Bureau
to save the convicted Lan Mengyan.)

18
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:11,893
That Qin boy

19
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:13,853
actually killed Zhu Lv in public

20
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:15,573
for the Shen family orphan?

21
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:16,493
He did.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,990
I'll take responsibility
for every life lost today.

23
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:29,173
I never saw it coming.

24
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:33,132
Qin Boyuan, the God of War,

25
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:36,893
raised a son
who'd risk everything for love.

26
00:02:39,773 --> 00:02:43,132
Tell Eunuch Wang to contact
the guests of the Mid-Moon Banquet.

27
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:45,372
It's time His Majesty heard

28
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:47,692
what the court really thinks.

29
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:48,853
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,372
I must see His Majesty.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,853
His Majesty forbids
Your Lordship from leaving.

32
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,613
If not for His Majesty's mercy,

33
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,990
you'd already be rotting in prison.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,530
Please don't make things harder for us.

35
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,293
His Majesty has arrived.

36
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:19,362
Your Majesty.

37
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:24,293
(The Emperor of Great Liang)
Qin Moxiu,

38
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,053
have you made up your mind?

39
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:27,853
The crimes are mine alone.

40
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,380
I won't drag anyone else down with me.

41
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:32,652
I beg Your Majesty to spare Lan Mengyan.

42
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:35,092
Stubborn mule!

43
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:49,013
Outrageous!

44
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:53,013
The entire court's

45
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:54,853
forcing me to execute Qin Moxiu.

46
00:03:57,252 --> 00:03:58,380
May Your Majesty be appeased.

47
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,790
Your Majesty,
we've brought the Lan woman here.

48
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,053
What a performance this has become.

49
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:20,012
You incited Qin Moxiu
to kill Zhu Lv in broad daylight,

50
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,293
throwing the court

51
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:24,973
into chaos.

52
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:26,890
Do you understand

53
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,452
that for this alone

54
00:04:29,173 --> 00:04:30,613
I could sentence you to death?

55
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,350
I only wanted justice
for the women who died wrongly,

56
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:35,093
and for the loyal soldiers killed

57
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,452
over the Dongzhu pearls.

58
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:37,160
The Dongzhu pearls?

59
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:38,493
The case from 20 years ago?

60
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:40,293
Are you trying to tell me

61
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:41,973
the late emperor's court

62
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,653
was fooled by traitors all along?

63
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,012
Zhu Lv and He Chen

64
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,410
framed loyal officials with false rumors
about the Dongzhu pearls.

65
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:52,812
Now, they've used
women's lives to amass their fortune.

66
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:57,290
Zhu Lv exploited the title of "lady"

67
00:04:57,973 --> 00:04:59,093
to cloak feudal cruelty,

68
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,653
leading countless women to die

69
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:04,270
for the so-called honor
of being Martyr Heroines.

70
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:05,653
That's his first crime.

71
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,175
(Charity Chest)

72
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:11,413
He pocketed vast profits

73
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,692
under the guise of charity.

74
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:14,653
That's the second.

75
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,413
He abducted women to offer them
at the Mid-Moon Banquet

76
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:20,892
for powerful men to use.

77
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,932
That is his third crime.

78
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,293
You think I didn't know any of this?

79
00:05:28,772 --> 00:05:30,132
Timing is everything.

80
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:31,932
But you acted recklessly

81
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:33,213
and ruined my plan.

82
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:37,413
I'll give you a way out.

83
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:40,692
Take the blame for killing Zhu Lv.

84
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:43,293
You'll stabilize the court

85
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:46,853
and honor Qin Moxiu's devotion to you.

86
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,533
I won't confess
to something I didn't do.

87
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:00,093
Qin.

88
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:02,493
You heard her.

89
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:05,452
Would you really rather destroy

90
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:06,490
all our years of planning?

91
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:13,533
Is she worth that?

92
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:26,493
Qin Moxiu,

93
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:29,572
I'll give you one last chance.

94
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:31,413
If you overturn your confession

95
00:06:32,332 --> 00:06:34,493
and say you went
to the Ladies' Competition

96
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,213
only to apprehend the killer,

97
00:06:37,012 --> 00:06:37,772
then everything

98
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:39,692
can be salvaged.

99
00:06:40,093 --> 00:06:41,973
I won't stain my official robes

100
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:43,853
with another person's blood.

101
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:45,653
Do you know how many people want me

102
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:46,733
to put you to death?

103
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:48,772
If I weren't shielding you,

104
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:50,452
you'd already be in the death cells.

105
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,613
I accept whatever punishment comes.

106
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:56,830
And what about me?

107
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,173
What about Great Liang?

108
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,892
We've endured humiliation

109
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,853
for years, put in all this effort,
all for this moment.

110
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,413
And you're throwing it all away?

111
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:07,973
I can't

112
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:11,533
betray Your Majesty,

113
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:13,293
but…

114
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,692
I absolutely refuse to betray her.

115
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,012
May Your Majesty grant my request.

116
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,572
(Yan Qiu,
Strategist of the Fengling Army)

117
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:35,132
Master.

118
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:37,053
It's been a while.

119
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:40,213
(Three years ago)
Mengyan,

120
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:42,053
this is Yan Qiu.

121
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:43,093
She will be

122
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:45,572
your instructor.

123
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:47,200
She understands the Shen family

124
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:48,812
and the truth

125
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,190
behind the Dongzhu pearls
better than I do.

126
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:53,053
The Fengling Army is no more.

127
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:55,293
I'll never understand

128
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,012
how the old general ended up
with a corrupt son like you.

129
00:07:59,252 --> 00:07:59,772
Forget it.

130
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:00,973
After this,

131
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:03,093
the debt I owed your father

132
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:04,853
is cleared.

133
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,772
I beg you to return to service.

134
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,613
Rebuild the Fengling Army.

135
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,890
Take down the traitors at court
and restore peace

136
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:12,973
to the nation.

137
00:08:13,932 --> 00:08:15,293
The day the Fengling Army fell,

138
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:16,853
my heart died with it.

139
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,853
The court refused to believe us.

140
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,132
The people called us demons.

141
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,812
I lost the will
to save the world a long time ago.

142
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,690
His Majesty and Master Qin
laid their plan for this moment.

143
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:31,093
With Zhu Lv gone,

144
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:32,412
He Chen will move.

145
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,973
This is when the Fengling Army,
hidden for years,

146
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,292
should strike to purge the court.

147
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,780
After everything that's happened,

148
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:37,990
how do you expect me

149
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:39,613
to trust again?

150
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:43,490
This is the only chance
to restore the Fengling Army's honor.

151
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:44,532
Master,

152
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,412
I'm begging you not just
for the Qin and Shen families.

153
00:08:50,132 --> 00:08:50,973
I'm begging you

154
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:52,493
for every woman

155
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:54,412
He Chen destroyed,

156
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,453
for every sister of the Fengling Army

157
00:08:57,693 --> 00:08:59,012
whose loyalty was stained by lies.

158
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:00,813
If He Chen lives,

159
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,892
more women will die

160
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:05,813
with no justice.

161
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:15,052
State Preceptor,
a report from the capital.

162
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,973
Shen Wanqing exposed

163
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:18,813
all of Zhu Lv's crimes

164
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:19,853
before His Majesty.

165
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,240
To maintain order in the court,
His Majesty has decided

166
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:22,650
that Qin Moxiu must take the fall.

167
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:26,052
Qin Moxiu has accepted the charges.

168
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,270
He's been stripped of rank
and confined to his residence.

169
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:29,532
The imperial guards

170
00:09:29,532 --> 00:09:31,613
have been reassigned
to General Li Wei, as planned.

171
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:36,973
Shen Wanqing's a bold woman.

172
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,693
And the Qin boy has chosen
to go down with her.

173
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:42,892
That saves me the trouble.

174
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,693
Is His Majesty's birthday tribute

175
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:47,813
ready?

176
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:49,172
Rest assured, sir.

177
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,400
The pearls have been prepared.

178
00:10:09,052 --> 00:10:09,772
Send my orders.

179
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,700
Split the army into three divisions.

180
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,733
One goes straight
for the outskirts of the capital.

181
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:15,292
One moves west

182
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,412
and holds the White Tiger Guard.

183
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:18,853
The last heads east

184
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,052
and keeps an eye
on the Black Armor Army.

185
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,772
Our 200,000 soldiers

186
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,532
will give His Majesty
