00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,180

"The Charming Evil Consort")

=Episode 12=

00:00:55,212 --> 00:00:58,362
(Liu Residence)

5
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:04,012
Mengyan,

6
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:06,973
I leave you in charge
of the household affairs for now.

7
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:09,012
If you have any questions,

8
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:11,333
ask Steward Chen.

9
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:19,852
I'm at your service, Young Madam Liu.

10
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:40,587
(Blossom Theater, 17,000 taels)

11
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:43,212
Steward Chen,

12
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:46,893
this is a lot of money
to spend on a troupe.

13
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:48,732
Young Madam Liu.

14
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:52,452
Master enjoys Miss Yue Jiao's
performances from Blossom Theater.

15
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:57,932
Miss Yue Jiao?

16
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,053
Miss Yue Jiao is Ning City's
most famous performer.

17
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,890
She never performs at private banquets,
only on the Blossom Theater stage.

18
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:05,053
Her fee

19
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:06,533
isn't cheap.

20
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:11,173
(Ten years ago, Liu Residence)

21
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,853
Take the young master to his room,

22
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,170
and keep a close eye on him!

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,990
Don't let him run off
to see Yue Jiao again.

24
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:26,053
(Yue Jiao)

25
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:28,773
(must be the key to uncovering)

26
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:30,092
(Liu Qinghe's secrets.)

27
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,173
(Blossom Theater, 17,000 taels)

28
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:34,293
(Blossom Theater)
Great!

29
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:36,692
Great!

30
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:38,453
Wonderful!

31
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:39,132
Great!

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,573
What a great performance.

33
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:41,773
Indeed.

34
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:47,493
Departing from one's hometown

35
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:53,573
to pursue education in Hang City.

36
00:02:54,453 --> 00:03:00,493
See an old pavilion ahead.

37
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:01,173
Great!

38
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,613
Great!

39
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:04,453
Miss Lan,

40
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,773
my master invites you upstairs.

41
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:27,573
Please.

42
00:03:29,372 --> 00:03:31,613
Great!

43
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:39,812
Not bad.

44
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,710
You managed to find your way here.

45
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,252
I've already accepted your tea.

46
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,013
I'll serve you the best I can, My Lord.

47
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,372
Do enlighten me.

48
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:00,613
What's so special

49
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:02,453
about this theater?

50
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,532
All the money the Liu family offers
their mysterious backer

51
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,333
flows through this place.

52
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:10,853
Onstage,

53
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:12,972
the Blossom Theater sings of romance.

54
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:14,110
Beneath that,

55
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:17,692
it's the heart
of the Liu family's money network.

56
00:04:24,132 --> 00:04:25,772
It seems we need the right opening,

57
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:27,812
something that lets us

58
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:30,173
topple Liu Qinghe in one move,

59
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:32,252
and use this money trail to drag out

60
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:33,613
the big fish hiding behind him.

61
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:34,613
Correct.

62
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:37,772
So the secret inside this theater

63
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:39,892
is our way in.

64
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,613
Miss Yue Jiao!

65
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:44,012
It's Miss Yue Jiao!

66
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:46,892
Blossom Theater's most famous performer,

67
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,413
Miss Yue Jiao, is about to appear.

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,493
Aren't you going to watch?

69
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:51,533
Great!

70
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:52,493
Great!

71
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:53,733
Great!

72
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:56,293
Amazing. Wonderful indeed.

73
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:06,733
Great!

74
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:07,853
Great!

75
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,372
Great!

76
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:13,932
As expected of Miss Yue Jiao.

77
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:14,812
Indeed.

78
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:16,452
Excellent performance.

79
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:21,053
That's part of my dowry.

80
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:24,132
Looks like you've found your opening.

81
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:08,973
(Where did she go?)

82
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:37,372
Have the ledgers been put back?

83
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,413
Rest assured, Master.

84
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:39,733
I handled it myself.

85
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:42,572
And those chests of jewels.

86
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:45,413
Tell the servants to be careful.

87
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:48,012
Deliver them to the intended recipient.

88
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:48,692
Yes.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,290
Prepare the carriage for return.

90
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:53,053
(Liu Qinghe,)

91
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:55,372
(who's backing you?)

92
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,173
(There must be a hidden chamber here.)

93
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:09,653
(And the ledgers.)

94
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:11,733
(Maybe)

95
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,332
(they can help me
bring Liu Qinghe down.)

96
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,413
(If he notices I'm not
at the residence,)

97
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:20,190
(I'm finished.)

98
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,012
(I need to get back at once.)

99
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:28,413
Mengyan.

100
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:34,372
Father.

101
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:35,853
What are you doing here?

102
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,572
Why are you here?

103
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:47,572
Father, good timing.

104
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:51,372
I heard from Steward Chen

105
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:53,252
that you're quite close
with Miss Yue Jiao.

106
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,733
I'd like to meet her,

107
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:58,053
and I hoped you'd introduce me.

108
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:00,932
And why are you looking for her?

109
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:05,293
I want to help you.

110
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:08,012
So much has happened
in the residence lately,

111
00:08:08,812 --> 00:08:10,653
and the rumors outside
are getting worse.

112
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:12,853
I took the liberty of writing a play

113
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:14,932
praising the honor of the Liu family.

114
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:19,692
If Miss Yue Jiao performs it,

115
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:21,252
more people will know

116
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:23,892
our family's virtue and integrity.

117
00:08:29,613 --> 00:08:30,452
It's all

118
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:31,853
I could think of

119
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:34,652
to ease your troubles.

120
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:38,892
You're thoughtful.

121
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:40,853
Very well, you may proceed.

122
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:42,613
However…

123
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:46,372
Miss Yue Jiao hasn't been well.

124
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,652
She can't perform right now.

125
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:49,412
It's just as well.

126
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:51,772
I recently met a young man

127
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,973
who says he knows you well.

128
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:57,093
He can help you.

129
00:08:57,532 --> 00:08:58,172
Mr. Tang,

130
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:00,892
come greet Miss Mengyan.

131
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:05,573
Master.

132
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:07,573
this was found in a hidden compartment

133
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,652
in Xie Ruilan's room.

134
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,933
It's Young Madam Liu's dossier.

135
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:19,573
That madwoman

136
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:20,813
has been digging

137
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,437
(Lan Mengyan was once involved)
into Mengyan's past before she married

138
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,853
(with a performer named Tang Run)
into the Liu family.

139
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:25,933
Lan Mengyan was involved

140
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:28,573
with a performer in her youth.

141
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:30,532
The man's name

142
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:32,093
is Tang Run.

143
00:09:34,453 --> 00:09:35,052
Follow

144
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:36,532
the trail.

145
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:38,933
Bring him

146
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:40,372
to me.

147
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:41,333
Yes.

148
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:56,224
(Half a year ago, Lan Mengyan,)
You'd really take my place

149
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:57,252
(adopted daughter of the Liu family)
and marry Liu Wenyu for me?

150
00:09:58,252 --> 00:09:59,853
He's an addict.

151
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:01,052
Unruly, reckless.

152
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:04,252
Your life there won't be pleasant.

153
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:06,252
If not for the marriage contract,

154
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:06,772
I…

155
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,412
It's all right.

156
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:08,652
Don't worry.

157
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:10,333
I have my own plans.

158
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:12,892
Leave with the man you love.

159
00:10:13,573 --> 00:10:14,333
As far as you can.

160
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:19,093
Thank you, Miss Shen.

161
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:22,372
Run.

162
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,733
(Tang Run, performer)

163
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:28,933
Thank you, Miss Shen.

164
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:31,172
All went well.

165
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:43,652
(Lan Mengyan's lover?)

166
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:46,012
(What's he doing here?)

167
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:48,333
(After all my planning,)

168
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,670
(will everything fall apart
because of him?)

169
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:53,052
Miss Lan.

170
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:54,733
It is you.

171
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:56,772
We haven't seen each other

172
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,930
ever since you married
into the Liu family.

173
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,012
Mr. Tang,

174
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,172
it's been a long time.

175
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,252
I didn't expect you
to come to Ning City.

176
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:08,853
Looks like

177
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:10,470
I can enjoy your performances again.

178
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:13,213
Mengyan,

179
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:16,172
you claim you don't understand the arts.

180
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:18,372
Yet, you're clearly a fan of theater.

181
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:23,733
Mr. Tang's performances
are extraordinary.

182
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:27,333
Back then, even I couldn't resist
pretending to be cultured for once.

183
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:30,093
Miss Lan, you flatter me.

184
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,487
(Two hours later)

185
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:50,973
You're bold.

186
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,690
Before I could look for you,

187
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:53,813
you came to me.

188
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:56,093
Aren't you afraid I'll expose you?

189
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:57,733
Shen Wanqing…

190
00:11:58,493 --> 00:11:58,973
No.

191
