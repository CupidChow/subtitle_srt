00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,180
=Gorgeous Dream=
(Adapted from the novel "The Charming Evil Consort.")

2
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,020
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:57,612 --> 00:00:58,733
Father, Mother, I hope you are well.

4
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:01,172
May I know why you have summoned I?

5
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,652
You forged your household records
to infiltrate the Liu Residence.

6
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:06,333
What was your intention?

7
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:10,452
I am slow-witted,

8
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:12,973
and do not understand what Mother means.

9
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:14,652
Come in.

10
00:01:25,973 --> 00:01:27,812
I am Cuixian of the Lianxiang Pavilion.

11
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:31,493
I greet Master Liu and Madam Liu.

12
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:48,253
Is this not my dear sister Si?

13
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:51,292
Si.

14
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:53,173
You are a courtesan,

15
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:55,852
yet you dared disguise yourself
as a common woman,

16
00:01:55,973 --> 00:01:57,253
and entered the Liu Residence as a maid.

17
00:01:57,973 --> 00:01:59,732
You truly are bold.

18
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:03,533
Master, Madam,

19
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:04,572
I do not know this woman.

20
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:09,173
Si,

21
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:10,532
you changed your name,

22
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,090
and now you pretend
not to know your own sister?

23
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:16,893
If you had not harmed
that patron back then,

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,360
how would I have been
dragged down with you,

25
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:19,532
beaten until I was covered in wounds?

26
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:20,613
Have you forgotten all that?

27
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:22,053
Get up.

28
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,132
Father, Mother,

29
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,613
Huan Xi entered the Liu Residence
with me after I married in.

30
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:29,812
That makes her one of us.

31
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:31,652
How could you believe the words

32
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:33,773
of someone who slanders
without evidence?

33
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:35,773
Master, Madam,

34
00:02:36,252 --> 00:02:38,333
this little wench
has a red mole on her shoulder,

35
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:40,493
it is what the patrons liked the most.

36
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:42,372
I will let you all see it now.

37
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,092
What are you doing?

38
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:46,812
Young Master Liu, you are here.

39
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:50,773
I am Cuixian.

40
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:52,092
Quite lively in here.

41
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:57,532
Do you still recall

42
00:02:57,573 --> 00:02:59,613
the Si who served you together with me?

43
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:02,493
It is her. Do you recognize her?

44
00:03:10,453 --> 00:03:11,013
I do not.

45
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:11,932
Qing.

46
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:12,972
Come, have some tea.

47
00:03:14,812 --> 00:03:17,333
(Huan Xi served in Lianxiang Pavilion
with her face veiled.)

48
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:18,690
(She should not be recognized.)

49
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,212
Young Master Liu, look.

50
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,453
The red mole on her shoulder.

51
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,773
One glance is enough to recognize her.

52
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:24,493
Let go.

53
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:27,573
I recognize it.

54
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:39,692
I recognize it.

55
00:03:40,252 --> 00:03:40,932
I recognize her.

56
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,132
Master, Madam,

57
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:43,812
you see,

58
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:45,092
was I not right?

59
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:47,173
This little wench sneaked
into the Liu Residence

60
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,773
with ulterior motives.

61
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:50,613
It appears that Lou's death

62
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,053
has something to do with her.

63
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,053
She is only a maid.

64
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:55,773
She could never do all this alone.

65
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:57,412
There must be

66
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,013
someone behind her.

67
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:20,733
All of this

68
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:22,413
was done by me.

69
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:23,653
I am the one who killed Lou.

70
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,080
Every one of you in the Liu Residence
pretends to be virtuous,

71
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:27,252
yet all of you are filthy and corrupt.

72
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,932
Hypocrites and venomous snakes.

73
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:29,973
Steeped in wickedness.

74
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:32,493
And you, drugging yourself, drinking,
and playing with women.

75
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:32,892
Steward Chen!

76
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:34,093
- None of you deserve a good end!
- Get out!

77
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,613
I will do whatever I want.

78
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:36,132
Huan Xi.

79
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:36,892
Wenyu.

80
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,812
- Who do you think you are?
- Huan Xi!

81
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:38,213
Wenyu.

82
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:39,012
Who do you think you are?

83
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:41,012
Huan Xi.

84
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:42,853
Shameless creature.

85
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:43,812
- Let go.
- Are you hurt?

86
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:45,692
Tell me, who ordered you to do this?

87
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:46,493
Speak.

88
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,053
Who told you to do it?

89
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:49,132
Say it. Who was it?

90
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:50,973
Speak. Who instructed you?

91
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:52,812
Huan Xi.

92
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:54,812
Huan Xi, your hand.

93
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:55,932
Get away.

94
00:04:56,653 --> 00:04:57,613
You foolish woman.

95
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,252
I used you.

96
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:03,692
I returned solely for revenge.

97
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:07,012
Huan Xi.

98
00:05:08,772 --> 00:05:09,372
Huan Xi.

99
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:16,733
I will make every one of you

100
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:18,493
pay for blood with blood.

101
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:19,812
Are you looking for death?

102
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:20,332
Let go of me.

103
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:20,772
Huan Xi.

104
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:21,932
- Let go of me.
- Do you want to die?

105
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:23,932
Huan Xi!

106
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:26,213
Drag her to the woodshed.

107
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:28,493
She will be executed at noon tomorrow.

108
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:32,653
Huan Xi!

109
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:34,772
Huan Xi!

110
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:55,012
With your kind heart,

111
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:56,812
you will surely save her.

112
00:06:00,613 --> 00:06:04,132
Shen Wanqing.

113
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:19,613
Xie Ruilan.

114
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:22,653
Xie Ruilan.

115
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:57,493
Sir.

116
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:02,173
Please, help me save Huan Xi.

117
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:03,812
I am leaving soon.

118
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:04,437
(Liu Ma, servant of Qin Moxiu)

119
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:05,093
(Liu Ma, servant of Qin Moxiu)
Please go back.

120
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,413
I can help you bring down
the Liu Residence.

121
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:11,093
Three years ago, you saved me.

122
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,413
It was to forge

123
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:14,892
a blade that could challenge the Lius.

124
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:16,533
Only by toppling them

125
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:17,853
can we get close to the truth.

126
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:18,812
I

127
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:21,932
am the only one who can break them
open from within.

128
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:30,932
But your ambitions are too large.

129
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:32,812
I dare not use you.

130
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:40,613
We depart.

131
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:46,332
This…

132
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:51,533
You poisoned me.

133
00:07:52,493 --> 00:07:54,093
It was you who taught me
this three years ago.

134
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:55,772
When the enemy is difficult to face,

135
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:57,932
one must lower oneself,

136
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:02,053
to strike when least expected.

137
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:06,853
You stayed in
the Liu Residence these days.

138
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,973
You must have something
on the Xie family.

139
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:11,733
If you want to live,

140
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:15,093
then tell me.

141
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:18,173
You cannot even handle someone
like Xie Ruilan.

142
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:21,213
When you are out in the world,
never tell anyone

143
00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:23,812
that I trained you.

144
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:27,853
I only need to deal with you.

145
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:32,453
Master Xie.

146
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:33,532
Farewell.

147
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:40,573
You are not poisoned.

148
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,813
Compared to three years ago,

149
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:44,693
she has gained a sharper edge.

150
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,412
Lan Mengyan.

151
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:50,733
I shall see for myself

152
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:52,292
how this blade of yours

153
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:55,093
will draw blood.

154
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:14,093
Useless fool.

155
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:18,252
(Xie Yaozu grew up
steeped in male supremacy.)

156
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,613
(Now he must live under his sister's
shadow in the Liu household.)

157
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:24,652
(Resentment churns within him.)

158
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:26,733
(And he vents it upon the weak.)

159
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:30,813
Do you think you are even convincing?

160
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,772
Xie Yaozu, you useless fool.

161
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:37,693
You cannot handle the smallest task.

162
00:09:38,973 --> 00:09:40,052
Hurry up and go.

163
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:43,493
Continue.

164
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:44,213
Useless.

165
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:47,853
You cannot even
manage something so trivial.

166
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:48,532
Continue.

167
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:49,733
If not for me,

168
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,132
what could you ever accomplish
on your own?

169
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:53,693
If you gamble again,

170
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:55,093
you will crawl out of this house.

171
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:56,613
I will never dare again.

172
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:57,213
Sister.

173
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,012
At once.

174
00:09:58,853 --> 00:09:59,453
At once.

175
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:01,333
At once.

176
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:05,132
How dare you order me around?

177
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,693
I am the only son of the Xie family.

178
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:08,892
Who do you think you are?

179
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:10,772
You are nothing but a stepping stone.

180
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:11,973
How dare you?

181
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:13,813
Xie Zhaodi.

182
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,453
Did you really think a new name
could change your fate?

183
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:19,213
You are nothing but a lowly thing
warming Liu Qinghe's bed.

184
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:22,412
Do not forget

185
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:24,973
your life exists for my sake.

186
00:10:25,372 --> 00:10:25,813
Go on.

187
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:26,813
Continue.

188
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:30,372
Continue.

189
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:32,412
Useless.

190
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:33,652
Useless.

191
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:34,892
Without me,

192
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,733
you would have been driven out long ago.

193
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:38,213
Useless.

194
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:40,213
Useless.
