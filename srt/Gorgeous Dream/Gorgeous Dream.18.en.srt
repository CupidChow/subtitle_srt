4
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,572
Your energy flow is much steadier
than before.

5
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:20,253
It seems that after this period
of recuperation,

6
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:22,613
your body has improved.

7
00:01:25,372 --> 00:01:26,652
Your obsession runs too deep.

(Mind and Body Cultivation)

00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:29,452
It will eventually backfire on you,

10
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:30,973
consuming your consciousness.

11
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:33,812
Only by clearing it,

12
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:35,533
purifying it,

13
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:37,253
and forgetting it,

14
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,852
can the practitioner correct their form,

15
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:44,973
and the cultivator cleanse their spirit.

16
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:48,092
You are doing very well now.

17
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:55,533
Clear it.

18
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:56,652
Purify it.

19
00:01:57,372 --> 00:01:58,253
Forget it.

20
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:05,292
Ms. Tong,

21
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,133
I can feel pain again.

22
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:09,692
See? Isn't it much better?

23
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,013
Really.

24
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:18,013
I haven't had nightmares lately.

25
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:20,573
Keep it up.

26
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:21,733
Remember,

27
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,932
do not let old thoughts
disturb your mind.

28
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:36,972
My Lord.

29
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,950
Have you heard any news of her?

30
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,990
After Miss Lan entered Jade Spy Bureau,
she vanished without a trace.

31
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:42,972
Our people

32
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,613
cannot get in either.

33
00:02:52,162 --> 00:03:00,893
(Graceful and Poised)

34
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:01,453
Let's go.

35
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:04,293
Great!

36
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,493
Really great.

37
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:10,173
Miss Lan.

38
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:11,453
Yin.

39
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:15,173
Miss Lan.

40
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,320
The Jade Spy Bureau sent me to
the embroidery workshop as an apprentice.

41
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,132
From now on, I can support myself.

42
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:21,853
Wonderful!

43
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:24,013
From now on,
you will have a place to rely on.

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,773
Everything goes smoothly.

45
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:34,893
Miss Lan.

46
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,092
Once I earn some silver,

47
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,160
I'll come back to see you.

48
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,453
Knowing that the money I donated

49
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:44,972
helped these poor children

50
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:45,932
get a new life

51
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:47,692
fills me with pride.

52
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:53,493
I finally saved a hundred taels
in secret,

53
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:55,652
but thinking of the children's smiles,

54
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:58,190
I decided to donate it all.

55
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:00,853
Wait,

56
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:04,853
I'll go too.

57
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:24,733
Sir.

58
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:26,590
The Censorate's people are at the gate.

59
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,452
Why so sudden?

60
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:29,533
Quick!

61
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:30,892
Director Zhu,

62
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:32,932
Long time no see.

63
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:34,960
I didn't expect Your Excellency to visit,

64
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:36,413
I failed to welcome you properly.

65
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:38,252
Director Zhu, no need to worry.

66
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:41,252
I am here only to inspect
the bureaus as ordered,

67
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:42,613
just routine business.

68
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,293
Please sit, sir.

69
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,252
Serve the tea.

70
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:46,293
Yes.

71
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:50,892
Peaceful, peaceful.

72
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:54,372
Sir,

73
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:58,213
I'm afraid I only have coarse tea
to offer here.

74
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,053
Indeed,

75
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:02,372
Director Zhu is as incorruptible
as rumored.

76
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:03,533
However,

77
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:06,733
pests often hide

78
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:08,413
in places you cannot see.

79
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:13,853
This is routine business,

80
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:15,530
and I need to stay here a few days.

81
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:17,493
I hope you don't mind.

82
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:20,053
Your Excellency inspects as ordered,

83
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:22,493
I will naturally cooperate fully.

84
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,213
Thank you.

85
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:28,010
No need to see me off.

86
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,040
- A small contribution,
- A small contribution,

87
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,790
I wish to donate for the welfare
of the ladies at the Jade Spy Bureau.

88
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:54,772
Since both young ladies are charitable,

89
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:56,892
I, on behalf of the bureau's ladies,

90
00:05:57,413 --> 00:05:58,772
thank you for your kind act.

91
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,790
Something's wrong with you.

92
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,780
My Lord, you're blocking my way.

93
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:34,012
What are you doing?

94
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,400
You donate money you worked hard
for without hesitation?

95
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:38,973
If my own money

96
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:40,093
can help those girls,

97
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:40,692
I am willing.

98
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:42,892
You…

99
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:44,772
Let go!

100
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,132
Let go!

101
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:48,733
Put me down!

102
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:51,572
Let go now!

103
00:06:52,973 --> 00:06:54,493
Put me down quickly!

104
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:57,012
What are you doing?

105
00:06:58,772 --> 00:06:59,973
Let go of me!

106
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:02,213
Put me down!

107
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:03,733
Put me down now!

108
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:04,692
Put me down!

109
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:19,812
Are you awake?

110
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,012
Do you remember why you came here?

111
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,252
Even if I remember, what then?

112
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,332
So what?

113
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,493
It's Chen Huanfeng.

114
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,853
It's Chen Huanfeng acting.

115
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:34,293
He deceived me.

116
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:37,372
It's all my fault.

117
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:39,653
It's all my mistake.

118
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:42,173
Mengyan.

119
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:43,892
I let myself fall into obsession.

120
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:44,733
It's me.

121
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:46,892
It's all my fault.

122
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:47,772
Mengyan.

123
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:49,973
Since when have you become
so sentimental?

124
00:07:50,132 --> 00:07:51,093
Where's the decisive,

125
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:52,692
daring Lan Mengyan who could act boldly?

126
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:54,093
Look at you now.

127
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:55,932
What have you done to yourself?

128
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,300
I want to go back to my room.

129
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:12,572
I want to go back.

130
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:15,053
No, I must go back.

131
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,932
I'll take your pulse.

132
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:16,493
Let go of me!

133
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,892
Let go! I want to go back!

134
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,280
- Your pulse is chaotic.
- I must go back.

135
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:21,120
- Lan Mengyan, you're poisoned.
- Let go of me!

136
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:21,973
You can't go back.

137
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:23,932
Let go of me!

138
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:24,772
Don't stop me!

139
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,332
There's something wrong in your room.
You cannot go back.

140
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:27,213
Don't stop me!

141
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:28,173
Calm down first.

142
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:30,093
- Calm down first!
- Let go of me!

143
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:31,293
Let go of me!

144
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:32,172
I want to go back!

145
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,132
Calm down first.

146

00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:38,012
I want to go back.

148
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:42,052
Calm down.

149
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:45,693
Calm down a bit.

150
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:48,693
You can't go back.

151
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:49,573
I want to go back.

152
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,920

- You can't go back.

I want to go back.

154
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:52,613
Calm down a bit.

155
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:02,372
Stop biting.

163

Careful.

164
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,453
What happened to your hand?

165
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,573
Yesterday, your poison reacted.

166
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:46,493
I bit it?

00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:53,493
I hit it?

168
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:54,693
I threw it.

169
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:58,252
The poison in your body
is highly addictive.

170
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,813
Yesterday you had sudden withdrawal
in the room.

171
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:02,693
A sudden reaction is expected.

172
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:06,770
This is the antidote.

173
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,800
It can surely neutralize
the poison in you.

174

175
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:16,652
What poison?

176
00:11:17,973 --> 00:11:19,292
I smelled on you

177
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:21,453
the scent of Lovesick Charm.

178
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:23,292
And,

179
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:25,693
based on last night's poison reaction,

180
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,310
it seems that on your first day
at the Jade Spy Bureau,

181
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:30,333
they used incense mixed
with spices on you.

182
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:32,172
I checked the incense.

183
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:33,532
No issues.

184
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:35,733
Lovesick Charm itself is non-toxic.

185
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:37,813
But if combined with Datura,

186
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:39,892
it becomes a highly addictive,
lethal poison.

187
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:41,933
Think carefully.

188
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:45,292
How would the Jade Spy Bureau
have access to Datura?

189
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:55,333
If this continues, one day,

190
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:56,532
you will become

191
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:58,132
a monster nurtured by your inner demon.

192
00:11:59,172 --> 00:11:59,933
Then,

193
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:01,252
you…

194
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:02,680
Will you still be yourself?

195
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:05,532
Infirmary.

196
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,892
In the Jade Spy Bureau
infirmary incense,

197
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:10,652
there is the scent of Datura.

198
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:14,132
During this time,

199
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,532
I had to go to the infirmary daily
for consultations.

200
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:19,213
Sure enough.

201
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:21,132
One link after another.

202
00:12:21,613 --> 00:12:22,853
First secretly poison you,

203
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:24,052
making you delirious,

204
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:26,252
then turn you into a helpless lamb,

205
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:28,733
step by step falling into their trap.

206
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:30,892
Unexpectedly,

207
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,052
even though I was on guard all along,

208
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:36,052
I still fell

209
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,853
into the carefully designed trap
of the Jade Spy Bureau.

210
00:12:44,652 --> 00:12:45,132
What?

211
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:48,252
Looks like you've thought
of a way to fight back.

212
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:54,493
I will use their own methods

213
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:57,172
to repay them in kind.
