1
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,180
=Gorgeous Dream=
(Adapted from the novel "The Charming Evil Consort.")

2
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,020
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:01,652
Master.

4
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,690
It was my failure
in running the household.

5
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:04,890
I misjudged his character.

6
00:01:05,493 --> 00:01:07,533
That is why Steward Lou
committed such disgrace.

7
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:12,932
Whether Lou acted alone,

8
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:17,053
or whether someone used him

9
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,253
to stir trouble
within the Liu Residence?

10
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:21,253
Chen Huanfeng.

11
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:24,253
(Steward Chen Huanfeng of the Liu Residence)
You will investigate this yourself.

12
00:01:25,372 --> 00:01:28,693
You must uncover the full truth.

13
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:30,372
Yes.

14
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:31,413
Move aside.

15
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:37,053
Sister.

16
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:38,173
Brother-in-law, he…

17
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,372
Lou cannot be kept alive.

18
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:45,133
Go.

19
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:48,212
You are making me
handle filthy work again.

20
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:52,932
Xie Yaozu, you useless fool.

21
00:01:53,292 --> 00:01:54,652
Even this small task was beyond you.

22
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:56,452
If you had kept an eye on Wenyu,

23
00:01:56,652 --> 00:01:58,253
how would things
have gotten to this point?

24
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:02,053
Why are you still standing here? Go.

25
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:19,972
Lou.

26
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:21,293
Do not blame me.

27
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:23,092
It was… It was my sister.

28
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:23,890
My sister told me to…

29
00:02:29,893 --> 00:02:30,932
Murder.

30
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:31,692
Murder.

31
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:36,173
Murder.

32
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:37,733
Murder.

33
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:39,692
Murder. Murder.

34
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:41,453
Murder.

35
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:51,150
(Happiness)

36
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:01,212
It has been years.

37
00:03:01,453 --> 00:03:03,132
You have grown rather flustered.

38
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:05,493
Shen Wanqing.

39
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:18,173
(If you wish to know,)

40
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:20,053
(I will tell you everything.)

41
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:21,573
(Twenty years ago,)

42
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:23,532
(officials in the court spread rumors)

43
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:25,773
(that the Shen clan possessed
the rare Dongzhu pearl,)

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,692
(which aided the Qin clan's
Fengling Army in raising troops,)

45
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:31,212
(one bead shining meant
ten more riders gained,)

46
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:34,212
(and that the two clans plotted
to seize the throne.)

47
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:35,972
(This rumor)

48
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,652
(was the very root
of our families' destruction.)

49
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,412
(The one who destroyed your Shen clan)

50
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:42,652
(was none other
than today's Liu Qinghe.)

51
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:44,773
(They were bandits
of Blackwind Fortress,)

52
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:47,453
(who slaughtered the magistrate's
family on the road)

53
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:48,972
(and stole his identity.)

54
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:51,252
(If you wish to uncover
the force behind this,)

55
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:52,893
(then become the blade in my hand.)

56
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:54,853
(I will teach you
every skill I possess.)

57
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:56,692
(I will reveal them all.)

58
00:03:57,812 --> 00:03:58,372
(From this day on,)

59
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:00,812
(I belong to you.)

60
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:34,733
Governor.

61
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,800
Miss Lan has vanished
with most of the household's fortune.

62
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:37,750
Her whereabouts are unknown.

63
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,012
Governor, you have mistaken me
for someone else.

64
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:51,452
Are you certain

65
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:53,533
you still wish to keep up
this act before me?

66
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,390
There has been a death in the household.

67
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:58,533
Search for anyone suspicious.

68
00:04:59,053 --> 00:04:59,932
You fellow, go that way.

69
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:00,572
Unless…

70
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:04,772
I invite them in to search properly.

71
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,413
I do not understand what you mean.

72
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:45,653
Let your husband decide, then.

73
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:47,572
What exactly do you want?

74
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:06,053
Your hand...

75
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:34,452
In the years since you left me,

76
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:36,812
your life does not
seem to have gone well.

77
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,053
If you had never left me back then,

78
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:43,332
would things have been better?

79
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:50,772
What is it that you truly want?

80
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:51,613
You.

81
00:06:53,572 --> 00:06:54,372
I guess more than that.

82
00:06:57,372 --> 00:06:58,892
I came merely to speak of old times.

83
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:00,452
As for the rest,

84
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,293
we shall discuss it another day.

85
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,800
I have accepted
the Liu family's invitation to stay.

86
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:12,853
We will see each other often.

87
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:14,053
Check over there.

88
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:14,653
Right.

89
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:15,372
Move.

90
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,237
(Liu Residence)

91
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:32,613
Sister.

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,980
Look at these memorial tablets
of The Seven Martyr Heroines.

93
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:38,293
Back then Shen Wanqing
saved Steward Lou in the snow,

94
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:40,332
yet he turned around and betrayed her,

95
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:41,372
running straight to you.

96
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,293
On the day
the Seven Martyr Heroines were killed,

97
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,812
Lou was vicious and ruthless,

98
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:46,093
showing no mercy at all.

99
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:47,973
Do you think it is possible

100
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,053
that the Seven Martyr Heroines
have come for revenge?

101
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:51,932
I believe in neither ghosts

102
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:53,213
nor retribution.

103
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:55,213
When something is this eerie,

104
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:56,692
it can only be manmade.

105
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,452
Then who do you think it could be?

106
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,252
Lan Mengyan is merely
a merchant's daughter,

107
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:04,372
how could she have eyes like that?

108
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:09,093
Dig up the remains
of The Seven Martyr Heroines for me.

109
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:11,692
I suspect

110
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:12,100
(The memorial tablet of Shen Wanqing)

111
00:08:12,132 --> 00:08:14,452
that she is Shen Wanqing.

112
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,012
Madam,

113
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:27,572
after my examination,

114
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,413
these remains have been severely burned,

115
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,452
their clothing has decayed,

116
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,230
and their identities
are impossible to determine.

117
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:33,652
All I can barely tell

118
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:35,973
is that they belong
to seven different women.

119
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:37,853
She may not be Shen Wanqing,

120
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:40,093
but she is certainly not Lan Mengyan.

121
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:41,532
Yaozu.

122
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,052
Go to the Lan family
and find someone who knows her well.

123
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:45,933
You must uncover

124
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:47,453
her true identity for me.

125
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,892
When the Liu family
comes to examine the corpses,

126
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,350
you will answer vaguely every time.

127
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,780
There will be a heavy reward afterward.

128
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:02,853
Yes.

129
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:20,292
My Lady.

130
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:21,213
Just as you predicted,

131
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:22,252
Xie Ruilan has sent Xie Yaozu

132
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,132
carrying your portrait

133
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:24,652
to Yang City to inquire about you.

134
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:30,750
(The maid Huan Xi of Lan Mengyan)

135
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:39,412
It is only frostbite,
it does not matter.

136
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:43,252
Come here.

137
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:55,973
If Xie Ruilan had not
watched me so closely,

138
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:57,733
I would never have let you

139
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,213
risk yourself running errands outside.

140
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:01,532
It is nothing.

141
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:03,052
My life belongs to you, My Lady.

142
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:05,012
It was you who rescued me
from the brothel,

143
00:10:05,132 --> 00:10:05,853
and it was you

144
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:07,750
who kept those wicked people
from hurting me again.

145
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:08,892
Without you,

146
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:10,372
there would be no Huan Xi today.

147
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:11,693
For your sake,

148
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:13,093
I am willing to do anything.

149
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,012
Silly girl.

150
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:23,412
By the way, My Lady,

151
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,172
I have arranged everything
just as you instructed.

152
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,933
Even if Xie Yaozu
digs three feet into the ground,

153
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,172
he will find only evidence

154
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,990
that you are the legitimate daughter
of the Lan family.

155
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:32,733
With Lou dead,

156
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,372
Xie Ruilan will certainly seek revenge.

157
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:36,613
If you endure this round,

158
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:37,652
the next one

159
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:40,252
will be Liu Wenyu.

160
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:44,520
When the time comes,

161
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,093
you will be able
to kill your enemy yourself.

162
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:53,453
Young Madam,
the Madam wishes to see you.

163
00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:00,630
Father, Mother, I hope you are well.

164
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:03,213
May I know why you have summoned I?

165
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,093
You forged your household records
to infiltrate the Liu Residence.

166
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:10,012
What was your intention?
