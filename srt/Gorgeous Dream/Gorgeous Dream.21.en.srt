00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,260
=Gorgeous Dream=

00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,180
(Adapted from the novel
"The Charming Evil Consort")

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,020
=Episode 21=

4
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:07,173
(She should be heading
to Yunxia Inn by now.)

5
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:09,533
(Did something go wrong?)

6
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,412
(The Skinner)

7
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:12,613
Who are you?

8
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:14,893
What do you want?

9
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:18,812
You've got such fine skin.

10
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,453
It's no wonder Ms. Tong
wanted it so badly.

11
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:24,573
Tong Yan?

12
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,573
What's your connection to Tong Yan?

13
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:27,573
Your skin

14
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:29,493
is mine now.

15
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:47,333
Come catch me, Master!

16
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:15,932
What's wrong?

17
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:17,333
Yan?

18
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:18,293
Yan?

19
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:19,692
Master,

20
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,412
I'm not feeling well.

21
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:23,053
Please excuse me…

22
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:24,173
Let me see.

23
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:25,613
Yan, let me look at you.

24
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:27,733
Yan!

25
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:28,690
Please excuse me.

26
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:29,252
Yan!

27
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:30,173
Yan!

28
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:30,652
Master,

29
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,173
- Let me see you!
- please let me go!

30
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:32,812
Yan!

31
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:33,293
Master,

32
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,372
- please let me go!
- What's gotten into you?

33
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:37,853
Yan!

34
00:03:38,893 --> 00:03:39,773
- Yan!
- Master!

35
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:41,853
Let me go!

36
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:50,293
Dear…

37
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:52,252
It's me. I'm Yan.

38
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,337
(One year ago)

39
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,573
You've been repudiated!

40
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:55,132
Dear…

41
00:03:55,212 --> 00:03:56,532
Look at yourself now.

42
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:58,573
Utterly repulsive!

43
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:01,850
(Written by Zhu Lv)

44
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:02,772
(Harmony is the essence of matrimony.
Tong grew jealous)

45
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:03,308
(and rejected the other concubines.
She is hereby dismissed)

46
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:03,825
(for having violated
the Seven Criteria Code for Divorce.)

47
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:20,692
(This is the only way)

48
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:23,012
(for me to stay by his side forever)

49
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:25,772
(and never be parted from him.)

50
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,012
(As long as I stay)

51
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:38,493
(young and beautiful,)

52
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,252
(he'll love me)

53
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:43,252
(and only me forever.)

54
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:53,053
I, Tong Yan,

55
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:54,853
greet you, Master.

56
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,932
Excellent.

57
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:01,413
You… You're…

58
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:02,293
a monster!

59
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:03,853
Be not afraid, my dear.

60
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:05,413
With this new skin,

61
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,653
I look just like before.

62
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,640
Don't be afraid, my love…

63
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:08,493
Stay away from me!

64
00:05:08,772 --> 00:05:09,653
You've gone mad!

65
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,452
Dear,

66
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:11,653
you used

67
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,692
to love pale, delicate beauties.

68
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:14,772
This skin

69
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:16,692
was crafted exactly to your liking.

70
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:18,653
So why do you loathe me now?

71
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:19,533
You madwoman!

72
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:20,772
Stay away!

73
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:22,213
Don't come near me!

74
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:23,173
Dear!

75
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:24,452
My love!

76
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,185
(Lan Mengyan, from Hang City,
25, bold in love and hate,)

77
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:28,950
(naive, wealthy, easy to control)

78
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:30,932
My love!

79
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:33,053
Dear!

80
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:35,853
My love!

81
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:38,213
Dear!

82
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:40,892
Dear!

83
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,730
- Stay away from me!
- My love…

84
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,932
Please don't despise how I look.

85
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:49,252
Please don't reject me.

86
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,012
Dear…

87
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:57,932
Isn't this the face you adored?

88
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:00,093
As long as this skin

89
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:02,213
pleases you

90
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:04,533
and keeps you enchanted,

91
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:06,012
why should you care

92
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,012
what lies beneath?

93
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:15,493
My love…

94
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:20,372
My love…

95
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:47,372
Talk.

96
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,213
What were you and Tong Yan plotting?

97
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:52,132
Tong Yan and I have
worked together for years.

98
00:06:52,973 --> 00:06:54,733
Zhu Lv got sick of her aging looks,

99
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:56,372
so she took

100
00:06:56,812 --> 00:06:58,932
the women who'd broken bureau rules.

101
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:01,012
I changed their skins for her

102
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:02,692
to please Zhu Lv.

103
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,252
Where are those women now?

104
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:07,533
I…

105
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:08,733
I don't know.

106
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:10,892
I was forced to do this.

107
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:13,053
Please spare me.

108
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:14,093
Spare you?

109
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:15,653
If I spare you,

110
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:17,692
who'll spare all the innocent women

111
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:19,653
you skinned alive?

112
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:25,213
Let's go.

113
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:30,012
Why?

114
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:32,252
I tore out my heart for him,
I skinned for him,

115
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:34,332
I killed for him…

116
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:36,012
Why won't

117
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:39,332
he love me?

118
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:42,770
To win a man's favor, you took lives

119
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:44,250
and stole the skins of others,

120
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:46,653
yet he treats you like dirt.

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,090
How could anything end well
when you destroy yourself

122
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:50,213
like this?

123
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:52,973
To love another,
you must first love yourself.

124
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:54,690
If you don't cherish yourself,

125
00:07:54,853 --> 00:07:57,093
how can you expect anyone else to?

126
00:07:59,452 --> 00:08:00,093
Love

127
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:02,853
myself?

128
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,372
What did you mean by tributes?

129
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,413
The Mid-Moon Banquet.

130
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:22,812
The Mid-Moon Banquet…

131
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:24,012
They're at…

132
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,132
Who's behind all of this?

133
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:28,653
Where are they?

134
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:34,372
They're outside the city…

135
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:35,613
Outside?

136
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:39,493
Where exactly?

137
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,000
Tell me! Where exactly outside the city?

138
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:42,693
Someone's coming.

139
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,560
We've got a lead.
We'll uncover the truth soon enough.

140
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:45,733
She's dead. We have to go.

141
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,372
(Tong Yan thought
she had put on a new skin,)

142
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:50,892
(but everything she saw)

143
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:53,252
(was nothing more than a dream)
(amid the bureau's incense.)

144
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,790
(The Jade Spy Bureau controlled others
with an incense of illusion,)

145
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,012
(now they've gotten a taste)

146
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:58,493
(of their own poison.)

147
00:08:58,493 --> 00:08:59,052
Who's this?

148
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:00,212
What's she doing here?

149
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:05,933
This is morbid.

150
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,132
It's Instructor Tong.

151
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,333
What happened to her?

152
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:22,652
After several rounds,

153
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,350
I placed first in every skill.
Music, weiqi, calligraphy, etiquette,

154
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,490
ceremony, archery, and riding.

155
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,270
I'm far enough
that no one else can catch up.

156
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:30,613
I just need one more point today

157
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:33,252
and no one can take my title.

158
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:35,412
Focus on the finals.

159
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,680
Don't worry about anything else.

160
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:37,990
We'll meet after the competition.

161
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,172
But the Mid-Moon Banquet
is heavily guarded.

162
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,790
Only high-ranking officials
and nobles are permitted entry.

163
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,970
How will you find your way in?

164
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,950
I've already had them
scout the hidden paths.

165
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,990
An invitation is needed,
but it won't stop me.

166
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:51,252
Don't worry about me.

167
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:53,613
We still don't know
who the mastermind is,

168
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,093
so keep your guard up.

169
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,292
I wish you success in advance.

170
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,252
May you win the title of the best lady.

171
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,900
All the best to the both of us.

172
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:04,412
All right.

173
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,590
Master, everything is ready
for the Mid-Moon Banquet.

174
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,172
However, I learned from the black market

175
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:40,973
that a man and a woman
are investigating the banquet.

176
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:42,813
Who are they?

177
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:44,412
I asked for a description.

178
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:46,412
The woman seems to be

179
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,132
a lady named Lan Mengyan
from the bureau.

180
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,132
And the man

181
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:51,973
appears to be the Lord.

182
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:53,333
Take her to the banquet.

183
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:56,772
I want her to suffer worse than death.
