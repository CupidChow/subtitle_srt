00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:52,180
(Adapted from the novel
"The Charming Evil Consort")

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,020
=Episode 7=

4
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:11,800
This way, please.

5
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:12,573
Alright.

6
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:14,532
Father.

7
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,692
This morning the opera troupe said
Du Liniang's costume was gnawed by rats.

8
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:19,280
There's no replacement for now.

9
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:20,493
I am foolish.

10
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:23,092
Please go to the backyard
to decide for yourself, Father.

11
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:25,132
Alright.

12
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,910
Let's go take a look together.

13
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:27,692
Let's go.

14
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:51,013
Qing.

15
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:54,412
Qing.

16
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:56,812
Qing.

17
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:58,493
How improper to be so rash?

18
00:02:58,613 --> 00:02:59,132
Qing.

19
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,510
What saint are you pretending to be?

20
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:04,333
Just now,

21
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,613
I clearly saw you flirting
with my Qing.

22
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,290
Acting aroused in front
of your daughter-in-law,

23
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,853
do you have no shame?

24
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:12,652
Qing.

25
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,652
Why are you having hysterics
first thing in the morning?

26
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:18,092
Look clearly.

27
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:19,372
I am your Father!

28
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:21,013
I see everything clearly!

29
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,692
It's you

30
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:25,733
who stealing my Qing.

31
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:28,293
Insolent!

32
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:30,493
How did I raise

33
00:03:30,613 --> 00:03:32,173
such a foul-mouthed beast?

34
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:39,270
Bring it here.

35
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,212
Give it to me.

36
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:44,853
You actually still touch this.

37
00:03:45,212 --> 00:03:45,790
Give it to me.

38
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,573
You useless thing!

39
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:50,893
So what if I inhale this?

40
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:54,590
I inhale this and it's still better than
you flirting with your daughter-in-law.

41
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:56,013
How am I worse than you

42
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:57,532
that you must steal my beloved?

43
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,212
For a woman,

44
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:10,013
you'd even raise a hand against me?

45
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:14,333
Truly a waste with nothing
but love on the mind.

46
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:15,092
I...

47
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:16,413
A waste?

48
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:17,692
Then what are you?

49
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:18,692
You

50
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:21,173
are a fool held up high
by those around you,

51
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:23,093
the greatest joke in the world!

52
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:25,093
You think you're clever,

53
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:26,053
but you don't know

54
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:27,252
that long ago,

55
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:29,892
you were already toyed with
by my mother.

56
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:30,772
You wretch!

57
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,493
What did you say?

58
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:36,270
Otherwise, what do you think

59
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:37,892
where did this top-grade

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,790
Wushi Powder I have come from?

61
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:41,452
It was my mother

62
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,572
who took the money you offered
to that nobleman

63
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,812
and exchanged it little by little.

64
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,493
Here, taste it.

65
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:48,533
Taste it.

66
00:04:58,493 --> 00:04:59,572
You still don't know?

67
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:01,692
Your accounts as Prefect Liu

68
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:03,932
are already empty.

69
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:05,772
Empty!

70
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:10,372
Good.

71
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:13,772
Very good.

72
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:14,812
Today,

73
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:17,372
I shall cleanse the Liu family

74
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:19,293
of its disgrace!

75
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,137

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,080
(Liu Mingzhen, Shen Wanqing)

79
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:41,132
Mother.

80
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:47,692
The hour has arrived.

81
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:50,093
Is come especially to escort you

82
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:51,252
to enjoy the opera.

83
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:53,533
Today's performance,
"The Orphan of Zhao"

84
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:56,293
will be performed personally
by my husband on stage.

85
00:05:57,053 --> 00:05:59,733
It'll surely be more splendid
than previous years.

86
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,533
What have you done to Wenyu?

87
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:04,293
The good show is about to begin.

88
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:06,372
You must not miss the time, Mother.

89

91
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:20,613
I'll chop you to death!

92
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,093
Chop you to death!

93
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:24,332
(Zhenbai Pavilion)
Come come, seats over here.

94
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:24,990
Seats over here.

95
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:26,252
Come, sit here.

96
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,132
This is a good spot.

97
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,973
Let me tell you.

98
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:35,132
There's a great show today.

99
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:36,733
Honored guests.

100

The good show is about to begin.

101
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:42,012
Please enjoy the performance.

(Zhenbai Pavilion)

103
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:52,213
Look!

104
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:55,533
The son is actually beating his Father!

105
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:57,853
(Zhenbai Pavilion)
The world has gone mad!

106
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,190
Such sin! What is happening?

107
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:00,012
Defying all ethics!

108
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:01,173

109
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:02,892

(The Orphan of Zhao)

115
00:07:31,772 --> 00:07:32,812
(The Orphan of Zhao)
Why are they still fighting?

116
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,012
What is he throwing?

117
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,452
Should I keep pulling?

118
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,012
(Zhenbai Pavilion)
Keep pulling.

119
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:46,962
(The Orphan of Zhao)

120
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:52,613
That's the play.

121
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:53,653
Don't stop.

122
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:55,413
(The Orphan of Zhao)

123
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:57,533
Move aside, I'm going to kill him!

124
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:58,733
No!

125
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,132
Hurry, go!

126
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:02,493
No, Master!

127
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:03,733
Move!

128
00:08:07,712 --> 00:08:09,293
(The Orphan of Zhao)

129
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:09,733
Wonderful!

130
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:11,692
Wonderful!

131
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:16,692
My Father and husband's
"The Duel at Huidou Pass"

132
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:18,932
was truly splendid.

133
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:20,692
Just acting.

134
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:22,452
Scared me to death.

135
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:25,973
Mother, you got too immersed in it.

136
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,470
It didn't look like acting at all.

137
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:33,333
Just now,

138
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:37,693
my son and I,
specially arranged this performance

139
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:39,973
(Zhenbai Pavilion)
to add some amusement to the banquet.

140
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:42,252
(Orphan of Zhao)
Our acting was crude, please forgive us.

141
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,933
So it was changed to
"The Duel at Huidou Pass".

142
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:46,892
Well-performed.

143
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:47,772
Gave me a fright.

144
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:48,892
So it was all acting.

145
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:50,172
Truly thoughtful!

146
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:51,613
Really well-acted.

147
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:52,172
Indeed.

148
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,052
Indeed.

149
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,170
I almost reported it to the authorities.

150
00:08:56,172 --> 00:08:57,733
It really was a good show.

151
00:08:58,532 --> 00:08:59,292
Do it again.

152
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,652
Alright!

153
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:04,213
(Zhenbai Pavilion)
Alright, once more!

154
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:05,372
Once more!

155
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:06,493
Once more!

156
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:09,252
(Zhenbai Pavilion)
Forgive us.

157
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:10,453
Forgive us.

158
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:11,693
Forgive us.

159
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:13,213
Forgive us.

160
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,252
Thank you all for your praise!

161
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:17,093
Unfortunately, my father and husband

162
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:18,453
prepared only this one scene.

163
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,670
Please, everyone, take your seats.

164
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:22,652
(Zhenbai Pavilion)
The troupe will be on stage shortly

165
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:24,733
to bring more wonderful performances.

166
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:25,933
Hurry.

167
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:27,890
Everyone, take your seats.

168
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:28,850
(The Orphan of Zhao)

169
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:05,012
Look at the fine son you raised!

170
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,213
He dared to attempt patricide!

171
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:09,372
Calm down, Father.

172
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:11,412
Don't harm your health with anger.

173
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:20,412
(Steadfast and Upright)
Fortunately you reacted quickly today.

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,733
Otherwise, the reputation
of the Liu family

175
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,213
would've been utterly ruined
by that unfilial son.

176
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,693
This is my duty as a daughter-in-law.

177
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:31,532
Master.

178
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:32,892
As you instructed,

179
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,890
I've ordered strict guard everywhere
in the residence.

180
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,500
The young master should still be inside.

181
00:10:36,693 --> 00:10:38,172
But with so many courtyards,

182
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:40,052
we have yet to find where he's hiding.

183
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:41,933
Useless fools.

184
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:43,252
Go find him at once.

185
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:44,012
Yes.

186
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:45,650
We will search thoroughly immediately.

187
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:50,213
I will not disturb your rest, Father.

188
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:58,772
You go back to the ancestral hall

189
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:00,052
and continue kneeling.

00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:17,072
(Liu Wangshu, Li Shushen, Liu Mingzhen)

192
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:44,892
Wenyu.

193
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:48,613
Wenyu.

194
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:57,652
Why are you here?

195
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:01,132
Why are you here?

196
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:03,693
Your son told me.

197
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:05,573
What did you do to my son?

198
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:09,372
Don't worry.

199
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:11,093
He's not dead.

200
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:13,733
He's in a

201
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:17,333
very safe place.

202
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:19,573
If you dare harm my son even a little,

203
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:22,252
I will see that you die
without a burial.

204
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:25,093
Die?

205
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:30,292
Wasn't the burial place
of my entire Shen family

206
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,933
chosen by your own hands?

207
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,493
So you really are Shen Wanqing.

208
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:43,573
Shen Wanqing.

209
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:46,412
What exactly do you want?

210
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,693
Touch me again,

211
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:53,252
and you'll never see your son again.
