00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,588
=Gorgeous Dream=

2
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:52,180
(Adapted from the novel
"The Charming Evil Consort")

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,020
=Episode 8=

4
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:56,932
Shen Wanqing!

5
00:00:57,652 --> 00:00:59,693
What exactly do you want?

6
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:02,852
Touch me again,

7
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:06,333
and you'll never see your son again.

8
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,613
If you want to see your son,

9
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:26,253
trade it for the truth of that year.

10
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:29,590
I don't know what you're talking about.

11
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:37,932
Liu Qinghe was a bandit
who robbed and killed,

12
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:41,053
yet he managed to slaughter
the entire Liu family

13
00:01:41,212 --> 00:01:43,572
and live under another
man's name for 20 years

14
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:46,732
without ever slipping up.

15
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:48,973
There must have been someone

16
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,493
who paved the way for all of you.

17
00:01:54,493 --> 00:01:56,292
What I want is the person

18
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:57,893
who raised you bandits

19
00:01:57,893 --> 00:01:59,693
up to this splendid high hall.

20
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:01,333
Who is he?

21
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,652
You vicious woman!

22
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:06,012
Are you trying to kill me?

23
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:08,132
A vicious woman?

24
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:09,853
Xie Ruilan.

25
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:13,092
When you played Liu Qinghe's accomplice,

26
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:14,773
how many lives did you cost?

27
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,173
Using the bones of one woman
after another

28
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,333
to build that man-eating
arch of chastity,

29
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,532
have you ever heard

30
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:25,013
their crying at night?

31
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:38,692
You were born noble,

32
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,812
a young lady.

33
00:02:41,573 --> 00:02:43,532
You had everything from birth.

34
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:45,372
You know nothing of us.

35
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:48,613
Back then,

36
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,092
we fought to the death just
for a mouthful of food.

37
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:54,412
Do you think this overwhelming fortune

38
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:55,932
fell from the sky?

39
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:59,252
If we hadn't stepped on others' heads,

40
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:01,692
we'd have frozen to death
in a mass grave long ago.

41
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,212
To survive,

42
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:07,613
what's wrong with doing
whatever it takes?

43
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,132
As long as I hold power,

44
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,412
even if my name were Xie Zhaodi,

45
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,372
no one would dare look down on me.

46
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:20,652
Using others' bones

47
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:23,013
to raise yourself higher,

48
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:24,013
can you swallow

49
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:25,972
such wealth?

50
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,733
Can you ever repay

51
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:29,132
so many sins?

52
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:30,493
So what?

53
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:31,532
Do you think

54
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,853
the Shen family is any better?

55
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:36,053
Using Dongzhu pearl to raise
the Qin family's army,

56
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,453
and meddling in state affairs.

57
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:38,333
This world

58
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,613
was ruined by people like you,

59
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,412
monsters who defy all order

60
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:43,812
who turned the world upside down.

61
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,212
There was never any Dongzhu pearl.

62
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:55,252
So what?

63
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:59,053
Just you alone,
you think you can topple the heavens?

64
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,290
Then I'll tear apart the power
that made the lies.

65
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:12,812
Even if I tell you what you want,

66
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:15,533
I don't believe you'll spare my son.

67
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:23,772
Believe it or not,

68
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,733
that's up to you.

69
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:27,332
Either way,

70
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:30,293
you have no choice.

71
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:36,853
Enough.

72
00:04:37,252 --> 00:04:38,053
Go back and rest.

73
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:41,372
You have one night to consider.

74
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:00,533
You still dare show your face?

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,590
Where did you hide that wretched child?

76
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:03,892
Where is he?

77
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:08,733
I know you covet the Lan family.

78
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:23,493
Are you seeking death?

79
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:30,973
Would you really bear to kill me, Master?

80
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:32,932
How could you

81
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:36,892
trust an outsider to handle
all that dirty money?

82
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:39,493
You still dare speak of shame?

83
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:41,252
(Steadfast and Upright)
As the Matriarch of the Liu family,

84
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,990
you embezzled the estate
to fund that brat,

85
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:44,290
leaving the Liu Residence empty.

86
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:48,252
Where will the monthly tribute silver
come from now?

87
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,252
Master, I have my own clever plan.

88
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:10,053
Young madam.

89
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:11,973
Speak.

90
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,213
Madam...

91
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:15,293
Madam found young master's body
by the lake.

92
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:16,772
What?

93
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:31,293
Son!

94
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:34,093
My son!

95
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:36,533
Why did you leave me like this?

96
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:39,892
What am I supposed to do now?

97
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:42,293
My son!

98
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:45,733
What are you doing?

99
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:50,733
Wenyu is already gone.

100
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:55,853
Let him rest in peace.

101
00:06:57,372 --> 00:06:58,213
Mother.

102
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,270
My husband was an excellent swimmer.

103
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,613
This matter is rather strange.

104
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:04,772
It's better to see the body clearly.

105
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:07,812
This is my son.

106
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,892
I absolutely will not be mistaken.

107
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,293
Yan.

108
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:16,812
Yan.

109
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:18,132
Rest assured.

110
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:21,093
I will make sure you

111
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,853
remain forever with my son in dignity.

112
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:25,653
According to the rules
of the Liu family,

113
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:27,132
when a man dies,

114
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:30,093
a woman must accompany him in burial.

115
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:34,533
This at least fulfills your wedded love.

116
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,293
Master has arrived.

117
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:41,332
Darling.

118
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:42,213
Father.

119
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:43,613
Father.

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,390
The body has been in water so long
that it is unrecognizable.

121
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:48,132
Please allow me to examine the body.

122
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:49,372
Fine.

123
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:50,653
Quick.

124
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,012
You...

125
00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:57,733
Father, it really isn't him.

126
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:59,653
It really is my son.

127
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:09,293
Son. My son!

128
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:12,372
Heavens above.

129
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:17,332
Master.

130
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:21,132
Speak.

131
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:22,572
Master.

132
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:24,990
Using "to follow husband in death",

133
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,533
let Lan Mengyan
fake her death in a coffin.

134
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:29,733
This way you could seize her dowry,

135
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:33,093
enough to supply the tribute money
to the nobleman by month-end.

136
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:38,012
You could also naturally
bring her into the private courtyard

137
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:41,333
and protect her from the gossip
of the world.

138
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:44,853
Tomorrow,

139
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,573
you just need

140
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,132
to find a stand-in corpse.

141
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:53,252
Yu.

142
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:03,292
My poor Yan.

143
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:11,252
Six hours later,

144
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:14,372
the funeral procession will carry
the coffin in.

145
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:17,772
If you do not wish to die with him,

146
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,453
return my son to me.

147
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:33,532
Come, Yan.

148
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:34,813
Get up quickly.

149
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:39,573
My poor, ill-fated Yan.

150
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:43,012
Steward Chen.

151
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:45,693
Help the young madam back
to her room to rest.

152
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:47,132
Attend to her carefully.

153
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:47,772
Yes.

154
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:24,650
(Four hours later)

155
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:27,493
Qing.

156
00:11:28,532 --> 00:11:29,690
Why are you only arriving now?

157
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:32,012
You promised to run away with me.

158
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:33,532
Were you lying to me?

159
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:09,012
Wenyu.

160
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:10,613
Wenyu.

161
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,950
- Are you alright?
- Mother.

162
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:13,573
Mother.

163
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:14,652
Mother.

164
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,573
My dear son.

165
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:17,172
I have finally found you.

166
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:19,172
Listen.

167
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,573
I have already found
a stand-in corpse for you.

168
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:24,172
In a few days, I will take you away.

169
00:12:24,973 --> 00:12:25,493
Good.

170
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:26,532
Good.

171
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:28,172
My son.

172
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:29,772
I'm glad you're safe.

173
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:33,933
Look at you, you're covered in bruises.

174
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,412
You've lost so much weight these days.

175
00:12:41,892 --> 00:12:43,252
It's all because of that wretch

176
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:46,213
who brought you to this state.

177
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:49,532
Yes.

178
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:51,412
All because of her.

179
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:52,772
All because of her.

180
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:56,733
I will kill her now.
