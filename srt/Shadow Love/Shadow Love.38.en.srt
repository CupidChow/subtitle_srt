Protect His Majesty.

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,080
Who are you?

7
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,310
How dare you disrupt
the funeral procession

8
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,510
of Taijin's Empress?

9
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,040
How can my beloved wife

10
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,070
enter your imperial mausoleum?

11
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,590
I issued the military order

12
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,850
forbidding you to eat.

13
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,920
Eat this candy secretly.

14
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,840
Eat it secretly.

Your Majesty set this trap

17
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,360
just to lure Duan Aodeng out

18
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,240
to kill him.

19
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,830
Given the current situation,

20
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,000
he must've regained his powers.

21
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,180
Without a clever strategy,

22
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,710
he's impossible to defeat.

23
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,830

Shuang devoted her entire life to Taijin.

98
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,860

but you even

101
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
used her corpse as bait

102
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,560
to lure me out.

103
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,910
I'm the ruler of a nation.

104
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,890
Li Shuang is the posthumously honored
empress of Taijin.

105
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,220
As the mother figure of the empire,

106
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,390
in life, she fought enemies
in the battlefield,

107
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,720
and in death, she helps Taijin

108
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,850
eliminate threats.

109
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,650
What's wrong with that?

110
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,360
I should've never
let her return to Taijin.

111
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,390
You failed to protect her—

112
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,549
If you truly loved her,

113
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,410
why'd it fall to me to protect her?

114
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,610
You betrayed her.

115
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,080
Now you want to take her away again.

117
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,200
Don't you think you're being too greedy?

118
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
However, I didn't expect

119
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,990
that you'd go to such lengths

120
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,720
to restore the Jade Linglong.

121
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,570
I accept my defeat.

122
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,910
I only hope

123
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,270
that after my death,

124
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,410
you won't use the Jade Linglong's power
to wage war.

125
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,740
Give the people of Taijin

126
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,390
peace and tranquility.

127
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,350
I'm no longer Prince Annan of Yao State.

128
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,670
Worldly affairs are

129
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,400
no longer my concern.

130
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,510
I didn't

131
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,720
come here to kill you.

132
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,030
Killing you

133
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,360
would only breed more hatred.

134
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,930
I just want to take Shuang home.

135
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,960
All my flesh and blood

136
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,730
have been hunted down and killed by me.

137
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,720
Even if you kill me,

138
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,790
except for Shuang,

139
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,480
no one would avenge me.

140
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,260
There are also your people of Taijin.

141
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,830
Since you took the throne,

142
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,950
you've led the people and nation

143
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,880
with compassion and diplomacy.

144
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,220
You're a good emperor.

145
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,950
The peace between our two states

146
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,690
was bought with Shuang's life.

147
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,480
You owe it to her to safeguard it.

148
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,200
You love her more

149
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,960
than I imagined.

150
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,350
Your Majesty.

151
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,440
This Dream Powder is

152
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,010
the most precious secret drug
in the palace.

153
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,440
It's the only one in the world,

154
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,150
an heirloom

155
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,440
for emergencies.

156
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,120
Are you really sure

157
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,480
you want to use it on General Li?

158
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,630
Everyone in Taijin

159
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,910
wants her dead.

160
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,290
But I won't allow it.

161
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,390
In my lifetime,

162
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,060
I owe her too much.

163
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,910
I can only use this

164
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,080
to let her live on.

165
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,800
The Dream Powder

166
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,120
stops one's breathing,

167
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,950
making them appear dead.

168
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,960
Once you take this pill,

169
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,510
you'll awaken

170
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,400
in 3 days.

171
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,560
Since Shuang is still alive,

172
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,610
why did you set up this trap?

173
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
To lure you out.

174
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,720
You renounced your title as Prince Annan.

175
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,850
I already knew that.

176
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,440
So,

177
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,180
I decided to take a gamble,

178
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,450
betting that you still love Shuang deeply

179
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,870
and would do anything to save her.

180
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,900
What I carry on my shoulders is

181
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,450
the weight of the empire

182
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,380
and all its people.

183
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,320
I can't love her alone.

184
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,200
But you can.

185
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,010
Gambling with your life,

186
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,830
aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

187
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,420
This journey

188
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,380
has been perilous.

189
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,720
My hands are stained
with the blood of many,

190
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,440
yet I've never felt indebted to anyone,

191
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,610
except for Shuang.

192
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,960
I owe her too much.

193
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,550
If I were to die for her,

194
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,210
I'd have no regrets.

195
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,360
From now on,

196
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,210
Prince Annan no longer exists,

197
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,120
nor does General Li.

198
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,550
May Taijin and Yao

199
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
remain allies

200
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,030
forever.

201
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,780
[Wuling]

202
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,360
If you keep refusing

203
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,620
food, water, and rest,

204
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,310
I'm afraid you'll collapse

205
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,960
before Shuang wakes up.

206
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,560
It's already the third day.

207
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,480
Why hasn't she awakened?

208
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,150
Three days is just an estimate.

209
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,480
How drugs work is contingent on

210
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,360
your constitution,

211
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,550
which varies.

212
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,320
Mo Yin said

213
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,870
it's normal to last for five to ten days.

214
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,480
There's no need to be so anxious.

215
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,270
Is it five days

216
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,320
or ten days?

217
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,550
So what if you know the exact time?

218
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,720
When Shuang wakes up

219
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,520
and sees you looking half-dead,

220
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,550
she might become so upset

221
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,720
that she faints again.

222
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,980
After all you've done,

223
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,880
are you still

224
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,160
going to make her suffer for nothing?

225
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,840
How'd it go?

226
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,330
He finally ate something.

227
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,870
That's good.

228
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,080
I added

229
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,840
calming medicine to his porridge

230
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,370
so he could rest for a while,

231
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,630
lest he

232
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,320
completely ruins his health.

233
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,910
Can you guarantee

234
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Shuang will

235
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,250
wake up again?

236
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,200
Actually, I'm not that anxious.

237
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,349
I can wait for you.

238
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,270
Let alone a few days,

239
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,570
even if it takes years,

240
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,550
decades,

241
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,780
or even centuries,

242
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,380
I'll wait for you forever.

243
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,030
Anyway, you are

244
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,760
stuck with me in this lifetime.

245
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,000
Mo Yin thought I couldn't leave you

246
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,230
because the Jade Linglong had

247
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,440
chosen its master.

248
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,120
But he doesn't know that

249
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,880
even the rarest spiritual entities

250
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,100
lack the ability to love.

251
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,480
What truly loves you

252
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,000
is me...

253
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,480
and my heart.

254
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,480
So,

255
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,960
whether I remove the Jade Linglong

256
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,310
or lose my memory,

257
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,830
or whether I am Jin'an or Duan Aodeng,

258
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,160
no matter how many times we start over,

259
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,310
I'll irresistibly fall in love with you

260
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,750
time and again.

261
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,060
Uncontrollably...

262
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,030
I'll fall for you all over again.

263
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,760
Even in the worst case

264
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,560
where you really

265
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,670
never wake up in this lifetime,

266
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,130
I'm not afraid.

267
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,200
Because we agreed

268
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,590
to be born together

269
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,270
and to die together.

270
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,590

Who are you?

298
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,070
You...

299
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,260
don't remember me?

300
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,080
Why am I here?

301
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,680
Did you just

302
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,650
call me Shuang?

303
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,140
Is that my name?

304
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,990
Don't come near me!

305
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,440
Stay right there.

306
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,310
Why am I here?

307
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,850
What's your relationship with me?

308
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,830
Answer me!

309
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,720
Who are you?

310
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,280
It's okay.

311
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,590
When I forgot everything,

312
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,070
you suffered alone.

313
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,590
Now I guess it's my turn.

314
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,930
As long as you're safe and healthy,

315
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,210
I'll be whoever

316
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,570
you want me to be.

317
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,400
What nonsense

318
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,710
are you talking about?

319
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,920
What's your

320
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,750
relationship with me?

321
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,160
I am your—

322
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,750
Just stay put

323
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,920
and talk!

324
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,880
I am your...

325
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,750
Your...

326
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,350
I get it now.

327
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,720
You're a thug!

328
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,160
A man and woman alone

329
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,440
in this remote wilderness—

330
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,900
you must've kidnapped me!

331
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,870
How's this a remote wilderness?

332
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,090
Besides,

333
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,250
do I really look like a thug?

334
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,590
I'll go to you.

335
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,690
Don't you move.

336
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,790
Stay still.

337
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,470
Well,

338
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,020
you're quite handsome.

339
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,720
I doubt you're a bad guy.

340
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,360
Are you the fox spirit

341
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,400
who gave your heart to me,

342
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,350
a hunter who fell off a cliff?

343
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,160
You have no memory of your past,

344
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,870
but you remember the stories

345
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,960
in the biographies quite well.

346
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,560
Do you read biographies too?

347
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,400
Then do you know

348
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,110
when the main characters

349
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,550
are the happiest

350
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,070
in those stories?

351
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,200
When?

352
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,550
When

353
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,200
it's a false alarm

354
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,850
and when they find what they've lost.

355
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,510
Today,

356
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,620
you've experienced both.

357
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,550
By the Mandate of Heaven,

358
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,310
the Emperor decrees:

359
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,530
[Imperial Palace of Taijin]
[Three months later]

360
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,480
Since our nation and Yao State

361
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,880
have formed an alliance,

362
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,590
we're fortunate to have peace

363
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,110
throughout the land.

364
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,240
All weapons

365
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,440
may now be sheathed and silenced.

366
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,550
Taxes and labor duties will be reduced

367
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,920
nationwide,

368
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,640
to give relief to the people.

369
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,070
Starting today,

370
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,480
these policies shall be

371
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,240
implemented in all regions

372
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,110
and evaluated accordingly.

373
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,030
His Majesty is wise and enlightened!

374
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,910
[I will certainly fulfill]

375
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,880
[everything we once hoped for together.]

376
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,190
[I won't fail the world,]

377
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,830
[nor will I fail you.]

378
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,000
I heard that

379
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,660
Taijin and Yao State have
signed a peace treaty.

380
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,040
All the people

381
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,160
can finally live in peace.

382
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,550
Before they left,

383
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,890
I checked Jin'an's pulse.

384
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,880
He's no different from
ordinary people now.

385
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,480
According to ancient texts,

386
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,590
his shadow puppet and blood master
have merged.

387
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,200
He is now his own master,

388
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,960
which means

389
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,220
the Jade Linglong will

390
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,800
only have health-strengthening effects.

391
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,680
Which ancient text?

392
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,360
I've never come across that.

393
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,310
That's because your studies are lacking.

394
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,570
Go look it up yourself.

395
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,640
Before, you went through so much trouble

396
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,120
to get that Jade Linglong.

397
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,470
Why aren't you

398
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,850
in a hurry to get it back from Jin'an now?

399
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,750
I originally thought

400
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,510
the shadow puppet was just an emotionless

401
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,590
killing machine.

402
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,510
But Jin'an's heart is

403
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,110
full of love

404
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,150
and kindness.

405
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,040
After getting to know him,

406
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,860
my view of the Jade Linglong
has completely changed.

407
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,240
Besides, the Jade Linglong has chosen him.

408
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,270
It'd be near impossible for anyone else

409
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,640
to take it and use it.

410
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,160
Leaving it with him

411
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,540
wouldn't hurt.

412
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,200
But, Master Mo,

413
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,840
you're still generous,

414
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,480
willing to give away

415
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,510
such a treasure

416
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,440
to someone else.

417
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,270
What are you saying?

418
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
I have

419
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,220
always been generous.

420
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,590
If you're that generous,

421
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,880
why don't you

422
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,270
give me this Wuling Mountain

423
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,250
filled with treasures?

424
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,830
If you like it,

425
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,640
it's yours.

426
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,630
Everyone in Wuling Mountain

427
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,050
treats you as
the lady of the house anyway.

428
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,000
It would make

429
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,270
no difference.

430
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,880
Since the Master has spoken,

431
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,400
then my position

432
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,290
should be made official.

433
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,790
Well, you're getting on in years,

434
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,880
and you're quite pleasing to the eye.

435
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
I guess I shall deign to

436
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,640
compromise and be your missus.

437
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,750
You...

438
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,110
As a young lady,

439
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,880
how could you speak so boldly

440
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,940
without any shame?

441
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,860
Do you agree or not?

442
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,310
I'm extraordinarily good-looking.

443
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,240
Who's compromising is debatable.

444
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,010
Are you feeling shy?

445
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,590
You're blushing.

446
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,920
Why are you blushing?

447
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,810
You're blushing!

448
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,790
Yes or no?

449
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,790
So that's a yes?

450
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,270
Yes?

451
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,590
Here, everyone gets
a piece of stewed meat!

452
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,550
Don't fight over it.

453
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,400
Me too!

454
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:07,960
Don't take hers.

455
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,350
Me too!

456
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,880
Who else wants some stewed meat?

457
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,750
Raise your hand!

458
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,160
Me!

459
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,590
Me too!

460
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,070
Here.

461
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,110
One piece each.

462
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,720
Me too!

463
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,380
Okay, okay.

464
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,640
This one is for your mother.

465
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,550
Here's yours.

466
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,240
Don't say I'm playing favorites.

467
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,280
[In loving memory
of my friend, Qiao]

468
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,460
These children are

469
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,490
all orphans I took in after you left.

470
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,260
They have a home now.

471
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,550
This must have been your wish.

472
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,720
Rest assured.

473
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,170
I'll do everything in my power

474
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,840
to protect them.

475
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,200
It's just like the old days.

476
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,270
The Lis are really

477
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,950
all the same.

478
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,110
Again!

479
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,160
Come on!

480
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,880
Chang Huaisheng from Squad 3, Team 3,

481
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
fall out and rest.

482
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,970
Deputy General Ji,

483
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,750
I can still go on!

484
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,580
New recruits naturally

485
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,510
have different physical conditions.

486
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,640
To become elites of the Changfeng Army,

487
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,240
you need a solid foundation.

488
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,830
Neither should you be lazy

489
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,360
nor should you rush things.

490
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:37,930
Fall out.

491
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,640
Yes, sir!

492
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,570
Deputy General Ji.

493
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,480
Sir,

494
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,680
you know my name?

495
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,110
Mr. Ji,

496
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,710
you're just like my sister now,

497
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,110

498
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,370
in the Changfeng Army.

499
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,950
Everyone, listen up!

500
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,350
Train hard!

501
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,760
Keep your back straight!

502
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,030
You,

503
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,850

Why was I

00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,640
so stubborn before,

617
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,650
not knowing how to enjoy life?

618
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,800
As long as you're happy.

619
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,670
Fan harder.

620
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,000
Alright,

621
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,150
that's enough

622
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,840
for today.

623
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,510
Thank you, Master.

624
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,920
I've barely taught you anything.

625
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,320
I'm no master.

626
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,440
Then what should

627
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,630
we call you?

628
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,550
If not Master...

629
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,350
Call me Uncle.

630
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:13,550
See?

631
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,510
I told you they were a couple.

632
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,480
Come on, let's go play.

633
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,680
Help needed!

634
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,150
Please help, you two!

635
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,400
We're out of firewood.

636
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,130
Can you watch

637
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,580
these two little ones?

638
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,430
Sure, leave them to us. Go ahead.

639
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,080
Have fun.

640
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,250
Be careful on your way.

641
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:29,960
Alright!

642
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,590
Are you hot?

643
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,320
Don't run around!

644
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:35,920
Don't run!

645
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,960
There's a ball there too!

646
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,690
Don't fight!

647
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,090
I'll get you another ball.

648
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,110
Don't bump into others!

649
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,960
Be careful.

650
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,200
You'll fall.
Don't climb on the dining table.

651
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,010
Don't pluck the flowers!

652
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,060
Are you hot?

653
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,800
It's really not easy

654
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,760
to watch kids.

655
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
I think it's nice.

656
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,000
With so many kids, it's so lively

657
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,880
and fun.

658
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,000
Don't run too fast!

659
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,030
It is fun.

660
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,630
Just a bit tiring.

661
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,630
Why don't you

662
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,840
help me recharge?

663
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,480
How?

664
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,920
Give me a kiss.

665
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,440
No way.

666
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,390
They're all watching.

667
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,150
They're busy playing.

668
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,800
Just one kiss.

669
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Just a quick peck.

670
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,070
It'll be a bad influence on the kids! No!

671
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:30,710
Just a peck.

672
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,280
No.

673
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,080
We've been together for so long.

674
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,110
They are looking!

675
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,110
They're not!

676
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,710
What do you mean?
Look, so many

677
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,110
-pairs of eyes!
-Then...

678
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,800
Let's do this.

679
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,400
I'll block their view.

680
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,150
Kiss me secretly.

681
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,840
Secretly.

682
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,480
No. No way.

683
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,230
They can't see us.

684
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:41,880
Then I'll kiss you.

685
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,320
No, that won't work either.

686
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,580
Fine, no kissing then.

687
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,890
Finally got them all settled.

688
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,930
Taking care of kids is really not easy.

689
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,430
What's wrong?

690
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,230
I was thinking...

691
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,250
The kids have someone to soothe them.

692
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,850
Why doesn't anyone soothe me?

693
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,120
Are the children

694
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,360
all asleep?

695
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,190
Looks like they are.

696
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,070
Shuang.

697
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:08,920
Shuang!

698
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:09,960
What?

699
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,510
Can you...

700
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:12,920
soothe me again?

701
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,510
Why?

702
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,160
Ouyang!

703
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,990
You two...

704
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,740
You're back! Just in time!

705
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,020
Perfect timing.

706
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,470
The kids are all asleep.

707
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,690
They're yours now.

708
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,270
Are you leaving already?

709
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,510
Wait.

710
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,480
Stay a few more days.

711
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,320
You don't come often.

712
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,800
We have

713
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,270
troubled you enough.

714
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,780
Until next time.

715
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,030
But...

716
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,430
Let's go.

717
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,760
The kids will miss you!

718
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,110
What about dinner?

719
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,670
No thanks!

720
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,800
Save it for the kids!

721
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,080
What's the rush?

722
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,590
Did they scare you that much?

723
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,590
Let's go quickly.

724
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,880
Once those little monsters wake up,

725
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,680
all hell will break loose again.

726
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,400
I remember someone

727
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,670
bragging so confidently

728
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,800
that watching kids for a while

729
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,860
will be a cakewalk.

730
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,510
Yes, the kids are cute,

731
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,430
but they're a bit too energetic.

732
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,550
I can't handle it.

733
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,380
More importantly,

734
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,460
I really want us

735
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,800
