00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,960
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,770
You made a round trip to Wuling Mountain,

4
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,710
created rubbings of some paintings

5
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,680
and delivered them
to Prince Annan's Mansion

6
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,710
within just two days?

7
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,020
[Prince Annan's Mansion]

8
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Since you can enter and exit
Prince Annan's Mansion with ease,

9
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,079
why don't you just kill him?

10
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,590
If he dies,

11
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,920
Li Shuang will be heartbroken.

12
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,460
You care about Li Shuang,

13
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,180
so you'll be upset too.

14
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,100
Then why should I hurt him?

15
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Besides,

16
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,630
his death won't necessarily

17
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,440
bring a lasting peace
between the two countries.

18
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,310
Then why did you create those rubbings?

19
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,360
You think he'd show mercy to Shuang

20
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,890
for the sake of
those flimsy sheets of paper?

21
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,280
I had to try that,

22
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
since Li Shuang

23
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,000
refused to leave.

24
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,680
If Jin'an can recall so much as
a tiny fragment of memory,

25
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,590
then Li Shuang's noble intentions

26
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,250
may really make a difference.

27
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,680
But with Jade Linglong
detached from his body

28
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,240
and all his memories gone,

29
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,450
how is it possible to remind Jin'an

30
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,620
of the past with just a few paintings?

31
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,600
Everything one has experienced

32
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,680
must be somewhat etched in one's heart.

33
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,280
Though Jade Linglong
once controlled his body,

34
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,310
it never truly changed his heart.

35
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,280
If this doesn't work,

36
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,630
I'll rescue Li Shuang myself.

37
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm here for all that may happen.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,930
Don't you worry.

39
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,560
You used to stay

40
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,220
out of all worldly affairs.

41
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,750
War,

42
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,590
poverty,

43
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,570
life and death—

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,400
you were never involved.

45
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,890
What exactly turned you

46
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,210
into a man of compassion as you are now?

47
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,610
I'm doing all this for you.

48
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,840
Don't you see?

49
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,960
You volunteered to help Li Shuang out,

50
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,550
but she declined to leave with you.

51
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,120
So, you chose to hole up
in this inn all day, sighing,

52
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
with no idea of flexibility

53
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,870
or changing your approach.

54
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,930
How foolish of you.

55
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I lived in Wuling Mountain for years

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,450
in isolation from the world,

57
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,650
so I didn't know much
about people's suffering.

58
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,650
On that day

59
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,530
when Jin Wujian led an attack
against Wuling Mountain

60
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,330
and caused numerous casualties

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,760
in a real bloodbath,

62
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,730
I suddenly realized

63
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,550
that war and slaughter

64
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,870
could only bring perpetual hatred

65
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,370
and grief.

66
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,440
I just remembered one thing.

67
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,960
Speaking of Jin Wujian,

68
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,070
Shuang specifically asked me to tell you

69
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,600
that when she was confined,

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,390
someone

71
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,030
gave her a bottle of a drug

72
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,350
named

73
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,370
Brain-Devouring Powder.

74
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,630
That day, someone came

75
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,400
and gave me
a bottle of Brain-Devouring Power.

76
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,710
Li Shuang...

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,610
didn't make a move?

78
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,800
Your Highness's spy
personally witnessed that.

79
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,670
I thought she was smart,

80
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,290
but as it turns out,

81
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,880
she's a hopeless fool.

82
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,360
If Prince Annan learns of
the Brain-Devouring Powder,

83
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,950
he'll surely conduct
a thorough investigation.

84
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,630
Your Highness,

85
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,630
what should we do?

86
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,610
Investigation?

87
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,490
Only if he lives long enough
to see that happen.

88
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,090
When Li Wei's troops
arrive at the city gate,

89
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,890
Duan Aodeng
will go confront them by all means.

90
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,680
Arrange archers now.

91
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,570
Whether there will be a fight or a truce,

92
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,600
he must

93
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,430
die on the battlefield.

94
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,780
[Imperial Kitchen]

95
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,740
You said you'd take me somewhere nice.

96
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,950
I thought we'd find clues
about the Brain-Devouring Powder.

97
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,430
But instead,
we just sneaked into the imperial kitchen

98
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,480
for free food and drinks.

99
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,210
You want some? It's delicious.

100
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,190
I've told you all the clues I know.

101
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,030
You already searched every corner

102
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,750
of this vast imperial palace,

103
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,260
but couldn't find anything.

104
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,330
I nearly starved to death.

105
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,860
Jin Wujian is dead already.

106
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,070
Why keep investigating

107
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,370
the Brain-Devouring Powder?

108
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,890
It is truly a rare drug.

109
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,290
Now that it's involved,

110
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,040
there must be something fishy going on.

111
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,480
Although Jin Wujian is dead already,

112
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,040
we still need to find
the mastermind behind all this,

113
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,120
or Wuling Mountain

114
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,850
may get in danger in the future.

115
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,230
Yummy.

116
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,560
Are you crazy?

117
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,970
We're in the imperial palace of Yao State,

118
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,700
not the backyard of your house.

119
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,750
Won't you be spotted

120
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,210
if you get out like this?

121
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,710
So what if I'm spotted?

122
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,310
What can they do to me
with their lousy martial skills?

123
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,570
You're able to escape,

124
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,600
but I'm not.

125
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,620
It'll be perfect if you get caught.

126
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,560
That way, I can be rid of a burden.

127
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,480
Who is it?

128
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,870
Who's in there?

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,680
Who?

130
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,120
Someone is here.

131
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,760
Where is this person hiding?

132
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,210
Let's go.

133
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,720
Help! There are assassins!

134
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,980
Guards!

135
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,250
Catch the assassins!

136
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,850
Catch the assassins!

137
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,490
We're safe now.

138
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,910
Who would've known

139
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,940
there's such a magnificent place

140
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
in the imperial palace of Yao State?

141
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,250
Everything here is made of gold.

142
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,640
These wealthy nobles

143
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,510
should really improve
their imperial kitchen's cooking.

144
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,710
The food is terrible.

145
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,780
Even the popular restaurants
in Lucheng can do better.

146
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,950
Is this also made of gold?

147
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,790
I saw you eat quite a lot.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
Plus,

149
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,720
didn't you

150
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,080
steal much food as well?

151
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,010
You think everyone's like you?

152
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,330
You're basically subsisting on air.

153
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,970
I get hungry easily.

154
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,280
Of course I need to keep snacks at hand.

155
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,530
I nearly starved to death just now.

156
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,870
If I accidentally

157
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,340
faint from hunger,

158
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,560
who will be there to help me?

159
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,700
Careful!

160
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,480
I'm afraid this is a dead end.

161
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,140
There's no way in. It's so dark here.

162
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,750
All's brightened up.

163
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,820
The light's too strong.

164
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,910
Can you dim it?

165
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,970
I'm fine with how it is now.

166
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,100
Why is there a hidden chamber?

167
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,070
That's a human, right?

168
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,330
Can you put it out now?

169
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,150
It seems he's still alive.

170
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,390
We just strayed into this place.

171
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,720
We mean no harm.

172
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,600
How may we address you, sir?

173
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,150
I think he's been tortured here
for a long time.

174
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,790
Focus on our goal.

175
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,430
We shouldn't waste time talking to him.

176
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,210
Let's go.

177
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,990
Are you silly or what?

178
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,360
In this huge imperial palace,

179
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,760
a secret chamber was built
under the ground

180
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,190
just to confine a dying man.

181
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,930
Don't you find it suspicious?

182
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,480
Perhaps he has the clues

183
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,920
we're looking for.

184
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,440
Do you understand human language?

185
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,960
Have you heard of a poison

186
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,820
called Brain-Devouring Powder?

187
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,600
You're locked up here

188
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,750
and badly tortured.

189
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,010
Is all of this

190
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,970
Duan Aodeng's doing?

191
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,630
I'm afraid we won't

192
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,280
get an answer even if we keep asking.

193
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:27,950
Maybe

194
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,310
he's speech-impaired.

195
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,120
It's time we left.

196
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,280
We'd better not cause trouble.

197
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,090
Hold on...

198
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,910
Who was it?

199
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,900
General, I thought you were a true heroine

200
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,300
who'd know how to weigh things out best.

201
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,670
That's why I wanted to save your life.

202
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,600
But now,

203
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,550
I'm deeply disappointed in you.

204
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,400
Your plan was to make me commit a murder.

205
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,060
Even if things had gone as you wished,

206
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,030
you'd still take my life.

207
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,530
Killing Prince Annan or not

208
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,680
wouldn't make a difference, would it?

209
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,220
You think he'd be grateful to you

210
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,150
for showing him mercy?

211
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,890
General, maybe you haven't heard

212
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,000
that your father Li Wei
has led an army to this very place.

213
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,290
As we speak,

214
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,630
he and your beloved man

215
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,640
are locked in mortal combat.

216
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,570
Your Highness,

217
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,130
those are our soldiers who got captured.

218
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,150
Prince Annan,

219
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,970
here we meet again.

220
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,200
Li Wei,

221
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,910
after hiding behind your daughter
for so long,

222
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,620
you finally have the guts to face
the blood feud between us.

223
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,920
Assassinations and sneak attacks
are indeed disgraceful acts.

224
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,520
But for the safety of Taijin,

225
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,680
I'd do everything in my power

226
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,510
and resort to any means necessary.

227
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,120
If I were in the same situation again,

228
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
I'd repeat what I did without mercy.

229
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,980
"Any means necessary"—of all the nerve!

230
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,730
Now that you said so,

231
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,720
I'll avenge my brother

232
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,710
with my own hands.

233
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,410
The Changfeng Army

234
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,800
is strictly disciplined.

235
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,390
They'd never choose an individual
over the greater good.

236
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,650
You think you can use me

237
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,890
to coerce my father into surrender?

238
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,390
Dream on.

239
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,180
I aim for more than his surrender.

240
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,140
Today,

241
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,069
neither Duan Aodeng nor Li Wei

242
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,900
can leave the battlefield alive.

243
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,569
Soft-hearted lady,

244
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,960
I'll have you see the devastating outcome

245
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,550
of your own merciful acts.

246
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,099
Don't worry.

247
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,090
I'll end your life in person afterwards,

248
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,110
so you can reunite with them in hell.

249
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,850
What are you waiting for?

250
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,160
Draw your sword out!

251
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,920
What stunt are you pulling now?

252
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,030
I came here

253
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,880
to seek peace

254
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,750
instead of new conflicts.

255
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,310
Taijin and Yao State

256
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,830
were at war for decades.

257
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,870
There were too many
killings and lost lives.

258
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,680
During this year,

259
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,270
stability has been gained

260
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,470
in the border area and among the people.

261
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,350
This is a precious time of peace.

262
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,270
In this case,

263
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,440
why must we start a war again

264
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,700
and plunge the people into dire straits?

265
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,070
Prince Annan,

266
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,890
if you agree to sheath the sword,

267
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,160
I, Li Wei,

268
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,000
will return
all the captured soldiers of Yao State

269
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,130
to you immediately.

270
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,480
Our two countries

271
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,550
will be on good terms ever after.

272
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,670
Think about it.

273
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,680
If Yao State strengthens its army

274
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,240
and wages war again,

275
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,930
it is the people of Yao State

276
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,710
who will suffer and agonize, right?

277
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,860
You're responsible for my brother's death.

278
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,680
Now, you're threatening me
with Yao soldiers.

279
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
If I give you the satisfaction now,

280
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,480
won't it be too easy for you?

281
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,380
I'm liable for your brother's misfortune.

282
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,570
If my death can bring about

283
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,980
a reconciliation

284
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,440
between the two countries,
and peace and prosperity

285
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,400
to the people,

286
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,620
I will gladly lay down my life.

287
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,430
Father!

288
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,700
Shuang,

289
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,850
don't be afraid!

290
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,400
Why the rush?

291
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,420
This great show

292
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,100
has just begun.

293
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,990
Shoot!

294
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,950
Father!

295
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,970
Prince Annan, what do you mean by this?

296
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,210
You're openly protecting
the general of the enemy army.

297
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,380
Are you planning for

298
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,880
a revolt?

299
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,240
Li Wei came here

300
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,030
to negotiate peace.

301
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,740
For two countries at war,

302
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,940
their envoys are not to be harmed!

303
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,700
Li Wei is unforgivable

304
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,160
for killing the late emperor!

305
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,310
By colluding with Taijin

306
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,710
and committing treason,

307
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,490
Duan Aodeng has dishonored
the late emperor.

308
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,440
Execute him now!

309
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,980
Father!

310
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,830
Father!

311
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,550
Father!

312
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,270
Shoot them to death!

313
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,200
Father!

314
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,960
It's no secret to me

315
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,820
that you're Duan Aodeng's woman.

316
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,020
I don't care if you two are
putting on an act for me today,

317
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,940
or if you've truly broken up.

318
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,480
What I'm sure is that you care about him

319
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,980
and you can't bring yourself to kill him.

320
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,880
You'll have to pay a price

321
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,880
for your affection.

322
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,880
Why did you...

323
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,030
For the people of Taijin and Yao State,

324
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,160
I'm ready to forfeit my life.

325
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,590
Prince Annan,

326
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,870
the blood feud between us

327
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,270
is finally...

328
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,680
ended today.

329
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,830
Open your eyes and watch.

330
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,480
All the deaths down there today

331
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,980
are caused by you.

332
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,030
I only beg you...

333
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,860
to spare Shuang's life,

334
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,720
now that mine is to be taken.

335
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,720
Let her

336
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,440
leave...

337
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,920
here

338
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,820
safely.

339
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,990
Father!

340
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,640
Father!

341
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,550
Shoot!

342
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,440
Keep up!

343
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,690
Let go of me!

344
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,070
I'll have all of you torn into pieces!

345
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,540
Let...

346
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,400
Let go of me!

347
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,490
This woman disregarded military discipline

348
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,220
and killed soldiers of our own.

349
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,000
She'll be kept in the military prison

350
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,720
and punished
according to the military law.

351
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,590
Back off!

352
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,040
I am the Empress Dowager,

353
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,480
the real sovereign of Yao State.

354
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,350
Prince Annan, you're just a nobody.

355
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,350
How dare you order to
punish me—your superior?

356
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,700
You've known me for many years.

357
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,770
I'm sure you're aware of my arrogance.

358
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,610
I'll decisively execute those

359
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,280
who have committed capital offenses,

360
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,430
despite all hindrances.

361
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,920
Li Wei...

362
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,680
Li Wei caused the late emperor's death.

363
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,440
Revenge was justified,
as it linked to the nation's dignity.

364
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,700
Did I do anything wrong

365
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,310
by ordering to shoot him?

366
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,830
And you have the gall
to mention my brother.

367
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,720
If you hadn't plotted a murder

368
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,360
and taken my brother out of the palace,

369
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,420
he wouldn't have been assassinated.

370
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,550
In the interests of
the now emperor and the court,

371
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,010
I meant to spare your life.

372
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,910
Little did I expect you
to be blinded by greed

373
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,390
at the nadir of depravity.

374
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,880
Li Wei came alone

375
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,070
to seek peace.

376
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,310
Behind him stood

377
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,370
the captured soldiers of our army,

378
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,240
who shed blood for our country.

379
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,270
They came back alive from Taijin

380
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,470
only to be killed by their compatriots.

381
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,350
Were you really trying to kill Li Wei,

382
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,480
or to take that opportunity

383
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,230
to eliminate your political opponents?

384
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,750
You can't prove that.

385
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,840
This is pure slander
and blatant defiance against sovereignty.

386
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,890
I personally witnessed what you did.

387
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,170
The Brain-Devouring Powder
you gave to Li Shuang

388
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,440
is also proof.

389
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,570
Prince Annan, what's your relationship

390
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,040
with this female general?

391
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,550
When Li Shuang was in captivity,

392
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,550
you visited her abode multiple times

393
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,230
to dine and play the qin

394
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,270
with her.

395
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,160
You even

396
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,270
stayed there overnight.

397
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,750
You're a traitor colluding with

398
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,440
the female general of the enemy country.

399
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,720
Now, you're even framing me
with a random bottle of poison.

400
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,950
You've sinned against Yao State.

401
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,000
Being powerless and alone,

402
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,840
I knew I couldn't fight you off,

403
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,270
so I ordered to shoot you
on the battlefield.

404
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,680
How was I wrong?

405
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,120
Why are you laughing?

406
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,270
Because

407
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,370
I'm surprised I can live to see

408
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,120
such intense infighting

409
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,590
in the imperial court of Yao State.

410
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,100
Trying to protect him,
aren't you, General?

411
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,440
Months ago,

412
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,900
Yao State and Taijin
had a battle in Lucheng.

413
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,550
Prince Annan barged into
our own military camp alone

414
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,030
to slaughter soldiers

415
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,770
and slay several generals.

416
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,850
That was why the Changfeng Army
stayed unscathed.

417
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,090
General Li,

418
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,560
have you already forgotten it?

419
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,560
That's right.

420
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,070
The man standing right in front of you now

421
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,640
is

422
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,160
exactly the terrifying man in black.

423
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,110
What?

424
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,310
The man in black?

425
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,270
How can that be possible?

426
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,640
Uncanny.

427
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,190
If it really was him...

428
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,700
Despicable rebel,

429
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,580
how dare you impudently and openly

430
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,440
put me on trial?

431
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,800
Impossible!

432
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,680
Prince Annan would never
betray our country!

433
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,440
Yes.

434
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,030
But the then reports from the battlefield

435
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,400
described the man in black

436
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,590
as an intrepid warrior—

437
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,880
I assume in today's world,

438
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,080
only Prince Annan can be a match for him.

439
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,760
When the late emperor passed away,

440
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,880
we all thought you suddenly died

441
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,140
from excessive grief.

442
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,720
But as it turns out,

443
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,850
you just faked your own death and fled.

444
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,660
Today,
in the presence of all the officials,

445
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,160
do you dare to say

446
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,480
where you went

447
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,920
and what you did

448
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,160
in the year you vanished?

449
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,460
The man in black...

450
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,610
was me.

451
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,530
But I lost control of my body
at that time

452
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,410
and completely forgot
my identity as Prince Annan.

453
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,910
Now that Prince Annan
has confessed candidly,

454
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,270
today,

455
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,790
in the name of the Empress Dowager,

456
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,310
I'll uphold justice for all.

457
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,440
Guards,

458
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,680
take Prince Annan down.

459
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,270
Put him in the Imperial Prison

460
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,870
for an impending execution.

461
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,030
Li Shuang, the female general of Taijin,

462
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,290
shall be executed too.

463
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,510
Everyone has to

464
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,360
pay the price for what they've done.

465
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,040
I'll take full responsibility

466
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,720
for everything I've done.

467
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,600
But before I'm punished,

468
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,640
I must rid the nation of this vile woman
who harmed the late emperor

469
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,720
and killed our countrymen.

470
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,160
Even an upcoming death

471
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,660
can't stop you
from spewing false allegations.

472
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,350
Is there any proof of

473
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,450
your accusations?

474
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,350
What are you dawdling for?

475
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,350
Take him down!

476
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,790
I am living proof.

477
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,740
Ze?

478
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,060
Greetings

479
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
to Your Majesty.

480
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,880
Greetings to Your Majesty!

481
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,350
Long live Your Majesty!

482
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,160
Is this a rebellion?

483
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,920
Who are you kneeling to?

484
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,920
Only my son Yu
is the Emperor of Yao State!

485
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Get up, all of you!

486
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,060
Get up!

487
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,400
Get up!

488
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,240
Honey,

489
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,320
you waited a long time

490
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,280
for this day, didn't you?

491
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,200
That day,

492
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,630
you lied about Aodeng being in danger
and lured me out of the palace.

493
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,570
You attempted to gain control of me
through dark magic.

494
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,780
When Aodeng risked his life to save mine,

495
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,930
he fell victim to your evil magic.

496
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,550
In the past year,

497
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,460
you kept conspiring with villains
to jeopardize him.

498
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,590
Today, you venomously
aimed to kill him again.

499
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,790
You already took the reign of Yao State.

500
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,590
Why did you have to persecute him?

501
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,830
Because I hated him.

502
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,110
Though we had got married,

503
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,230
he still only saw my sister as your wife.

504
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:09,690
What about me?

505
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,800
Then, I killed my sister,

506
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,480
cast the Love-Binding Curse on you

507
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,080
and finally gave birth to Yu.

508
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,969
I thought
though I might not have your heart,

509
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:22,190
at least my son Yu
would be the ruler of Yao State.

510
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,409
But one day,
as I passed by the imperial study,

511
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,000
I overheard you

512
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,850
talking about
giving the throne to Duan Aodeng.

513
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,639
Why?

514
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,030
Yu is your own son.

515
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,110
Why can't you accept him?

516
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,760
The one Ze can't accept

517
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,810
is you.

518
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,199
He who stands in my way

519
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,320
must die.

520
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,670
Your father's body

521
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,850
has been sent back to the city.

522
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,840
You can go bid him farewell now.

523
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,590
I didn't kill him,

524
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,880
yet he died because of me.

525
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,510
Your father

526
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,320
saved my life.

527
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,240
In the future,

528
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,550
if you want blood for blood,

529
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,810
I won't try to get away.

530
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,890
He exchanged his own life

531
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,140
for a reconciliation
between our two countries.

532
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,360
Unjustifiable bloodshed and sacrifices

533
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,110
are what he would hate to see.

534
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,380
Father,

535
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,670
in all these years,

536
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,570
I always referred to you
as "Grand General,"

537
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,530
and rarely called you "Father."

538
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,710
But in my heart,

539
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,520
I truly envied Ting

540
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,610
having a close father-child bond

541
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,880
with you without worries.

542
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,880
Although I bear the family name of Li,

543
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,320
I'm not really related to you by blood.

544
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,780
I feared that I wasn't qualified.

545
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,480
I lacked courage.

546
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,590
During these years,

547
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,590
I thought

548
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,480
I could repay you for raising me

549
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,440
by fighting enemies

550
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,230
bravely on the battlefield.

551
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,880
You treated me

552
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,630
as your own daughter the entire time,

553
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,070
but I was so opinionated

554
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,000
that I chose to keep
a meaningless distance from you

555
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,280
and let all the beautiful moments

556
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,420
slip away.

557
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,920
I never regretted

558
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,590
being a female general

559
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,970
and fighting on the battlefield.

560
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,070
