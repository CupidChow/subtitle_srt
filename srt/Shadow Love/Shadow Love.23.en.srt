No matter how powerful you are,

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,970
you can't defend
against the malice in the dark.

5
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,160
You've been crying for so long.

6
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,210
You'll wake up

7
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,650
to the swollen eyes tomorrow.

00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,240
This medicine

9
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,960
can fix the swelling.

10
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
It works wonders.

because he wanted you to live well,

14
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,680
not to beat yourself up about him

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,010
have you really made up your mind?

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,840
Right now,

24
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,150
numerous people are
keeping eyes on the General's Residence.

25
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,150
We're definitely

26
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,400
surrounded by Prince Li's spies.

27
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,910
To keep the Crown Prince safe

28
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,170
and deceive everyone,

29
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,300

We can't return to Yunjing anymore.

31
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,870
I'll find a safe place

32
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,950

Even fierce tigers don't eat their cubs,

yet as a ruler of a nation,

36
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,750
he's resorted to such despicable means.

37
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,310
How ridiculous.

38
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,430
That's why

39
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,360
we must protect the Crown Prince

to bring the Crown Prince back to me.

What's the point of panicking?

We have prepared fine horses.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,510
Please mount it now, Crown Prince.

105
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,720
Prince Li is inviting the Crown Prince.

106
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,510
What does that have to do
with a commoner like me

107
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,910
who's just out for a hike?

108
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,510
What?

109
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,870
Tell me.

110
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,300
What do you mean he disappeared?

111
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,360
Please calm down, Your Highness.

112
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,630
We carried out your command
to intercept the Crown Prince's carriage,

113

sat only Jin'an
from the General's Residence.

115
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,680
I dared not act rashly,

116
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,030
so I had to let Jin'an go

117
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,430
and hurry back to report.

118
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,770
How dare you return without capturing him?

119
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,040
Without Baoxing around,

120
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,159
none of you seems capable
of doing anything right!

121
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,560
Spare me, Your Highness.

122
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,390
Keep searching.

123
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,430
Bring him to me,

dead or alive.

125
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,159
Understood.

126
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,310
Jin'an deliberately exposed himself

127
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,800
to lure them into pursuing him.

128
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,460
Prince Li's men took the bait.

129

The Crown Prince
has secretly left the city.

130
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,720
Once beyond Lucheng's jurisdiction,

131

the Grand General's friends

132
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,680
and students along the way
will have his back.

133
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,720
They should be able

134
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,580
to ensure His Highness's safety.

135
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,200
Jin'an's trick of secret swapping

136
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,300
has indeed worked.

160
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,790
Your Highness,

161
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,360
where are you heading?

162
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,480
Didn't expect

163
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,080
Prince Li to have
such an extraordinary sidekick.

164
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,750
Prince Li has never

165
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,550
liked such roundabout tactics.

166
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,800
As remote as that road is,

167
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,940
he could have simply killed me directly

168
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,870
without going to all this trouble.

169
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,390
Your Highness, you're so sharp-witted.

170
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,230
I was right about you.

171
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,240
Who are you?

172
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,920
How dare you imprison the Crown Prince?

173
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,470
How rude of you.

174
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,940
When did I ever imprison His Highness?

175
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,080
The door is right over there.

176
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,370
If you want to leave,

177
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,380
you're free to go anytime.

178
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,280
You went to great lengths
to bring me here.

179
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,370
While you haven't treated me
with proper courtesy,

180
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,900
you haven't hurt me either.

181
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,580
What on earth are you up to?

182
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,480
Your Highness, you're perceptive.

183
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,150
Prince Li is
desperately trying to kill you.

184
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,780
General Li

185
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,050
is also in a hurry to cut ties with you

186
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,400
to save her own skin.

187
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,580
But Your Highness,
if you were to leave this place,

188
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,890
wouldn't that be

189
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,650
walking straight into danger?

190
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,220
Staying between two opposing armies,

191
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,970
and being so familiar
with news from the city,

192
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,000
are you

193
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,590
from Yao State?

194
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,160
It's a pity, though.

195
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
I bear the mere title of Crown Prince

196
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,490
with no real power.

197
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,910
If you plan to use me

198
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,700
to force Taijin to submit,

199
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:41,940
I'm afraid

200
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,660
you're wasting your time.

201
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,030
Your Highness,

202
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,190
just look.

203
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,270
I'm merely

204
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,200
a wandering brute from the jianghu

205
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,320
with no place in my heart
for state affairs.

206
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,710
I just feel

207
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,870
that you, as the Crown Prince,

208
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,870
are bullied all the time

209
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,000
and live in constant fear
like a stray dog.

210
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,380
I simply can't stand to watch it anymore.

211
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,960
I brought you over

212
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,270
to offer you a way out

213
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,980
to start anew.

214
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,270
Tempting smooth talk

215
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,720
always has a reason behind it.

216
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,120
Rather than waste time
beating around the bush,

217
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,510
why don't you just cut to the chase?

218
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,270
Fair enough.

219
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,740
The General's Residence

220
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,700
has something I'm after.

221
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,910
I heard about the Crown Prince's matter.

222
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,750
Any updates?

223
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,840
We've searched everywhere along the way.

224
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,960
Not only the Crown Prince,

225
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,240
but the whole convoy's gone,

226
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,100
as if they vanished into thin air.

227
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,680
Could they have gotten lost?

228
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,440
The escorting soldiers

229
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,870
were all carefully selected,

230
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,080
knowing Lucheng's terrain
like the back of their hands.

231
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,390
I've sent reinforcements

232
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,840
to expand the search area.

233
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,790
We must find him.

234
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,960
Are you going

235
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,790
to look for him in person?

236
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
This happened because of me.

237
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,150
I can't sit by and do nothing.

238
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,480
Ji Ran and the others are searching
along the way.

239
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,270
Then we

240
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,430
can check those rugged areas.

241
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,150
We might

242
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,580
discover something unexpected.

243
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,800
The footprints seem

244
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,900
to be heading that way.

245
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,080
Let's go.

246
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,790
The footprints

247
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,200
end right here.

248
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,870
I've been wondering.

249
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,190
Since those people
using the silver needles

250
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,590
have kept targeting you,

251
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,030
why would they
drag the Crown Prince into it this time?

252
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,030
Perhaps after losing to me repeatedly,

253
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,360
they couldn't accept it

254
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,510
and wanted to leverage the Crown Prince

255
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,770
to force me to come out.

256
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,070
I'm thinking

257
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,960
that His Highness

258
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,250
shouldn't have to suffer so much.

259
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,480
Although my father

260
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,560
has always treated me like his own,

261
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,240
I've known well
that living under someone else's roof,

262
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,390
I must be careful

263
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,550
with my words and behaviors.

264
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,440
I know you don't want excessive intakes
of sweets to affect your sword practice,

265
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,960
so I told the palace maids

266
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
to use less sugar.

267
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,320
Others thought I was always standing up
for the Crown Prince,

268
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,790
but few knew

269
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
that His Highness

270
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,030
was my only friend back then.

271
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,030
Now,

272
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,040
he's in danger

273
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,550
due to my oversight.

274
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,400
Regret won't help.

275
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,920
We should find the Crown Prince
as soon as possible.

276
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,550
And then

277
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,040
I'll figure out what to do next.

278
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,579
Let's treat your wound first.

279
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,710
If it gets infected,

280
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,589
we'll lose both the Crown Prince

281
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,430
and you.

282
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,170
So what's your plan?

283
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,030
You knew that the man in black

284
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,430
was one of their targets.

285
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,880
To keep me safe,

286
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,350
you planned

287
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,030
to take it all on yourself.

288
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,480
You had to send the Crown Prince away,

289
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,540
so you felt guilty.

290
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,450
Yet Prince Li was relentless,

291
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,060
leaving you nowhere to hide.

292
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,770
So you planned to go all out.

293
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,560
I know everything in your mind,

294
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,240
and I'll help you make it all.

295
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,970
You've been on edge lately,

296
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,500
not even getting any proper rest.

297
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,400
Shuang,

298
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,070
you still have me by your side.

299
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,680
You're willing to risk your life for me,

300
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,770
and I would do the same for you.

301
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,470
I don't want to see anyone die.

302
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
I just want to end this mess

303
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,030
and spend

304
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,800
the rest of my life with you.

305
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,160
In those biography scrolls I've read,

306
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,870
all the young ladies
would cry their eyes out

307
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,270
at the slightest injury.

308
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,780
But look at you.

309
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,590
With all these wounds,

310
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,070
you haven't even flinched,

311
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,030
let alone shed a tear.

312
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,730
Ever since I entered Lucheng,

313
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,510
I'm no longer some pampered lady.

314
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,380
I'm the General of the Changfeng Army.

315
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,840
I have neither the time

316
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,240
nor the luxury to be weak.

317
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,280
But I'm different from the others.

318
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,240
You are everyone's general,

319
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,400
yet you're my one and only beloved Shuang.

320
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,090
It's alright.

321
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,200
Neither I

322
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,210
nor these lush woods and bright moon

323
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,270
would know it.

324
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,240
Master.

325
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,750
Li Shuang's broken
into the secret forest with her man.

326
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,210
They're heading this way.

327
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,310
I knew she would come,

328
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,220
but I didn't expect it to be this soon.

329
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,440
Seems like you don't have much time left

330
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,640
to consider, Your Highness.

331
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,550
You and Prince Li are

332
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,000
meant for a fight to the death.

333
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,350
Instead of

334
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,920
fleeing and hiding,

335
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,730
why not go all out
and fight to the bitter end?

336
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,920
Your Highness,

337
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,590
I can ensure your survival

338
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,510
or even help you rise to power
in one fell swoop,

339
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,350
free from future worries.

340
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,310
As Crown Prince,

341
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,110
you have no power, no influence.

342
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,170
And even the loyalty
and friendship that could've

343
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,890
saved your life are gone now.

344
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,850
If you don't join hands with me,

345
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,520
what other path

346
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,630
do you have other than death?

347
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,570
What are you after

348
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,240
in the General's Residence?

349
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,310
The man in black,

350
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,730
Jin'an.

351
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,400
I can sense

352
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,530
the stronger aura of the Crown Prince.

353
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,490
Help.

354
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,160
Help...

355
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,720
Help me.

356
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,410
Your Highness.

357
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,820
Your Highness!

358
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,000
Are you hurt, Your Highness?

359
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,090
Let's first find a way

360
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,090
to take them back.

361
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,120
Your Highness!

362
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,330
Anxiety and fear

363
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,260
have made it hard for you to focus.

364
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,000
Though there are no serious problems,

365
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,200
you still need some good rest.

366
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,060
Your Highness.

367
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,310
Your Highness.

368
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,600
Run, Your Highness.

369
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,680
Your Highness, run.

370
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,440
Your Highness.

371
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,310
Mr. Mo Yin.

372
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,240
Your Highness.

373
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,790
Huai'en was injured because of me.

374
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,640
Could you

375
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,300
check on him for me?

376
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,420
Of course, Your Highness.

377
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,550
I treat

378
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,920
all patients equally,

379
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,290
with no distinction

380
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,460
between princes and commoners.

381
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,270
[That weird.]

382
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,680
[Why do]

383
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,010
[these wounds show traces
of Wuling Mountain techniques?]

384
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,950
Is there something wrong?

385
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,960
Don't worry, Your Highness.

386
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,440
Despite some internal injuries,

387
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,640
no vital parts were hurt, fortunately.

388
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,670
He only needs some medicine
to promote circulation

389
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,870
and reduce bruising.

390
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,290
Your Highness.

391
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,760
Are you alright, Your Highness?

392
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,360
His Highness is fine.

393
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,370
Your Highness.

394
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,560
Do you know

395
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,880
who abducted you?

396
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,800
Who else could it be?

397
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,510
As long as I'm alive,

398
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,440
my dear brother

399
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,160
won't easily let me go.

400
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,600
Had Huai'en not saved me,

401
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,000
I would probably

402
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,430
be dead now.

403
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,960
This one's on me.

404
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,050
Sorry for my oversight

405
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,770
and lack of consideration.

406
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,810
-I promise that next time...
-Promise what?

407
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,940
Promise that next time

408
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,760
you'll successfully
throw me even farther away?

409
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,440
General,

410
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,160
His Highness just got out of danger
and needs some peace and rest.

411
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
Please talk to him

412
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,960
after His Highness feels better.

413
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:26,960
Then we will

414
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,200
take our leave.

415
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,200
Mr. Mo Yin, please hold on a minute.

416
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,810
Due to treacherous mountain paths,

417
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,070
I accidentally got some minor injuries.

418
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,300
Would you mind helping me dress them?

419
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,290
General, you truly are a remarkable woman.

420
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,200
You don't seem concerned
about the social distance

421
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,640
between men and women.

422
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,290
How clumsy the man was

423
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,930
to bandage the wound

424
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,310
this badly!

425
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,000
Thank you for your help, sir.

426
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,200
Sir, you've put aside our past grudges

427
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,260
and offered us so much generous help.

428
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,050
I really appreciate it.

429
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,640
General, Miss Lu told me

430
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,730
that you never

431
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,220
take good care of yourself

432
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,200
and even pay

433
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,350
no attention

434
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,510
to minor wounds.

435
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,960
You specifically asked me
to dress your wounds today.

436
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,920
I guess

437
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,270
you have something to ask me, right?

438
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,110
His Highness was thrown
into a great fright this time.

439
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,440
Is he really alright?

440
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,810
Not only is he fine,

441
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,960
he's even in much better shape
than you are, General.

442
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,240
Then

443
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,880
what about Huai'en?

444
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,340
This man is extremely loyal.

445
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,770
I think he must have been

446
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,130
fretting over
the Crown Prince's situation recently,

447
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,990
causing him digestive problems.

448
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,400
Just now,

449
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,790
when I checked his pulse,

450
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,590
guess what I found?

451
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,270
What?

452
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,730
His constipation

453
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,930
has lasted for at least five days.

454
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,880
In this case,

455
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,240
it seems

456
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,160
that I was overthinking it.

457
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,960
It's never wrong to overthink
a matter of life and death.

458
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,770
In my opinion,

459
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,590
it's uneasy to cure him.

460
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,510
If this keeps up,

461
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,100
I'm afraid
it could lead to serious complications.

462
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,160
Where

463
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,550
did you get this?

464
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,930
Weren't you so into the show
you put on just now?

465
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,680
Why quit acting now?

466
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,240
Ever since you showed up in Lu City,

467
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,070
I've suspected your identity.

468
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,730
Despite our meticulous plan,

469
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,500
the Crown Prince was still abducted.

470
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,510
So it was because of you,

471
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,280
a spy hiding in my place.

472
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,080
General, you must be joking.

473
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,520
Not even the deepest dungeon
could hold me.

474
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,710
For the Crown Prince, a mere weakling,

475
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,270
why would I bother
working as a spy for others?

476
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,030
Since you recognize this needle,

477
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,720
you must know its owner

478
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,000
and must be involved in it somehow.

479
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,510
If you don't come clean,

480
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,940
I'll have no choice
but to throw you into prison

481
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,740
for relentless interrogation.

482
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,500
Why don't you let people finish speaking

483
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,060
before resorting to force?

484
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,680
I don't know why this person

485
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,280
kidnapped the Crown Prince.

486
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,310
I came to your place

487
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,570
for the man in black.

488
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,550
Or should I say,

489
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,270
Jin'an?

490
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,270
How much do you know about him?

491
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,960
General, you can rest assured.

492
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,790
I've been at your residence
for so many days.

493
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,310
If I truly wanted to harm anyone,

494
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,590
I'd have done it long ago.

495
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,240
Why would I wait until today?

496
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,720
During your long stay at my residence,

497
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,650
you've been keeping a low profile.

498
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,530
I guess it's because

499
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,300
you're no match
for the man in black, right?

500
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,270
As unpredictable
as your martial arts skills are,

501
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,550
I can do nothing to you.

502
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,680
Guess I'll

503
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,710
have to call Jin'an for help.

504
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,510
I once thought
you were an upright and reliable general.

505
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,110
Didn't expect you

506
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,830
to be as cunning as Jin'an.

507
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,490
The Jade Linglong inside Jin'an's body is

508
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,750
a sacred relic of my Wuling Mountain.

509
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,180
Do you mean

510
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,240
that only by removing the Jade Linglong

511
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,400
can we save Jin'an?

512
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,400
This way, we can save

513
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,350
not only him, but also you

514
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,110
and all the other living beings.

515
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,570
Will it endanger his life?

516
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,520
No, it won't.

517
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,330
But whether it's removed or not,

518
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,130
all his memories of you, General,

519
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,100
will be totally wiped out.

520
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,170
Jin'an and I originally agreed

521
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,240
that when everything was settled,

522
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,550
he'd go to Wuling Mountain with me.

523
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,070
But given the complicated situation now,

524
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,920
he doesn't have much time left.

525
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,070
I have to...

526
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,920
I have to spill

527
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,400
everything to you

528
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,160
like a big-mouthed guy.

529
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,240
If he refuses

530
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,270
to go with me one day in the future,

531
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,760
I might

532
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,980
need to ask for your help, General.

533
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,510
Has Jin'an

534
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,930
known about this all along?

535
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,440
He didn't want you to worry,

536
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,240
so he kept it from you on purpose.

537
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,550
I'm not in cahoots

538
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,170
with this silver needle's owner.

539
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,110
Many years ago,

540
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,730
my godfather was murdered,

541
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,710
and the Jade Linglong was stolen.

542
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,530
The same silver needle

543
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,810
was left at the scene.

544
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,990
I have a blood feud with its owner.

545
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,880
General, please

546
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,570
tell me the truth about it.

547
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,140
Since I brought Jin'an
back to my residence,

548
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,730
this person has launched
several attacks on us.

549
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,260
He acts in a mysterious way,

550
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,300
coming and going without a trace.

551
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,240
I know very little about him.

552
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,030
The only clue is

553
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,350
that he can use silver needles

554
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,050
to manipulate innocent people at will.

555
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,600
Could it be the acupoint-sealing needle?

556
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,620
Some time ago,

557
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,370
I had Jin'an draw his portrait

558
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,490
and searched everywhere,

559
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,310
but still found no trace of him.

560
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,310
So you do recognize him, sir.

561
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,030
Who is he?

562
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,540
I can not jump to conclusions,

563
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,910
but I will certainly
get to the bottom of it.

564
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,080
This person kidnapped the Crown Prince,

565
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,000
yet was willing to let him return
safe and sound.

566
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,660
He must be up to something big.

567
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,310
I urge you, General,

568
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,490
not to let your guard down.

569
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,810
The shadow puppet is way too powerful.

570
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,010
I've set several traps.

571
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,900
Still, he not only escaped easily

572
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,630
but also injured me.

573
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:24,710
The shadow puppet and the Jade Linglong
haven't perfectly merged yet.

574
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,510
If he loses his mind,

575
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,150
the consequences
of the chaotic power can be devastating.

576
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,880
If we don't act decisively now,

577
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,920
it'll be a big threat
looming large in the future.

578
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,659
You're already so exhausted,

579
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,389
yet you still try to stay awake?

580
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,270
Let me finish what I'm working on first.

581
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,440
I'm sorry

582
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,740
for keeping you up so late with me.

583
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,650
I couldn't fall asleep anyway.

584
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,910
You've been working
until the middle of the night.

585
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,670
What

586
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,130
is this exactly?

587
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,610
This is the child doll I made for Nanxing.

588
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,360
And this is his wife.

589
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,080
I've thought it over.

590
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,150
I plan to visit him

591
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,960
first thing tomorrow morning.

592
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,710
You're right.

593
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,210
There's something

594
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,440
we must get over.

595
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,070
Those who remain

596
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,960
need to move on.

597
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,400
Nanxing saved your life.

598
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,110
The doll you made is so ugly.

599
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,590
Isn't that

600
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,800
repaying kindness with ingratitude?

601
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,230
I've tried my best.

602
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,580
Nanxing's biggest wish in life

603
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,490
was to have a family of his own.

604
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,150
Now that he's gone,

605
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,630
no matter what,

606
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,440
I must do everything I can

607
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,480
to fulfill that wish for him.

608
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,010
With such good intentions,

609
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,200
you're certainly honoring
all that Nanxing did for you.

610
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,260
To honor his kindness,

611
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,280
I should find the one who killed him

612
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,170
and finish the murderer

613
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,510
to avenge him.

614
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,360
An eye for an eye,
and this cycle of revenge will never end.

615
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,190
Do you have to trap yourself
in this worldly karma?

616
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,000
You're saying so

617
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,600
because you've never experienced

618
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,670
the pain of losing someone close to you.

619
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,360
Now that he's gone,

620
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,920
these things

621
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,590
are just meant to ease

622
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,960
the regrets and guilt

623
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,320
of the living.

624
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,320
They're all fake.

625
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,980
Make the murderer pay with his life.

626
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,550
That's the only real thing
I can do for him.

627
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,610
What if

628
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,470
the killer is someone
on good terms with you

629
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
or even one of your family members?

630
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,540
Would you still have to kill them?

631
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,500
If they were truly my family,

632
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,230
how could they hurt someone
important to me?

633
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,300
Nanxing,

634
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,230
I've brought you your wife and child.

635
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,400
You can rest in peace now.

636
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,380
Thank you

637
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,690
for making such a beautiful family
for Nanxing.

638
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,800
I might be

639
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,320
leaving soon.

640
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,090
This is Clear Moon Pearl.

641
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,230
Take it.

642
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,400
Why give me something so valuable?

643
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,030
You want to rebuild the clinic,

644
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,740
and I can't think of any other way

645
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,690
to help you.

646
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,000
Ordinary people love fortune.

647
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,180
Money is always

648
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,490
the way to go.

649
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,070
Jin'an,

650
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,760
I need to leave the General's Residence
for something urgent.

651
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,490
Do you remember our agreement?

652
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,480
There's something

653
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,610
I want to figure out.

654
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,590
What do you think makes shadow puppets

655
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,550
lose control?

656
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,570
I'm not sure.

657
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,360
I only heard about it

658
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,000
from my godfather when I was young.

659
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,110
Many years ago,

660
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,030
there was a shadow puppet
in the mountains.

661
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,670
It seemed like a normal man,

662
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,960
who even got married
and had children in the village below,

663
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,550
living an ordinary life.

664
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,590
But later, for some reason,

665
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,630
it suddenly lost control

666
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,750
and slaughtered everyone

667
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,980
in the entire village within one night.

668
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,060
Therefore,

669
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,050
to ensure peace for all people,

670
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,640
I must take you back with me.

671
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,690
I'll go with you.

672
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,930
The moment you told me

673
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,610
that the Jade Linglong
would drain Shuang's life,

674
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,320
I just made this decision.

675
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,500
But right now, Lucheng is in turmoil.

676
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,760
Shuang is caught in the middle of it

677
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,020
and having a hard time.

678
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,400
I need to help her
get through this crisis first.

679
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,360
But the Jade Linglong is unpredictable.

680
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,150
What if you

681
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,280
completely lose control before then?

682
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,510
If I lose control,

683
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:31,510
can you protect the people
at the General's Residence for me?

684
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,580
I have no connection with them.

685
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,660
I only want to get what I'm after.

686
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,190
If I totally lose it,

687
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,840
please

688
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,130
guarantee their safety

689
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,100
even if it means killing me.

690
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,710
I promise you

691
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,860
that once everything is settled,

692
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,790
I'll go with you.

693
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,410
Alright,

694
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,790
I promise you

695
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,230
that I'll do my best.

696
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,080
If necessary,

697
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,160
I'll take extreme measures.

698
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,190
Thank you.

699
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
Do shadow puppets

700
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,240
also have compassion

701
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,850
and concerns about others' lives?

702
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,320
Your Highness,

703
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,190
latest reports say

704
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,320
that Li Shuang's brought the Crown Prince

705
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,180
back to the General's Residence.

706
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,520
When did this happen?

707
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,000
Around dawn.

708
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,110
After they returned,

709
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,800
the General's Residence
shut the doors to all visitors.

710
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,570
Not even a fly had come out

711
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,090
until sunset.

712
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,400
Li Shuang

713
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,280
sent the Crown Prince away
and then brought him back again.

714
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,710
What trick is she playing?

715
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,000
What's the use of wild speculation?

716
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,010
Who's there?

717
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,370
Your Highness, don't be afraid.

718
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,110
I mean you no harm.

719
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,510
I've come

720
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,680
to offer you

721
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,790
a great gift.

722
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,880
Everyone, leave us alone.

723
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,760
-Yes.
-Yes.

724
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,010
Your Highness,
if you want to kill the Crown Prince,

725
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,670
you just need to strike directly.

726
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,520
Although Li Shuang commands
powerful forces,

727
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,920
the Changfeng Army isn't

728
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,730
the Li family's private army after all.

729
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,510
She wouldn't dare use them arbitrarily.

730
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,440
The General's Residence
has only a few dozen people.

731
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,520
As long as you bring enough troops,

732
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,000
there's no way you'll lose.

733
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,570
Since you know this matter so well,

734
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,030
how could you not know

735
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,280
that Li Shuang's got

736
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,630
a man in black who has

737
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,150
overwhelming power
to even fight thousands of soldiers?

738
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,950
Please don't worry about that man,
Your Highness.

739
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,490
On the day of the heavenly calamity,

740
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:21,220
he will certainly not appear before you.
