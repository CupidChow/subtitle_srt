00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:40,930
[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,970
[Episode 3]

3
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,710
Are you feeling better?

4
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,760
It's so late

5
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,820
and you're still not sleeping.

6
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,080
Are you thinking about Li Ting?

7
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,730
I heard about what happened
at the stronghold today.

8
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,030
I understand
you weren't trying to kill him

9
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,800
but instead
were confident you could save him.

10
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,740
You're sick yourself,

11
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,590
yet you're still worrying about
someone else?

12
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,990
You're not someone else.

13
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,750
You saved me

14
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,800
and gave me shelter.

15
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,240
Do you know

16
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,030
why I brought you back with me?

17
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,120
When I was young,

18
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,530
I was just like you,

19
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,960
homeless and displaced.

20
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,560
If the Grand General hadn't taken me in

21
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,329
and given me a place to stay,

22
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,430
I would have starved to death long ago.

23
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,000
So the sibling relationship

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,680
between Li Ting and I

25
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,080
is in name only.

26
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,960
If that's the case,

27
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,490
it's even more important that you
explain everything clearly to him.

28
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,330
The Grand General always taught me

29
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,150
not to over-explain

30
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,630
the things I've said

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,800
or done.

32
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,480
People sometimes

33
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,920
only care about results.

34
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,020
Whether the process was good or bad,

35
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,090
right or wrong...

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,079
depends entirely on
their quick judgment.

37
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,840
As long as we rescued Ting,

38
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,000
nothing else

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
matters.

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,870
Since you care about him so much,

41
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,630
yet he misunderstands you like this,

42
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,960
don't you feel wronged?

43
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,910
That's the biggest difference
between us two.

44
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,710
We were both taken in as orphans,

45
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,120
but you

46
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,190
are bold

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,079
and dare to take what isn't yours,

48
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,630
while I must be cautious

49
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,690
and can't afford to feel sorry for myself.

50
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,680
Alright,

51
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,560
since you're not feeling well,
get some rest.

52
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Come on, scoot in.

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,210
Scoot in.

54
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,000
Are you

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,430
going to sleep in the bed too?

56
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,560
Of course.

57
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,280
Do you expect me,

58
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,310
a general, to sleep on the floor for you?

59
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:09,990
Hurry up.

60
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,170
Get in, quickly.

61
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,430
Lie down properly

62
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,310
and tuck in.

63
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,579
Be good and go to sleep.

64
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,260
Got it?

65
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,540
What's with this weather?

66
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,800
I'm freezing to death.

67
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,380
I'd rather die
than do night watch again.

68
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,600
Tomorrow, we'll really need to
grease some palms

69
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,530
and properly pay our respects
to Deputy General Luo.

70
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,210
What's wrong? Move along.

71
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,690
Who are you?

72
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,480
What do you mean?

73
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,040
I'm Jin'an.

74
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,310
I...

75
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,980
I really am Jin'an.

76
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,100
If you don't believe me,
look at my clothes.

77
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,010
Don't move.

78
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,660
If you dare act improperly again,

79
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,050
I'll kill you with one strike of my sword.

80
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,270
But I really am Jin'an.

81
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,310
Think about it.

82
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,830
This is the general's quarters.

83
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,190
It's heavily guarded outside,

84
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,520
and you're so cautious.

85
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,630
If someone really broke in at night,

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,800
how could you possibly not know?

87
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,680
If you still don't believe me,

88
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,950
look at my pants.

89
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,430
Cover up.

90
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,240
Anyway, I am Jin'an.

91
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,520
If you don't believe me,

92
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,210
just kill me then.

93
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:43,800
Speak.

94
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,560
Why did you become like this?

95
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,310
Speak!

96
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,920
I...

97
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,870
I don't know either.

98
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,390
It's strange indeed.

99
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,159
Although I don't know why,

100
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,520
you have to believe me.

101
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,680
General.

102
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,040
I have something to report.

103
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,370
Someone's calling you.

104
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,130
Don't make a sound.

105
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,720
If anyone finds out

106
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
there's a half-naked man in my room,

107
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,390
I'll cut you into a thousand pieces.

108
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:24,980
Hide well.

109
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,020
Hurry.

110
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,310
Who are you people?

111
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,010
Hide!

112
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,760
I'm glad you're alright.

113
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,910
Jade Linglong,

114
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,290
I've finally found you.

115
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,600
Why do I have no strength?

116
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,630
Gen...

117
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,550
General!

118
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,600
General!

119
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,030
General!

120
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,000
Save me, General!

121
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,880
General!

122
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,360
General!

123
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,240
Strike between his eyebrows.

124
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,300
He's not dead.

125
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,160
His pressure points were sealed.

126
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,270
Someone actually controlled the soldiers

127
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,570
and infiltrated our ranks.

128
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,780
It's such a bizarre method.

129
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,900
Could they be deliberately creating chaos

130
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,260
to rescue Huo Du?

131
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,790
Tonight's assassination attempt

132
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,790
wasn't just

133
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,590
targeting you, General, was it?

134
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,200
Could they be after
the person in your tent?

135
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,030
General,

136
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,110
that person wasn't properly clothed

137
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,310
and his behavior was truly suspicious.

138
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,840
Why are you coughing?

139
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,040
Isn't he suspicious?

140
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,390
It's the General's lover.

141
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,480
Shut up.

142
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,390
Luo Teng.

143
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,240
Take those two soldiers

144
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,320
to Lu Xin's clinic.

145
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,840
All strategic locations in the camp

146
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,240
must be heavily guarded.

147
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,080
Don't give the enemy an opportunity.

148
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,630
Also,

149
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,630
keep Huo Du under close watch.

150
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,080
Yes.

151
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,750
Yes.

152
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,270
A child with extraordinary fighting skills

153
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,240
turned into an adult overnight

154
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,480
and somehow lost all his strength?

155
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,100
Since this is the case,

156
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,160
then I pose no threat to you.

157
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,330
Whether as a child or an adult,

158
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,890
have I ever harmed you?

159
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,600
How did you know we had to

160
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,330
strike them between the brows?

161
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,090
I saw a needle at the back of their heads

162
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,850
and thought it was strange,

163
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,790
so

164
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,410
I figured that must be the key.

165
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,670
Those two

166
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,940
were clearly coming after you.

167
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,690
Who are you really?

168
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,120
So you noticed too?

169
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,200
They wanted to capture me

170
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,480
but didn't dare to hurt me.

171
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,670
It's quite strange.

172
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,530
I want to know who I am
even more than you do.

173
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,180
Do you remember that day

174
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,730
when I escaped from the camp

175
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,320
and then came back?

176
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,000
I was exhausted then

177
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,440
and some images flashed through my mind.

178
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,300
I think there was a stone chamber.

179
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,870
That place must be

180
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,750
near where I found you.

181
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,320
Whether it's true or not,

182
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,850
I'll take you to look for it.

183
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,290
If I find anything suspicious about you,

184
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,380
I'll show no mercy.

185
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,120
You saved my life in the first place.

186
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,960
If you want to,

187
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,430
feel free to reclaim it anytime.

188
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,770
Someone actually managed to undo
Master's acupoint-sealing needle.

189
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,310
He not only undid
my manipulation,

190
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,240
but also gained the protection
of the Changfeng Army.

191
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,120
Prince Annan

192
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,810
has become a shadow puppet,

193
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,670
but he remains cunning and untamable.

194
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,800
It's Li Shuang and that shadow puppet.

195
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,900
This direction...

196
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,300
They're heading to the Barren Forest.

197
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,730
Since they want to walk into our trap,

198
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,770
we should graciously oblige them.

199
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,610
You ride quite well.

200
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,400
My limbs are about to fall off.

201
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,800
I'm guessing you escaped

202
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,410
through this forest that day, didn't you?

203
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,390
There might be danger inside.

204
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,550
Everyone,

205
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,170
dismount and enter the forest. Stay alert.

206
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,930
Don't overlook anything suspicious.

207
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,770
-Yes.
-Yes.

208
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,200
Master.

209
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,470
This shadow puppet
never leaves Li Shuang's side.

210
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,760
How can we capture him?

211
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,190
Naturally, I have my ways.

212
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,270
You can barely ride a horse.

213
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,600
Stop trying to show off.

214
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,080
At least I'm an adult.

215
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,610
If nothing else,
I can serve as a human shield.

216
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,740
These branches were broken recently.

217
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,050
Couldn't have been more than 10 days ago.

218
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,840
A child

219
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,720
couldn't have caused such a disturbance.

220
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,890
Could it be

221
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,400
he was in adult form at that time?

222
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,130
General,

223
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,640
there's a tunnel entrance over there.

224
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,700
Did you think of something?

225
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,270
It feels so familiar.

226
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,800
Ji Ran.

227
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,200
I'll go down and take a look.

228
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,650
I'll go with you.

229
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,320
Very well,

230
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,010
let's go.

231
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,160
General,

232
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,030
be careful of traps.

233
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,960
I'm well aware.

234
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,510
Let's split into two groups

235
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,589
to cover for each other.

236
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,109
Okay.

237
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,510
Prison break!

238
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,700
Follow me

239
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,460
and fight our way out!

240
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,720
Huo Du has been rescued!

241
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,380
After them!

242
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,390
Sir, this way.

243
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,710
Let's go!

244
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,180
It's Huo Du!

245
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Quick! After him!

246
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,310
Catch him!

247
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,480
Hurry!

248
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,830
They're over there!

249
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,630
Go after them!

250
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,070
It seems

251
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,880
there's been a fierce battle here.

252
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,500
She's dead.

253
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,440
That's his scent.

254
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,420
It's you!

255
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,890
It seems to be coming from the tunnel.

256
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,360
I hope General's side is safe.

257
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,890
Let's go!

258
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,630
Jin'an!

259
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:18,910
General,

260
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,410
are you alright?

261
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,070
I'm fine.

262
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,190
Chase them.

263
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,280
Chase them!

264
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,190
Quickly!

265
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,250
Search over there.

266
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,190
They couldn't have gone far.

267
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,870
Find them!

268
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,510
Yes.

269
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,040
Huo Du.

270
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,460
Huo Du!

271
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,860
Do you dare?

272
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,920
Surround him!

273
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,000
Huo Du,

274
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,000
release Li Ting

275
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,310
and I'll spare your life.

276
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,680
Spare my life?

277
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,010
Will the imperial court agree to that?

278
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,510
I'm giving you two options.

279
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,350
Either let me go,

280
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,670
or watch your brother

281
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,750
die with me!

282
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,160
Li Ting.

283
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,710
Li Ting.

284
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:21,950
Li Ting?

285
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,090
Li Ting?

286
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,640
He's dead.

287
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
Take Huo Du's body

288
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,060
back to the military camp.

289
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,590
Yes.

290
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,130
What about him?

291
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,990
Secretly take him back
to the General's Residence.

292
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,400
Yes.

293
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,000
This Jade Linglong

294
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,110
was planted in
the shadow puppet's body recently

295
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,590
and is clearly unstable,

296
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,200
but even so,

297
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,960
it can still exert such terrifying power.

298
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,270
Master,

299
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,230
I think we should just find an opportunity

300
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,710
to kill that female general.

301
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,730
Once the blood master dies,

302
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,860
the shadow puppet will
naturally be ours for the taking.

303
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,440
Right now, the connection between
the blood master and puppet is unstable.

304
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,990
Even if we kill the blood master,

305
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,510
it will be of no use.

306
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,330
So you're saying

307
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,990
we need to target him directly?

308
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,110
Seems that without complete confidence,

309
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,570
we'll have to wait
for another opportunity.

310
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,660
[Lucheng]

311
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,430
[General's Residence]

312
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,310
Line up!

313
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,880
Greetings, General.

314
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,720
The person sent from the army
has been placed in the side room.

315
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,680
Strengthen the security in the mansion

316
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,830
and make sure
not a word of this leaks out.

317
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,270
Yes.

318
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,470
Who are you?

319
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,310
Where am I?

320
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,270
Who are you?

321
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,480
I'm...

322
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,030
Aren't you in pain?

323
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,680
Asleep again?

324
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,470
Then I'll prick you awake.

325
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,150
That won't be necessary.

326
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,610
With so many injuries,

327
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,120
you can still move freely.

328
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,780
That's truly extraordinary.

329
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,350
I heard them say

330
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,900
that you not only have amnesia,

331
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,030
but you also transformed from a child.

332
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,530
How did you transform?

333
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,630
Transform for me.

334
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,550
Just once.

335
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,460
I want to see it.

336
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,570
Is it starting already?

337
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,810
Is it dangerous?

338
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,940
How long does it take?

339
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,920
You're done?

340
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,140
The supernatural strength
and heightened senses disappeared again.

341
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,070
Why on earth did I become like this?

342
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,890
It's none of your business.

343
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,790
Then drink this medicine
to strengthen your body first.

344
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,000
You really think you can move freely now?

345
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,630
Shuang entrusted you to me,

346
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,970
so you're my patient now.

347
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,640
How can you run off
without being properly treated?

348
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,350
General?

349
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,540
Is she alright?

350
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,790
She's fine.

351
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,880
Where is she?

352
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,290
Why don't you worry about yourself first?

353
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,270
Don't you want to know

354
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,310
why you have this strange condition?

355
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,200
Don't you want to find out

356
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,730
about your own background?

357
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,430
Can you really cure me?

358
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,630
Interesting.

359
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,350
When it comes to medical skills,

360
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,350
in all of Lucheng,

361
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,590
if I, Lu Xin, claim to be second best,

362
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,320
no one dares to claim they're first.

363
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,000
First, drink this medicine
to strengthen your body.

364
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,840
As for your strange condition,

365
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,100
we'll treat it slowly.

366
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,090
Weren't you moving around quite freely?

367
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,270
I had a close call.

368
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,200
Shuang, with that look on your face,

369
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,660
I might as well
have let that villain kill me.

370
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,120
From what you're saying,

371
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,450
you don't think
you did anything wrong at all.

372
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,960
Huo Du escaped,

373
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,530
and I caught up with him.

374
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,540
If I don't get credit, so be it.

375
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,940
What did I do wrong?

376
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,160
Have you lost your mind?

377
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,290
This first lash is because

378
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,050
you don't even know what you did wrong!

379
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,590
Acting recklessly,

380
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,200
obsessed with glory,

381
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,910
putting yourself in danger,

382
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,350
and complicating Father's rescue.

383
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,690
Were you wrong or not?

384
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,550
Have you ever hit me before in my life?

385
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,010
Is this really necessary?

386
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,670
This second lash is because

387
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,530
you don't deserve your position!

388
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,030
Since you joined the Changfeng Army,

389
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,310
you've done nothing but complain

390
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,110
and bark orders at the soldiers.

391
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,110
As the son of the Li family,

392
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,490
your every word and action

393
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,010
is under public scrutiny.

394
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,280
Throwing childish tantrums

395
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,390
and bringing shame to our family,

396
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,560
were you wrong or not?

397
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Whipping my arms and legs, fine!

398
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,310
Go ahead, whip me.

399
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,340
Whip me to death!

400
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,190
If I've done anything else wrong,

401
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,320
just punish me for everything at once.

402
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,010
The third lash

403
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,510
is for your disrespect toward your elders.

404
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,110
I'm indeed
not Father's biological daughter,

405
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,120
but I am still his daughter.

406
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,770
You don't have to accept me,

407
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,680
but you must respect Father's decisions.

408
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,440
Were you wrong or not?

409
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,750
No,

410
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,160
I seek glory,

411
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,160
but I also hope

412
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,040
that you can think highly of me.

413
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,270
Fine.

414
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,750
Since you think

415
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,550
I'm such a disloyal and unfilial person,

416
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,160
you might as well beat me to death

417
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,160
and rid the Li family of this menace!

418
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,370
This fourth lash...

419
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,480
I deserve it myself.

420
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,090
You grew up with me since childhood

421
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,840
and turned out like this.

422
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,850
Clearly, I didn't guide you properly.

423
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,310
It's my fault.

424
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,510
That brother of yours is a grown man

425
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,440
and still doesn't know any better.

426
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,670
He really needs to be taught a lesson.

427
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,200
But while it's one thing
to discipline him,

428
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,260
why did you discipline yourself too?

429
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,720
You just came from Jin'an's place.

430
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,750
How is he now?

431
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,310
He's quite the special case.

432
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,640
In all my years,

433
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,720
I've never seen such a strange condition.

434
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,120
It's not even documented in medical texts.

435
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,070
I need to study him thoroughly.

436
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,110
But his body is too weak right now,

437
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,960
so the most urgent thing

438
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,270
is to help him recover.

439
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,350
First, there were soldiers
with acupuncture points blocked,

440
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,110
moving mindlessly.

441
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,440
Then, there was a woman
who had been long-dead

442
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,160
but could still kill people.

443
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,480
And now, there's Jinan

444
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,270
who can change his size.

445
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,400
If I didn't know you so well,

446
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,710
I would seriously wonder

447
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,110
if that's Changfeng Army
or Wuling Mountain you're running.

448
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,679
Wuling Mountain?

449
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,340
What place is that?

450
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,360
It's like a sacred pilgrimage site

451
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,030
for medical practitioners.

452
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,070
They say

453
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,560
their medical skills there are miraculous,

454
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,159
able to revive the dead
and grow flesh on bones.

455
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,260
From what you're saying,

456
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,120
if we find Wuling Mountain,

457
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,560
we might be able to figure everything out.

458
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,280
But Wuling Mountain

459
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,800
operates with integrity

460
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,320
and would never harm people
through shady means.

461
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,110
Besides,

462
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,110
to avoid worldly conflicts,

463
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,580
they've been isolated
from the outside world for decades.

464
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,150
Don't worry.

465
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,760
Though his condition is unusual,

466
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,800
I believe

467
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,230
it's not incurable.

468
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Once I heal him

469
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,800
and he remembers everything,

470
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,400
the truth will come to light.

471
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:57,960
In that case,

472
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,690
we'll have to leave it at that for now.

473
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,590
Thank you for today.

474
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,350
I'll have someone escort you back.

475
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,930
I don't want to go back.

476
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,590
If you have nothing to do
when you get back,

477
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,590
I just remembered

478
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,070
our camp is running low

479
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,280
on hemostatic herbs.

480
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,960
Go deliver some.

481
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,200
Just give them to Ji Ran.

482
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,190
You're so kind, General.

483
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,850
The Changfeng Army
is truly blessed to have you.

484
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,620
Here.

485
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,550
Premium medicine

486
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,700
for that precious brother of yours.

487
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,810
Keep an eye on Jin'an for me.

488
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,920
I'll be back in a couple of days.

489
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,150
I'm off, General Shuang.
