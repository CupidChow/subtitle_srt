[Episode 15]

00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,710
[Lucheng]

4
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,150
By the general's order,

5
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,430
all citizens entering the city

6
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:47,970
without

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
proper identification

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,680
shall be subjected to rigorous
questioning to ascertain their identity.

9
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,590
Tomorrow is the Lantern Festival,

10
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,190
the most cherished occasion

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,930
of the year for the common folk.

12
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,950
Now that the fighting has subsided,

13
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,200
we must ensure the people

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,840
can celebrate the festival in peace.

15
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,400
What?

16
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,230
Why can't I enter without identification?

17
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,160
What's wrong with me just going in?

18
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,310
What right do you have to stop me?

19
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,370
What are you doing?

20
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,960
What right do you have to stop me?

21
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,470
What...

22
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,910
What right do you have to arrest me?

23
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,400
Let go!

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Hold him down!

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,400
Why are you arresting me?

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,360
Behave yourself!

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,760
I'm just a small merchant.

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,870
Why are you arresting me?

29
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,960
You soldiers are so unreasonable!

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,890
What's going on?

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,079
General.

32
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,840
General,

33
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,800
we've captured

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,520
a suspicious person
without identification.

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,380
Mercy, My Lord!

36
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,310
I live just outside the city.

37
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,870
Tomorrow is the Lantern Festival.

38
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,680
I only wish to go into the city
and run a little stall.

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,190
Look,

40
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,400
this bundle contains only small items

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,280
and trinkets.

42
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,750
Open it up.

43
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,800
Yes.

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,520
Careful, careful.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,870
I still need to sell these.

46
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,930
Don't damage them.

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,840
My Lord, these are just
inexpensive trinkets.

48
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,400
The plains outside the city

49
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,130
are inhabited only by farmers.

50
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,280
For someone
who claims to be a street vendor,

51
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,080
how do you explain

52
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,410
the calluses on your hands
from years of riding and archery?

53
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,190
No.

54
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,870
No, My Lord!

55
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,240
My Lord!

56
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,500
I'm innocent, My Lord!

57
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,240
-I'm innocent!
-Send him to the government office.

58
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,030
I'll interrogate him myself.

59
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,710
Yes.

60
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,310
General, I'm innocent, General!

61
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:13,840
Move!

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,700
General, I'm innocent, General!

63
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,450
General!

64
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,800
Excuse me.

65
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't have any...

66
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,710
identification either.

67
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,210
Why don't you arrest me, but only him?

68
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,220
You don't have any identification?

69
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,079
No, I don't.

70
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,470
Just now I swaggered into the city,

71
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,470
and your men didn't even question me.

72
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,280
How embarrassing!

73
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,750
They almost left me out.

74
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,960
Take me.

75
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,470
They

76
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,760
probably saw your fine clothes

77
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,210
and didn't think they needed to check.

78
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,190
Forgive us, General.

79
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,120
Are you done looking?

80
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,820
Ready to arrest me now?

81
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,000
You want to go to prison?

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,680
Isn't this your rule?

83
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,510
Besides, I've never been there before,

84
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,370
so it might be nice to check it out.

85
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,560
Who are you?

86
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,970
Where do you come from?

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,910
Well,

88
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,400
I can't tell you.

89
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,260
What do you want

90
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,150
in Lucheng?

91
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,630
Even if I told you,

92
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,380
you wouldn't understand.

93
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,570
She's questioning you,

94
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,510
so reply to each point directly.

95
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,240
Don't beat around the bush.

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
At the border,

97
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,720
food is scarce and expensive.

98
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,520
If you want to go to prison, fine,

99
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
but you'll have to

100
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,060
pay for your own meals.

101
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,510
Fine.

102
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,310
You're right.

103
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,630
My money pouch

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,270
seems to be missing.

105
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,720
Here,

106
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,750
this hairpin

107
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,409
should cover plenty of meals.

108
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,260
Then you'll get your wish,

109
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,180
but once you're in prison,

110
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,040
you'll inevitably suffer
some physical punishment.

111
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,160
And when that happens,

112
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,220
no matter whose precious son you are,

113
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,600
I won't

114
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,880
release you easily.

115
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:12,830
Take him away.

116
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,560
Yes.

117
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,000
Move.

118
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,190
This hairpin

119
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,280
is enough to feed him
in prison for a lifetime.

120
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,240
I hope he's not some noble's son

121
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,310
coming here to make fun of us.

122
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Inform the warden

123
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,330
to keep a close watch on him.

124
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,040
Yes.

125
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,909
As for today's incident,

126
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,659
I won't pursue it further for now.

127
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,050
But if there are any more mistakes,

128
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,560
the entire squad

129
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,250
will lose half a year's pay.

130
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,670
-Thank you, General.
-Thank you, General.

131
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,430
Here you are. Take it.

132
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,280
Wait a moment.

133
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,170
Lu Xin.

134
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,920
Closing so early?

135
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,370
It's a festival today.

136
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,970
Who would come for medicine?

137
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,060
That's true.

138
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,190
Since you've closed up the shop,

139
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,000
why not go out for a walk?

140
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,100
The streets are full of couples,

141
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,750
and I'd be all alone,

142
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,360
talking to myself.

143
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,159
No fun at all.

144
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,830
If you're bored,

145
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,750
wait for me at the General's Residence.

146
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,310
I'll keep you company
after I finish patrolling.

147
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,170
You said the same thing last year,

148
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,920
but you ended up reading
military books all night.

149
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,120
I might as well snack on seeds at my shop.

150
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,640
Why are you personally patrolling today?

151
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,270
It's all because of Jin'an.

152
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,110
He insists that I learn to

153
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,480
enjoy life,

154
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,240
pushing me to play instruments and paint,

155
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,870
but I don't have that talent.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,800
Don't talk about enjoying life.

157
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,400
It's practically torture.

158
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,240
Don't you have

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,160
any other feelings except complaining?

160
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,000
Like

161
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,850
a sweet feeling in your heart?

162
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,720
Have you been reading

163
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,159
some ridiculous romance novels again?

164
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,950
You're as stubborn as a mule.

165
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,360
Jin'an is right.

166
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,720
All these years,
you've been the General of Taijin,

167
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
the Li family's daughter,

168
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,950
and the Beautiful Lord of Hell.

169
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,070
You've fulfilled every role dutifully,

170
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,310
but you've forgotten

171
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,370
that you're still an ordinary woman.

172
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,240
What's wrong with being an ordinary woman?

173
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,510
Do ordinary women have to

174
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,570
play musical instruments and paint?

175
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,040
Can't they do anything else?

176
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,000
What matters isn't what you do,

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,390
but that you try everything

178
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,390
and have choices.

179
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,560
On some things,

180
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,720
Jin'an and I seem to think alike.

181
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,480
You don't

182
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,680
have to limit your life

183
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,140
to swords and spears only.

184
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,510
This dress

185
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,920
was custom-made at great expense
from the embroidery shop.

186
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,180
It's the only one of its kind
in the world.

187
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,040
I've wanted to give it to you
for a long time,

188
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
but I knew

189
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,510
you would make
all kinds of excuses to refuse it before.

190
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,430
However, Shuang,

191
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,070
I hope you can set aside your concerns

192
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,630
and live happily for yourself just once,

193
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,350
even if it's just for one day,

194
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,909
alright?

195
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,799
Since you're so thoughtful,

196
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,510
I'll

197
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,250
return the favor with a grand gift.

198
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,390
Why are you here?

199
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,080
I calculated it was time
for you to return home,

200
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,340
so I came to escort you.

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,730
Today is the Lantern Festival.

202
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,030
I've heard

203
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,000
the Lantern Festival
has lanterns glowing all night

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
and it's incredibly lively.

205
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,670
Let's go take a look.

206
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,200
Are you asking me

207
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,010
to celebrate with you?

208
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,750
No.

209
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,600
I just thought you probably
haven't seen lanterns before,

210
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,750
and I was worried
you'd be bored alone at home.

211
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,640
Why are you asking so many questions?

212
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,500
If you don't want to go, forget it.

213
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,510
I didn't mean that.

214
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,000
After all,

215
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,390
this is your first time asking me out.

216
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,690
I wouldn't dare spoil your good mood.

217
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,680
It's quite lively outside.

218
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,120
Sir, do you know what's happening outside?

219
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,030
Why are you quiet?

220
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,910
Hello.

221
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,320
What's your surname?

222
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,960
Where are you from?

223
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,870
Are you also locked up here

224
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,670
because

225
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,600
you don't have that identification?

226
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,960
We're about to die.

227
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,670
Can you just shut up

228
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,240
and be quiet for a moment?

229
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,210
When will your companions

230
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,560
come to rescue you?

231
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,880
Brother Chen,

232
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,390
we just walked into the inn so boldly.

233
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,270
Shouldn't we

234
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,870
be more cautious and keep a low profile?

235
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,550
Indeed,

236
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,840
the Jin people are vigilant.

237
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,030
If not for Brother Chen's
careful planning today,

238
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,390
deliberately having Wu
expose himself at the city gate

239
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,720
to distract the guards,

240
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,630
I'm afraid

241
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,640
we might not have all made it in.

242
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,240
Now Lucheng

243
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,990
is on high alert everywhere.

244
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,910
If we try too hard to disguise ourselves,

245
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,710
we'll only draw more attention.

246
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,270
I just

247
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,600
really feel sorry for Wu.

248
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,750
Don't worry, Brother Chen.

249
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,750
We are death-sworn warriors
of the Left Minister's Mansion.

250
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,670
Taking risks for the greater cause

251
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,720
is our duty.

252
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,720
Right now,

253
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,480
the most important thing is to figure out

254
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,740
what we should do next.

255
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,340
Let's stay calm first,

256
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,090
and continue our investigation in Lucheng.

257
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,390
That day,

258
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,870
just after we left,

259
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,550
Zang Budu was murdered.

260
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,480
It seems

261
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,550
we're getting closer to Prince Annan

262
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,820
than ever before.

263
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

264
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,550
In front of me,

265
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,310
why do you still pretend?

266
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,240
I've been following you
all the way from Ninglan.

267
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,630
When I saw you were in trouble,

268
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,490
I didn't care about anything else

269
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,440
and followed you

270
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,750
onto the prison cart.

271
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,360
I... I...

272
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,130
I was wrongfully arrested

273
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,480
and locked up here!

274
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,000
I...

275
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,350
I don't know what you're talking about.

276
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,720
Could it be that

277
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,320
they sacrificed you as a diversion

278
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,360
and made you a disposable pawn?

279
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,030
You talk too much.

280
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,550
I still lost track of them after all.

281
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,960
And now I have to
waste my memory-erasing pill.

282
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,790
Sleep now,

283
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,520
and when you wake up,
you won't remember me.

284
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,380
Since that's the case,

285
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,930
I'll have to go out
and search more carefully.

286
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,080
Besides,

287
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,610
on such a beautiful night,

288
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,510
I can't let it go to waste.

289
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,960
Make way!

290
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,000
The dragon is coming!

291
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,320
Great!

292
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,780
What's with the long face?

293
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,520
If you're unhappy, I'm even more unhappy.

294
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,910
No matter how I asked Shuang out before,

295
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,390
she might not even come.

296
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,120
This year

297
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,340
she finally asked me out for once,

298
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,700
but I never thought
she'd bring you along too!

299
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,160
A quarter past five,
center of the main street.

300
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,430
This is the place.

301
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,600
Where is she?

302
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,600
She's probably held up
by something at the military camp.

303
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,150
I don't know.

304
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,240
You'll get used to it.

305
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,840
Make way!

306
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,670
Make way! Make way!

307
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,720
The dragon is coming!

308
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,600
The dragon is coming!

309
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,530
Dragon! Jin'an!

310
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,420
Make way, make way!

311
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,390
Make way!

312
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,320
Thank you.

313
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,970
Shuang!

314
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,030
You look beautiful!

315
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,440
I have such good taste.

316
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,630
And the size is perfect.

317
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,910
Really beautiful.

318
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,480
If you keep staring like this,

319
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,670
it'll be dawn soon.

320
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,270
You look so pretty

321
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,600
in this outfit.

322
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,510
This silk dress

323
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,200
has layers upon layers.

324
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,960
I'm suffocating.

325
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,200
You can wear armor,

326
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,240
but can't handle this light silk dress?

327
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,500
Stop complaining, you'll get used to it.

328
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,600
General.

329
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,750
Why did you invite him?

330
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,440
Didn't I say I'd give you a gift?

331
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,120
He is the gift!

332
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,720
What kind of gift is this?

333
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,910
He already spent his money
on you last time.

334
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,510
I saw everything.

335
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,790
You two are as close as a couple now.

336
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,940
What's there to be shy about?

337
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,670
You've misunderstood.

338
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,910
Don't be shy.

339
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,360
Don't be shy.

340
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,000
Tonight

341
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,150
we won't talk about work.

342
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,750
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

343
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,000
Um,

344
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,369
there's a lantern show over there.

345
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,270
Where's the lantern show?

346
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,130
There's a fireworks show over there.

347
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,390
I have no choice

348
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,750
but to obey the general's orders.

349
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,440
If you feel uncomfortable,

350
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,680
I can leave first.

351
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,270
Tonight is a rare festive occasion.

352
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,720
There's no harm in walking around.

353
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
Though we aren't meant to be,

354
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,010
we can still be friends,

355
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,310
right?

356
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:35,830
Here.

357
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,880
Take it.

358
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,280
Let's go.

359
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,210
Are we really just walking away like this?

360
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,480
What's wrong with that?

361
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,680
I'm creating opportunities for them.

362
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,750
You don't understand.

363
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,070
But one of them

364
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,750
is just following orders,

365
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,440
and the other is doing it reluctantly.

366
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,640
Both look

367
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,960
kind of awkward.

368
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,720
Not at all!

369
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,400
They're just being shy and bashful.

370
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,440
How can you be so clueless?

371
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,640
So dense.

372
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,530
You won't be invited
to their wedding at this rate.

373
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,160
Look how well-matched they are!

374
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,880
Look!

375
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,310
Brother, she's so beautiful!

376
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,160
Buy her a flower, please.

377
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,510
How much?

378
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,200
Three coins each.

379
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,550
Come here, little girl.

380
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,270
Give me your hand.

381
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,110
Here you go.

382
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,550
You're beautiful and rich.

383
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,680
Brother, you're so lucky.

384
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,960
Take care.

385
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,550
It's not what you think.

386
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm rich too.

387
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,680
When did you become so showy?

388
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,310
Shouting about your wealth
in the middle of the street?

389
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,750
But I do have money!

390
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,800
I just handed it all over to you.

391
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,270
Now for no reason

392
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,660
that little girl thinks
I'm some kind of kept man.

393
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,510
Is that fair?

394
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,200
You do have a point.

395
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Well,

396
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,250
to avoid any further misunderstandings,

397
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,910
I'll give you all the money.

398
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,540
Take it.

399
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,690
I'm leaving.

400
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,080
Take the lantern too.

401
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,370
I've given you all the money,

402
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,790
so don't ask me for any more.

403
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,790
Hold it properly.

404
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,350
Isn't this making it worse?

405
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,750
Stay calm.

406
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,310
Calm down.

407
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,590
Just do it!

408
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,240
The General is on the main street.

409
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,830
No,

410
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,570
I came looking for you.

411
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,280
I heard you're on duty tonight.

412
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,410
I came specially...

413
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,550
specially...

414
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,030
to bring you this.

415
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,680
Masks for sale!

416
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,810
Pick whatever you like!

417
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:14,670
Help yourself!

418
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,510
Right.

419
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,740
Feel free to look around.

420
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,510
Sir,

421
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,590
how come I've never seen anyone

422
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,000
selling this sort of face mask before?

423
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,750
You two

424
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,270
must be from out of town, right?

425
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,200
Do you know

426
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,640
Lucheng has four treasures?

427
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,240
Lucheng has four treasures?

428
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,800
They say Lucheng has three treasures:

429
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,310
honey, deer antler,
and green jade chicken.

430
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,920
What is this fourth treasure, then?

431
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,720
You're holding it in your hands!

432
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,550
You two may not know,

433
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,750
but just recently,

434
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,000
here in Lucheng,

435
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
a great hero appeared,

436
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,880
the man in black.

437
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,140
Just a few days ago

438
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,910
during the border battle,

439
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,030
that heroic man in black

440
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,680
used magical tactics

441
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,510
and supernatural power

442
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,960
to single-handedly

443
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,750
drive back
50,000 soldiers of the Yao Army!

444
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,820
Bravo!

445
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,620
When did you learn such magical tactics?

446
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,590
Take your time. Pick whatever you like.

447
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,880
This is what we call
the sublimation of art.

448
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,830
That's nothing.

449
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
And this great hero

450
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,720
charged alone into the enemy camp

451
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,240
and joined forces with
General Li of the Changfeng Army

452
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,960
to strike down that scheming counsellor

453
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,310
from his horse!

454
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,110
Those 50,000 Yao soldiers
were so terrified

455
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,550
that they wet themselves,

456
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,480
fled like rats,

457
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,790
and retreated through the night

458
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,070
for more than 50 li!

459
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,920
Bravo!

460
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,750
What a pity!

461
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,070
What a pity!

462
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,830
About this noble hero

463
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,630
with unmatched martial skills,

464
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,200
we never had the chance

465
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,440
to learn

466
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,240
his name or background.

467
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,880
He only

468
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,880
left behind this

469
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,960
magnificent mask.

470
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,350
Now you tell me,

471
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,400
does this mask

472
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
deserve to be Lucheng's

473
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,000
fourth treasure?

474
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
Yes, indeed!

475
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,310
I'll take one!

476
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:57,750
OK.

477
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,480
Come on!

478
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,000
Pick whatever you like!

479
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,310
Don't push! Don't push!

480
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,830
Line up, everyone!

481
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,590
What are you doing?

482
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,200
Help yourself!

483
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,600
Why are you walking away?

484
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,270
Go listen to

485
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,730
how they're praising you.

486
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,550
There are too many people.

487
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,750
I'm afraid you'll get pushed around.

488
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,070
What are you afraid of? I'm here.

489
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,640
Let's go.

490
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,200
I don't want you to get hurt.

491
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,460
Let me pick one for you.

492
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,160
Everyone, please don't push!

493
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,110
The man in black is right in front of you.

494
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,240
Why did you say that?

495
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,200
Let's go.

496
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,260
Have a look.

497
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,360
Thank you for accompanying me for so long.

498
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,720
Shuang has some misunderstandings.

499
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,510
But she rarely gets to relax,

500
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,000
and I don't want to spoil her mood,

501
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
though I've probably ruined yours.

502
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,260
I don't think that way.

503
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,050
You're overthinking.

504
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,550
You can stop being polite now.

505
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,240
Compared to this insincere politeness,

506
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
I actually prefer

507
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,550
your previous hurtful bluntness

508
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,480
as it sounds more pleasant to my ears,

509
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,200
at least it was genuine.

510
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
My gratitude

511
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,480
is also sincere.

512
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,160
But you can't thank me forever

513
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,490
for such a small matter.

514
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,360
I've received all your compensation.

515
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,790
I told you back at Cang Mountain

516
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,510
that I wouldn't cling to you anymore

517
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,880
and I keep my word.

518
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,750
Doesn't Shuang look beautiful today?

519
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,610
It's the first time
I've seen her dressed like this.

520
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,830
You clearly have feelings for her

521
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,630
but you won't tell her how you feel.

522
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,720
If you don't tell her,

523
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,680
she is so dense

524
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,330
that she'll never understand.

525
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,830
I don't understand
all this restraint and propriety.

526
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,920
If you get rejected, then so be it.

527
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,200
It won't cost you a penny.

528
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,270
Life is too short

529
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,110
to live with regrets.

530
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,590
Anyway, it's your business.

531
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,200
I don't really want to get involved.

532
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,880
I'm tired.

533
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,240
I'm heading back to sleep first.

534
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,720
You should go rest early too.

535
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,200
I'll find a chance

536
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,600
to clear things up with Shuang.

537
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,530
I won't cause you any more trouble.

538
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,350
The candied haws are for you.

539
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,550
Thanks for spending time with me today.

540
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,960
I am not worthy.

541
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,110
You are pretty and intelligent.

542
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,630
You will find a good match someday.

543
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,350
Of course.

544
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,000
I will definitely meet

545
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,160
a great man.

546
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,160
You will be jealous then.

547
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,370
I'm leaving.

548
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,720
Luckily, I didn't listen to Jin'an.

549
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,180
Giving flowers and plants

550
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,280
isn't as practical as giving food.

551
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,880
What are you

552
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,410
mumbling about over there?

553
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,400
Nothing.

554
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,930
I was just saying

555
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,590
this is the best date cake in Lucheng.

556
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,270
Don't you always like it?

557
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,470
I bought some for you.

558
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,480
By the way,

559
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,960
as soon as their stall opens,

560
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,550
everything sells out quickly.

561
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,000
How did you manage to get some?

562
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,330
And they're still warm.

563
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,400
They're doing me a favour.

564
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,370
These two dozen are freshly made.

565
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,030
You're abusing your power?

566
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,030
No, I'm not.

567
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,640
Take them back.

568
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,300
Apologize.

569
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,280
Apologize...

570
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,400
No way.

571
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Will you go or not?

572
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,680
What am I apologizing for?

573
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,550
I haggled with Old Chen for ages

574
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,880
and put in a ton of effort.

575
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,070
I spent the whole afternoon

576
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,240
making festival lanterns for his yard.

577
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,500
That's how I got these freshly made ones.

578
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,070
Why?

579
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,640
Why...

580
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,680
Well...

581
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,070
Well...

582
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,720
You know...

583
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,500
It's a festival today.

584
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,310
I've noticed you don't have many hobbies.

585
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,480
Besides eating, you mostly
practice martial arts.

586
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,200
As for fighting,

587
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,920
well, you know how it is.

588
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,980
Let's just skip it.

589
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,880
So I can only do my best

590
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,960
to treat you

591
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
to some nice food.

592
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,830
You?

593
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,790
Treat me?

594
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,200
I hate beating around the bush,

595
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,800
so I'll just say it straight.

596
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,750
Qiao,

597
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,720
I fancy you.

598
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,480
I know

599
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,640
we're not that familiar with each other,

600
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,400
but honestly,

601
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,880
life is just about eating,
drinking, and the daily routines.

602
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,720
Let's find time to

603
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,440
grab more meals together,

604
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,750
and if we can get along well,

605
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,750
that will be great...

606
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,350
OK.

607
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:08,920
Yes,

608
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,680
this is a bit sudden.

609
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,310
It's OK if you don't agree today,

610
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,110
Anyway, I'm off work
tomorrow and the day after.

611
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,680
But...

612
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,270
You...

613
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,560
What did you just say?

614
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,680
I said...

615
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,350
OK.

616
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,510
OK.

617
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,440
The general took you in,

618
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,680
which means

619
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,550
you're a decent man.

620
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,310
Besides,

621
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,880
your martial skills are really impressive.

622
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,070
With our combined strength,

623
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,070
the children we have

624
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,510
will surely be as strong as bulls.

625
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,400
Then,

626
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,830
we can have a dozen or so children.

627
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,510
After training,

628
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,960
they'll form a powerful team

629
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,070
that'll guarantee the general's safety!

630
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,070
What do you think?

631
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,000
A dozen or so?

632
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,590
You don't want to?

633
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,310
No, it's not that.

634
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,880
I'm just suddenly

635
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,160
feeling a bit conflicted.

636
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,690
Then I'll take that as a yes.

637
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,590
Come on.

638
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,400
Come on.

639
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,490
It used to keep me company.

640
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,000
From now on,

641
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,650
it's your turn.

642
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,510
Who are you?

643
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,750
You almost pushed me into the river!

644
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,640
I thought you were trying
to end your life,

645
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,030
so I wanted to pull you back.

646
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,500
I didn't expect you to be ungrateful

647
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,760
and turn on me instead.

648
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,590
My back!

649
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,070
Your back?

650
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,480
My back!

651
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,640
I was just admiring the sparkling water,

652
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,960
and wanted to get a closer look.

653
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,160
You're really strange.

654
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,590
Earlier you were clearly upset,

655
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,270
yet you smiled and said
everything was fine.

656
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,680
Now you're over the moon

657
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,100
just watching me make a fool of myself.

658
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,720
You sneaky eavesdropper,

659
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,030
you've been listening in, haven't you?

660
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
That's my psychological strategy.

661
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,630
I don't have a chance anyway.

662
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,510
The more gracious, composed,

663
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,750
and reasonable I am,

664
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,560
the more guilty he'll feel.

665
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,170
And I'll make him drown in that guilt.

666
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,310
I didn't expect such a young lady

667
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,350
to be so calculating.

668
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,830
I must say,

669
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,710
I'm impressed.

670
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,920
Regretting it now?

671
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,380
You clearly have so much to say

672
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,030
yet you keep it all bottled up.

673
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,090
The one who suffers

674
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,860
will ultimately be yourself.

675
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,880
Everyone in this world

676
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,830
wears a mask to some degree.

677
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,460
Besides,

678
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,600
even if you want to speak,

679
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,250
there may not be anyone willing to listen.

680
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,310
People back where I'm from

681
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,170
just say whatever they feel like.

682
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,750
Life is meant

683
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,400
to be lived freely

684
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,230
and as one pleases.

685
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,440
Your people?

686
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,330
Where are you from?

687
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,600
I think you're just
carefree and thoughtless.

688
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,160
Boss,

689
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,520
give me some.

690
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,640
Sure, these, right? Take them all.

691
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,480
Excuse me.

692
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,010
Give me some rings, please.

693
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,110
Thank you.

694
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,440
These past few years,

695
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,310
the Lantern Festival

696
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,940
has always been my most tense period,

697
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,440
filled with fears of unrest in the city

698
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,750
and Yao State's lying in wait.

699
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,730
But this year is different.

700
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,270
Is it because I'm here

701
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,310
that makes it different?

702
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:57,920
Yes.

703
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,889
Every single day from now on

704
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,800
I'll be here.

705
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,800
I can't just put down
my sword for one person.

706
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,030
In the future,

707
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
you will face countless waits.

708
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,280
Because it's you,

709
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,670
all the waiting

710
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,770
will turn into expectations.

711
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,330
I smell sulfur and saltpeter.

712
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,880
This place is dangerous.

713
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,680
Let's go, now!

714
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,800
What?

715
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,280
Thank you

716
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,090
