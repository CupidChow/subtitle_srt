You don't remember your birthday.

4
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,700
My life has been drifting,

5
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,880
so I don't remember mine either.

6
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,750
Why don't we make today

7
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,310
our shared birthday?

8
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,240
We may not have been born on the same day,

9
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,190
but we wish to die on the same day.

10
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,079
That way,

11
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,630
we would be

12
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,590
born together

13
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,970
and die together.

14
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,470
If only everything

15

[Origin of Our Fate]

18
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,480
The Jade Linglong

19
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,120
is the most evil artifact in the world.

20
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,070
once inside the body,

21
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,390
it can transform a living person
into an obedient shadow puppet.

22
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,720
A shadow puppet acknowledges its master

23
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,630
through a blood contract,

24
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,830
and when nourished with blood essence,

25
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,310
it gains extraordinary power,

26
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,090
able to fight against
10,000 soldiers alone.

27
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,720
Consort Qin,

28
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,560
how dare you?

29
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,310
You're actually trying
to kill the Emperor.

30
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,160
Honey,

31
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,300
I love you so much.

32
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,590
How could I ever bear to kill you?

33
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,560
Once the Jade Linglong enters the body,

34
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,909
the shadow puppet
will lose all previous memories,

35
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,550
becoming mentally connected
with the blood master,

36
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,430
loyal for eternity.

37
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,600

49
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,400

Prince Annan.

51
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,620
You predicted it perfectly.

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,750
The Changfeng Army
has really fallen into our trap.

Li Shuang again!

56
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,840
This time, we must capture her alive!

57

Our main forces have long

Lucheng grows such fine fruit.

Then I'll have to cross the valley

70

We were no match.

92
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,330

there's no grudge between us.

114

Oh, no.

118

The Jade Linglong
hasn't formed a blood pact yet,

Although the Yao Army's attack on Lucheng

149
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,640
caught us off guard,

150

Ridiculous!

You think that just because you won,

154

you have the leverage

155
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
and that His Majesty won't blame us?

Our plan for a night raid on the Yao State

158
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,360
should have been flawless,

159

You're not afraid of death?

If you wanted me dead,

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,510
Although you saved me,

192
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,420
I won't tolerate your impudence.

193
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,680
Military supplies are precious.

194
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,280
Since you spilled your food,

195
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,750
no food for you today.

196
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,400
You two,

197
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,240
let's go.

198
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,310
Why did I save her?

199
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,510
Why do I feel

200
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,680
calm and at ease

201
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,870
when seeing her?

202
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,480
Where does this strange power

203
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,830
come from?

204
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,680
What exactly happened?

205
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,670
Why do I look like this?

206
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,070
Why can't I remember anything?

207
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,750
Never mind.

208
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,490
The situation is unclear,

209
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,110
so survival is the priority.

210
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,120
Given how things are,

211
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,550
I can only live on as a child

212
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,440
and stay by her side.

213
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,530
So this is what I looked like as a child?

214
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,680
Quite handsome, I must say.

215
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,240
Why is this so itchy?

216
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,560
The fabric of these clothes is so rough,

217
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,650
and the style is sloppy and outdated.

218
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,550
General,

219
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,610
why did you believe him so easily

220
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,010
when he said he doesn't remember anything?

221
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,420
That day in the forest,

222
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,400
his eyes were vacant

223
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,150
and his heartbeat rapid.

224
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,600
He clearly went through something big.

225
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,880
The border is unstable.

226
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,640
Maybe he was traumatized

227
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,060
and temporarily lost his memory.

228
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,310
I heard his strength is incredible.

229
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,270
But he's just a child.

230
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,600
When he saved me that day,

231
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,960
either he lost his mind

232
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,270
or had ulterior motives.

233
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,790
That's why

234
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,830
we should keep him here.

235
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,720
He's just a child.

236
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,400
No matter how strong,

237
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,480
if he has hidden intentions,

238
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,790
he will eventually show his true colors.

239
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,510
Very well.

240
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,960
Then we'll just

241
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,550
be extra cautious.

242
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,830
General.

243
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,480
General?

244
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,640
I was just thinking,

245
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,400
perhaps he's like me,

246
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,110
just someone who has

247
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,190
suffered enough in this war.

248
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,320
It's her.

249
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,070
Why am I so sensitive to her scent?

250
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,810
Do I

251
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,560
have a dog's nose now?

252
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,860
The clothes you gave me were too big,

253
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,120
so I made some adjustments.

254
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,580
They look better this way.

255
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,350
You claimed you've lost your memory,

256
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,680
yet you still care about your appearance.

257
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,640
That day,

258
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,550
when I brought you back from the forest,

259
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,210
your clothes were in tatters,

260
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,510
but they were clearly adult clothes.

261
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,910
Were they your father's?

262
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,110
I'm thirsty.

263
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,770
Get me a cup of water.

264
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,210
Is she afraid that I poisoned her?

265
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,310
Is it too hot?

266
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,000
It is a bit hot.

267
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,260
Let it cool down before drinking.

268
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,120
This sword is so beautiful.

269
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,640
It's so heavy.

270
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,960
I can't even lift it.

271
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,110
Miss,

272
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,790
you're really strong.

273
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,680
This is the Changfeng Army camp

274
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,920
in Lucheng, Taijin.

275
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,750
I'm Li Shuang,
the general of the Changfeng Army.

276
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,080
You may call me General.

277
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,930
This sword is indeed heavy,

278
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,350
but for someone who could

279
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,030
send a man flying several meters
with one palm,

280
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,100
lifting it should be nothing.

281
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,710
Have you forgotten?

282
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,030
You happened to save me,

283
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,350
and just now pretended to be weak

284
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,880
to cover it up.

285
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,240
Why are you really here

286
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,060
at the Changfeng Army's camp?

287
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,160
I truly have no memory.

288
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,800
I'm not lying to you.

289
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,030
I don't know

290
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,640
why I was in the forest

291
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,900
that day,

292
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,690
or why I saved you.

293
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,030
I just felt that

294
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,670
you were important to me

295
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,070
and I had to save you.

296
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,050
You're afraid I'm a spy?

297
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,830
If I really had ulterior motives,

298
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,640
wouldn't it

299
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,110
have been easier to just let you die

300
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,400
in the forest that day?

301
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,020
Your words and actions

302
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,820
all seem full of scheming.

303
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,880
Though you're just a child,

304
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,310
it seems you've had some training.

305
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,960
Otherwise,

306
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,130
how could you be so meticulous?

307
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,030
A child?

308
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,650
What's a child supposed to be like?

309
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,480
Am I not convincing enough?

310
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,480
When I was naughty and stubborn,

311
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,830
you didn't give me food;

312
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,060
now that I'm being obedient and smart,

313
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,950
you say I'm calculating.

314
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,200
I just want to survive.

315
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,700
Why am I wrong at every turn?

316
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,440
Since you're a general,

317
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,440
you must be knowledgeable and experienced.

318
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,130
Have you ever heard of
any way to reverse aging?

319
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,720
I'm a general,

320
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,020
not a charlatan.

321
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,440
Also,

322
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,480
eat this candy

323
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,300
in secret.

324
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,030
I've issued a military order

325
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,290
forbidding you to eat.

326
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,790
What a timely rain this is.

327
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,090
It must be a year of abundant harvest.

328
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,000
I hope there will be

329
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,630
no more wars between the two countries,

330
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,100
and the people won't suffer anymore.

331
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,960
It's too cold today.

332
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,590
The General went to inspect the camp

333
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,440
and hasn't returned yet.

334
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,640
Let's go have a drink, bro.

335
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,750
Drinking?

336
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,430
If the general finds out,

337
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,720
we'll be beaten with military sticks.

338
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,310
Why do I feel so uncomfortable

339
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,960
and restless?

340
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,030
Why did I

341
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,400
turn back into an adult?

342
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,070
I want to see the General.

343
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:39,679
It's...

344
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,550
So you've walked right into the trap,
haven't you?

345
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,510
Tell me,

346
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,230
with the Changfeng Army camp's
tight guards,

347
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,480
how did you escape?

348
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,360
Tell the truth.

349
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
So many people

350
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,210
couldn't keep an eye on one child?

351
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,740
That's your incompetence.

352
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,170
Where have you been

353
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,370
all night?

354
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,280
I went to search for my origins.

355
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,070
Isn't that what you want to know the most?

356
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,330
Did you find anything?

357
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,480
Since you ran away,

358
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,870
why did you come back?

359
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,640
I couldn't remember my past,

360
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,230
so I had nowhere to go.

361
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,400
Besides,

362
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,890
I only feel at ease

363
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,280
when I'm around you.

364
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,320
Kid,

365
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,550
speak properly.

366
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,950
I know this is a military camp

367
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,550
and you don't keep idlers.

368
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,110
I can be your soldier.

369
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,000
With those skinny arms and legs of yours?

370
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,710
You're no taller than a stump,

371
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,440
and you want to be a soldier?

372
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,760
That day in the forest,

373
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,240
you arrived late

374
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,440
and failed to protect her.

375
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,800
I was the one who saved the general.

376
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,590
That was...

377
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,230
just a lucky win.

378
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,590
You took advantage of the situation.

379
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,320
Besides,

380
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,920
if we hadn't arrived in time,

381
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,320
with your amateur skills,

382
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,120
could you have lasted that long?

383
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,510
So what?

384
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,500
It's enough that I can beat you.

385
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,590
You little brat,

386
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,480
you're asking for a beating.

387
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,050
If I beat him,

388
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,010
can I be your soldier?

389
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,590
Okay.

390
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,030
Excuse me.

391
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,740
You better keep your word.

392
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,760
Now that you're in the army,

393
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,920
you must

394
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,710
follow the rules from now on.

395
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,920
If you step out of line,

396
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,210
you'll face military punishment.

397
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,030
Ji Ran,

398
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,030
take him to register his name,

399
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,590
assign him a place to stay,

400
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,020
and issue his clothes.

401
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,440
Yes.

402
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,320
I don't know my name.

403
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,800
With your dirty looks and bare feet,

404
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,030
we'll just call you Cow Dung.

405
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,800
Cow Dung.

406
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,560
Call him Jin'an.

407
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,480
May our Taijin

408
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,020
enjoy lasting peace and prosperity.

409
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,880
I like this name.

410
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,070
General.

411
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,230
There's too much suspicion
surrounding this child.

412
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,670
Precisely because of that,

413
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,800
we should keep him where we can see him.

414
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,320
His fighting skills are impressive
and he's quite clever.

415
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,710
If we can verify his identity

416
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,970
and have him serve in our Changfeng Army,

417
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,920
it will be a huge boost for us.
