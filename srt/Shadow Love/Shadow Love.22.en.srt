00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,009
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,750
You're using the Li family to pressure me.

4
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,280
I dare not.

5
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,560
You don't know
the Crown Prince's whereabouts,

6
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,820
but you must know the man in black, right?

7
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,280
Who is he?

8
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,090
The man in black
comes and goes like the wind,

9
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,820
never revealing his true face.

10
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,630
How

11
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,020
would I know?

12
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,310
Such a clever tongue,

13
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,970
as if you really know nothing.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,280
The man in black
is very close to Li Shuang.

15
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,080
Now that he's committed murder,

16
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,580
I suspect

17
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,070
he's hiding right here
in the General's Residence.

18
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,130
It doesn't matter that the Crown Prince
and the General are not here.

19
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,930
I'll just have

20
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,150
everyone here

21
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,750
go to my residence for a visit.

22
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,480
Someone will talk eventually.

23
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,900
Take everyone from the General's Residence

24
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,030
and bring them back!

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,910
Yes!

26
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,370
I got five pieces in total,

27
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,079
three for Qiao and two for me.

28
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,630
They're so delicious.
I'm afraid there won't be enough.

29
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,230
Forget it.

30
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,770
I'll save them all for Qiao.

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,220
I'll just say I've eaten my share.

32
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,410
So lively?

33
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,490
What's happening?

34
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,000
It's so late at night.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,460
What trouble are they looking for
this time?

36
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,850
Qiao!

37
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,480
Take them away!

38
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,890
Actually, you don't need to do it.

39
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,400
I'm a doctor myself.

40
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,550
Your medicine isn't as good as mine.

41
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,920
If your skills aren't up to par,

42
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,160
it will leave scars.

43
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,910
General!

44
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,920
General!

45
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,840
Prince Li came
with a dagger granted by His Majesty,

46
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,280
leading a large group
to find the Crown Prince.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,030
He said

48
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,250
the man in black
is definitely connected to you,

49
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,980
and he took Qiao and the others.

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,329
Where is the Crown Prince?

51
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,240
He's hidden away.

52
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
He's safe for now.

53
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,800
You protect the Crown Prince,

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,860
and I'll save Qiao.

55
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,530
Don't worry.

56
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,550
I'll be fine.

57
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:00,860
Don't worry.

58
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,960
For what happened today,

59
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,780
I'll make sure you get an answer.

60
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,730
Please,

61
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,880
take good care of her for me.

62
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,320
Let's go.

63
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,120
Speak!

64
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,670
Will you speak or not?

65
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,630
Will you?

66
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,320
Speak!

67
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,710
Speak!

68
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,430
Hurry!

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,000
Go easy on them.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,400
Don't beat them to death.

71
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,800
When Li Shuang comes for them,

72
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,200
we'll need someone alive

73
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,900
so we can bargain with her.

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,190
Your Highness, you're overthinking it.

75
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,040
The General puts the greater good first.

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,560
How could she waver

77
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,000
over a few guards?

78
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,680
I just want her to know

79
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,090
that if she doesn't submit,

80
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,440
none of you will live.

81
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,920
In the future,
the whole country will be mine.

82
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,360
If she remains stubborn,

83
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,260
she'll meet the same fate.

84
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,200
His Majesty is in good health,

85
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,159
and the Crown Prince
is benevolent and virtuous.

86
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,360
No matter what,

87
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,750
the country

88
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,040
will never be yours.

89
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,910
Your Highness!

90
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,000
-Ling!
-Ling!

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,830
Don't move!

92
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,510
I admire that look in your eyes—

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,750
so fierce,

94
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,180
unafraid of death.

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,750
I heard your martial skills
are impressive.

96
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,480
If you're willing to follow me,

97
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,960
you won't have to suffer so much.

98
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,600
You locked us up here only to find out

99
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,260
the whereabouts of the man in black,
didn't you?

100
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,520
His martial skills are unmatched.

101
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,980
How could a mere guard like me
compare to him?

102
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,120
So you do know his whereabouts?

103
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,290
You harmed our people.

104
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,950
The Li family will pay you back double!

105
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,750
How dare you!

106
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,800
I came today

107
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,300
never expecting to leave alive.

108
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,930
I admire you even more now.

109
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,390
Trying to play the hero, are you?

110
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:33,950
Guards!

111
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,000
Cut the tendons in her hands!

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,680
Yes!

113
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,000
Qiao!

114
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,660
Qiao!

115
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,770
Where are you?

116
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,170
Qiao!

117
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,350
Qiao!

118
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,950
Where are you?

119
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,080
Could you be the famous man in black?

120
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,680
Go to hell!

121
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,159
Give me back Qiao!

122
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,410
So you're not him.

123
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,630
Your Highness, thank goodness you're safe.

124
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,430
Shuang.

125
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,270
I didn't expect Father to give

126
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,410
the national treasure dagger to Prince Li.

127
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,320
So what?

128
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,480
It's just an object.

129
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,050
Pull yourself together.

130
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,560
Don't overthink it when you don't know

131
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,760
the reason behind it.

132
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,289
My becoming Crown Prince

133
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,630
was suspicious from the start.

134
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,950
Thinking it over,

135
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,549
perhaps

136
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,750
I'm just a pawn Father uses

137
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,910
to balance Prince Li's faction.

138
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,940
Now that he's done with me,

139
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,940
I can be discarded.

140
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,270
But I acknowledge you.

141
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,770
I acknowledge you as the Crown Prince.

142
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,580
Your Highness,

143
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,960
forgive me for keeping you here
a while longer.

144
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,570
I've already notified the Changfeng Army

145
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,000
to come and protect you immediately.

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,400
Prince Li took my people.

147
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,020
I must go to his residence.

148
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,890
I'll go with you.

149
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,410
My empty title as Crown Prince

150
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,090
is still of some use.

151
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,700
Your Highness,

152
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,210
Prince Li's true target is you.

153
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,290
He took my people

154
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,790
just to show you his power.

155
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,670
If you go,

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,370
you'll be walking right into his trap.

157
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,430
I'm going this time

158
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,510
with nothing to do

159
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,510
with the Li family

160
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,710
or the Changfeng Army.

161
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,110

310
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,700
how dare you try to kill me?

311
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,030
Can you bear His Majesty's wrath?

312
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,870
You dared to attempt to assassinate
the Crown Prince.

313
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,600
Why wouldn't I dare to kill you?

314
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,940
I just killed a few servants.

315
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,960
Besides, they were insubordinate,

316
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,130
so they deserved to die.

317
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,660
To you, they were servants,

318
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,280
but to me,

319
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,520
they were family.

320
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,960
Today I dare to kill you,

321
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,840
and I'll take full responsibility!

322
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,960
Su Muyang cannot protect you.

323
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,760
He is already a man doomed to die.

324
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,160
It's not just me who wants him dead,

325
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,090
but also Father!

326
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,010
Back then,

327
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,820
Father suddenly arranged
a marriage for him

328
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,580
and made him Crown Prince.

329
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,800
Don't you find that strange?

330
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,070
That's because

331
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,230
Father is destined to face the calamity

332
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,360
of “Mars retrograding near Antares.”

333
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,450
Now, the day of reckoning is approaching.

334
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,000
The Crown Prince must offer his life
to Heaven

335
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,520
to change Father's fate
and avert disaster.

336
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,250
The 10th day of this month
is the day of reckoning.

337
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,820
The altar for sending the Crown Prince
to the afterlife

338
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,280
has been set up in Lucheng.

339
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,210
The Crown Prince came to Lucheng

340
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,340
to offer himself
as a sacrifice for Father.

341
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,400
By protecting him,

342
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,500
you're defying an imperial order.

343
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,640
You are the commander
of the Changfeng Army.

344
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
If you kill me,

345
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,310
the Li family will be guilty of treason.

was indeed rough.

00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,310
Their natures are similar.

378
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,070
Their habits make them different.

379
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,550
Their habits make them different.

Man at birth.

381
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,680
Human nature is inherently good.

382
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,860
The General treats me well,

383
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,390
so I must treat her well too.

384
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,310
Lucheng is unstable.

385
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,370
I'm willing to die in battle
for the General at any time.

What's your name?

387
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,460
You can call me Qiao.

388
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,310
Qiao?

389
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,680
Are you willing

390
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,010
to follow me from now on?

391
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,360
Will I get enough to eat?

392
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,280
General,

393
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,960
everything is ready.

394
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,510
Please allow us

395
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,090
to go with you

396
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,860
to send Qiao on her final journey.

[Tomb of My Old Friend Qiao]

398

Jin'an

399
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,130
is a wolf in sheep's clothing.

400
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,950
But he treats the General well,

401
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,030
so he's a good guy.

402
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:13,890
If one day

403
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,930
I should fall on the battlefield,

in the southeast corner

405

of the training ground

406
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,470
will be Jin'an's.

407
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,650
Qiao, you're so diligent,

408
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,340
never forgetting to practice.

409
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,140
Drops of water can form a river,

410
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,840
and grains of sand can build a tower.

411
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,500
When it comes to martial arts,

412
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,200
one cannot be careless.

413
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,220
These sparring partners of yours

414
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,630
look quite unique.

415
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,440
What's wrong with them?

416
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,770
Are they unhappy?

417
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,050
They'll all be knocked down by me,

418
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,510
so of course
they're not in the mood to smile.

419
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,610
Have you ever thought that

420
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,400
the reason they're called tumbler dolls

421
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,330
is that they can't be knocked down?

422
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,660
You need to use more force in your wrist.

423
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,420
I'm exhausted,

424
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,110
yet you remain so elegant.

425
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,380
I don't want to waste words with you.

426
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,410
From now on, this tumbler doll

427
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:46,140
will represent how satisfied I am
with your martial arts practice.

428
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,860
I'm already this tired.

429
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,820
Why won't you give me a smile?

430
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,770
I can't smile

431
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,930
at you.

432
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,050
You...

433
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,900
What are you looking at?
Get back to practice.

434
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,950
I'm done practicing.

435
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,670
Anyway,

436
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,210
you can't smile at me.

438
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,720
If you're not practicing,
put the stone weights back.

439
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
I can't lift them.

441
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,680
You must keep the General safe.

442
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,790

446
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,410
to leave the Changfeng Army camp.

General, please

450
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,690
allow Qiao and me to leave.

Please be kind

452
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,320

457
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,440
any other relatives?

the mountain paths are difficult,

463
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,550
and the Barren Forest
is full of yin energy.

464
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,480
Why are you here?

465
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,350

You've always treated her
as a sworn sister.

At this moment,

469
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,320
you must be in immense pain.

470
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,570
I blame myself for being incapable

471
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,810
of protecting her.

472
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,990
It happened so suddenly.

473
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,240
Your Highness,
you don't need to blame yourself.

474

Besides, Prince Li

476
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,810
as if His Majesty himself were present.

477
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,810
I could neither disobey His Majesty

478
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,680
nor dare to oppose his will

479
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,630

00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,410
Your Highness,

481
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,680
I am incompetent

482
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,220
and cannot protect you.

00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,040

00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,000
pack your things

00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,790
I know,

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,370
since I arrived in Lucheng,

489
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,640
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

490
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,160

do you want to

00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,409
though I have no power,

497
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,500
I still firmly hold my position
as Crown Prince.

00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,230
If Su Muli gives you a hard time,

499
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,679
I will fight with my life

to seek justice for you.

501
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,820

"Mars retrograding near Antares?"

503
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,989
I think I heard it

504
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,280
in the capital before.

505
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,110
It is a heavenly calamity

506
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,760
that requires a specific solution

507
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,630
to overcome it.

508
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,400
Haven't you always wondered

509
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,570
why 3 years ago
you were suddenly made Crown Prince

510
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:47,170
and married
to the Prime Minister's daughter?

511
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,530
That's right.

512
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,400
Your life

513
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,750
is the solution to this calamity.

514
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,230
Imperial orders cannot be disobeyed.

515
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,160
Forgive me for being incompetent.

516
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,980
That can't be true.

517
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,780
There must be another way.

518
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,760
You won't just give up on me!

519
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,650
And Jin'an—

520
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,230
he promised me.

521
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,570
That's right.

522
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,490
Previously,

523
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,930
he single-handedly

524
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,200
repelled the Yao Army,

525
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,670
causing a sensation throughout the court.

526
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,670
Even His Majesty

527
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,710
became interested.

528
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,280
-With the Changfeng Army as a shield,
-Your Highness...

529
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,190
Prince Li alone

530
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,250
is hardly a threat!

531
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,140
You knew?

532
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,730
Indeed.

533
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,440
I've long known

534
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,010
that Jin'an is the man in black.

535
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,290
I know you have a deep connection
with Jin'an.

536
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,960
As long as you ask him,

537
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,460
he will surely lend a hand.

538
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,220
Your Highness,

539
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,740
if the one who wanted you dead
were Prince Li,

540
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,660
there might still be room to maneuver.

541
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,440
But he is the Emperor of Taijin,

542
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,840
the reigning sovereign.

543
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,800
How can you expect the Li family

544
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,200
to defy imperial orders?

545
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,670
This matter has already implicated
too many people—

546
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,320
Lu Xin,

547
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,040
Qiao,

548
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,840
Nanxing.

549
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,790
I cannot cause more innocent people

550
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,630
to be caught up in this.

551
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,190
Caught up?

552
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,360
Whether you want it or not,
they will be caught up in it!

553
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,760
Su Muli never forgets a grudge,

554
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,650
and he suffered heavy losses
at your hands before.

555
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,450
How could he possibly let you go?

556
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,240
No.

557
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,840
You're not really concerned about
innocent people.

558
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,310
You just don't want Jin'an
to be implicated.

559
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,460
You're afraid his identity will be exposed

560
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,540
and cause trouble,

561
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,590
aren't you?

562
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,070
Shuang.

563
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,630

00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,190
Shuang.

00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,090
The person before you now

566
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,600
is neither the Crown Prince

567
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,470
nor the heir to the throne,

568
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,150
but Muyang, who grew up with you.

569
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,720
Please, save me.

570
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,520
We've been friends for many years.

571
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,280
But now

572
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,560
you would rather watch me

573
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,920
meet my death here,

574
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,840
just for that Jin'an?

575
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,530
Fine.

576
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,090
General, since you have made up your mind,

577
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,760
it would be awkward for me

578
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,320
to say anything more.

579
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,860
I remember when we were children,

580
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,400
you always protected me.

581
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,320
Your protection until now

582
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,260
has been enough.

583
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
Your Highness...

584
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,310
Mo Yin.

585
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:38,740
Have you ever experienced the pain
of losing loved ones?

586
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,440
I was thinking

587
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,600
if only I were a little stronger,

588
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,950
I could protect those around me

589
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,440
from being trampled.

590
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,580
Godfather...

591
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,790
Godfather.

592
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,150
Godfather.

593
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,190
Godfather!

594
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,640
Godfather!

595
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,510
Godfather!

596
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,300
No matter how strong you are,
it's useless.

597
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,590
You still can't withstand those
with malicious intentions

598
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,850
lurking in the shadows.
