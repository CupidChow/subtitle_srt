[Sixu Clinic]

4
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,710
Boss.

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,789
I've finished all the work.

6
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,710
Then I'll…

7
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,590
You can go.

8
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,350
Okay.

9
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,350
Wake me up tomorrow morning.

10
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:58,759
Got it.

11
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,410
Is it that hard to make it official?

12
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,140
Please, just go home already.

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,680
I have to get up early every day

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,470
to train at the General's Residence.

15
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,240
It's killing me already.

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,800
If Shuang finds out

17
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,560
you've been drinking at my place,

18
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,690
she'll probably make me train harder.

19
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,120
I'm feeling down

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,150
and want a drink

21
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,050
and a chat with my friend.
What's wrong with that?

22
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,290
If you don't tell and I don't tell,

23
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,350
how would she know?

24
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,230
Just don't tell her, simple as that.

25
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,350
Besides, Lu Xin,

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
when have I ever sold you out?

27
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,650
Don't you trust me?

28
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,030
It's not that.

29
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,150
I'm just curious—

30
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,420
do men care about titles too?

31
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,410
Men and women are equal, okay?

32
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,810
On this point,

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,520
I agree with Li Shuang.

34
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,280
You're desperate for a title.

35
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,430
Is it because the Crown Prince is coming

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,160
and you're feeling unsettled?

37
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,430
I do feel a bit uneasy.

38
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,970
But don't you think

39
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,410
since the Crown Prince betrayed her,

40
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,590
she should've…

41
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,960
let go of the past?

42
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,380
If romantic feelings

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,050
were so easy to let go of,

44
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,110
there wouldn't be

45
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,270
so many lovesick people in this world.

46
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,520
Stop drinking.

47
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,590
You don't need to be so pessimistic.

48
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,750
If you ask me,

49
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,520
you're not

50
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,380
much worse than the Crown Prince.

51
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,190
Really?

52
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,270
Really.

53
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,840
You're both grown men,

54
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,960
both young and handsome.

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
And besides, as you said,

56
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,750
all people are equal.

57
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,800
It's just that…

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,590
the Crown Prince and Shuang

59
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,750
share an irreplaceable past,

60
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,150
while you

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,710
don't even remember your own past.

62
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,940
That really is a shame.

63
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,390
Sometimes,

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,140
I want to tell her
about my past experiences,

65
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,900
but I don't know where to begin.

66
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,630
Have you ever thought

67
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,960
that perhaps you and Shuang

68
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,310
had met before?

69
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,950
A fleeting glance

70
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,190
in a vast crowd.

71
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,120
You and she are meant to be.

72
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,170
That's how it's written
in all the love stories.

73
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,930
Drink up.

74
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,040
Okay.

75
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,120
Years ago,

76
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,480
I heard about a method

77
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,150
to restore memories from folk tales,

78
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,150
but I've never tried it.

79
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,750
After all, patients like you

80
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,600
are too rare.

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,070
Hold on, Lu Xin,

82
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,800
what do you mean by that?

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,710
You want to use me
as your test subject again?

84
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,870
Have you forgotten
what happened to my beard last time?

85
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,070
What I gave you was just tonics
that were good for your health,

86
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,510
totally harmless.

87
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,750
Besides, I'm not giving you
any medicine this time.

88
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,890
How about this?

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
Why don't you tell me
more stories instead?

90
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,320
No more stories.

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,460
If you're not willing, forget it.

92
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,510
Perhaps one day you'll wake up

93
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,980
with your memories back.

94
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,480
Maybe tomorrow,

95
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,120
next year,

96
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
decades from now,

97
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,170
or centuries later.

98
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,159
Finish your drink and leave.

99
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,720
So what is this method?

100
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,800
Clear your mind of stray thoughts,

101
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,330
fix your eyes on it,

102
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,270
and imagine yourself

103
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,190
getting drowsier,

104
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,190
and drowsier,

105
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,710
and drowsier.

106
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,830
Well? Sleepy yet?

107
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,890
If you are, sleep.

108
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,720
Not at all.

109
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,250
Don't talk.

110
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,950
You'll get sleepy soon.

111
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,310
W-Wait a sec.

112
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,640
What is it?

113
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
Did you remember something?

114
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,310
Are you alright?

115
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,870
You can't hold your liquor at all.

116
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,270
It's so late.

117
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,640
Why are you still up?

118
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,530
I had a few drinks with you earlier

119
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,240
and then went out to sober up.

120
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,190
How come you were gone for 2 hours

121
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,750
and came back smelling even more of wine?

122
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,870
Is it that bad?

123
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,270
Lu Xin made me drink.

124
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,000
I refused at first.

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,360
I reminded her
that she had training tomorrow morning,

126
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,430
but she insisted I drink.

127
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,430
She said I looked upset

128
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,120
and offered to drink with me.

129
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,870
I said I really couldn't,

130
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,070
but she said I had to.

131
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:26,650
I...

132
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,700
I couldn't refuse her,

133
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,800
so I had a few drinks with her.

134
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,070
You nitpicked about my manners

135
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,030
in every way

136
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,680
and then went out drinking yourself.

137
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,360
How shameful.

138
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,240
As my teacher,

139
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,810
shouldn't you be setting an example?

140
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,560
Yes.

141
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,390
I was wrong.

142
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,950
As your teacher,

143
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,610
I should...

144
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,650
What did you say?

145
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,680
Mr. Jin'an,

146
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,580
am I serving you tea

147
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,770
in a proper manner?

148
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,360
It's proper.

149
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,840
Your request was sudden,

150
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,400
but the proper etiquette

151
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,750
must still be observed.

152
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,549
These 5 items

153
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,480
symbolize diligence in learning,

154
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,110
dedicated teaching,

155
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,680
good fortune,

156
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,130
success in examinations,

157
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,970
and perfection in virtue.

158
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,720
But I recall

159
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,630
that the traditional student's gifts

160
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,630
include 6 things.

161
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,550
Dried meat is too expensive.

162
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,350
All right.

163
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,630
You're not just an ordinary teacher to me,

164
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,870
so my gifts for you

165
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,970
cannot be ordinary either.

166
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,870
The Crown Prince is coming to Lucheng

167
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,070
to reward the troops.

168
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,910
I'll be busy for a while.

169
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,230
This bead contains my blood.

170
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,690
When I'm not around,

171
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,460
you can use it in emergencies.

172
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,520
Why did you hurt yourself again?

173
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,240
You've risked your life for me

174
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,670
so many times.

175
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,910
Compared to that,

176
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,420
this is nothing.

177
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,700
Your Highness,

178
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,030
the Crown Prince has entered Liangzhou.

179
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,890
He'll be in Lucheng within 2 days.

180
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,000
What's the situation

181
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,800
along the way?

182
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,150
All the prefectures

183
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,600
are loyal to Prince Li.

184
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,600
Even if the Crown Prince wants

185
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,060
to win them over, he can't.

186
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
But before he set off,

187
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,370
he met with Li Wei's son,

188
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:51,990
Li Ting.

189
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,270
I planned to let him off for the sake

190
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,110
of our brotherly bond,

191
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,970
but he just can't behave himself,

192
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,440
fixated on winning the Li family over.

193
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,390
If he had both the prime minister

194
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,500
and the Li family on his side,

195
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,700
he'd be unstoppable.

196
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,860
As long as he's breathing, he's a threat.

197
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,460
Our men are already in place,

198
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,380
waiting for your word.

199
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,720
Go tell them

200
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,070
to make it clean and quick.

201
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,620
Yes.

202
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,830
Don't blame me
for being a ruthless brother.

203
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,840
If you must blame someone,

204
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,600
blame yourself.

205
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,360
[Lucheng]

206
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,560
General,

207
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,150
the Crown Prince sent word earlier,

208
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,680
telling you to wait in camp.

209
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Why did you still come out to welcome him?

210
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,980
His Highness doesn't want to trouble us—

211
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,300
that is his kindness.

212
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,470
But if I hadn't come,

213
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,150
it'd be seen as disrespectful
to the future ruler.

214
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,810
But aren't you
and the Crown Prince old friends?

215
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why care so much about formalities?

216
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,420
Li Shuang, general of the Changfeng Army,

217
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,180
welcomes the Crown Prince.

218
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,030
Shuang,

219
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,120
didn't I tell you

220
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,040
to wait at your residence?

221
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,420
Why did you come all the way out here?

222
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,140
Get up.

223
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,660
Your Highness came from afar.

224
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,660
I had to welcome you personally,

225
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,270
or I'd be breaking protocol.

226
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,630
You've all waited long.

227
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,630
Soldiers,

228
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,200
your health comes first.

229
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,240
Please rise.

230
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,260
We'll set out at once.

231
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,940
Your Highness,

232
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,530
you've had a long journey.

233
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,780
Everything's arranged

234
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,910
at the post station.

235
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,110
Welcome the Crown Prince into the city!

236
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,940
Welcome the Crown Prince into the city!

237
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,400
Thank you
for being so considerate, General.

238
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,740
Protect His Highness!

239
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,940
Move!

240
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,070
Don't kill him!

241
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,240
If they're all dead,
how will we investigate later?

242
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,990
Shuang!

243
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,280
Your Highness!

244
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,950
Your Highness!

245
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,220
Your Highness!

246
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,180
Your Highness!

247
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,870
Send for the army physician.

248
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,670
Let's hurry to the post station.

249
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,390
We don't know who the assassins are.

250
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,600
The post station may not be safe.

251
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,680
Help His Highness onto the horse.

252
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,540
We're going back to my residence.

253
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,370
Your Highness,

254
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,790
we were eager to protect you

255
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,790
and acted rashly.

256
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,990
Please forgive us.

257
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,290
Lock down all information.

258
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,619
No one is to hear of this.

259
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:05,720
Yes.

260
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,890
You're hurt?

261
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,310
What happened?

262
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,530
I'll explain later.

263
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,210
I'll get His Highness treated first.

264
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,230
Though the wound is deep,

265
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,110
thankfully, it missed the vitals.

266
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,070
But you need proper rest and care

267
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,750
to completely recover.

268
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,000
You may leave.

269
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,260
Your Highness.

270
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,510
Shuang,

271
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,130
what are you doing?

272
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,500
I failed to protect you

273
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,730
and let you get injured.

274
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,230
Please punish me.

275
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,400
Why should I punish you?

276
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,050
Look, I'm right here in one piece.

277
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,400
Protecting you

278
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,880
is my duty,

279
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,480
but at that critical moment,

280
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,680
you saved me instead.

281
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,780
It was my fault that you got injured.

282
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
I owed you.

283
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,840
Of course I had to save you.

284
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,250
Your Highness.

285
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,650
These past 3 years,

286
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,260
have you been well?

287
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,530
Your Highness.

288
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,230
Thank you for your concern.

289
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,970
All is well…

290
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,720
in Lucheng.

291
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,400
Shuang,

292
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,110
it's just the two of us here.

293
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,910
Do you still need to be so formal?

294
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,310
You can push me away,

295
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,200
and I know the reason why.

296
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,270
But for these 3 years,

297
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,470
I've wanted to come to see you every day.

298
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,840
Yet I couldn't.

299
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,110
Your Highness,

300
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,040
walls have ears.

301
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,690
If someone overheard,

302
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,000
it could tarnish your reputation.

303
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,750
Earlier at your residence,

304
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,460
I saw a man.

305
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,960
As I recall, you've only ever kept

306
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,760
female attendants by your side.

307
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,690
Your Highness,

308
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,640
that man

309
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,510
once saved my life.

310
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,440
He had no family,

311
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,110
so I took him in

312
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,810
and gave him a job.

313
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,740
I've heard things have been
unstable along the border.

314
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,420
When it comes to household staff,

315
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,480
it's best to use people you know well.

316
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,590
Yes.

317
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Summon him.

318
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,470
I want to meet him.

319
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,640
Yes.

320
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,440
Shuang told me

321
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,600
she found you in the woods
and brought you back.

322
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,040
What were you doing

323
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,800
in the wilderness?

324
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
I was attacked

325
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,830
by a beast in the mountains

326
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,760
and blacked out.

327
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,030
People in Lucheng are kind and friendly.

328
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,890
I never thought

329
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,640
even the wild beasts here
were somewhat kind too.

330
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
It attacked you

331
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,010
but didn't eat you.

332
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,250
If Your Highness doubts me,

333
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,480
you can go into the mountains
and see for yourself.

334
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,030
Jin'an!

335
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,510
Don't talk nonsense.

336
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,590
Your Highness,

337
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,190
Jin'an hasn't been here for a long time

338
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,190
and hasn't learned proper manners.

339
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,070
It's fine.

340
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,490
Did you just say

341
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,610
his name is Jin'an?

342
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,240
Yes.

343
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,350
It means lasting peace
and prosperity in Taijin.

344
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,830
It's a good name.

345
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
You gave it to him?

346
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,680
Yes.

347
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,130
Since General Li has
high expectations for you,

348
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,730
you should behave yourself,

349
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,090
serve her diligently,

350
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,110
and learn a servant's manners
as soon as possible

351
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,180
so she won't be let down.

352
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,060
I'm afraid you've misunderstood.

353
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,920
I'm not a servant
who takes orders from just anyone.

354
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,110
General Li has served me tea
as my student.

355
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,890
I'm her exclusive personal teacher,

356
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,910
staying with her and teaching her

357
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,690
arts and etiquette.

358
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,340
Jin'an!

359
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,130
Your Highness,

360
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,880
Jin'an meant no offense.

361
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,040
Please forgive him.

362
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,570
You're still injured.

363
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,520
Get up.

364
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,720
We grew up together.

365
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,110
If he's your teacher,

366
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,510
then in my presence,

367
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,200
there's no need for such formalities.

368
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,720
Life in the army is dull and hard.

369
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,070
Music, chess, calligraphy, and painting

370
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,640
do help ease the boredom.

371
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,020
By the way, Shuang,

372
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,030
have you read the biographies

373
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,070
I sent you?

374
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,760
Your Highness, if there's nothing else,

375
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,290
I'll take General Li back
to dress her wounds.

376
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:55,470
You…

377
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,480
Shuang,

378
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,230
I know

379
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,880
you have feelings for me.

380
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,510
As long as you say yes,

381
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,370
I'll go to Father tomorrow
to revoke the decree

382
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,570
and cancel my engagement to the Ji girl.

383
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,680
Your Highness, don't come in.

384
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,960
It could stir gossip.

385
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,850
I've been

386
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,730
keeping this hairpin for you.

387
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,880
Now that Your Highness is getting married,

388
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,780
I should return it to you.

389
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,400
This hairpin

390
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,850
was left to me by my mother.

391
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,850
I gave it to you.

392
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,350
Do you still not understand?

393
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,220
Do you truly mean

394
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,780
to cut off all ties with me?

395
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,420
He is the Crown Prince.

396
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,590
You provoked him again and again.

397
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,920
If he's truly angered,

398
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,030
no one can protect you.

399
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,790
He caused you to get injured,
so he's at fault.

400
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,590
If you hadn't returned alive today,

401
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,250
then forget the Crown Prince—

402
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,120
I'd even destroy the entire Taijin court

403
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,310
to avenge you.

404
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,200
Jin'an!

405
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:23,960
I'm sorry.

406
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,220
I was just worried about you.

407
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,680
Don't ever say

408
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,070
such reckless things again.

409
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,680
Also,

410
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,610
during this period,

411
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,750
stay away from the Crown Prince

412
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,750
to avoid trouble.

413
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,050
I'm a general of Taijin.

414
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,030
My country, my family,

415
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,360
and the Changfeng Army—

416
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,350
I'll risk my life to protect them all.

417
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,790
Protecting the Crown Prince

418
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,960
is my duty as well.

419
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,930
You want to protect everyone,

420
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,890
but have you
thought about protecting yourself?

421
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,640
My life

422
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,350
belongs to Taijin and the Li family.

423
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,410
I'm ready to die at any time.

424
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,720
What about me?

425
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,590
There's a bond between us.

426
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,050
Have you thought about what I should do

427
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,000
if you die?

428
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,400
[General's Residence]

429
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,440
Your Highness,

430
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,830
everything has been taken care of.

431
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,830
Rest assured.

432
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,680
Is your injury serious?

433
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,870
It's nothing.

434
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,780
Your Highness,

435
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,530
Prince Li has always seen you
as a thorn in his side.

436
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,520
I never expected him
to be so bold this time.

437
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,110
You arrived in Lucheng
and were attacked right away.

438
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,640
In the capital,
bound by Father's authority,

439
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,200
he wouldn't dare go too far.

440
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,830
Now that I'm out here alone,

441
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,060
it's the perfect chance to strike.

442
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,830
I just didn't expect

443
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,790
he'd be so impatient

444
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,180
and dare to attempt
a brazen assassination.

445
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,730
I believe

446
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,760
the more impatient Prince Li is,

447
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,590
the more likely he'll trip himself up.

448
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,920
But there's one thing I don't understand:

449
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,590
Your Highness is of royal blood.

450
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,160
Not punishing General Li

451
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,360
is already showing her mercy.

452
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,290
Why did you take that blade for her?

453
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,670
It all started because of me.

454
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,720
I told Shuang not to come receive me

455
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,540
precisely because I didn't want her
to get hurt.

456
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,240
But she came anyway.

457
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,790
Three years ago,

458
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,680
I let her down.

459
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,470
Now that we've met again,

460
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,680
I can't let her get hurt for me again.

461
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,610
But Your Highness,

462
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,480
Prince Li is powerful
and well-connected now.

463
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,160
Your relationship with General Li

464
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,760
has long been a threat to him.

465
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,670
If…

466
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,120
General Li will surely
become your weakness.

467
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,030
To my brother,

468
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,270
my past, my present,

469
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,830
and everyone around me

470
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,610
are all my weaknesses.

471
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,250
So what is there to fear?

472
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,970
[Imperial Palace of Taijin]

473
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,100
Your Highness, please.

474
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,510
Father, you summoned me.

475
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,670
May I ask the reason?

476
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,450
Father, please don't be mad.

477
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,580
With heavenly tribulation imminent,

478
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,720
you actually tried
to assassinate the Crown Prince.

479
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,770
I knew nothing of the tribulation.

480
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,330
I only wanted to ease your burdens.

481
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,790
Please believe me.

482
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,100
You fool.

483
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,520
The sacrificial ritual has strict rules.

484
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,770
If he dies before the tribulation,

485
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,590
the formation will collapse.

486
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,550
I was ignorant.

487
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,470
I deserve nothing less than death.

488
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,920
I've always valued you,

489
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,430
but you're too impatient

490
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,330
and never learn caution.

491
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,780
How can I rely on you?

492
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,640
Father, you're visionary.

493
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,640
I will remember your teachings.

494
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,040
The Bureau of Astronomy reported

495
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,560
that Mars will soon appear near Antares.

496
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,570
Lucheng is the best site
for the sacrificial ritual.

497
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,370
I'll give you a chance
to make up for your mistake.

498
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,300
Set out at once for Lucheng
and assist in the ritual.

499
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,640
On the day of the tribulation,

500
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,010
bring the Crown Prince to the altar
and cut his heart out.

501
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,470
Then it's all done.

502
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,680
Remember—

503
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,750
until then,

504
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,580
there must not be the slightest mistake.

505
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,530
I will do my utmost.

506
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,020
But what if
the Crown Prince refuses to die

507
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,800
as a sacrifice?

508
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,840
You're his elder brother.

509
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,960
You'll have to give him a push.

510
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,710
I'm giving this dagger to you.

511
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,880
It carries my authority.

512
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,680
He dares not disobey.

513
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,970
Yes, Father.

514
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,850
He actually survived.

515
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,460
What incredible luck.

516
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,200
I heard he was slashed

517
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,070
and barely survived.

518
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,510
He truly has a fate strong enough
to take the tribulation.

519
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,770
I underestimated him.

520
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,240
So what should

521
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,580
we do next?

522
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,200
This brother of mine

523
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,450
appears gentle and modest

524
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,820
but is actually calculating,

525
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,590
always opposing me.

526
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,130
This trip to Lucheng—

527
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,880
we'll settle both old

528
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,130
and new scores.

529
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,240
Your Highness, now is the perfect time

530
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,350
to go to Lucheng.

531
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,740
Your Highness,

532
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,880
His Majesty's head eunuch, Jin Bao,

533
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,640
has been quite devoted to your cause.

534
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,300
He replaced the golden pills
with poison made from aconite,

535
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,300
and His Majesty never got suspicious
after taking it.

536
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,070
By the looks of things,

537
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,610
the day of a power shift is near.

538
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,500
Father's days must be numbered.

539
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,790
Otherwise, he wouldn't be

540
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,920
so desperate for a sacrifice
to extend his life.

541
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,680
I don't believe in astrology,

542
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,550
but just in case—

543
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,670
we absolutely cannot let the Crown Prince

544
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,740
actually die on the altar.

545
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,550
His Majesty definitely

546
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,630
has eyes and ears in Lucheng.

547
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,940
If we act too early, wouldn't it...

548
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,370
Do you think I haven't thought of that?

549
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,750
Su Muyang's life

550
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,090
can be spared until the day of the ritual.

551
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,290
Just kill him before he gets on the altar

552
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,310
and then throw his body up there.

553
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,350
By the time I return to the capital,

554
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,510
Father will have succumbed to the poison,

555
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,370
and I will be able to legitimately

556
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,310
ascend the throne.

557
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,350
To be the Crown Prince

558
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,220
has never been my goal.

559
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,680
If I'm to be anything,

560
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,920
I'll be the supreme one—

561
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,120
the ruler of the nation.

562
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,310
Attention!

563
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,410
His Majesty has spoken.

564
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,980
The Changfeng Army has guarded the border

565
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,510
and defeated enemies,
making outstanding military achievements.

566
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,240
His Majesty is greatly pleased

567
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,510
and is offering

568
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,690
the entire army treasures, fine silk,

569
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,690
and 100 jars of imperial wine

570
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,630
to reward your loyalty.

571
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,489
End of the proclamation.

572
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,739
The Changfeng Army thanks
His Majesty for his grace!

573
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,070
Long live the Emperor!
Long live the Crown Prince!

574
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,400
Long live the Emperor!
Long live the Crown Prince!

575
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,630
Long live the Emperor!
Long live the Crown Prince!

576
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,030
Long live the Emperor!
Long live the Crown Prince!

577
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,030
General is here.

578
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,480
General.

579
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,670
General, here's to you.

580
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,400
To you.

581
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,150
Drink up, brothers!

582
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,880
General, here's to you.

583
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,320
General.

584
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,440
Good wine! Fill my glass.

585
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:36,710
Drink up!

586
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,070
Fill it up!

587
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,630
Good wine! Drink!

588
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,150
Come on, fill it to the brim!

589
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,480
Cheers!

590
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,340
Come on, drink!

591
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,199
-General.
-General.

592
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,810
Drink to your heart's content!

593
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,590
Li Shuang of the Changfeng Army

594
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,050
requests an audience
with the Crown Prince.

595
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,490
Greetings, Your Highness.

596
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,110
Please rise.

597
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,730
There are no outsiders here.

598
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,390
No need for such formalities.

599
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,550
Shuang,

600
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,150
what brings you here?

601
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,440
Your Highness has not fully recovered

602
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,920
but personally rewarded the army.

603
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,970
It's truly a blessing
for the Changfeng Army.

604
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,820
I must thank you in person.

605
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,590
Also, this...

606
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,360
It's the finest wound salve,

607
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,120
a gift from a renowned
physician friend of mine.

608
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,050
It works wonders for sword wounds.

609
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,580
No wonder you're distant with me.

610
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,260
I've missed so much

611
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,630
of your life.

612
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,710
Three years have passed in a flash.

613
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,920
Here at the border,

614
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,680
you've made new friends.

615
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
I'm glad you have.

616
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Her name is Lu Xin.

617
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,760
She saved me when I was injured.

618
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,180
She's a close friend

619
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,110
to whom I'm indebted.

620
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,170
If you're willing,

621
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,510
tell me more, will you?

622
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
I've been fine

623
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,370
these 3 years at the border.

624
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,400
Besides Lu Xin,

625
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,110
I've made another friend

626
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,300
called Jin'an.

627
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,260
Though I found him and took him in,

628
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,690
he's saved me many times from danger.

629
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,360
He didn't mean
to offend Your Highness earlier.

630
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,320
I'm willing

631
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,010
to accept any punishment for him.

632
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
I've never cared much for etiquette.

633
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,830
Why would I hold it against him?

634
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,960
The more trustworthy
the people by your side,

635
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,320
the more at ease I can be.

636
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,260
Thank you for your understanding.

637
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,030
You haven't fully recovered yet.

638
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,160
You should head back and get some rest.

639
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,760
I still have
military matters to attend to.

640
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,100
I'll take my leave now.

641
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,470
Your Highness, it seems
General Li still cares about you.

642
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:12,130
Otherwise, she wouldn't have
come in person to give you the salve.

643
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,480
I'll certainly

644
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,670
be nice to her friends.

645
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,200
But seeing her so careful with me

646
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,110
makes me really sad.

647
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,330
Have you investigated

648
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,720
Jin'an's identity?

649
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,440
There's little information about him.

650
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,670
Nothing seems suspicious.

651
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,360
It's said that when General Li found him,

652
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,910
he had already suffered a head injury
and lost his memory.

653
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,500
Besides,

654
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,840
he was the one who killed Huo Du.
