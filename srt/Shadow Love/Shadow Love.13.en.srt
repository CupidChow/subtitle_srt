[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,970
[Episode 13]

3
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,190
If that's the case,

4
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,720
let's settle all accounts.

5
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,430
You've spoken inappropriately
to me multiple times.

6
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,760
What punishment do you think you deserve?

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,329
I was trying to save you,

8
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,890
and save myself as well.

9
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,960
But if you want to talk about
genuine feelings,

10
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,290
there were some as well.

11
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,440
What about just now?

12
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,360
Your wounds have clearly healed,

13
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,680
yet you still asked me

14
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,900
to feed you medicine.

15
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,920
Since I arrived at your residence,

16
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,650
I've rarely seen you so gentle.

17
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,710
So

18
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,310
I just got a bit carried away.

19
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,150
I originally wanted to
enjoy it for a few more days,

20
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,000
but

21
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,280
I couldn't bear

22
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,470
to see you

23
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,470
working so hard for me day and night.

24
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
You looked quite pretty that day

25
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,840
in that dancer's outfit.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,960
When will you

27
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,430
wear it for me again?

28
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,090
How dare you talk nonsense like that!

29
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:38,760
Shuang!

30
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,870
How is she?

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,800
How long have you been experiencing
these dizzy spells?

32
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,840
It's been a while.

33
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,640
I just didn't pay much attention to it.

34
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,180
You're suffering from melancholy,

35
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,750
combined with deficiency
in both qi and blood.

36
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,560
If this continues,

37
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,840
there will be serious consequences.

38
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,100
You really need to recuperate properly.

39
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,280
It can't be that serious.

40
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,480
I just need some rest.

41
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,750
You're always like this.

42
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,590
When your soldiers have
even the slightest ailment,

43
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,840
you're more concerned than anyone;

44
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,000
but when it comes to yourself,
you keep making all the excuses.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,430
This time, you were unconscious for a day,

46
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,480
and you were lucky it wasn't worse.

47
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,880
But what about next time?

48
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,190
Report, General.

49
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,190
We've received a message from the capital.

50
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,860
[To Li Shuang]

51
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,070
Look at the state you're in.

52
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,120
How can you read letters?

53
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,250
Don't read it. Rest.

54
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,160
A letter from the capital
must carry important business.

55
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,070
Don't be petulant.

56
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,070
Don't read it.

57
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,870
Give it to me, Lu Xin.

58
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,650
Don't be petulant.

59
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,240
Come on.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,159
Father writes that

61
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,070
His Majesty

62
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,130
has pardoned our Li family's crimes,

63
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,960
and Father has been reinstated
to his post.

64
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,170
That's great!

65
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,390
Cuiyun.

66
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,720
Make a run to the Changfeng Army

67
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,680
and deliver this news

68
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,800
to Qin Lan and Luo Teng.

69
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,430
Yes.

70
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,240
Now that peace has been restored

71
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,040
and everyone is happy,

72
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,300
you can finally breathe a sigh of relief.

73
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,740
Why not take this opportunity

74
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,160
to properly recover?

75
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,070
When you're feeling better,

76
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,070
we'll go to Cang Mountain together.

77
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,120
I know

78
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,010
a unique medicinal herb which grows there,

79
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,270
the dragon blood herb.

80
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,630
It's excellent for
replenishing blood and qi—

81
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,920
just right to help you recover.

82
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,780
Cang Mountain?

83
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,750
Cang Mountain is
a hundred li from Lucheng.

84
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm the General.

85
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,000
How can I abandon my post
without permission?

86
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,510
It's exactly because you are the General

87
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,920
that you must take care of yourself.

88
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,430
The Yao State has already
withdrawn their troops.

89
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,430
In the short term,

90
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,700
they won't wage war again.

91
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,030
So put your mind at ease.

92
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,230
But

93
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,870
there are still many important matters
in the camp that need my attention.

94
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,800
Those matters

95
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,800
can be handled by Qin Lan and Luo Teng.

96
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,950
Your top priority now

97
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,409
is to recover your health.

98
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,760
If your health fails,

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,680
who will lead the army in battle?

100
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,390
Besides,

101
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,650
didn't you just promise me

102
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,860
that you would
take better care of yourself?

103
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,500
What,

104
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,120
are you already going back on your word?

105
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,330
General.

106
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,600
This coachman looks a bit unfamiliar.

107
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,400
I just recently recruited him.

108
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,310
What,

109
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,790
Miss, you think I'm not reliable?

110
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,870
To be honest with you, Miss,

111
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,950
I know every inch of Lucheng

112
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,000
and all its roads, big or small,

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,159
like the back of my hand.

114
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,480
With me, Ouyang Jun, as your guide,

115
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,340
you can rest completely assured.

116
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,330
Ouyang Jun?

117
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,360
That name sounds

118
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,390
suspiciously boastful.

119
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,800
What was that?

120
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,220
I heard something like "full."

121
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,550
I mean full of yourself.

122
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,510
Well, thank you then.

123
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,480
By the way, General,

124
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,360
that wheel is broken.

125
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,159
I forgot to tell you.

126
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,750
We won't make it halfway
before it falls apart.

127
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,280
I think we should get it fixed
before leaving.

128
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,530
How long will that take?

129
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,860
Fixing it isn't the problem;

130
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,000
it's just we need to unload
the heavy stuff first,

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,930
otherwise it'll be hard to work on.

132
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,610
Go ahead and fix it.

133
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,960
Your surname?

134
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,650
None of your business.

135
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,430
Qiao will accompany me on this trip.

136
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,480
You all stay at the mansion.

137
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,190
If there's any urgent matter,
send a message by carrier pigeon.

138
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,040
Do not delay.

139
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,300
Don't worry, General.

140
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,360
Ouyang Jun, let's go.

141
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes.

142
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,920
Please go upstairs.

143
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,800
Private room guests have arrived!

144
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Please take care.

145
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,110
Honored guests, are you
looking for lodging?

146
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,510
Our inn has all kinds of rooms:

147
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,669
some with mountain views,
some with lake views,

148
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,909
others overlooking the street.

149
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,480
-Which kind would you prefer?
-Where are we?

150
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,340
Cangshan Town.

151
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,549
I want...

152
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,720
No matter where you are,

153
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,080
you should enjoy life.

154
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,930
You are the only person

155
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,730
in this world who truly matters to me.

156
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,150
I hope you can live a better life.

157
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,440
Give us the best rooms.

158
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,490
Certainly!

159
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,970
Please come in, everyone.

160
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,680
Lu Xin?

161
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,620
That really hurts.

162
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,670
Seems my efforts weren't wasted.

163
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,980
Someone has finally learned to enjoy life.

164
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,670
Well, someone told me that

165
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,790
occasional indulgence

166
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,630
can't really be considered wasteful.

167
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,320
Shuang,

168
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,270
since when have you been so willing
to spend money?

169
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,600
Is my room like this too?

170
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,390
This is our room.

171
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,270
Our?

172
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,750
I booked two rooms.

173
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,670
We have three men and three women,

174
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,670
so three people per room—

175
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,790
cozy but just right.

176
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,240
Money

177
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,030
should be

178
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,230
spent when necessary

179
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,670
and saved when possible.

180
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,300
What are you listening to?

181
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,480
You walk so quietly.

182
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,510
I don't think it's my light footsteps,

183
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,310
but rather your heavy thoughts.

184
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,330
Aren't you here to see Shuang?

185
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,390
Why don't you go in?

186
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,820
What are you doing?

187
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,150
Jin'an has something to tell you.

188
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,740
The carriage is ready.

189
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,910
We can leave

190
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,800
for Cang Mountain
early tomorrow morning.

191
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,680
Got it.

192
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,450
I'll be going then.

193
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,090
Wait.

194
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Qiao

195
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,910
bought a lot of candy.

196
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,970
We can't eat it all,

197
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,890
so take some back with you.

198
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Let me try a piece.

199
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,850
It'll be a waste if you try.

200
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,600
Thank you.

201
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,360
I thought

202
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,790
you bought this candy...

203
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,860
Just let me try some.

204
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,790
He's been standing at the door
for quite a while.

205
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,150
Are you asleep?

206
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,820
Yes, I am.

207
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,850
Then chat with me for a while.

208
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,910
What stage are

209
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,670
you and Jin'an at now?

210
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,970
What?

211
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,800
What do you mean by "what stage?"

212
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,920
You two are always flirting.

213
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,900
Do you really think I can't tell?

214
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,840
Actually, Jin'an

215
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,540
is quite nice.

216
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,510
He's handsome,

217
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,840
considerate,

218
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,570
and knows how to make you happy.

219
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,800
Back then, he risked his life
to take Li Zhangyi hostage.

220
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,800
It was to help you and the Changfeng Army
enter the city, right?

221
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,300
When you were unconscious,

222
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,440
he refused to eat or drink,

223
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,570
and stayed by your side for a whole day.

224
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,910
I've never seen a man

225
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,920
so completely devoted.

226
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,450
It's a shame though,

227
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,830
he's a bit weak.

228
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,720
Two punches and he'd be down.

229
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,220
If there's ever a real emergency,

230
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,850
he'd be useless for sure.

231
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,960
That man in black who appeared earlier,

232
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
what's your relationship with him?

233
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,150
Why do you want to know?

234
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,790
I heard that man in black

235
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,390
defeated the Yao Army and was unstoppable.

236
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,000
The people all say he's a great hero.

237
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,620
No wonder you can't decide.

238
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,390
Are you considering him as well?

239
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,720
You're getting more and more ridiculous.

240
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,630
Even if you don't think about him,

241
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,030
he might think about you.

242
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,750
If he only cared about fame and fortune,

243
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,000
why did he disappear

244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,480
as soon as the battle was over?

245
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,810
When it comes down to it,

246
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,960
it was just an act of a hero
coming to the aid of a damsel.

247
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,360
That's a headache.

248
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,140
One is handsome and considerate,

249
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,480
while the other is strong and brave.

250
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,080
How should you choose?

251
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,550
Just take them both.

252
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Nonsense.

253
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,200
Men can have multiple wives,

254
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,860
so why can't women do the same?

255
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,670
One could

256
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,840
accompany you on the battlefield,

257
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,390
while the other stays at home

258
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,240
for romance and pleasure.

259
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,480
Just imagine how wonderful that would be.

260
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,550
You'll truly be a pioneer among women

261
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,750
and a model for us all.

262
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,480
I know you have doubts about me.

263
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,290
But you're a good person.

264
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,960
And I really have no reason

265
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,150
to dislike you.

266
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,850
Have you forgotten

267
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,750
that I caused you to fall off that cliff?

268
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,080
I'll never forget that.

269
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,290
But there were reasons for it.

270
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,870
Besides, I'm

271
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,150
still alive, aren't I?

272
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,280
Stop pretending to be nice.

273
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,240
I know

274
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,390
when I was imprisoned,

275
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,160
you went to see the General
to plead for me,

276
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,820
and that's why I was pardoned.

277
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,360
You did that just to win me over.

278
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,620
I won't be indebted to you.

279
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,600
Do you think

280
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:37,960
everyone will fall for

281
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,660
your cold and aloof act?

282
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,610
Let me tell you,

283
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,750
I helped you for no other reason

284
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,090
than Lu Xin.

285
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,550
Miss Lu?

286
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,670
If Lu Xin hadn't pleaded for you,

287
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,840
you'd probably

288
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,370
still be rotting in prison.

289
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,570
A girl

290
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,980
lowers her pride

291
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,210
and devotes herself entirely to you,

292
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
and what do you do?

293
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,870
You just sulk all day,

294
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,130
showing no gratitude,

295
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,950
and treating her with contempt.

296
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,310
The falling flower may have feelings,

297
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,950
but the flowing water is indifferent.

298
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,650
If she continues to pursue me like this,

299
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,900
she'll only get hurt.

300
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,880
That may be true,

301
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,970
but you don't have to be so cold.

302
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,320
You can be nicer

303
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,410
and still make your point.

304
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,030
Though the world is vast,

305
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,980
this dragon blood herb

306
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,620
is a miraculous medicine
that only grows on Cang Mountain.

307
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,210
Even in
the prosperous and magnificent Yunjing,

308
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,190
it's nearly impossible to find.

309
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,280
What's so special about it?

310
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,960
Is it the Supreme Lord's
Golden Elixir?

311
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,020
If that's the case,

312
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,550
our quest for this medicine

313
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,010
seems quite challenging.

314
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,080
We came here

315
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,370
fully prepared for a difficult journey.

316
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,200
At worst,

317
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,060
we'll just have to put in more effort.

318
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,520
We'll find it eventually.

319
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

320
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,329
your noodles are ready.

321
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,400
Let me.

322
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,220
Careful, it's hot.

323
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,430
Sir,

324
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,000
do you know

325
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,099
how long it takes from here

326
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,099
to Cang Mountain?

327
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,200
Are you folks heading to Cang Mountain?

328
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,070
Could it be for

329
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,330
the dragon blood herb?

330
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
You know about the dragon blood herb too?

331
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,110
Around here,

332
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,550
every household grows it.

333
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,030
We have as much as you want.

334
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
There's even some under your table.

335
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,870
So...

336
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,220
So beautiful.

337
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
Your arms must be tired.

338
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,400
Put it down now.

339
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,270
Why give me that face?

340
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,460
I did say this herb
grows exclusively on Cang Mountain,

341
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,260
but I never said it's rare.

342
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,440
There's plenty indeed.

343
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,680
Never mind.

344
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,340
At least we've found what we came for.

345
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,210
Let's buy some

346
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,550
and take it back to Lucheng.

347
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,510
That won't do.

348
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,350
Although this herb is very potent,

349
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,980
its effectiveness
depends entirely on freshness.

350
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,760
Once picked for more than half a day,

351
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,590
it becomes no better than dried grass.

352
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,400
So it must be consumed fresh on the spot,

353
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,880
and it needs to be taken
for at least three days

354
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,000
to be effective.

355
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,010
This young lady really knows her stuff.

356
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,030
The ones under your table

357
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,960
are quite fresh.

358
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,530
You've said enough.

359
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,860
You may get back to work.

360
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,680
Health comes first.

361
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,030
Since we're already here,

362
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,490
let's follow Lu Xin's advice

363
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,020
and stay for a few more days.

364
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,320
I suppose that's the only choice.

365
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,030
Hey, Missy.

366
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,190
Wait for me.

367
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,110
Missy, let's take a break.

368
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,970
We've been walking for two hours.

369
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:15,970
Missy!

370
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,830
Wait up.

371
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,090
You're walking too fast. I can't keep up.

372
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,400
You're weak.

373
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,460
Don't hold me back.

374
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,840
This poor girl,

375
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,110
selling herself to save her mother.

376
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,310
She really is.

377
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,680
How pitiful.

378
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,150
This girl is truly unfortunate.

379
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,640
What do you want to do?

380
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,440
Help her.

381
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,440
Why?

382
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,460
I've seen this kind of act
too many times.

383
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,260
It's all fake,

384
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,660
just some old tricks we've used ourselves.

385
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
Don't believe it.

386
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,070
Let go.

387
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,850
I'm telling the truth.

388
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,650
Don't be rash.

389
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,310
Take this money.

390
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,180
Go home and get treatment for your mother.

391
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,400
May I ask your name, Miss?

392
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,030
I'm willing to serve you in any way

393
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,580
to repay your grand gesture.

394
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,640
No need to repay me.

395
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,620
Once the illness is cured,

396
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,950
just eat well

397
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,380
and live a good life.

398
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,440
What a kind person!

399
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,140
Thank you, benefactor! Thank you!

400
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,480
This girl.

401
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,170
Even more stubborn than a mule.

402
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,160
So many people.

403
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,640
How lively.

404
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,680
Everyone!

405
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,160
Our tavern has been open
for five years now,

406
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,170
and thanks to your patronage,
business is booming.

407
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,070
Today,

408
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,310
we're holding a wine-drinking competition.

409
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,920
Anyone

410
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,000
who participates

411
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,680
will get 30% off their meal.

412
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,160
Great! Great!

413
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,680
And the winner

414
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,410
can eat for free!

415
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,960
Great! Great!

416
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,510
Would any

417
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,160
of our guests like to
join the competition?

418
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,790
I'll do it!

419
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,830
Me!

420
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,220
Any other guests willing to compete?

421
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,070
Let's go join the competition too.

422
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,840
You can drink?

423
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,600
I can't,

424
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,480
but you can.

425
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,960
Didn't the owner say

426
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,110
just participating can get us 30% off?

427
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,960
Alcohol is bad for your health.

428
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,720
Don't go.

429
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,980
That's because you don't know
how much Shuang can drink.

430
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,180
She knows her limits.

431
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,270
I know my limits.

432
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,440
A young lady is participating too!

433
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,370
Please. Please.

434
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,670
She really knows her limits.

435
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,460
Right?

436
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,530
What?

437
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,640
Nothing.

438
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,610
Let's have a drink.

439
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,600
Everyone!

440
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,880
Let the competition

441
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,550
begin!

442
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,110
Great! Great!

443
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,310
Drink! Drink!

444
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,830
Stop drinking
if you can't take it anymore.

445
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,680
Don't fuss.

446
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,870
Drink up!

447
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,830
That's about enough. They're all...

448
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,080
Well done!

449
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,590
Nice!

450
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,630
Everyone!

451
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,030
I declare

452
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,400
tonight's winner

453
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,590
is this young lady!

454
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,920
Nice! Well done!

455
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,430
Everyone!

456
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,110
Thanks to the owner's generosity

457
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,310
for waiving my bill.

458
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
Everyone's drinks tonight

459
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,220
are on me.

460
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,930
Great! Great!

461
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,980
She's had too much to drink.

462
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,090
Let's go.

463
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,510
Let's go dancing too.

464
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,250

when you're drunk.

491
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,290
I'm giving you a chance
to redeem yourself.

492
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,610
The Changfeng Army

493
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,300
is in need of talent right now.

494
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,760
Your martial skills are impressive.

495
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,650
Why not stay

496
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,380
and do something meaningful
for your country and people?

497
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,730
Your men

498
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,110
could also stay in the camp

499
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,400
and have proper jobs.

500
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,950
Lady Li.

501
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,990
Here.

502
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,820
You've impressed me once again today.

503
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,340
Cheers.

504
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,170
Cheers.

505
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,640
Lady Li.

506
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,760
I don't mean to gossip,

507
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,730
but has Miss Qiao

508
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,380
always been this stubborn?

509
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,270
Today at the market,

510
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,880
we met someone selling herself
for her mother's burial fee.

511
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,270
I told her it was a scam,

512
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,270
but she...

513
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,440
But she wouldn't believe it.

514
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,080
Exactly.

515
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,150
She emptied her money pouch for that girl.

516
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,400
I checked afterward,

517
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,350
and that woman

518
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,820
specifically targets passersby.

519
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,210
Even those egging her on nearby

520
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,340
was part of the scam.

521
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,270
Qiao is the type

522
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,320
who appears tough

523
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,610
but has a soft heart.

524
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,820
Do you know

525
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,370
how she entered my General's Residence?

526
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,960
Stop hitting her!

527
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,890
She'll die if you keep going at her!

528
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,190
Stop!

529
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,430
Stop!

530
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,750
Get up.

531
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,660
Come on.

532
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,920
Or she'll really be beaten to death.

533
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,550
Indeed.

534
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,380
Beating a defenseless woman

535
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,860
in broad daylight.

536
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,040
What kind of crime is this!

537
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,720
My Lord,

538
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,640
but we paid for this.

539
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,390
One is willing to beat,
the other willing to take it—

540
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,790
what crime is there in it?

541
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,850
That's right.

542
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,920
She voluntarily signed

543
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,780
this life-and-death agreement.

544
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,160
My Lord,

545
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,860
don't blame them.

546
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,300
They paid to hit me.

547
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,350
This is a business transaction.

548
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,260
These ropes

549
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,680
were also tied by myself.

550
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,550
If you pay,

551
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,610
you can beat me too.

552
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,730
What kind of business is this?

553
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,640
This...

554
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,420
-Thank you, My Lord.
-Thank you, My Lord.

555
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,860
Make way. Move.

556
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,350
Break it up.

557
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,240
Let's go.

558
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,680
Do you want me to take you to a doctor?

559
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,210
Are you hurt anywhere else?

560
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,660
I'm alright,

561
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,280
My Lord.

562
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,010
Why are you in this kind of business?

563
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,120
Their lives are hard,

564
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,160
and they're full of anger,

565
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,230
so they need someone to take it out on.

566
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,020
I've trained in martial arts
since childhood.

567
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,140
I can take a beating.

568
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,080
I see there are

569
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,830
many shops hiring assistants in town.

570
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,560
Why don't you try that instead?

571
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,880
I did.

572
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,400
They

573
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,150
complained about how much I eat,

574
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,480
and after just a few days,

575
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,720
they kicked me out.

576
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,440
What about your family?

577
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,210
Why don't they care about you?

578
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,440
They died

579
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,640
in the war.

580
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,980
What's your name?

581
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,700
You can call me Qiao, My Lord.

582
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,200
Qiao,

583
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,480
would you like to

584
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,410
come work for me?

585
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,880
Will I get enough to eat?

586
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,600
So this girl Qiao

587
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,080
has had a hard life too.

588
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,030
Qiao is just

589
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,160
this kind of person.

590
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,300
She'd rather be deceived herself

591
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,020
than have one more person

592
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,440
in this world suffer like she has.

593
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,750
I was wrong.

594
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,220
It won't happen again.

595
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,680
Cheers.

596
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,490
Bottoms up.

597
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,270
Miss. Miss.

598
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,960
Come dance with us!

599
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,790
Let's dance!

600
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,660
Why are you here?

601
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,890
Is this a good time?

602
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,830
Of course it is.

603
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,310
No, it's not.

604
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,790
Our General needs to rest.

605
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,050
You seem well-fed.

606
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,570
I noticed you were just drinking earlier

607
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,970
and barely ate anything.

608
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,400
Try some.

609
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,620
It smells wonderful.

610
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,850
Careful, it's hot.

611
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,030
Smell it. Doesn't it smell great?

612
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,270
-I can't take it anymore.
-Doesn't it smell great?

613
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,530
General, I'm too full.

614
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,440
The smell makes me feel like vomiting.

615
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,170
I'll go outside to digest a bit.

616
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,440
Is it really that bad?

617
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,540
Why did she leave?

618
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,110
Perhaps

619
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,730
she went to find more food.

620
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,230
Come on, have a try.

621
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
It tastes so good.

622
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,320
Really good.

623
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,850
Why aren't you eating?

624
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,310
Have some yourself, too.

625
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,080
Eat.

626
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,170
It's good.

627
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,170
Have another one.

628
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,160
You eat it.

629
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,790
I have something for you.

630
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:01,240
"The Tale of Mr. Bat."

631
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,390
Let me.

632
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
I've wanted to give this to you
for a while,

633
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,110
but

634
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,310
I never had the time.

635
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,210
Since we'll be staying here
for a few more days,

636
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,240
reading some books

637
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,640
might help pass the time.

638
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,580
Why does this

639
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,730
look different from what I usually read?

640
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,220
The paintings on this

641
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,740
are much more detailed.

642
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,660
Look,

643
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,440
what's this?

644
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,200
The original ending for Mr. Bat

645
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,270
was too tragic.

646
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,470
So I wrote my own version.

647
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,940
Although the story

648
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,110
isn't as dramatic as the original,

649
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,920
at least

650
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
everyone gets a happy ending.

651
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,960
When you read it,

652
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,960
you won't feel so sad.

653
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,840
You know what?

654
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,200
In this world,

655
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,660
how can everything go as one wishes?

656
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,440
Things that are already destined

657
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,540
should

658
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,600
not be forced.

659
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,550
But I believe

660
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,610
we make our own fate.

661
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,880
As long as you're determined,

662
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,080
you can definitely change the outcome.

663
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,670
Thank you.

664
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,920
No need to be so formal with me.

665
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,630
No,

666
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,230
it's not about Mr. Bat.

667
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,070
There are many things

668
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,230
I need to thank you for.

669
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,350
If it weren't for you,

670
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,699
how could the countless soldiers
and civilians of Lucheng

671
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,570
enjoy today's peace?

672
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
But there's one thing.

673
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,710
I'm afraid the matter of the man in black

674
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,310
can't be kept secret any longer.

675
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,030
But don't worry.

676
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,590
Although I've reported everything
truthfully,

677
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,360
I

678
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,870
didn't reveal your true identity.

679
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,110
I understand.

680
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,010
The higher you rise,
the more attention you attract.

681
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,610
You're trying to protect me.

682
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,420
But this way,

683
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,120
all your military merits and salary

684
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,550
will be gone.

685
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,110
This is

686
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,780
really unfair to you.

687
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,700
In that case,

688
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,180
I really am at a big disadvantage, right?

689
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,840
But don't worry,

690
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,970
I'll take care of it.

691
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,800
Just think about what you want.

692
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,590
Other than promotions and titles,

693
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,590
I'll give you

694
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,930
anything else you want.

695
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,680
My greatest wish

696
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,630
is to stay by your side forever.

697
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,880
Listen.

698
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,900
Things that have already come true

699
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,380
don't count as wishes anymore.

700
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,810
Think of another one.

701
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,490
If I must make a wish,

702
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,650
I hope that you,
who are invincible on the battlefield,

703
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,560
after leaving the battlefield,

704
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,670
could be like an ordinary woman—

705
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,800
someone who can feel fear,

706
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,280
hunger,

707
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,730
and cold;

708
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,500
someone who needs warmth

709
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,070
and protection from others.

710
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,230
General?

711
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,360
Gen...

712
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,190
Shuang.

713
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,390
Shuang.

714
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,150
Did you call me?

715
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,350
Shall we drink?

716
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,090
Let's drink!

717
00:37:59,090 --> 00:37:59,740
Come on,

718
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,230
let's go get a drink.

719
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,690
Let's go

720
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,420
get a drink.

721
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,280
Let's go for a drink.

722
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,800
Come on.

723
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:04,760
Let's go.
