00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,910
[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,950
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,039
Attention, all forces!

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,479
March to Ninglan!

5
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,590
Destroy the Yao Army!

6
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,759
Destroy the Yao Army!

7
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,560
-Kill them!
-Kill them!

8
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,870
Ninglan's fortifications are solid,

9
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,200
which puts us at a disadvantage.

10
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,600
To minimize casualties,

11
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,470
we need to be strategic.

12
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,400
Inside Ninglan,

13
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,590
there is a secret tunnel
connecting the inside and outside,

14
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,560
enough for an elite unit to slip through.

15
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,590
To take Ninglan by surprise,

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,670
we'll split into three forces,

17
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,200
attacking from inside and outside
together.

18
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,840
Notify Qin Lan

19
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,040
to lead an elite squad

20
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,800
to the south gate
at 7 PM to challenge them.

21
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,520
Luo Teng, Lyu Yi, Qin Wu—

22
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,030
each of you will take a squad to wait

23
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,230
in the forests by the other three gates.

24
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,190
Prepare torches and horses.

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,120
I'll lead an elite squad

26
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,870
through the secret tunnel

27
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,750
into Ninglan.

28
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,910
Though the Yao Army is large,

29
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,160
their elites are few.

30
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,000
Liu Yun certainly won't position

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,560
all his main forces at the north gate.

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,280
So in this battle, General,

33
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,080
you're going to win by strategy.

34
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,280
When Qin Lan challenges them
at the south gate at 7 PM,

35
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,740
the Yao Army will think our forces
are too few

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,240
and open the gate to fight.

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,030
Open the gate!

38
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,800
Fight!

39
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,400
[Ninglan]

40
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,860
Yes!

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,870
Tell Qin Lan to light the signal flare

42
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,710
once they open the gate.

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,590
At the sight of the flare,

44
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,960
the three forces in the three forests
outside the city will light torches

45
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,120
and run horses
to create commotion immediately,

46
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,180
making it appear
as if tens of thousands are attacking.

47
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,630
Move out.

48
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:34,910
Charge!

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,870
The elite squad inside the city

50
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,329
will strike the south gate
at the same time,

51
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,190
creating an inside-out assault.

52
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,590
The Yao Army

53
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,710
will certainly fall into chaos,

54
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,490
and we

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,030
will take Ninglan in one decisive move.

56
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,680
My Lord!

57
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,000
My Lord!

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,750
My Lord,

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,460
My Lord,

60
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,280
the Taijin Army

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,560
is attacking from the east!

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,430
My Lord!

63
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,840
My Lord,

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,960
the west is in danger!

65
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,120
There might be tens of thousands
of enemies outside the walls!

66
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,960
My Lord!

67
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,840
My Lord!

68
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,360
There are even more in the north!

69
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,150
Right now,
our soldiers' morale is unstable.

70
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,240
My Lord, please decide

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,000
how we should defend as soon as possible!

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,030
This can't be.

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,510
How many men do they have exactly?

74
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,480
It looks like

75
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,720
there are

76
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,510
around 45,000 men in total, I'm afraid.

77
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,310
My Lord!

78
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,430
My Lord, bad news!

79
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,190
An elite squad of Taijin Army
appeared in the city

80
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,480
and is heading this way. How many?

81
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,270
How many men do they have?

82
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm afraid there are hundreds of them—

83
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,270
no,

84
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,560
thousands!

85
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,490
Close the city gate!

86
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,870
Let's eliminate the enemies
inside the city first!

87
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,360
But My Lord,

88
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,560
our main forces
are still outside the city!

89
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,690
Close the city gate!

90
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
General!

91
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,159
The commander of the Taijin Army,
Li Shuang,

92
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,240
is personally leading 10,000 troops

93
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,600
to attack Ninglan!

94
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,800
The man in black,

95
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
capable of killing a hundred
single-handedly,

96
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,190
is unstoppable.

97
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,120
But once he's separated from Li Shuang,

98
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,240
his power

99
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,870
loses its source

100
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,200
and can't be sustained.

101
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,120
If this drags on,

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,270
that power

103
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,720
will gradually fade

104
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
until it disappears completely.

105
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
So you're saying,

106
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,870
if we can find a way to separate them,

107
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,330
our army can turn the tide?

108
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,270
If Ninglan falls,

109
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,070
Li Shuang

110
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,830
will be stretched too thin.

111
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,630
Then the man in black

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,240
will have to

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
fight alone, won't he?

114
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,480
Of course,

115
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,270
you understand military strategy

116
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,000
better than I do.

117
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,480
Right?

118
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,920
Just one thing:

119
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,800
he must not die,

120
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,800
and no one can know that he's alive.

121
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,190
General,

122
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,440
everything has gone as you predicted.

123
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,240
Li Shuang couldn't hold back

124
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
and recklessly redeployed troops.

125
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,360
Now

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,160
is the perfect time for us
to launch a counterattack

127
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,480
and take Lucheng.

128
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,900
Give the order.

129
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,600
Attack.

130
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,510
Attack.

131
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,330
It seems

132
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,500
I've underestimated you.

133
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,280
It must have taken you effort
to pull off such a lousy act.

134
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,610
Counsellor, you really

135
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,440
went to some trouble courting death.

136
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,830
You knew it was a trap.

137
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,800
If you weren't desperate,

138
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,430
you wouldn't have come alone.

139
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,390
To kill you,

140
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,070
I alone am enough.

141
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,610
I have tens of thousands of troops here.

142
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,810
Can you kill them all?

143
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,920
Kill!

144
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,550
Kill!

145
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,669
Kill.

146
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,080

193
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,240
General!

194
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,910
The Yao Army has surrendered completely.

195
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,510
We've won

196
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,040
a decisive victory!

197
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,030
Bravo! Bravo!

198
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,910
Luo Teng,

199
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,360
stay here to guard the city,

200
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,480
handle the aftermath
and treat the wounded.

201
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,050
Yes.

202
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,150
Qin Lan,

203
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,200
take the supplies

204
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,000
and return to Lucheng immediately.

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,480
Yes.

206
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,670
Notify the female spies in Lucheng

207
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,070
to prepare everything.

208
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,080
Jin'an,

209
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,140
you must hold on.

210
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,080
Today we captured the man in black alive.

211
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,150
Lucheng is now within our grasp.

212
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,790
This is a great victory.

213
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,440
Everyone,

214
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,720
let's celebrate!

215
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,670
Counsellor, your plan was brilliant!

216
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,270
Cheers!

217
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,150
Cheers!

218
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,480
Come on!

219
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,540
Drink up!

220
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,960
Come here.

221
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,430
Greetings, My Lord.

222
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,860
Spare me, My Lord!

223
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,910
-What a beauty.
-Please spare my life!

224
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,040
Can you use a dagger?

225
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,080
No worries.

226
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,910
Today,

227
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,470
I'll teach you how to use one properly.

228
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,710
Here.

229
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,450
See that man?

230
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,200
Use this dagger

231
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,050
to stab him hard.

232
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,670
One stab,

233
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,070
and you'll be rewarded with 10,000 coins.

234
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,120
If you refuse,

235
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
the one who gets stabbed will be you.

236
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,770
Kill him!

237
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,330
Kill him!

238
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,240
Go!

239
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,550
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

240
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,030
Do it!

241
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,790
Hurry up!

242
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,670
Kill him!

243
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,270
Kill him!

244
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,000
The once-arrogant man in black

245
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,910
is now being tortured by a dancing girl.

246
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,000
How utterly ridiculous!

247
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,450
Reward her!

248
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Well done!

249
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,310
Well done!

250
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,240
Servants! Bring her reward!

251
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,000
Assassin!

252
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,400
Protect the Counsellor!

253
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,760
I am Li Shuang of the Changfeng Army.

254
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,890
Who dares approach?

255
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,830
I have tens of thousands of troops here.

256
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,860
If you kill me, how do you think

257
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,230
you'll escape the camp?

258
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,620
General...

259
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,830
General Li, spare me!

260
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,670
General Li...

261
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,230
After her!

262
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:07,620
Go!

263
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,970
Kill!

264
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,590
Jin'an!

265
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,920
How are you feeling?

266
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,410
I'm so tired.

267
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,830
I don't think I can walk anymore.

268
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,860
They're catching up to us.

269
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,030
You go first.

270
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,550
Didn't you say

271
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,790
our lives are bound together?

272
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,100
How could I leave you behind?

273
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,340
But they're closing in.

274
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,160
Wait for me.

275
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,750
General!

276
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,450
We're here!

277
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,840
Protect the General!

278
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,230
Attack!

279
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,130
Your Highness,

280
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
please calm down.

281
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,920
I have failed you.

282
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,550
A tiny city like Lucheng

283
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,540
has cost us several of our best generals.

284
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,720
A battle we were sure to win

285
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,930
was completely lost
because of that shadow puppet.

286
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,850
You think saying you've failed me

287
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,880
is enough to cover this up?

288
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,680
Your Highness,

289
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
the jade Linglong

290
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,760
inside the shadow puppet

291
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,820
has merged with the blood master.

292
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,400
Its power is not to be underestimated

293
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,960
and is very difficult to deal with.

294
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,290
Difficult to deal with?

295
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,410
If it were easy,
what would I need you for?

296
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,890
I don't care what methods you use.

297
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,440
I want you to bring him back alive

298
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,580
at any cost!

299
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,000
As you command.

300
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,630
Today, I was supposed to give you
the antidote

301
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,430
to the Brain-Devouring Powder.

302
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
But you're too useless.

303
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,960
No wonder Wuling Mountain threw you out.

304
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,330
Today is just a minor punishment
to teach you a lesson.

305
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,010
From now on,

306
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,880
I don't want to hear you say

307
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,960
"difficult to deal with" again.

308
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,640
Okay.

309
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,830
This half dose of antidote

310
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,420
is enough to keep you alive.

311
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,790
However,

312
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,600
you'll inevitably taste the agony
of thousands of insects eating your brain.

313
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,950
I'm curious whether,

314
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,350
given your great powers,

315
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,180
you can survive it.

316
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,370
Thank you for the antidote, Your Highness.

317
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,850
[General's Residence]

318
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,990
Your Majesty,

319
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,960
there's an urgent report from Lucheng.

320
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,440
Li Shuang, General Zhenbei,

321
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,480
led the Changfeng Army

322
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,010
and defeated 50,000 soldiers
of the Yao Army.

323
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,380
Take a look.

324
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,240
This Li Zhangyi.

325
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,100
He actually committed such an act,
bringing harm to our country.

326
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,510
I failed to judge him correctly.

327
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,880
Father, please punish me.

328
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,020
You were the one
who strongly recommended him

329
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,510
as the military supervisor.

330
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,480
Now he has caused such a calamity.

331
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,340
How do you think

332
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,540
we should handle him?

333
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,060
Li Zhangyi, as an imperial official,

334
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,400
succumbed to lust and abused his power,

335
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,000
nearly committing treason.

336
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,920
I believe

337
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,880
he should be dismissed and investigated,
never reinstated,

338
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,350
with his family exiled to Yaizhou,

339
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,550
to uphold the proper conduct of Taijin.

340
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,590
He is your right-hand man.

341
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,310
Are you willing to let him go?

342
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,440
Everyone at court serves you, Father.

343
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,840
Like them, I only wish

344
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,280
to share your burdens.

345
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,680
Please judge wisely.

346
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,090
Let Yang take a look.

347
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,520
Yes.

348
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,000
Though brief in words,

349
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,260
it shows

350
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,750
how arduous this battle was.

351
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,550
Fortunately,

352
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,720
the entire Changfeng Army fought bravely,

353
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,480
and the Li family
served loyally and heroically,

354
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
allowing our country

355
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,210
to achieve this great victory.

356
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,000
Previously, Li Wei was unwell,

357
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,910
but he should be fully recovered now.

358
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,430
Starting tomorrow,

359
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,790
he should resume his duties

360
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,210
and attend the morning court as usual.

361
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,500
Your Majesty, you are wise.

362
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,300
I noticed this report

363
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,280
also mentions

364
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,380
a man in black.

365
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,110
Yang,

366
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,690
what's your opinion?

367
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:20,850
This person...

368
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,800
deliberately conceals his identity.

369
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,190
I'm not sure

370
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,400
if there's a reason.

371
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,440
Perhaps

372
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,790
we should reward him first

373
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,790
to gain his favor,

374
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:29,980
and then

375
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,040
carefully investigate the cause.

376
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,030
If we can ease his worries

377
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,430
and recruit him to the court,

378
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,690
our army would be greatly strengthened.

379
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,650
If he's willing, that would be ideal.

380
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,370
But what if he refuses?

381
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,550
Such strength

382
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,750
must never fall into another's hands.

383
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,590
If he refuses,

384
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,540
we must kill him

385
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,930
to eliminate future trouble.

386
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,420
Alright. You may rise.

387
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,670
Thank you, Father.

388
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,950
I was foolish.

389
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,470
I didn't think it through.

390
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,220
Yang, as the Crown Prince,

391
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,210
how can you belittle yourself?

392
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,640
I know well

393
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,140
that my intelligence

394
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,550
is far beneath my brother's.

395
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,830
Because of your favor, I was granted
the position of Crown Prince.

396
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,440
Only through diligence and self-correction

397
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,430
can I be worthy of your grace.

398
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:38,150
It's nearly time
for the Grand Tutor's examination today.

399
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:38,950
Well,

400
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,240
I

401
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,990
shall take my leave.

402
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,920
[General's Residence]

403
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,660
You're awake?

404
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,850
Don't move.

405
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,200
You might tear open your wound.

406
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,680
While I was unconscious,

407
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,570
it was you who took care of me all along?

408
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,190
Your identity is sensitive.

409
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,950
The fewer who know, the better.

410
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,940
If it were anyone else,

411
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,840
I wouldn't feel at ease.

412
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,280
How long have you been taking care of me?

413
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,960
You don't look well.

414
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,850
Take your medicine first.

415
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,680
My hands have gone numb under your weight.

416
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,590
I can't move them.

417
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,790
Why don't you feed me?

418
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,200
Actually,

419
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,110
I didn't mean to deceive you.

420
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,630
It's just that my body
has changed too much.

421
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,820
Even I

422
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,310
had trouble accepting it.

423
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,550
Now that you know,

424
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:58,590
however

425
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,920
you want to deal with me,

426
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,160
I will accept.

427
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,830
When I was young,

428
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,830
my father adopted me

429
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,690
and taught me martial arts.

430
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,760
One day,

431
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,000
Madam

432
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,810
was cornered by a hunting dog.

433
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,730
To save her,

434
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,080
I killed the dog.

435
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,070
I didn't expect that

436
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,590
she would grow

437
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,150
increasingly distant from me after that.

438
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,170
She even urged Father

439
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,130
to send me away,

440
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,520
saying I possessed

441
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,630
incredible strength

442
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,159
and was no ordinary person.

443
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,030
But Father told me

444
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,850
that sometimes,

445
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,370
having extraordinary abilities

446
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,370
isn't a bad thing.

447
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,210
As long as one follows the righteous path,

448
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,510
even in darkness,

449
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,000
one can tread through hell.

450
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,400
You saved me,

451
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,480
saved the Changfeng Army,

452
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,540
and saved Lucheng.

453
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,239
Sometimes, good and evil

454
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,699
aren't defined by others,

455
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,040
but by your own heart.

456
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,400
Your blood nourishes my power

457
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,840
in ways beyond measure.

458
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
But gaining such fearsome strength

459
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,330
must come with a price.

460
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,280
Lately,

461
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,400
you've been weak.

462
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,130
I don't know if it's because of me.

463
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,510
Don't make

464
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,510
baseless guesses.

465
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,670
Then promise me,

466
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,280
no matter what happens,

467
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,760
you'll never hurt yourself for me.

468
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,320
I promise.

469
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,230
Now that you're awake,

470
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,590
I'll go handle
some military matters first.

471
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,320
I'll check on you when I'm back.

472
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,000
Wait.

473
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,010
Since I've revealed my identity,

474
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:57,800
well,

475
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,710
I won't hide anything from you anymore.

476
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,760
Actually, the man in black

477
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,460
not only possesses supernatural strength,

478
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,910
but can also heal his own wounds.

479
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,840
If you don't believe me,

480
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,320
you can unwrap the bandages
and see for yourself.
