[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,950
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,370
I was about to ask you the same.

4
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,900
That day when Shuang and Jin'an

5
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,600
were going to die together,

6
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,740
why did you step in to help them?

7
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,330
I never thought

8
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,310
that love

9
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,110
could really make people risk their lives.

10
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,650
Watching them face death so bravely,

11
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,290
I suddenly felt

12
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,380
that perhaps helping lovers be together

13
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,750
was also a kind of healing.

14
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,900
You always talk like

15
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,670
you don't care about it at all,

16
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,590
but when it really mattered,

17
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,050
you didn't just walk away.

18
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,270
Thank you for saving them.

19
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,910
And thank you

20
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,550
for letting me realize
who I treasure most.

21
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,530
You all mean too much to me.

22
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,050
I can't let go.

23
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,560
So,

24
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,480
I probably won't be able
to join your sect.

25
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,430
Does "you all"

26
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,020
include me?

27
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,910
In a few days,

28
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,660
everyone will return to Lucheng.

29
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,550
There's still a long road ahead.

30
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,360
We'll meet again if fate allows.

31
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,510
Pour the wine.

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,920
Your Majesty,

33
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,360
too much wine is bad for your health.

34
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,240
Please take care of your health.

35
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,510
You may all leave.

36
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,720
Your Majesty,

37
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,690
you're drunk.

38
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,570
If I could really get drunk,

39
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,500
that would be nice.

40
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,190
How are the preparations?

41
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,550
An elite unit of the Imperial Guards
is already outside the east gate,

42
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,880
awaiting your command.

43
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,120
Go to Wuling Mountain,

44
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,070
surround it with the Imperial Guards,

45
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,330
and wait for Li Shuang.

46
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,200
Is Your Majesty concerned

47
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,950
that General Li might disobey your order
and never return?

48
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,740
But the Li family and the Changfeng Army…

49
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,400
Even the most upright person,

50
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,060
once a knife is at their throat,

51
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,120
will throw aside loyalty,

52
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,760
honor, and filial duty.

53
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,460
Compared with one's own gain or loss,

54
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,840
the lives of others

55
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,530
mean nothing at all.

56
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,510
Selfishness

57
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,500
is human nature.

58
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,120
I understand.

59
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,300
And Jin'an—

60
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,060
he was once the man in black,

61
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,910
involved in too many things.

62
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,240
Bring him along as well.

63
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,970
Bring him back alive if possible.

64
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,500
If not, bring his body back.

65
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,040
As you command.

66
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,190
I won't let them have their way.

67
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,220
I will never let go

68
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,620
of what belongs to me.

69
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,480
Master is recovering in seclusion

70
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,360
and cannot see you off.

71
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,650
He asked us to escort
the three of you down the mountain.

72
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,250
Thank you.

73
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,630
Master also asked me

74
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,090
to give you this medicine.

75
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,240
Although your wounds have healed,

76
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,090
you still need plenty of rest.

77
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,210
Take it regularly,

78
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,070
and it will greatly benefit you.

79
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,890
I don't dare take his medicine.

80
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,000
First it's shadow puppets,
then it's light puppets.

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,400
One thing after another.

82
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,700
Thank you all for your help
during this time.

83
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,500
We'll meet again if fate allows.

84
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,960
There's nothing
between your master and me.

85
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,160
We're not in a relationship.

86
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,480
He is a perfect gentleman,

87
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,840
and I'm not pregnant.

88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,560
Stop spreading rumors

89
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,520
so he won't be troubled needlessly.

90
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,200
And this—

91
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,590
please give it to him.

92
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,970
Tell him

93
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,630
he and I are even from now on.

94
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,250
Let's go.

95
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,310
Did she really say that?

96
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,150
Yes.

97
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,120
Master, is there anything else
I can do for you?

98
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,000
Nothing else.

99
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,210
You may go.

100
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,080
Loving someone means…

101
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,200
sharing good food,

102
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,750
enjoying beautiful scenery together,

103
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,800
wanting to share all the wonders
in the world with them,

104
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,260
and being willing
to bear each other's pain.

105
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,870
Why are you sighing?

106
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,750
Shuang,

107
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,590
this is as far as I'll go with you.

108
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,130
You're not going back to Lucheng?

109
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,240
Going back to watch you two
being all lovey-dovey

110
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,390
while I'm all alone?

111
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,480
In your dreams.

112
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm staying here
to continue studying medicine.

113
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,540
Even though the clinic is gone,

114
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,520
I can still become a renowned physician

115
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,090
and help those who need me.

116
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
I can tell

117
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,060
that during the time on Wuling Mountain,

118
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,960
you've been really happy.

119
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,680
You are free.

120
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,050
From now on,

121
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,290
you can do anything you want.

122
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,920
After we part today,

123
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,110
we might not see each other again
for a long time.

124
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,910
No matter where we are,

125
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,200
you must write to me.

126
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,650
Even if we're not together,

127
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,650
our hearts will always be together.

128
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,500
And you,

129
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,140
treat Shuang well.

130
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,720
If you ever hurt her,

131
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,910
no matter how far I have to go,

132
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,240
I'll make you pay for it.

133
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,620
Didn't you go down the mountain with them?

134
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,520
Why are you back?

135
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,410
I never said I was leaving.

136
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,960
Besides, I can't bear to leave you.

137
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,790
I mean, your Wuling Mountain.

138
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,190
There are so many rare medicines

139
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,200
and medical books here.

140
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,150
I haven't learned them all yet.

141
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,080
Wouldn't it be a shame to leave now?

142
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,970
What do you take this place for?

143
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,230
You think you can come

144
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,800
and go as you please?

145
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,200
You were moved by Shuang and Jin'an,

146
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,510
and you helped them.

147
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,020
That means you're not cold-blooded.

148
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,320
So now that I've returned

149
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,910
after leaving,

150
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,390
aren't you quite happy?

151
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,790
I seem to recall someone saying

152
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,580
we're even from now on.

153
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,630
I've already cleared your name

154
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,150
in front of everyone.

155
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,230
Don't push your luck.

156
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,910
I haven't even given you
a piece of my mind yet!

157
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,110
You didn't even come out to say goodbye.

158
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,500
Heartless as ever.

159
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,320
You haven't even become my disciple,

160
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,810
yet you already dare
talk back to your master?

161
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,930
So you agree?

162
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,320
Staying on Wuling Mountain isn't easy.

163
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,840
Whether you can pass the test

164
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,200
depends on

165
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,550
your talent.

166
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,320
And here,

167
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,600
take this.

168
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,840
I never take back

169
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,960
what I gave away.

170
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,870
Master!

171
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,610
Wait for me, Master!

172
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,220
[Wuling Mountain]

173
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,320
See?

174
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,480
I told you

175
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,390
Lu Xin couldn't bear
to leave Wuling Mountain.

176
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,870
I won

177
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,630
our bet.

178
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,360
Though Mo Yin is eccentric,

179
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,900
he's a man of integrity.

180
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,240
With him by Lu Xin's side,

181
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,210
I can rest easy.

182
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,580
Where did everyone go?

183
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,090
Why is nobody here?

184
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,390
The fire is still burning.

185
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,920
Could they have gone hunting?

186
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,670
The Changfeng Army
is strictly disciplined.

187
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,600
Without orders,

188
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,410
they wouldn't act on their own.

189
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,550
General Li has been away
from the capital for days with no word.

190
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,850
His Majesty misses you greatly

191
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,070
and has ordered me to escort you

192
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,950
and Mr. Jin'an back to the capital.

193
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,140
Being emperor really changes a person.

194
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,400
But do you really think

195
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,080
you and your men can stop us?

196
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,710
Move.

197
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,000
General Li left her post
on an imperial mission.

198
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,060
It's totally fine.

199
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,490
But as border guards,

200
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,630
they abandoned their posts.

201
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,480
It's a crime punishable
by execution of their entire families.

202
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,150
I'm merely following orders.

203
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,790
If you cooperate, General,

204
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll ensure the safety of your men.

205
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,210
By the way,

206
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,240
your father and brother

207
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,200
are waiting for you in the capital.

208
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,190
General,

209
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,240
shall we?

210
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,200
[Imperial Palace of Taijin]

211
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,640
[Imperial Study]

212
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,930
Your Majesty,

213
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,180
I have fulfilled my mission.

214
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,600
Jin'an, Li Shuang, and her subordinates

215
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,790
have all been escorted
back to the capital.

216
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,670
The two of them are now
waiting outside the palace

217
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,270
for Your Majesty's summons.

218
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,030
This was no easy task.

219
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,520
I didn't expect it to go so smoothly.

220
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,850
Your Majesty,

221
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,980
General Li is concerned
about her family's safety,

222
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,480
so she naturally complied.

223
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,390
As for Jin'an,

224
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,440
I've learned

225
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,440
that his extraordinary strength

226
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,430
came from a sacred relic
of Wuling Mountain in his body.

227
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,520
Now that the relic has been returned,

228
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,740
he's nothing more than a common warrior,

229
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,800
completely at Your Majesty's mercy.

230
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,940
The man in black was
once unmatched in bravery.

231
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,570
What a pity.

232
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,000
Recently,

233
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,800
the Yao State has expressed
the wish for peace.

234
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,000
Their envoy entered the city yesterday

235
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,270
and will

236
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,820
seek an audience today.

237
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,510
During the late emperor's reign,

238
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,030
they provoked us repeatedly

239
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,160
and never showed any desire for peace.

240
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,840
Why the sudden change of heart?

241
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,480
The transition of imperial power

242
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,550
is indeed

243
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,550
the best opportunity
to shift from enemies to allies.

244
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,800
But my rule is not yet steady.

245
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,720
I fear

246
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,520
their peace offering is merely a pretense,

247
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,080
and their real aim is
to test our strength.

248
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,440
Let my order be known:

249
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,210
a banquet will be held in the palace

250
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,210
to entertain the Yao State's envoy.

251
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,630
Li Shuang and Jin'an are to

252
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,850
attend as well.

253
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,510
General Li has defended the border
for years,

254
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,480
fighting the Yao State time and again.
She ought to be there.

255
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,070
But Jin'an...

256
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,470
He once dealt the Yao State
a crushing blow.

257
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,900
How could I exclude him

258
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,600
from such an occasion?

259
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,480
Besides,

260
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,540
he once did me a great service.

261
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,190
As the Emperor now,

262
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,200
I should reward him.

263
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

264
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,910
Summon the envoy of the Yao State.

265
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,170
[Xianyang Palace]

266
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,240
I'm Bai Kun, envoy of the Yao State.

267
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,510
On behalf of our Empress Dowager
and Sovereign,

268
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,070
I congratulate Taijin's new emperor
for his ascension to the throne.

269
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,270
Since you've come to our court,

270
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,440
why do you not kneel before His Majesty?

271
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,080
I came to Taijin

272
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,950
under the command of the Yao State's
Empress Dowager and Sovereign

273
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,200
to seek peaceful coexistence
between our two states.

274
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,830
There is no reason for me
to bow and call myself your subject.

275
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,790
Sir, you're being so aggressive.

276
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,580
Does this mean

277
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,490
your court's desire for peace
is not sincere?

278
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,940
Mr. Bai, you are mistaken.

279
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,160
If you can help facilitate a peace treaty,

280
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,440
it'd fulfill the wish
of the people of both states.

281
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,780
The Changfeng Army has guarded
the border for many years,

282
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,440
and this is all we seek as well.

283
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,340
The envoy has traveled from afar.

284
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,160
It must have been a tiring journey.

285
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,020
But since we are

286
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,870
still in national mourning,

287
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,160
it's not proper to hold a lavish feast.

288
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,920
So today,

289
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,040
I've arranged a simple banquet

290
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,890
to welcome you.

291
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

292
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,230
I have long heard of
General Li Shuang's unmatched bravery.

293
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,230
Seeing you today,

294
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,610
I can see that the rumors are true.

295
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,760
However, Taijin is actually

296
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,710
relying on a woman to defend its borders.

297
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,510
Is there truly no man in your court

298
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,590
more capable than her?

299
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,660
In Taijin, we employ people

300
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,420
regardless of gender.

301
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,520
There may be differences in rank,

302
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,270
but there is no difference in loyalty.

303
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,410
Besides,

304
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,750
haven't all your elite generals

305
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
been defeated by me, a woman?

306
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,480
Your Majesty,

307
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,310
I have come not only

308
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,880
to pay my respects

309
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,150
but also to deliver a peace treaty.

310
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,590
To show our sincerity,

311
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,260
we have only 2 conditions.

312
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,660
First,

313
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,680
return the captured soldiers
of the Yao State.

314
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,960
Second…

315
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,870
Disband the Changfeng Army.

316
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,290
If Your Majesty agrees,

317
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,920
our state is willing to cede 2 cities:

318
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,120
Qingchuan and Helan.

319
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,340
From then on, the two states
shall never go to war again

320
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,140
and will remain allies forever.

321
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,210
General Li,

322
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,030
what do you think?

323
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,490
Your Majesty,

324
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,700
the Changfeng Army

325
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,660
is one of Taijin's most important
defense forces.

326
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,030
How can it be disbanded just because of
the words of a scheming envoy?

327
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,730
Actually, when all is said and done,

328
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,290
it's because the battles were so brutal

329
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,510
that your emperor became wary.

330
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,690
But since both states have decided

331
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,590
to make peace,

332
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,330
making a compromise

333
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,570
is not impossible.

334
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,120
Besides, now that peace reigns
throughout the land

335
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,650
and the borders are stable,

336
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,410
it's time for General Li
to lay down your armor

337
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,140
and return home to get married.

338
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,400
When that time comes,

339
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,910
if the envoy visits Taijin again,

340
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,130
she and I

341
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,610
will prepare wine to welcome you,

342
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,020
and we can catch up

343
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,280
as old friends.

344
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,780
General Li,

345
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,280
don't you agree?

346
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,070
Your Majesty is right.

347
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,790
If so,

348
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,400
leave the maps of Qingchuan and Helan.

349
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,390
As for the other conditions,

350
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,580
we'll discuss them later.

351
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,640
Your Majesty,

352
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,780
do you mean to seize two cities
without giving anything in return?

353
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,850
As the ruler of a state,

354
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,190
how could you go back on your word?

355
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Watch your mouth!

356
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,550
How dare you be so insolent

357
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,880
and insult His Majesty?

358
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,160
Though the Yao State desires peace,

359
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,420
we are not weaklings to be trampled upon.

360
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,610
If Your Majesty has no wish for peace,

361
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,410
we do not fear war.

362
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,270
When blood runs in rivers,

363
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,180
all the officials here

364
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,420
will bear witness.

365
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,530
Sir, you must be mistaken.

366
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,550
If His Majesty wished to reject peace,

367
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,980
he wouldn't have arranged this banquet.

368
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,760
It was merely

369
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,460
a test of your state's sincerity.

370
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,550
Your Majesty,

371
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,880
allow me to speak

372
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,720
on the envoy's behalf.

373
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,460
Taijin and the Yao State have fought
dozens of battles.

374
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,020
Countless soldiers died,

375
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,640
and the people at the border

376
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,570
were displaced.

377
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,970
What they've longed for
all their lives is nothing but peace.

378
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,830
If the two states

379
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,070
could cease fighting,

380
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,730
it would be a blessing for all.

381
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,880
Please, Your Majesty,

382
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,480
cast off the old, begin anew,

383
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,830
and bring a fresh start for the people.

384
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,050
The Changfeng Army cannot be disbanded.

385
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,580
However, if your state

386
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,370
cedes 2 cities as you offered,

387
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,500
half of the captives

388
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,400
can be released.

389
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,570
Envoy, what do you think?

390
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,200
Half of the captives

391
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,750
for 2 cities?

392
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,830
Your Majesty,

393
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,390
don't you find that greedy?

394
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,490
Greedy?

395
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,260
As the defeated nation, the Yao State

396
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,250
should have expected harsh terms.

397
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,550
Now,

398
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,510
the advantage lies with Taijin.

399
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,120
I choose peace or war as I please.

400
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,940
I am the ruler of the world.

401
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,200
Whatever I desire,

402
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,900
I shall have.

403
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,660
I am a guard under General Li.

404
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,240
It's my honor
to be summoned by Your Majesty,

405
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,130
and I believe

406
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,670
there's a special reason for it.

407
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,320
No need to be modest.

408
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,680
Back in Lucheng,

409
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,660
you helped General Li greatly.

410
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,620
I summoned you to give you a reward.

411
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,430
My humble efforts deserve no credit.

412
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,680
However,

413
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,310
since Your Majesty has offered,

414
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,510
there is one thing

415
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,480
I'd like to request.

416
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,790
I beg Your Majesty

417
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,450
to grant me a marriage.

418
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,350
Since you've asked,

419
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,880
I shall make arrangements.

420
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,680
But

421
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,480
you may have to wait
until after I get married.

422
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,740
I've already agreed with General Li—

423
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,600
the Changfeng Army's commander,
General of the North, Li Shuang,

424
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,530
will resign from her military post

425
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,760
and enter the palace as my consort.

426
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,420
Yunjing is truly extraordinary.

427
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,350
I've finally

428
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,000
seen these green tiles and red walls.

429
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,840
This is where you grew up.

430
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,310
I know you're upset.

431
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,310
Instead of bottling it up,

432
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,720
why not just…

433
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,920
Why should I be upset?

434
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,120
Do you really think

435
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,490
I'm the biggest fool in the world?

436
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,050
If I still couldn't understand you by now,

437
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,470
how could I say I love you?

438
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,910
If I'm angry at anything,

439
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,240
it's that

440
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,660
you didn't

441
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,480
tell me sooner.

442
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,540
It must've been hard

443
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,800
to endure all this alone for so long.

444
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,390
It really has been a long time.

445
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,000
To save me,

446
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,530
you've suffered so much.

447
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,300
Leave everything to me from now on.

448
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,850
We'll face

449
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,280
whatever comes our way.

450
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,690
The only thing that matters is—

451
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,160
you are

452
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,600
my wife for life.

453
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,900
That will never change.

454
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,510
I know

455
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,870
my words must be very touching.

456
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,700
But could you please

457
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,110
not cry all over my clothes?

458
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,770
If you're so fussy about tears and snot,

459
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,070
how are we going
to spend a lifetime together?

460
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,350
Normally, it's fine,

461
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,950
but I'm about to meet my father-in-law.

462
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,720
I can't show up looking sloppy.

463
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,900
Without our parents' consent

464
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,690
or a matchmaker's proposal,

465
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,690
you can't call him

466
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,290
your father-in-law yet.

467
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,530
That's not true.

468
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,760
With my charming demeanor,

469
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,210
once your father meets me,

470
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,030
he won't be able to say no.

471
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,190
Sorry, Father,

472
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,550
I let you down.

473
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,710
I'm glad you're safe.

474
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,110
Father,

475
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,920
this is the one I told you about—

476
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,070
Jin'an.

477
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,270
Come here.

478
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,590
It's your honor

479
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,620
to meet me.

480
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,960
It's my honor

481
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,000
to meet you.

482
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,280
Shuang!

483
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,440
Shuang!

484
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,630
I finally caught up with you!

485
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,880
You left in such a hurry last time.

486
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,380
I quit my studies and rushed back,

487
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,820
but I still missed you.

488
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,940
I heard that after I left Lucheng,

489
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,670
there were a few more tough battles.

490
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,630
How have you been?

491
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,630
Were you injured?

492
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,310
Here I am, safe and sound,

493
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,020
standing right before you.

494
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
It's you.

495
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,360
Not done staying
at the General's Residence,

496
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,090
so you followed her to Yunjing?

497
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,590
Young Master,

498
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
were we

499
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,500
very close before?

500
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,270
We only had some
small disagreements before.

501
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,290
Do you really have to pretend
you don't know me?

502
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,620
That's not what I meant.

503
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,050
I had a bit of an accident.

504
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,400
I don't remember much

505
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,450
of what happened in the past.

506
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,870
Quit pretending.

507
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,430
He just recovered from an injury.

508
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,560
Don't mess with him.

509
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,450
Y-You're favoring your lover
over your own brother.

510
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,070
Ting.

511
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,680
Quan.

512
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,340
Yes.

513
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,350
Prepare a guest room for…

514
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:12,980
our guest.

515
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,180
Yes.

516
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
You put your lover before your brother.

517
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Keep your voice down. Keep it down!

518
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,750
Look at you, wearing a flower and a dress.

519
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,350
Get out. Get out.

520
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,400
Stop talking nonsense. Go out.

521
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,920
Fine, I'll have the kitchen
prepare some food for you.

522
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,110
Go now, go.

523
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,040
What's wrong?

524
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,240
I can feel

525
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,580
that I was close to Young Master
back in Lucheng,

526
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,780
but I can't remember a thing.

527
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,220
I knew I'd gradually forget things,

528
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,240
but I didn't expect it to happen so fast

529
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,730
and so completely.

530
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,000
Then let it be forgotten.

531
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,100
As long as you still remember me,

532
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,010
I'll tell you about the past.

533
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,310
Back on Wuling Mountain, you told me

534
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,830
that we should not dwell on the past,

535
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,680
that every hill and field
would be our witness.

536
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,760
Does that not count anymore?

537
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,310
You're right.

538
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,480
Instead of dwelling on the past,

539
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,260
we should cherish the present.

540
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,960
We still have a long journey ahead.

541
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:56,700
Your Highness,

542
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,590
without His Majesty's permission,

543
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,590
you cannot enter.

544
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,210
I'd like to see

545
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,050
who dares to stop me today.

546
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,840
My beloved concubine,
you've grown bolder and bolder.

547
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,990
Now, when you see me,

548
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,820
you don't even show
the most basic courtesy.

549
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,680
Concubine?

550
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,890
No wonder the coronation
keeps being delayed.

551
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,070
So you really plan
to deprive me of my position,

552
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,880
marry Li Shuang,

553
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,080
and make her empress?

554
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,230
You are my lawful wife.

555
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,110
It's only right

556
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,380
for you to be empress.

557
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,350
What's gotten into you today?

558
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,630
Where is this coming from?

559
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,190
Stop pretending.

560
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,900
Don't think I don't know

561
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,740
what you said in front of
all the officials and the envoy

562
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,030
at the banquet today.

563
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,800
You've only been emperor for a few days,

564
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,680
and you're already getting carried away.

565
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,480
Don't forget

566
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,070
whose support kept you alive

567
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,600
so you could sit here today.

568
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:12,070
Who is so audacious

569
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,190
as to sow discord between us

570
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,420
and speak recklessly of state affairs?

571
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
I will

572
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,889
punish them immediately.

573
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,989
It was me.

574
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:27,969
Father!

575
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,920
Your Majesty, have you decided

576
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,110
how you'll punish me?

577
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,480
Father,

578
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,070
today, he...

579
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,630
Go back and rest.

580
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,350
I have a few words to say
to my son-in-law.

581
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,400
But I...

582
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,420
Go back first.

583
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,480
We are family,

584
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,920
so I called you my son-in-law.

585
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,400
Please don't take offense.

586
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,050
I wouldn't, Father-in-law.

587
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,550
If I hadn't

588
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,420
taken this seat,

589
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,520
the one sitting on the throne

590
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,810
should have been you.

591
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,360
I am old now.

592
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,180
I wouldn't dare covet the throne.

593
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,630
However,

594
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,010
many royal relatives

595
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,870
are constantly scheming,

596
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,480
and there are rumors in court

597
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,480
saying Your Majesty is incompetent

598
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,210
and unworthy of this position.

599
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,110
Because of this,

600
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,440
I've worked tirelessly

601
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,700
to keep them in check and maintain order.

602
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,640
Father-in-law,

603
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,850
please speak frankly.

604
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,260
Tian Huailiang
from the Ministry of Personnel

605
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,100
has impeached Jia Shihong,
the governor of Jiuqing County,

606
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,300
for embezzling disaster relief funds,

607
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,630
which I'm sure
Your Majesty is already aware of.

608
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,150
His wife

609
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,150
is my cousin.

610
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,760
Since she is my relative,

611
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,110
she is also Your Majesty's relative.

612
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,250
Family shares honor and disgrace.

613
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,440
Surely

614
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,560
Your Majesty understands that.

615
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,330
I have already ordered

616
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,660
a thorough investigation
into Jia Shihong's case.

617
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,930
This man is a complete parasite.

618
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,380
Even if I wanted to help,

619
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.

620
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,840
So…

621
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,800
Your Majesty means to refuse me?

622
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,230
Do you think Tian Huailiang is

623
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,180
truly acting out of loyalty?

624
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,350
He once served Prince Li.

625
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,880
He is using this

626
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,320
as an opportunity to slander me

627
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,970
and force Your Majesty
to cut off your own arm.

628
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,990
Have you already forgotten

629
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,130
how you once came to me

630
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,910
begging and pleading?

631
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,950
If I hadn't fought
to put you on the throne,

632
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,860
Your Majesty wouldn't even have the chance

633
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,560
to refuse to help me

634
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,580
with a minor corruption case.

635
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,880
If I

636
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,170
had the power to put you on the throne,

637
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,630
I have the power to drag you down.

638
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,670
I will forever be

639
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,340
grateful

640
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,650
for your kindness.

641
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,110
As for Jia Shihong's case,

642
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,840
you may rest assured.

643
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,710
As mediocre as you are,

644
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,220
you should be content being a puppet.

645
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,480
Even if you're manipulated,

646
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:25,370
it's better than desperately fighting
for survival.

647
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,070
As for Your Majesty's jest

648
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,030
in court today about General Li,

649
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,110
I will pretend I never heard it.

650
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,510
As long as you sit on the throne,

651
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,510
Tianjiao must be

652
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,480
empress.

653
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,770
I

654
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,290
will heed your guidance, Father-in-law.

655
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,870
Good morning, Grand General.

656
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,440
You're late.

657
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,800
Were you waiting for me?

658
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,880
Did you come today…

659
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,320
to tell me something?

660
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,220
After Li Shuang and I

661
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,300
met each other,

662
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,310
we grew close,

663
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,330
faced hardships together,

664
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,880
and fell in love.

665
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,720
I have come specifically

666
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,870
to ask for your daughter,
Li Shuang's hand in marriage.

667
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,080
I hope you will give us your blessing.

668
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,880
Shuang told me you've suffered greatly

669
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,600
and lost all your supernatural strength.

670
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,530
I tested you with my sword earlier.

671
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,990
You only have basic martial skills left.

672
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,200
If you marry her,

673
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,660
how will you protect Shuang?

674
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,630
With my life.

675
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,760
You should know

676
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,110
His Majesty won't let her go easily.

677
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,460
That's why I plan to take Li Shuang

678
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,590
away from Yunjing as soon as possible.

679
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,330
Su Muyang

680
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,110
fears the power of the Changfeng Army.

681
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,510
He will not dare harm you.

682
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,780
What if Shuang refuses?

683
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,280
If you don't stand in our way,

684
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
I will find a way to convince her.

685
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,630
What if I do stand in your way?

686
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,320
Then I'll keep pestering you
until you don't.
