00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,230
Why did I grab his collar and kiss him?

4
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,560
How did I let her grab my collar
and kiss me?

5
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,039
I was the one taking the initiative?

6
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,980
I should have been the one
taking the initiative.

7
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,850
Drinking causes trouble.

8
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,430
No.

9
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,030
I have to say

10
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,480
what needs to be said clearly.

11
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,140
Put it here.

12
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,150
Be careful.

13
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,400
Put it there. Put it there.

14
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,600
Where is the General?

15
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,310
She went to the camp early this morning

16
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,570
and didn't even have time for breakfast.

17
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,560
Is there something urgent?

18
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,740
I didn't hear about anything urgent.

19
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:53,870
Over there.

20
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,270
Put the large ones there.

21
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,030
Isn't this the fine wine the General

22
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,090
has been hiding in her room for years?

23
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,450
Where's it being moved?

24
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,560
The General said

25
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,840
drinking causes trouble.

26
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,300
Drinking causes trouble?

27
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,810
What does that mean?

28
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,190
Let me tell you,

29
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,960
from now on, you should stop asking

30
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,690
about our general's business.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,460
Drinking causes trouble?

32
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,870
Trouble?

33
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,380
Come on. How does it cause trouble?

34
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,240
What kind of trouble did it cause?

35
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,400
She's been drinking for years,

36
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,130
and now she just suddenly quit.

37
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,880
She must be feeling extremely regretful.

38
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,030
What?

39
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
Does she really regret it?

40
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
How would I know?

41
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,590
You rushed here in the morning

42
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,190
without saying anything clearly,

43
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,990
repeating only a few sentences.

44
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,360
If an ordinary person
could understand you,

45
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
it'd be a miracle.

46
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,030
Forget it.

47
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
That's for ordinary people.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm not ordinary.

49
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,560
It was simply

50
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,220
that the mood was just right.

51
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,080
You followed your feelings,

52
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,500
forgot about propriety,

53
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,240
and in a moment of impulse,

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,840
you did something you now deeply regret.

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,160
It was not in a moment of impulse,

56
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,360
and I do not regret it.

57
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,839
I am serious about her.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,480
You two are truly a carefree couple,

59
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,340
meant to enjoy love in this world.

60
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,370
This is what Shuang deserves.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,270
Besides, from the way

62
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,120
she looked at you yesterday,

63
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,400
I already understood something.

64
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,310
Since that's the case,

65
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,190
you two now have

66
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,570
my approval to be together.

67
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,480
From now on,

68
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,390
I'm practically your mother-in-law.

69
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,040
You must take care of her

70
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,650
and show me utmost respect.

71
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,610
If you want to be a mother,
just have a child yourself.

72
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,580
Since you say you understand Shuang,

73
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,730
can you tell me

74
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,530
why she's avoiding me today?

75
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,430
Perhaps...

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,530
she still has some dissatisfaction
with you.

77
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,880
What dissatisfaction?

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,390
She's a general,

79
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,720
but she's still a woman.

80
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,360
For a lifelong commitment,

81
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,990
there should be some sense of ceremony.

82
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,050
Sense of ceremony?

you kissed me last night.

I kissed you last night.

90
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,830
What do you think about

91
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,080
the fact that I kissed you last night?

92
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,480
No.

93
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,020
I need to practice with someone.

95
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,190

97

00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,480
If I can avoid it,

193
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,230
I naturally have no objection.

194
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,360
But if it

195
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,080
angers His Majesty,

196
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,110
my father-in-law's painstaking efforts

197
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,340
may go to waste.

198
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,270
I wonder, in his eyes,

199
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,540
which is more important:

200
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,920
you or the honor of the Ji family?

201
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,250
You're using my father to pressure me?

202
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,320
How could I?

203
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,780
Crown Princess,
you are the only daughter in your family.

204
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,560
Even if His Majesty punishes us,

205
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
my father-in-law

206
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,160
will surely take your side.

207
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,170
Huai'en!

208
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,830
Yes.

209
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,590
Escort the Crown Princess back.

210
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,960
Your Highness, I've already investigated

211
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,490
the matter you instructed.

212
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,490
Not only did His Majesty go to
Wuling Mountain

213
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,200
to obtain the longevity elixir,

214
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,720
but he also
specifically had the Imperial Astrologer

215
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,400
calculate the birth charts
of the Crown Prince

216
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,060
and Prime Minister Ji's daughter,
Ji Tianjiao.

217
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,390
I believe

218
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,130
His Majesty arranged
their marriage so that,

219
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,990
when the "Mars retrograding near Antares"
occurs,

220
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,790
the Crown Prince, as the heir,

221
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,670
would have a perfect fate

222
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,080
to shield His Majesty from disaster.

223
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,030
Ji Lan thinks

224
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,840
he's holding a winning piece,

225
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,200
not knowing that

226
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,200
his precious daughter

227
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,670
will soon become a widow.

228
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,180
Your Highness,

229
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,870
are we really going to

230
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,790
let the Li family

231
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,550
turn the tables so easily?

232
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,270
Li Shuang's defeat of the Yao Army

233
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,000
was a tremendous achievement,

234
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,610
which has changed Father's mind.

235
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,720
At present,

236
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,740
even Li Wei has been reinstated
to his position.

237
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,980
Who would dare say anything more?

238
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,290
Li Wei

239
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,530
is a veteran minister of many reigns,

240
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,440
and Li Shuang commands the Changfeng Army.

241
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,020
If the Crown Prince intends
to ally with the Li family,

242
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,770
he cannot be underestimated.

243
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,380
I'm well aware of that.

244
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,390
I doubt Su Muyang

245
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,240
will make it safely to Lucheng.

246
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,220
Your Highness, your foresight

247
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,860
is beyond my reach.

248
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,810
[Prime Minister's Mansion]

249
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,360
Your Highness!

250
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,510
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

251
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,600
It won't do your health any good.

252
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,200
Get out!

253
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,270
Forgive me, My Lord.

254
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,320
You coward!

255
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,900
How dare you go to see her!

256
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,150
What's the matter this time?

257
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,280
Is it because of
the Crown Prince's mission to Lucheng?

258
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,490
Are you reluctant to part with him?

259
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,690
Not at all!

260
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,150
Everyone knows

261
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,720
he has a special relationship
with Li Shuang.

262
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,190
Meeting his former lover openly

263
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,880
shows he has no respect for me!

264
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,840
As the Crown Princess,

265
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,630
I'll become a laughingstock!

266
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,480
What laughingstock?

267
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,600
Why are you being so shortsighted?

268
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,300
I'm your own daughter.

269
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Why are you siding with an outsider?

270
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,590
My daughter,

271
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,550
now,

272
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,930
Prince Li has grown powerful,

273
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,320
with nearly half the court officials
supporting him.

274
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,240
Li Zhangyi's misconduct

275
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,360
shouldn't have been a big deal,

276
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,870
but His Majesty
not only punished him severely,

277
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,120
he also sent the Crown Prince to Lucheng
to supply the army.

278
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,650
Do you know what that means?

279
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,510
In a royal family, the Emperor
is first a ruler, and only then a father.

280
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,510
Prince Li's power is too great,

281
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,440
and that's not good

282
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,870
for His Majesty.

283
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,080
Are you saying

284
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,340
His Majesty intends to promote Su Muyang

285
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,290
to counterbalance Prince Li?

286
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,670
Even though the Li family's crisis
has eased,

287
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,960
they're far less favored

288
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,490
by His Majesty than before.

289
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,420
If Su Muyang goes there

290
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,960
and gets involved with them,

291
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,790
won't your plans…

292
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,910
To achieve greatness,

293
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,060
one cannot fuss over
short-term gains or losses.

294
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,520
Li Wei fell under His Majesty's suspicion

295
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,550
because he held military power.

296
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,430
If General Li stands with us,

297
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,720
the Crown Prince may one day
have a shot at the throne.

298
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,670
But he and Li Shuang...

299
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,510
The Crown Prince is not someone
who can't read the situation.

300
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,550
Besides,

301
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,240
he's weak by nature.

302
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,810
As long as you secure
your position as Empress,

303
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,290
who he surrounds himself with

304
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,450
won't matter.

305
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,770
You should treat him better in the future.

306
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,480
After all, you are husband and wife.

307
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,540
You need to act like a Crown Princess.

308
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,600
Others aside,

309
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,080
women who are already married

310
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,670
shouldn't go back to their parental home

311
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,790
all the time.

312
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,069
Father,

313
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,069
I just missed you.

314
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,400
Besides,

315
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,310
I'm in charge
at the Crown Prince's Mansion.

316
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,510
No one would dare stop me
if I want to leave.

317
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,240
Don't you want me

318
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
by your side all the time?

319
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,079
Oh, you.

320
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,240
The illness came on suddenly.

321
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,680
We've already sent someone
to inform the General.

322
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,310
But we didn't dare
make decisions on our own,

323
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,370
so we had to ask you to come take a look.

324
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,580
He's having an epileptic seizure.

325
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,680
Go to my clinic and find Nanxing.

326
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,070
He knows the prescription.

327
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,220
Once the medicine is ready,
bring it to me.

328
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,830
My Lady,

329
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,310
he's just a prisoner condemned to die.

330
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,960
Do we really need
to go to such lengths to treat him?

331
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,720
It's her?

332
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,350
Even if he's condemned to die,

333
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,640
he hasn't been executed yet.

334
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,170
He can die after he's cured.

335
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,440
Do as Miss Lu says.

336
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,720
Hurry and get the medicine.

337
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,240
Yes.

338
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,820
He's awake.

339
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,640
He's awake!

340
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,300
He's awake.

341
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,070
Miss Lu, you truly excel in medicine.

342
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,400
Take good care of him these next few days

343
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,880
and remember to give him
his medicine on time.

344
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,510
If anything unusual happens,

345
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,570
notify me immediately, understood?

346
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,230
Thank you for your help, Miss.

347
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,750
This way.

348
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,680
You bold villain!

349
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,480
Let go of Miss Lu!

350
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,160
Don't move!

351
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,690
If you don't want her to die,

352
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,030
have someone prepare a fast horse for me!

353
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,680
Hurry!

354
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,920
If it weren't for this kind young lady,

355
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,640
who didn't mind your filth and stink

356
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,770
and still saved you,

357
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,750
you'd be in hell by now.

358
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,850
And you?

359
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,400
Not only did you repay kindness
with enmity,

360
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,960
you dirtied her hands.

361
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,440
Mind your own business!

362
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,750
Not many people

363
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,880
can make it out of this prison alive.

364
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,480
Worry about yourself first!

365
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,560
Please calm down.

366
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,280
The General isn't here.

367
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,790
I have no authority to negotiate with you.

368
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,550
How about this?

369
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,590
Release Miss Lu

370
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,310
and take me instead.

371
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,030
Don't move!

372
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,970
Do you think I'm stupid?

373
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,350
You're just a soldier.

374
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,610
No one cares if you die.

375
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,070
But she's different.

376
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,180
She's an army physician,

377
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,580
worth much more than you.

378
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,960
I don't appreciate what you just said.

379
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,000
Soldiers, army physicians,

380
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,400
rabbits, wild boars,

381
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,070
even this little cricket—

382
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,030
they're all lives.

383
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,880
What gives anyone the right
to rank their worth?

384
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,750
Who said that? I'm very valuable.

385
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,400
Shut up!

386
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,070
Don't think I wouldn't dare kill you.

387
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,200
Even if you kill me, you won't get away!

388
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,460
Just taking someone with me before I die—

389
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,680
one is no loss,

390
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,960
and two is profit!

391
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,160
I'm asking you for the last time.

392
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,550
Don't!

393
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,550
Do you agree?

394
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,160
Fine.

395
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,480
Then I'll kill her first!

396
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,200
Taking a hostage

397
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,920
and trying to escape.

398
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,720
Lu Xin.

399
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,890
Are you alright?

400
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,920
Are you hurt?

401
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,720
I'm fine.

402
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,830
Just twisted my neck.

403
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,670
Let me see.

404
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,600
It hurts.

405
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,400
Miss, you acted decisively.

406
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Truly worthy of a general's talent.

407
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Fortunately he stepped in just now,

408
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,880
or I'd be dead.

409
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,120
Thank you for saving me.

410
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,830
You've been here for 4 or 5 days already.

411
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,890
Do you plan to stay in prison forever?

412
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,790
I could stay a few more days,

413
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,310
but

414
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,030
this cell is too dark—

415
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,960
I can't get used to it.

416
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,690
So I won't trouble you further.

417
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,170
Here's my official document.

418
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Since you have it,

419
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,480
why didn't you show it earlier?

420
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,350
If I had,
how could I have had such an experience?

421
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,270
May I leave now?

422
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,090
Thank you for today.

423
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,550
If you ever cause any trouble in the city,

424
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,880
I will show no mercy.

425
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,590
Also,

426
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,720
your hairpin...

427
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,890
I can't let those prison meals go unpaid.

428
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,930
My name is Mo Yin.

429
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,480
I believe we'll meet again.

430
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,650
Wrong way.

431
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,240
It hurts.

432
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
It took all my effort to save his life.

433
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,400
When you...

434
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,830
raised your sword,

435
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,590
you didn't hesitate at all.

436
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,160
And you have the nerve to say that?

437
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,810
If you hadn't been lucky enough today

438
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,940
to be saved by Mo Yin,

439
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,570
would you even be alive to speak here?

440
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,400
I'm a doctor.

441
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,670
Healing the sick
and saving lives is my duty,

442
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,020
just as it's your duty

443
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,070
as a general to protect the people.

444
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,630
Let me ask you,

445
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,110
over these years

446
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,510
of practicing medicine,

447
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,190
how much dowry have you saved?

448
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,940
If it's not enough,
I'll make up the difference myself.

449
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,120
I don't plan to get married.

450
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,340
Why do I need a dowry?

451
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,570
I've thought about it.

452
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,960
Since you like Ji Ran,

453
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,440
I'll arrange your marriage to him.

454
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,550
With him protecting you by your side,

455
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,480
I can rest easy.

456
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,070
Can you stop this habit

457
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,720
of playing matchmaker?

458
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,760
Ji Ran doesn't want to marry me,

459
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,650
and I don't want to marry him.

460
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,590
But didn't you…

461
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,440
Yes.

462
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,440
I did have feelings

463
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,920
for him before,

464
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,690
but that's over now.

465
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,750
There's nothing romantic between us.

466
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,750
Then you can

467
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,400
cultivate some.

468
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,240
Besides,

469
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,030
we can see how it goes
after you get married.

470
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,200
I make my own decisions about marriage.

471
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,110
Why should I listen to you?

472
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,960
He's your subordinate,

473
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,750
with his life constantly at risk,

474
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,830
always ready to die on the battlefield.

475
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,750
Are you asking him to protect me

476
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,070
or to make me a widow?

477
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,940
I heard that

478
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,510
someone got drunk

479
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,300
and got herself into trouble.

480
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,350
My past with Ji Ran is over.

481
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,590
Don't bring it up again!

482
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,720
I know you worry about me.

483
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,160
Even though
I often complain about being alone,

484
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,400
I've never truly felt lonely—

485
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,640
because I have you.

486
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,430
But you,

487
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,480
now that you've found someone
who truly cares for you,

488
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,810
you should cherish him.

489
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,400
Alright.

490
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,070
From now on,

491
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,790
I'll respect every decision you make.

492
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,790
However,

493
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,770
starting tomorrow,

494
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,550
you will come to my residence

495
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,680
every day at 7 AM

496
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,400
and train with the maids.

497
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,510
On the one hand,

498
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,020
it will strengthen your body,

499
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,920
on the other hand,
you'll learn to protect yourself.

500
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,520
It's all benefit and no harm.

501
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,880
I usually sleep in
until late morning every day.

502
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,090
Then this method
doesn't seem suitable for you.

503
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,550
Let's arrange your marriage instead.

504
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,420
Guards!

505
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,190
No, no, don't come!

506
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,260
I know there are many people here.

507
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,540
I'll train.

508
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,690
If you don't show up,

509
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,420
I'll personally come to your clinic
to fetch you.

510
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,910
General,

511
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,440
there's a letter from the capital.

512
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,000
Military Advisor Qin

513
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,930
wants to see you.

514
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,960
Someone's here.

515
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,990
His Majesty

516
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,310
ordered the Crown Prince
to Lucheng to reward the troops.

517
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,180
He'll

518
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,270
be departing soon.

519
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,110
I suppose the court,

520
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,720
to prevent complaints
among the frontline soldiers

521
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,160
over Li Zhangyi's dereliction of duty,

522
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,160
sent the Crown Prince specifically

523
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,640
to boost morale.

524
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,050
One moment they're cautious of us,

525
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,140
the next they're appeasing us.

526
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,850
They always think they know what's best.

527
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,890
These people spend all day
overthinking things

528
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,640
and then send waves of people to us.

529
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,870
I think

530
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,950
they're just too idle in the capital.

531
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,750
You shouldn't talk nonsense.

532
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,060
If someone hears it and reports you,

533
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,790
it could be considered
a capital offense for disrespect.

534
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,400
Before I die, I'll expose

535
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,660
your secret drinking.

536
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:57,920
Enough.

537
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,240
It's a long journey.

538
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,290
His Highness is precious.

539
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,880
Let's just make proper arrangements
when he's here.

540
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,440
Yes.

541
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,450
General,

542
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,210
do you think the court

543
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,950
specifically sent the Crown Prince here

544
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,500
because of that man in black?

545
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,030
I think it's very likely.

546
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,680
That man in black is truly mysterious.

547
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,480
Although he helps us every time,

548
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,440
he comes and goes without a trace,

549
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,110
like a ghost.

550
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,070
That's enough.

551
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,110
Don't

552
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,840
speculate about His Majesty's intentions.

553
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,440
Also,

554
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,910
no matter who the man in black is,

555
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,970
he has repeatedly helped us greatly.

556
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,270
The Changfeng Army owes him a great debt.

557
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:41,920
Luo Teng,

558
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,200
pass my order:

559
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,550
no one in the army

560
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,720
is allowed to speak about him recklessly;

561
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,400
violators

562
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,550
will face military punishment.

563
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,160
Yes.

564
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,080
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

565
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,720
Muyang!

566
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,880
Ting?

567
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,160
What brings you here?

568
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,160
I heard you're going to Lucheng.

569
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
I have some things

570
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,510
I want you to deliver to Shuang.

571
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,560
You could have had someone

572
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,920
bring them over.

573
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,240
Why did you come in person?

574
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,720
I haven't seen you for a while.

575
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,850
I came to see you off.

576
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,820
The journey to Lucheng
is long and difficult,

577
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,350
and your health isn't good.

578
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,000
Did you pack everything?

579
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:28,660
Don't worry.

580
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,310
I used to deliver things for you.

581
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,830
This time it's the other way around.

582
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,740
Shuang will be

583
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,960
very happy to see you.

584
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,000
Crown Prince, why didn't you

585
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
tell me that you're leaving?

586
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,160
I prepared some gifts.

587
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,070
Though they're things I don't need,

588
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,030
they should be

589
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,400
exquisite items General Li hasn't seen.

590
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,180
Please take them to her for me as well,

591
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,900
as a token of my regard.

592
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,680
Shuang has always been frugal

593
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,130
and spent much time in the army.

594
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,530
She probably won't need such fancy things.

595
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,290
Your Highness,
you don't need to trouble yourself.

596
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,890
Though General Li is a woman,

597
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,440
she is brave and skilled in battle,

598
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,630
with remarkable military achievements.

599
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,020
She's truly admirable,

600
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,700
far better than some men.

601
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,970
Shuang said that as long as

602
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,740
one has righteousness in their heart,

603
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,340
men can manage the household

604
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,350
and women can fight on the battlefield.

605
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,850
As the old saying goes,
all beings are equal.

606
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,580
So why be bound by conventions?

607
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,920
I don't want to waste my time
arguing with you.

608
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,350
Since this is a royal reward,

609
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,850
whether your sister likes it or not,

610
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,100
she has to accept it.

611
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,460
That's the way between ruler and subject.

612
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,270
The journey is long and difficult.

613
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,730
Crown Prince,
please take care of yourself.

614
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,420
She has quite a temper.

615
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,010
She's always like this.

616
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,320
Don't take it personally.

617
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,980
I wouldn't stoop to her level.

618
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,280
But you, Muyang,

619
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,440
please don't take it to heart.

620
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:13,990
Ting,

621
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,270
you've grown up.

622
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,690
You speak and act with more restraint now.

623
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,860
Shuang said that

624
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,200
I'm an adult now

625
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,690
and shouldn't act recklessly.

626
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,350
Shuang,

627
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,070
I hope this time

628
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,720
you can understand your own feelings.

629
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,350
I know you've always had Shuang
in your heart,

630
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,440
but she…

631
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,880
Anyway,

632
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,010
you must treat her well,

633
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,310
especially well.

634
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,440
Don't ever let anyone surpass you.

635
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,360
That's her!

636
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:31,920
Let's go!

637
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,270
Everyone knows you're a bastard
General Li brought back,

638
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,790
with no parents.

639
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,240
-Little bastard!
-Little bastard!

640
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,300
What are you doing?

641
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,400
The little cripple
is protecting the little bastard—

642
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,960
you two really suit each other.

643
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,750
Insult me alone

644
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,070
if you want.

645
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,400
Dragging others into it

646
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,350
is your fault!

647
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,590
I'll insult anyone I want to!

648
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,110
Little bastard! Little cripple!

649
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,310
Beat him!

650
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,110
Beat him!

651
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,160
Beat him!

652
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,440
Stand up.

653
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,970
You're a prince.

654
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,220
You must always stand tall

655
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,640
to avoid being bullied.

656
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,420
I didn't know you were so skilled,

657
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,440
unlike me...

658
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,270
Even if you don't cause trouble,

659
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,470
you need to be able to protect yourself.

660
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,780
If you're willing,

661
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,110
starting tomorrow,

662
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,500
you can practice swordsmanship with me.

663
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,230
But my right hand...

664
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,950
If you want, starting tomorrow,
you can train swordsmanship with me.

665
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,110
If you can't wield the sword
with your right hand,

666
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,170
then use your left.

667
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,740
My father once said

668
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,920
that with determination,

669
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,180
anything is possible.

670
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,270
You don't need to call me
"Your Highness" anymore.

671
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,270
We're friends.

672
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,400
Just call me Muyang from now on.

673
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,150
Your Highness,

674
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,310
since you're here to reward the troops,

675
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,710
you should focus on that.

676
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,470
Prince Li has many eyes and ears.

677
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,710
If he finds out,

678
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,440
he might make things difficult
for you again.

679
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,500
I've always avoided confronting him

680
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,920
to show that I have no desire

681
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,270
to compete with him

682
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,170
and only want to live in peace.

683
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,720
How else will he target me?

684
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,640
After all,

685
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,910
General Li holds command
over the Changfeng Army.

686
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,220
I don't care about military power at all.

687
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,680
Father has never trusted me
with important matters.

688
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,610
The reason he sent me here this time

689
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,700
must be that he has tacitly approved

690
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,740
Shuang and me being together.

691
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Now,

692
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,600
I can rightfully
place this hairpin on her.

693
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,680
Because of this,

694
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,040
you must have suffered quite a bit, right?

695
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,510
I don't remember.

696
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,150
In that case,

697
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,570
losing my memory wasn't so bad.

698
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,659
-Actually, I'm here today to tell you...
-The Crown Prince is coming.

699
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,929
The news about the man in black
has reached the capital.

700
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:29,150
The purpose of the Crown Prince's visit
isn't clear yet.

701
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,030
But I can't

702
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,690
shake this feeling of unease.

703
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,600
The court has always been full
of power struggles,

704
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,550
and you possess extraordinary abilities.

705
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,510
I'm afraid

706
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,020
they might think that whoever has you

707
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,080
can rule the world.

708
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,429
I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

709
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,280
I am.

710
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,420
Whether I turn into the man in black

711
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,650
depends on my mood.

712
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,739
They won't catch me so easily.

713
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,030
But you—

714
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,090
when the Crown Prince arrives,

715
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,190
how will you introduce me?

716
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,370
Then how do you want me to introduce you?

717
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,500
My servant?

718
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,070
My boytoy?

719
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,670
Or...

720
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,110
my husband-to-be?

721
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,680
Why are you so blunt?

722
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,440
You're a woman after all.

723
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,320
So what?

724
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,670
I've never cared for the shackles

725
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,840
this world places on women.

726
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,440
Men can lead troops into battle—

727
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,320
so can women.

728
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,550
Men can joke freely—

729
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,660
why can't I?

730
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,400
That's true.

731
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,590
So,

732
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,360
how exactly do you plan to introduce me?

733
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,520
Since you're asking,

734
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,830
you must have thought of a way, right?

735
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,670
Before, I taught you qin, chess,
calligraphy, and painting,

736
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,630
and you said they were useless.

737
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,660
Now I'm teaching you etiquette.

738
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,190
Surely that will be useful.

739
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,190
One day,

740
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,190
when you go to the capital
to meet His Majesty,

741
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,070
you won't be at a loss.

742
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
That makes sense.

743
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,200
Are you willing to teach me?

744
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,760
Of course I'm willing to teach you.

745
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,670
However,

746
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,630
I can't keep teaching you

747
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,670
without a proper title, can I?

748
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,400
How about this?

749
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,830
Let's use wine instead of tea.

750
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,360
You offer me

751
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,810
a bowl in respect as a student,

752
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,620
and from today on,

753
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,480
I'll teach you everything I know.

754
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,230
What do you say?

755
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,960
Well...

756
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,680
let me think about it.

757
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,200
If you're going to teach me,

758
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,830
teach me more.

759
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,630
Besides

760
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,070
serving tea and wine to the Crown Prince,

761
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,470
what else should I learn?

762
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,960
What should I learn

763
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,230
to make the Crown Prince happy?

764
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,360
What else can you do?

765
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,760
Should I...

766
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,800
learn…

767
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,480
like…

768
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,510
singing songs?

769
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,190
Or...

770
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,760
And who's being petty now?
