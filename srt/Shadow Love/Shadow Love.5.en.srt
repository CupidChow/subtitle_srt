[Episode 5]

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,009
[The Imperial Palace of Taijin]

4
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,310
[Xianyang Palace]

5
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,200
Since the spy is dead,

6
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,450
shall we close the case now?

7
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,840
I

8
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,700
urge Your Majesty to reconsider.

9
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,509
A dead man cannot speak.

10
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,590
Even if wrongly accused,
he cannot defend himself.

11
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,580
Besides,
these so-called treasonous letters

12
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,840
could have been fabricated
to frame someone.

13
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,680
Huo Du

14
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,710
was appointed

15
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,950
Military Supervisor
of the Changfeng Army by the court.

16
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,350
And now, conveniently, he's labeled a spy.

17
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,030
It seems to me

18
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,150
that Li Shuang

19
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,470
is abusing her power

20
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,030
to persecute her opponents.

21
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,680
Deceiving the Emperor
is a crime punishable by death.

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,880
I suggest, Prince Li,

23
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,110
that you speak with caution
unless you have proof.

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,630
Your Majesty, please judge wisely.

25
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,570
The Li family
has been loyal for generations

26
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,480
and surely

27
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,710
would never commit such a despicable act.

28
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,680
It seems the Crown Prince

29
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,310
indeed has deep ties with the Li family.

30
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,960
No wonder Li Wei's son, Li Ting,

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,400
took your carriage

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
to leave the capital for the border.

33
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,520
Is that true?

34
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,160
I dare not lie.

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,960
I wonder if Your Majesty

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,190
granted Li Ting special permission
to leave the capital.

37
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,079
Or perhaps

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,500
General Li

39
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,150
secretly sent his son to the border,

40
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,430
intending to take control of
the garrison troops

41
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,630
for his own purposes?

42
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,610
Our country

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,450
governs with
filial piety and righteousness.

44
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,800
Li Ting missed his elder sister
and went to visit her,

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,360
which is only natural.

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Your Majesty, please judge wisely.

47
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,770
If that's the case,

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,240
the spy case

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,530
remains inconclusive.

50
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,090
Hear my decree:

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,030
Li Wei is stripped of his rank
as General of Cavalry

52
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,470
and demoted to Military Protector.

53
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,560
The Li family in the capital

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,290
may not leave without summons.

55
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

56
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,950
Father, you are wise.

57
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,750
I'll put it here.

58
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,280
The shelf isn't sturdy enough.

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,680
It might collapse later.

60
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,000
He's carrying dead leaves
and fresh flowers upstairs.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,910
It must be

62
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,240
some kind of formation,

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,910
or perhaps he's trying to send a message.

64
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,640
How could a pile of random stuff

65
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,910
mean anything?

66
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,840
Spies are cunning.

67
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,450
We must remain on guard.

68
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,920
Understood.

69
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,520
Take it slow and be careful

70
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,430
while you work.

71
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,280
Alright.

72
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,430
Check the repaired roof

73
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,000
for leaks.

74
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,860
Will do.

75
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,120
Sister.

76
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,930
I've been looking for you.

77
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,470
I've been looking for you.
Turns out you're here.

78
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,000
Come with me.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,380
I've got a surprise for you.

80
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:14,990
Let's go.

81
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,720
You spent the whole morning

82
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,880
working on this?

83
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,680
This is going to be your bed from now on.

84
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,750
I laid dried leaves at the bottom,

85
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,950
so it stays dry and warm.

86
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,190
And the flowers around it

87
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,250
will help you relax and sleep better.

88
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,640
What a waste of time.

89
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,310
How is this a waste of time?

90
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,480
You're a general—

91
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,140
busy and exhausted every day.

92
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,510
Even back in camp,
you've got a mountain of things to handle.

93
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,310
Eating well and getting good rest
really matters.

94
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,800
Who's this for?

95
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,750
Me.

96
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,070
You?

97
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,480
After all that work,

98
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,430
I can't have you sleeping on a flower bed

99
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,030
while I take the common bunk.

100
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,270
Besides,

101
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,920
that stone bed in the shed is so hard.

102
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,180
It's breaking my back.

103
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,230
Oh, right.

104
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,840
Where did you get these?

105
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,510
I got them in exchange
for plowing Auntie Huang's field.

106
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,170
You love drinking, don't you?

107
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,240

How is this possible?

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,830
Lately,

139
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,980
I've stayed with her every single day.

140
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,440
Why does it still hurt so much?

141
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,270

blood?

146
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,270
Since you've declared war,

147
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,500
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

please don't be angry.

151
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,910
You told me before

152
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,110
that your brother was a bit simple-minded.

153
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,920
I thought you were deceiving me,

154
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,280
but seeing him today,

155
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,630
it's such a waste of his good looks.

156
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,780
I'm not simple-minded.

157
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,830
I'm sharp.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,040
Alright.

159
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,890
You're sharp.

160
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,120
Poor boy.

161
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,520
Auntie Huang,

162
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,690
I'm so sorry
to disturb you this late at night.

163
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,510
I apologize

164
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,630
on behalf of my brother.

165
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,550
Don't mention it.

166
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,670
This chicken was

167
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,210
quite difficult to catch anyway.

168
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,240
I wanted to give it to you

169
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,910
to help you regain your strength.

170
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,150
Why are you so greedy?

171
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,610
I was just about to stew it.

172
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,840
Go easy on him.

173
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,550
There's no point
in getting angry with a fool,

174
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,240
right?

175
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,440
I'm leaving.

176
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,390
Speak.

177
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,120
Why are you sneaking around
in the middle of the night?

178
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,250
Are you that hungry?

179
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,480
I...

180
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,750
If I tell her

181
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,240
that I need to drink blood,

182
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,440
will she be scared,

183
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,150
or will she hit me badly?

184
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,510
Forget it.

185
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,200
Before I figure out the truth,

186
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,960
I'd better not

187
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,810
talk nonsense in front of her.

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,200
I'm...

189
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,220
hungry.

190
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,480
Coming!

191
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:47,960
This...

192
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,420
This...

193
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,840
Have they arrived?

194
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,640
They're here!

195
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,180
The food supplies are here.

196
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,360
The food supplies are here!

197
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
Everyone,

198
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,790
go get your rations!

199
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,150
Hurry up, the food is being distributed!

200
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,440
Come on!

201
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,400
So much food!

202
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,590
Come quickly!

203
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,030
I guess

204
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,650
you don't know how to face them,

205
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,660
so you came up here to hide.

206
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,720
To them, meeting me

207
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,990
is the greatest fortune of their lives.

208
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,560
They see me as their savior.

209
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,030
But they don't know

210
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,920
that the one who destroyed their lives

211
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,790
is me.

212
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,520
This so-called kindness

213
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,180
is just a debt I owe.

214
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,480
It's been a lie

215
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,830
from start to finish.

216
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,400
But at least you wanted to make amends,

217
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,390
and you've done it.

218
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,910
You're a general,

219
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,770
guarding the border,

220
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,240
following the court's orders.

221
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,520
The killing, the war—

222
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,360
they're not your choice.

223
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,700
And look,

224
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,480
tonight they're drinking and dancing

225
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,600
so happily,

226
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,690
all because of you.

227
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,490
A shooting star!

228
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,550
Make a wish, quick!

229
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,780
What does it mean?

230
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,390
Shooting stars are fleeting but beautiful,

231
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,200
so

232
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,780
they're worth wishing on.

233
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,760
It's alright.

234
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,830
It's gone now.

235
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,000
There's another one!

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,960
Quick!

237
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,080
I wish

238
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,270
for a world without war,

239
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,250
where peace lasts forever.

240
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,080
I've already drunk blood.

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,670
Why do I still feel so unwell?

242
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,870
No way.

243
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,880
How could I take advantage of her
like this?

244
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Let it hurt then.

245
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,870
As long as I stay by her side,

246
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,170
I'll find a way eventually.

247
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,340
Welcome back to camp, General.

248
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,160
Everyone has worked hard today.

249
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,150
Please rise.

250
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,680
Thank you, General.

251
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,480
Military Advisor Qin,

252
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,210
any unusual movements lately?

253
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,450
Early this morning,

254
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,650
a letter arrived from the capital.

255
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,550
[To Li Shuang]

256
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,880
[General's Residence]

257
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,500
Simply handing over the body

258
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,360
and the letter

259
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,430
won't settle this matter.

260
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,400
Jin'an killed Huo Du with his own hands.

261
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,640
We all witnessed it.

262
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,600
The only way to avert this crisis

263
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
is to escort him back to the capital.

264
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,270
Right now,

265
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,870
the Grand General is under house arrest
and has been stripped of his rank.

266
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,320
His Majesty
has always been deeply suspicious.

267
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,080
The Li family and the Changfeng Army

268
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,790
are already in grave danger.

269
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,180
No matter

270
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,210
what that man's intentions were,

271
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,360
killing without orders is a serious crime.

272
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,830
If you, General,

273
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,360
refuse to hand over the culprit,

274
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,850
the next step

275
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,980
will be the destruction
of your entire family.

276
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,030
You're back.

277
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,080
Why are you here?

278
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,050
Waiting for you.

279
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,070
Staying here is so boring.

280
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,750
I guess you've gotten used to

281
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,150
the freedom outside these past few days.

282
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,870
Back in the village,
I was the boss of the kids.

283
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,870
Everyone obeyed me.

284
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,670
But now that I'm back here,

285
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,200
they won't let me do a thing.

286
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,030
I try to cook,

287
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,300
and they're afraid I'll poison the food.

288
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,150
I try to clean,

289
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,450
and they're afraid
I'll plant hidden weapons.

290
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,550
Since I'm going to be staying here,

291
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,200
why don't you

292
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,910
give me some tasks to do?

293
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,840
So you want to work for me?

294
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,250
Then, would you be willing

295
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,670
to die for me?

296
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,670
I was just asking casually.

297
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,310
You don't have to answer.

298
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,460
Have a drink with me.

299
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,480
I've never asked you before.

300
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,410
What are your plans for the future?

301
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,480
Though you've lost all your memories,

302
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,340
you still have a long future ahead

303
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,780
to search for them

304
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,010
and live the life you want.

305
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,240
You've been with me for so long.

306
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,070
I won't treat you unfairly.

307
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,480
Here's some money.

308
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,510
Take it,

309
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,690
leave Lucheng,

310
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,200
and start a small business

311
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,400
to support yourself.

312
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,050
You're driving me away?

313
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,950
I'm not driving you away.

314
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,110
I'm sending you to where you belong.

315
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,270
If I've done something wrong,
just tell me.

316
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,110
I'll change.

317
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,310
My household is full of women.

318
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,550
If you stay,

319
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,600
it'll only spark gossip.

320
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,640
Besides,

321
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,340
with your current status,

322
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,880
you can't return
to the military camp either.

323
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,640
I have no memories.

324
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,290
I can't go anywhere.

325
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,960
And I can't leave you.

326
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,480
I can't live

327
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,550
without you.

328
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,680
You're a man.

329
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,790
You should have ambitions

330
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,030
and care for your family and your country.

331
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,630
Don't always think about
depending on others.

332
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,750
I've got enough weirdness
going on—

333
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,480
my body changing,

334
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,320
my extraordinary strength,

335
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,920
and a lack of control over it.

336
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,790
If I tell her now

337
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,000
that the only way
I can stabilize my condition

338
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,350
is by being near her,

339
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,750
would she believe me?

340
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,500
We haven't known each other for long,

341
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,090
but we've been through a lot together.

342
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,790
Don't you feel

343
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,880
even a little reluctant in your heart?

344
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,590
I've seen many soldiers

345
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,440
die in battle.

346
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,880
Life-and-death partings

347
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,480
are nothing new to me.

348
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,560
I've seen through it all.

349
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,960
Besides,

350
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,550
what we've been through

351
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,240
means nothing.

352
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,790
What if

353
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,440
I could die for you?

354
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,440
Life and death

355
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,720
happen in the blink of an eye.

356
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,240
Survival

357
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,060
is a human instinct.

358
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
Besides, you offer no proof.

359
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,720
Why should I believe you?

360
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340
You're a general.

361
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,030
Your word is law.

362
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,260
If you tell me to leave,

363
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,310
then I'll go.

General,

387
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,690
are you really letting him go?

388
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,840
A major operation is underway tonight.

389
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,920
If he stays,

390
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,920
he'll only make things more dangerous.

391
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,310
I don't get it.

392
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,160
You've always been strict with the troops,

393
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,420
allowing no mistakes.

394
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,470
Why show mercy this time?

395
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,000
He risked his life

396
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,490
to save me and Li Ting multiple times.

397
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,730
With such a debt,

398
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,810
how could I,
out of my own selfish desires,

399
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,420
push him to his death?

400
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,030
But General,

401
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,030
at the heart of it,

402
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,560
it's because His Majesty

403
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,350
mistrusts

404
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,590
the Li family,

405
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,920
which is why he makes things difficult.

406
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,110
If His Majesty's suspicions
aren't cleared,

407
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,480
no matter who we send,

408
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,280
the court will never be satisfied.

409
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,790
From now on,

410
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,370
if His Majesty has any complaints,

411
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,680
all the blame

412
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,750
will fall on me alone.

413
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,960
Report!

414
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,680
General!

415
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,550
General!

416
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,070
I swear, I'm innocent!

417
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,680
Get out of the way!

418
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,350
Behave yourself!

419
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,400
Don't you know who I am?

420
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Behave yourself!

421
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,150
Move!

422
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,960
Let me go!

423
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,120
Hurry up!

424
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,300
Quick!

425
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,120
Go!

426
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,190
Chief,

427
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,020
we found it!

428
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,790
I didn't expect it to be so easy.

429
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,720
It seems
we shouldn't have been so hesitant before.

430
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,960
If we had acted sooner,

431
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,590
we wouldn't have been forced

432
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,070
into such a difficult position today.

433
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,720
Enough.

434
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,590
Wait!

435
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,500
Commandant Luo,

436
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
they've escaped.

437
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:32,860
Damn it!

438
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,800
They didn't fall for our trap.

439
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,770
The fake map is still here.

440
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,070
All of you,

441
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,790
go to the General's Residence immediately

442
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,350
and ensure the deployment map's safety.

443
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,200
Yes, sir!

444
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,470
Thanks to your vigilance, Brother.

445
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,510
That wretch

446
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,560
was actually putting on an act
with Luo Teng,

447
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,520
nearly trapping us in our own game.

448
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,510
Brother,

449
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,840
what should we do now?

450
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,350
Why are you sneaking around?

451
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,450
You're right. Why am I sneaking around?

452
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,450
What are you doing here?

453
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,590
[General's Residence]

454
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:25,890
Search!

455
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,550
Open up!

456
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,170
Anyone here?

457
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,590
Found it.

458
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,850
This must be the right one.

459
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:14,400
Alright,

460
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,430
let's go.

461
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,510
Wait.

462
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,730
A deployment map

463
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,150
is worth thousands of taels.

464
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,260
Tell me,

465
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,900
how much is her head worth?

466
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,980
With such pathetic skills,

467
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,650
you dare to plot against me?

468
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,470
Impossible.

469
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,640
Those who betray their country

470
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,200
have only one fate: death.

471
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,600
With skills that poor,

472
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,220
I have to find a chance to feign weakness.

473
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,880
Look out!

474
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,840
Do it now!

475
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,750
Are you alright?

476
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,790
Why did you come back?

477
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:42,920
I...

478
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,160
I wanted to protect you.

479
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,690
See?

480
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,240
I told you...

481
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,820
I could die for you.

482
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:55,920
Jin'an!

483
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,970
Stop!

484
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,680
Don't run!

485
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,530
Two are dead.

486
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Leaving him alive

487
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,840
is the true killing move.

488
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,130
General, you want to give
the deployment map to the Yao people?

489
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:21,890
Why?

490
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,950
General, are you suggesting

491
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,560
that we deliberately leave a flaw,

492
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,370
turn their own scheme against them,

493
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,930
and trap them?

494
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,550
Huo Du has been hiding
within our army for years.

495
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,550
His accomplices

496
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,230
won't be easy to identify.

497
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,200
The Yao Army is on the move now.

498
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,400
War is inevitable.

499
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,570
Using a fake deployment map as bait

500
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,560
will not only confuse the enemy,

501
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,590
but also help us identify
Huo Du's remaining allies,

502
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,310
so we can capture them all at once

503
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,040
and eliminate future threats.

504
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,450
But normally,

505
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,340
ordinary soldiers
can barely get their hands

506
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,810
on the deployment map.

507
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,310
If we make it too easy,

508
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,360
they'll see right through our plan.

509
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,350
That's why we need a trap within a trap.

510
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,280
The first map they steal too easily
won't be trusted,

511
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,250
but what about the second one
which they fight desperately to take?

512
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,160
General, you're truly the most devious.

513
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,620
I mean... the wisest.

514
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,590
By order of the Yao General,

515
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,270
we are requisitioning
the deployment map of the Changfeng Army.

516
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,550
Anyone who obtains and submits it,

517
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,670
regardless of background,

518
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,740
will be rewarded with 1,000 taels of gold.

519
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,070
With a reward in front
and severe punishment behind,

520
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,310
in the balance,

521
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,080
they have no choice

522
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,790
but to comply.

523
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,680
However,

524
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,150
Commandant Luo will have to suffer.

525
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
I will follow your orders, General.

526
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,010
I was wrong!

527
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
Please stop hitting me! I was wrong!

528
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,310
When we go out later,

529
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,350
act a bit more furious—

530
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,210
like you're cutting ties with me.

531
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,110
[General's Residence]

532
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,180
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

533
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,070
Though the wound is deep,

534
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,790
it didn't hit any vital organs.

535
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,960
Logically,

536
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,930
his pulse shouldn't be this weak.

537
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,460
You seem really worried about him.

538
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,310
It's not that.

539
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,100
He blocked that knife

540
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,720
for my sake.

541
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,210
Get down.

542
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,000
Get down now.

543
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,240
I haven't even started on you yet.

544
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,200
You've been with me for so many years.

545
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,130
How can you have no sense of danger?

546
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,500
Trusting and taking him in so easily.

547
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,480
Who said I trust him?

548
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,110
I trust you.

549
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,950
Anyone who walks out of
the General's Residence alive

550
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,950
must be someone
you've tested and found trustworthy.

551
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,920
But his background is unknown.

552
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,550
Yet, despite his mysterious past,

553
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,480
he resolutely took a knife for you—

554
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,590
any doubts about him should be gone now.

555
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,480
If that knife had struck you instead,

556
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,440
it wouldn't be something

557
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,840
a few remedies could fix.

558
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,430
Come here.

559
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,310
Do you know

560
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,570
what he told me

561
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,000
when he was with me?

562
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,410
What did he say?

563
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,790
He said

564
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,730
he can't leave you.

565
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,900
He's handsome,

566
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,490
and he's devoted to you.

567
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,510
I'd say you two should...

568
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,160
What are you laughing at?

569
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,360
Don't make me hit you!

570
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,720
Always threatening people with violence—

571
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,240
do you forget you're still a young lady,

572
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,590
waiting to get married?

573
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,000
Blood...

574
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,110
Blood...

575
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:00,960
What?

576
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,070
He said...

577
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,140
What did he say?

578
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,720
Blood...

579
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,200
Blood.

580
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,680
Blood?

581
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,030
Blood...

582
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,929
I have read about this before.

583
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,280
Some martial artists

584
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,510
train with blood from a young age,

585
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,139
developing a thirst for it.

586
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,760
If they're severely wounded

587
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,840
and medicine doesn't help,

588
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,170
they'll need blood to sustain their life.

589
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,190
Could this be

590
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,630
why he hasn't woken up yet?

591
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,960
Let me go back
and check the medical texts.

592
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,670
Perhaps

593
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,530
I can find similar records there.

594
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,330
Here,

595
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,030
take it.

596
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,190
You should apply it

597
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,230
to the wound on your neck,

598
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,560
or it could leave a scar.

599
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Blood...

600
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,510
Blood...

601
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
Blood...

602
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
What did you say?

603
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,590
Blood...

604
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,770
What did you say?

605
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,530
You!

606
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,460
Could it be that

607
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,710
the methods in those ancient texts

608
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
actually work?

609
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,550
Look out!

610
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,360
Why did you come back?

611
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,670
I told you

612
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,680
I could die for you.

613
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,960
You really are foolish.

614
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,840
I went to great lengths to send you away

615
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,930
just to keep you away from trouble.

616
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,400
Why did you come back?

617
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,420
Though I can't transform at will
right now,

618
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,790
I was stabbed,

619
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,820
yet I'm recovering so quickly,

620
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,210
and even the discomfort in my chest

621
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,640
has eased considerably.

622
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,590
No,

623
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,460
there has to be more to it.

624
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,450
Could it be that

625
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,110
the one who can ease all my pain

626
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,240
is her?

627
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,000
You're awake.

628
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,590
I feel better now.

629
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,670
Glad to hear that.

630
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,500
Lu Xin told me

631
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,670
that your wound
needs to be dressed regularly

632
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,760
to heal quickly.

633
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,180
What are you doing?

634
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,510
Changing your bandage.

635
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,320
This self-healing ability is so strange.

636
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,090
If she finds out,

637
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,760
she'll definitely send me away again.

638
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,420
You took that stab to protect me,

639
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,630
so I should be the one taking care of you.

640
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,230
Your wound is worse than it was yesterday.
