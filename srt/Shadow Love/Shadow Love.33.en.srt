[Episode 33]

3
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,410
Prince Annan.

4
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,070
Have someone prepare a meat dish

5
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,950
and send it over quickly.

6
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,300
Yes.

7
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,590
Have you kept…

8
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,470
your promises to me?

9
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,820
In my prison camp,

10
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,790
even without you asking,

11
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,050
food and medicine

12
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,090
are well provided.

13
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,960
As for the 2 innocent soldiers
who were killed,

14
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,210
I've ordered proper burials for them.

15
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,140
These are their identity tokens.

16
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,000
Perhaps

17
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,770
you'd like to keep them.

18
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,360
[Lyu Yi]

19
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,170
Let's eat.

20
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,930
What's wrong?

21
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,900
Are you not eating

22
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,579
because you're afraid
I poisoned the food

23
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,040
when you weren't looking?

24
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,400
An honorable person

25
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,700
would never stoop to vile tricks.

26
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,310
I believe

27
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,720
you're the same.

28
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,040
There's something

29
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,650
I'd like to know about.

30
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,430
You've called out a name several times
in your dreams—

31
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,440
Jin'an.

32
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,710
Who is this person?

33
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,320
I found him in the wild.

34
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,990
He lost his memory

35
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,560
and forgot who he was.

36
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,990
So I let him stay in my residence

37
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,020
to do chores.

38
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,560
So that means

39
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,150
he's a servant?

40
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,270
Yes.

41
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,240
A useless servant

42
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,610
who always got into trouble.

43
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,610
But he was a good cook

44
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,500
and knew how to cheer me up.

45
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,510
Afraid I'd get bored eating alone,

46
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,580
he always kept me company—

47
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,330
just like you're doing now.

48
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,070
You actually

49
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,190
care about

50
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,650
a lowly servant so much.

51
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,780
Prince Annan,

52
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,680
have you ever loved a woman?

53
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,670
I protect my country and people,

54
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,230
focused on making my mark.

55
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,520
How could I let romance

56
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,920
hold me back?

57
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,070
So you wouldn't understand…

58
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,930
why I care about him.

59
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,690
I don't need to understand.

60
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,360
But what I do see

61
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,960
is that you're in danger

62
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,490
while the one you care for
is nowhere to be found.

63
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,430
So why do you

64
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,810
still care for him?

65
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,110
It's getting late.

66
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,130
Prince Annan, you should go.

67
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,920
Wait.

68
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,810
Next time you come,

69
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
could you please

70
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,190
bring me a qin?

71
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,070
You're a prisoner of war,

72
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,610
yet you're in the mood for music?

73
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,920
I won't sign
the letter of surrender anyway,

74
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,050
and you won't kill me

75
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,460
or let me go.

76
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,270
Rather than spending my days worrying,

77
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,350
I might as well do something I enjoy

78
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,480
to pass the time.

79
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,930
Besides,

80
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,720
you look a bit like Jin'an.

81
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,010
When you visit me,

82
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,120
it makes me happy.

83
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,950
Don't you dare compare me

84
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,750
to that lowly servant again.

85
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,830
I said half a month,

86
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,030
but with my remarkable skills,

87
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,370
I finished grinding

88
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,040
all 1,000 bundles of herbs

89
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,810
in just

90
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,710
a few days.

91
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,670
Miss Lu, you're packing.

92
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,360
Are you going on a journey?

93
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,510
During my time on Wuling Mountain,

94
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
although I didn't become
a master of medicine,

95
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,510
I did make some progress.

96
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,150
Therefore,

97
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,960
Master, please allow me

98
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,150
to leave the mountain
to practice medicine.

99
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,870
No!

100
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,480
Why not?

101
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,600
No reason.

102
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,080
It's the rule of Wuling Mountain.

103
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,510
What is learned on the mountain

104
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,960
must stay on the mountain.

105
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,000
There have been no exceptions
for hundreds of years.

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,720
Rules

107
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,600
are meant to be broken.

108
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,510
Back in Lucheng,

109
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,180
didn't you save Su Muyang?

110
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,670
If you could do it, why can't I?

111
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,650
Or is it because

112
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,360
Su Muyang is royalty,

113
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,130
so his life is more valuable

114
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,390
than a commoner's?

115
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,360
That's why I regret it!

116
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,600
After I saved him,

117
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,910
he conspired with Jin Wujian

118
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,360
and put Jin'an and Li Shuang in danger.

119
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,240
They almost died.

120
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,960
Saving lives is not wrong!

121
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,600
Why confuse the 2 things?

122
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,750
When you help people

123
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,480
who have suffered from illness recover,

124
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,510
when you see them regain hope

125
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,640
and hear them say thank you sincerely,

126
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,240
don't you feel
a sense of accomplishment?

127
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,270
A sense of accomplishment?

128
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,910
That's just vanity.

129
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,870
I don't care about

130
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,870
worldly success.

131
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,480
Fine!

132
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
I care!

133
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,650
You're lofty and detached.

134
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,960
I'm shallow to the core.

135
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,360
I just want to do my best

136
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,360
to relieve people's suffering

137
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,790
and hear them sincerely thank me.

138
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,750
Enough talk.

139
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,870
Today, you want to leave the mountain,

140
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,670
but I, as your master, forbid it.

141
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,150
If you insist on leaving,

142
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,000
you'll no longer be my disciple.

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,390
Then so be it!

144
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,910
If being your disciple

145
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,120
means following stupid rules,

146
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,080
I'd rather not be.

147
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,360
Get out! Get out!

148
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,080
I...

149
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,240
What's wrong?

150
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,800
What's wrong?

151
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,920
I ground

152
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,400
1,000 bundles of herbs in 7 days.

153
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,830
My arms are so sore.

154
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,540
And you're talking back to me.

155
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,410
The pain-relieving ointment I developed.

156
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,820
Try it.

157
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,690
See if it works instantly.

158
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,800
Using it on a heartless person like you

159
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,050
is really a waste.

160
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,360
Go, go, go.

161
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,950
Go by yourself.

162
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,900
Go, go, go!

163
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,790
Go by yourself.

164
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,710
Prince Annan,

165
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,560
have you ever loved a woman?

166
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,750
You look a bit like Jin'an.

167
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,960
When you visit me,

168
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,030
it makes me happy.

169
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,040
Prince Annan,

170
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,440
what can I do for you?

171
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,480
I remember you said

172
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,800
after the defeat in Lucheng,

173
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,080
you searched everywhere for me

174
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,360
and finally

175
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,360
found me in Taijin.

176
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,920
Yes.

177
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,740
That's right.

178
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,830
Why do you ask?

179
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,030
During your search in Taijin,

180
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,550
did you ever meet

181
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,550
a man who looked much like me,

182
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,030
named Jin'an?

183
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,000
Looked like you?

184
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,670
Impossible.

185
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,270
Absolutely impossible.

186
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,970
You have the looks

187
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,070
and bearing

188
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,950
no ordinary man could ever match.

189
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,270
I never saw

190
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,030
the man you spoke of.

191
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,070
Prince Annan,

192
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,910
why are you suddenly asking about this?

193
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,710
A few days ago, in the courtyard,

194
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,750
I had a brief conversation with Li Shuang.

195
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,840
Strangely enough,

196
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,610
she mentioned some matters

197
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,120
I knew nothing of,

198
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,520
yet they felt so real—

199
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,540
like I'd lived through them myself.

200
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,790
The Taijin people are

201
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,910
cunning

202
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,370
and silver-tongued.

203
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,280
Prince Annan,

204
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,410
we haven't avenged our state yet.

205
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,890
Don't let her mislead you.

206
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,670
Prince Annan!

207
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,640
You startled me. What's the matter?

208
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,480
Speak slowly.

209
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,390
Prince Annan,

210
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,750
something's happened in the courtyard.

211
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,450
Prince Annan.

212
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,000
What's wrong with you guys?

213
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,840
In…

214
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,620
in the house.

215
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,990
Who taught you to play the qin like that?

216
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,540
Self-taught.

217
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,650
If you're bored,

218
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,350
take a walk in the courtyard.

219
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,590
Or,

220
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,200
I'll have someone bring you some books.

221
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,240
But the qin—

222
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,600
don't play it again.

223
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,510
Why not?

224
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,480
You excel in both civil and martial arts,

225
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,740
but you lack one thing:

226
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,950
self-awareness.

227
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,610
But unfortunately,

228
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,510
I just love

229
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,260
playing the qin.

230
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,000
Besides, playing the qin

231
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,740
nurtures the heart and mind.

232
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,760
Prince Annan, when you have time,

233
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,960
you should play it too

234
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,500
to ease that violent temper of yours.

235
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
These medicines—

236
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,960
some are to take, some are to apply.
All necessary.

237
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,200
Being picky

238
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,470
will only delay your recovery.

239
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,540
Don't tell me
the renowned general of Taijin

240
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,050
has trouble drinking bitter decoctions.

241
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,790
Ridiculous!

242
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,990
Why would I have trouble with that?

243
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,310
It's sweet.

244
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,920
The other day,

245
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,829
I noticed you applied
all the wound medicines

246
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,630
but didn't take the decoctions.

247
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,030
I guessed
you didn't like the bitter taste,

248
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,510
so I had honey added to it.

249
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,580
If you'd had the courage
to try it even once these past few days,

250
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,120
you'd have known it wasn't bitter at all.

251
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,080
You added…

252
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,440
honey in the decoction?

253
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,540
Don't look at me like that.

254
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,550
As my prisoner of war,

255
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,950
you need to be in good health.

256
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,270
Wait.

257
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,570
It's very kind of you

258
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,440
to say that.

259
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,400
Let me play a tune

260
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,960
to thank you.

261
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,510
No need.

262
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,460
I'll take my leave.

263
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,210
Wait.

264
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,800
I've said I'll play for you,

265
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,750
so you can't leave without listening.

266
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,680
Besides,

267
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,600
it's Jin'an's favorite piece.

268
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,070
Since he's not here,

269
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,500
you'll listen on his behalf

270
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
and see if I play well.

271
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,310
What do you think?

272
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,830
Wonderful.

273
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,720
Wait.

274
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,300
Since you like it,

275
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,090
I'll play a few more pieces.

276
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,200
The qin is an elegant instrument.

277
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,750
How can you play it like this?

278
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,920
Was it that bad?

279
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,630
Sit properly.

280
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,220
Hands in position.

281
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,980
Curl your fingers.

282
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,920
Good.

283
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,280
Let's begin.

284
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,300
This is how you play.

285
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,060
Not so good.

286
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
You have no taste.

287
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,410
Just because you didn't get praised,

288
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,670
Prince Annan,

289
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,350
there's no need to be so upset.

290
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,090
Why don't you

291
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,380
play a few more pieces?

292
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,240
I'll try to appreciate them.

293
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,070
I respect you
because you're a military commander too.

294
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,530
I won't treat you harshly,

295
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,830
but you must know your place.

296
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,240
I'm not

297
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,730
keeping you here for nothing.

298
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,060
Your words remind me.

299
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,110
I must eat.

300
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,030
When I eat,

301
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,390
the Changfeng Army eats with me.

302
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,090
Since keeping me serves a great purpose,

303
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,310
I presume you won't

304
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,600
begrudge me a little food.

305
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,120
Don't play useless tricks.

306
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,050
I've seen

307
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,620
plenty of women before.

308
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,610
What kinds of women have you seen before?

309
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,580
Wait.

310
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,090
I'm out of candy.

311
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,110
He really ground
1,000 bundles of herbs.

312
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,260
So many of them.

313
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,790
I'll definitely repay you later.

314
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,270
I'm taking them.

315
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,230
[Wuling Mountain]

316
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,270
You've got some nerve…

317
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,680
to steal the herbs.

318
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,960
It's not stealing.

319
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,960
During my time on Wuling Mountain,

320
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,290
I've worked out plenty of prescriptions.

321
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,040
You should give me something in return.

322
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,520
These are just the most common herbs

323
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,730
here on Wuling Mountain.

324
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,750
You won't need them
for your precious pills.

325
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,640
But in my pharmacy,

326
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,580
they're really important.

327
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,110
I owe you.

328
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,200
Name your price.

329
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,800
Money or my life?

330
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,080
I'll repay you one day.

331
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,200
One day?

332
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,480
Will you even be able to repay me?

333
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,410
Your arms are fine now?

334
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,670
The ointment I made

335
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,640
worked well, didn't it?

336
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,070
It barely helped.

337
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,020
I recovered quickly

338
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,400
because I'm strong.

339
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,880
I've decided

340
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,920
to go down the mountain

341
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,160
with you today

342
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,860
to prevent

343
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,550
your strange prescriptions

344
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,780
from harming people

345
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,260
and ruining Wuling Mountain's reputation.

346
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,240
What are you waiting for?

347
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,400
Keep up.

348
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,830
I knew you couldn't bear to part with me.

349
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:32,860
Let's go.

350
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,160
Look.

351
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,790
The sun is rising.

352
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,920
We've watched the sunset together,

353
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,400
and now the sunrise too.

354
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,200
Perfect.

355
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,670
Forgive me, Prince Annan.

356
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,240
I'll practice harder when I return

357
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,570
and will never play the wrong notes again.

358
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,720
Compared to her,

359
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,220
your mistake

360
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,880
is nothing.

361
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,800
You may leave.

362
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,920
Prince Annan,

363
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,450
the medicine is ready.

364
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,200
Since you came back
from the courtyard last time,

365
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,530
you've been drinking
the calming decoction for days.

366
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,590
That girl's qin playing is dreadful.

367
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,510
Could it be some kind of dark magic?

368
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,710
Don't talk nonsense!

369
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,960
Prince Annan,

370
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,160
Li Shuang

371
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,880
still refuses to surrender.

372
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,720
She's probably just stalling for time.

373
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,590
Rather than wasting effort on her,

374
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,160
we should

375
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,310
take the initiative

376
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,170
and catch the enemy off guard.

377
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,310
That last battle—

378
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,450
why do you think

379
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,750
we fought it?

380
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,870
Isn't it obvious?

381
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,000
To drive out the Taijin Army

382
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,070
and defend our land.

383
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,130
That's one reason.

384
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,830
The second reason

385
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,040
is to make Taijin
see the situation clearly

386
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,570
and reopen peace talks.

387
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,020
Those thousands of captured soldiers

388
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,040
are our brothers who fought alongside us.

389
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,010
I must save them.

390
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,680
By the way, Prince Annan,

391
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,270
the house where Miss Li is held

392
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,530
is quite dilapidated.

393
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,070
The roof has several leaks.

394
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,240
The winds have been strong lately.

395
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,170
Shall we send someone to repair it?

396
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,380
Li Shuang has an iron will.

397
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,230
A bit of wind is nothing to her.

398
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,680
Let her suffer.

399
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,490
Let's see how long she can hold on.

400
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,790
Understood.

401
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,760
You may go.

402
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,340
How many times have I told you?

403
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,750
Never mention that woman
in front of Prince Annan again.

404
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,480
Why not?

405
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,790
Haven't you noticed?

406
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,960
Prince Annan seems

407
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,680
to be doubting what happened to him

408
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
in Taijin.

409
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,870
This woman

410
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,350
was once his wife.

411
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,960
If she uses this

412
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,970
to undermine our troops' morale,

413
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,860
it could ruin everything.

414
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,560
Keep your mouth shut.

415
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,200
[Lucheng]

416
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,640
Physician, Physician.

417
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,750
-Physician Lu, thank you.
-Physician Lu.

418
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,640
Look at my hand.

419
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,400
It's healed!

420
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,720
Look at my eyes.

421
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,960
They're not healed yet,

422
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,480
but I feel so happy inside.

423
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,230
You were gone for so long.

424
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,320
When you weren't in Lucheng,

425
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,920
we didn't even dare to get sick

426
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,070
because there was no physician
as good as you.

427
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,820
Getting sick isn't something to wish for.

428
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,420
I'd rather close my clinic

429
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,920
if it meant all of you

430
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,350
could stay healthy.

431
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,440
I've prescribed some medicine for you.

432
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,790
Your constipation is still
the same old problem.

433
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,920
Take your medicine regularly,

434
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,990
exercise more,
sleep early, and rise early.

435
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,850
It can still be cured completely.

436
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,530
Alright.

437
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,560
Thank you, Physician Lu.

438
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,580
Take it on time.

439
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,760
Thank you.

440
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,920
I trust your medical skills,

441
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,880
but

442
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,200
who is this person?

443
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,800
Yeah.

444
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,660
He doesn't look trustworthy.

445
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,750
Ridiculous!

446
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,150
I'm handsome and charming.

447
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,830
How can you say I don't look trustworthy?

448
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,070
Actually,

449
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,720
she...

450
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,390
Though she has a gift
for studying medicine,

451
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,150
without my guidance,

452
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,030
how could she be so skilled today?

453
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,880
He thinks he's better than Physician Lu.

454
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,680
Physician Lu,

455
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,410
there are so many frauds
in jianghu these days.

456
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
You should be careful

457
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,720
about who you hire.

458
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,310
That's right.

459
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,350
Yes, don't get deceived.

460
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,710
What are you dawdling for?

461
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,080
Alright, everyone,

462
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,210
I know you're concerned about me.

463
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,550
He's just…

464
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,910
my new assistant.

465
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,080
I see.

466
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,070
I've already tested his character.

467
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,040
He's reliable.

468
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,270
It's just that for now,

469
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,550
he's not familiar

470
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,550
with your chronic conditions,

471
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,640
so he can only

472
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,070
assist with minor tasks.

473
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,960
However,

474
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,440
training under me,

475
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,350
he'll definitely improve

476
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,640
his medical skills.

491
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,310
but who knows when we'll meet again?

492
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,310
Lucheng is not safe anymore.

493
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,920
You should

494
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,680
find another place to settle down soon.

495
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,510
Why? What happened?

496
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,720
You haven't heard?

497
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,110
They say Prince Annan of the Yao State,

498
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,510

00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,640

on the battlefield.

You should move quickly too.

507
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,440
Yes, move away quickly.

508
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440

Since I am so incompetent,

may I ask which of you here

00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,750
is willing to lead troops to the border

564
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,250
and win back
the so-called dignity for Taijin?

565
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,920
What?

566
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,110
Why are you all silent now?

00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,480
Unfortunately, after serving
in court for so long

570
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,400
and getting paid for doing nothing,

571
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,920
you've started to disregard
the suffering people

572
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,510
and the lives of soldiers
on the front line,

573
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,510
insisting on fighting battles
you know cannot be won!

574
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,920
Your Majesty,

575
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,000
we're in a deadlock now.

576
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,660
Peace talks

577
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,150
are the only way to save our state
and bring peace to our people.

578
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,660
Please allow me

579
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,320
to serve as an envoy

580
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,000
and personally escort prisoners of war

581
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,330
to the front lines

582
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,720
to negotiate peace with the Yao State.

583
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,180
Previously,

584
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,760
when the Yao State sent
an envoy for peace talks,

585
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,070
we refused him.

586
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,030
Now,

587
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,440
if the tables turn,

588
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,250
they'll surely make outrageous demands.

589
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,190
How great a price must we pay then?

590
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,320
General Li,

591
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,000
can the Li family

592
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,470
and the Changfeng Army

593
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,230
bear the consequences?

594
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,840
If I do anything
that humiliates the state,

595
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,180
let it be deemed treason.

596
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:12,930
My entire family

597
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,290
will accept execution

598
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,260
without complaint.

599
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,050
Your request is granted.

600
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,190
[Diligence and Benevolence]

601
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

602
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,220
Thank you, Grand General,

603
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,920
for putting on a show

604
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,630
with me in court today.

605
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,550
The flood crisis affects
people's livelihoods.

606
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,150
Under these circumstances,

607
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,950
ending the war to rest and rebuild

608
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,320
is the only right path.

609
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,420
However,

610
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,440
as the ruler,

611
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,780
my word carries weight,

612
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,110
and I can't go back on it.

613
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,190
Even if my previous order
to wage war was a mistake,

614
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,190
I cannot publicly change my stance.

615
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,800
So you,

616
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,220
Grand General,

617
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,710
had to take the brunt

618
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,260
and become the target of criticism.

619
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,450
I've pledged
to serve the state until I die.

620
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,800
With the state in crisis,

621
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,760
my reputation is nothing.

622
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,630
Besides, in this matter,

623
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,360
I have my personal motives.

624
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,760
Thank you, Your Majesty,

625
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,050
for allowing me to save my daughter.

626
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:27,850
Shuang is now

627
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,150
imprisoned.

628
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,550
Isn't it also because of me?

629
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,760
How could I

630
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,670
possibly accept your thanks?

631
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,890
Your Majesty is too modest.

632
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,550
I still remember when I was a child,

633
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,360
I spent time at the General's Residence,

634
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,440
learning from you

635
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,360
with Shuang.

636
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,880
Sometimes I wonder,

637
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,480
since I ascended the throne,

638
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,100
whether my deeds

639
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,920
have lived up to

640
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,920
the 3 words written
by the founding emperor:

641
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,880
diligence and benevolence.

642
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,280
The past is the past.

643
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,410
Dwelling on it serves no purpose.

644
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,600
From now on,

645
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,760
as long as Your Majesty stays true
to your conscience

646
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,920
and to your people,

647
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,640
Taijin will be at peace.

648
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,480
Father.

649
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,030
Ting.

650
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,030
It's so late.

651
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,150
What is it?

652
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,610
What's wrong, Ting?

653
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,660
You're a grown man now.

654
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,590
Don't hug me like a kid.

655
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,070
Father,

656
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,110
are you going to the Yao State

657
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,840
to fight a war?

658
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,020
I'm going to negotiate peace.

659
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,300
For the peace and prosperity of Taijin,

660
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,900
there should be no more wars.

661
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,800
Prince Annan

662
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,800
is Jin'an, isn't he?

663
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,960
If you go to the Yao State

664
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,840
and see him,

665
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,280
tell him this for me:

666
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,230
if he dares harm you
or Shuang in the slightest,

667
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,760
I will kill him myself.

668
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,840
Ting,

669
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,360
you're grown now.

670
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,590
There are things you must remember.

671
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,760
There are truths

672
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,360
you must understand.

673
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,440
Whenever there is war,

674
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,110
bloodshed and sacrifice are inevitable.

675
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,320
On the battlefield,

676
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,280
life and death are beyond our control.

677
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,670
Shuang and I

678
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,130
lead troops into battle

679
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,840
to end wars,

680
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,770
not for hatred or killing.

681
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,080
Do you

682
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,070
understand this?

683
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,960
Then Shuang…

684
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,190
she will return safely,

685
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,150
won't she?

686
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,670
I will make sure your sister

687
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,510
returns safely.
