00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:40,840
[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,950
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,410
My Lord, please calm down.

4
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,479
Calm down?

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,759
Li Shuang showed me such disrespect.

6
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,680
How can I possibly calm down?

7
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,190
To upset yourself so much

8
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,039
over a criminal's daughter

9
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,150
is not worth it.

10
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,840
Had I known Li Shuang was so arrogant,

11
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,680
I'd have given her dozens more strokes.

12
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,430
You,

13
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,310
write a letter to the court at once.

14
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,870
Report that the one who killed Huo Du
is hiding in the Changfeng Army.

15
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,530
If Li Shuang dares shield him,

16
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,750
I'd like to see
how she's going to pull that off.

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,360
My Lord,

18
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,660
that's not advisable.

19
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,240
Li Shuang must know

20
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,050
that he was just a servant,

21
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,760
and even if he were handed to the court,

22
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,340
His Majesty wouldn't be satisfied.

23
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,750
Yet to protect him,

24
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,280
she fell out with you in public,

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,410
even at the risk of crossing Prince Li.

26
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,350
Looks like that boy

27
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,350
means a great deal to her.

28
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,120
Have you looked into his background?

29
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,190
His name is Jin'an.

30
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,190
I heard that Li Shuang
took him back a while ago.

31
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,240
He's homeless,

32
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,780
a useless wretch with no martial skills.

33
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,650
No martial skills?

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,150
Then how did he kill Huo Du?

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,060
I've already investigated it.

36
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,530
It was just an accident.

37
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,550
They say
he merely pushed Huo Du accidentally,

38
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,560
and that worthless fool just died.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Sit. Tell me more.

40
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,790
So you're suggesting

41
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,940
that I do Li Shuang a favor and let it go?

42
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,030
Exactly, My Lord.

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,310
Although Li Wei has been demoted,

44
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,030
the Li family and the Changfeng Army

45
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,190
are not to be underestimated.

46
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,310
If you can persuade

47
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,630
Li Shuang to align with Prince Li,

48
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,560
His Highness will surely be pleased,

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
and you'll win

50
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,150
His Highness's favor.

51
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,520
If Li Shuang still refuses to cooperate,

52
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,470
you can bide your time to deal with her

53
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
and Jin'an later.

54
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,160
Send word to the General's Residence.

55
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,670
Tell them I'll pay a visit

56
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,960
later today.

57
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,200
Yes.

58
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,280
Who does Li Zhangyi think he is?

59
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,860
He hurt you so badly.

60
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,700
You always worry about me.

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
But after all these years by my side,

62
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,320
you should be used to it.

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,180
Don't I always get injured

64
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,030
now and then?

65
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,120
How could I ever get used to it?

66
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,600
You're my best friend.

67
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,680
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

68
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,070
At worst,

69
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,140
I'll be more careful.

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,140
I just need to be more careful.

71
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,130
You're always trying to be tough.

72
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,730
I'm leaving now.

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,680
Remember to apply the ointment.

74
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,409
Don't worry.

75
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,659
I'll be fine soon.

76
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,670
What's wrong?

77
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,120
Nothing.

78
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,560
Take care on the road.

79
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:53,920
I'm off.

80
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,070
Shuang,

81
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,560
it's over between you
and the Crown Prince.

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,560
Rather than dwelling on the past,

83
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,790
you should let it go

84
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,600
and cherish what you have now.

85
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,000
Mr. Ji.

86
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,680
Miss.

87
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,230
Although this is the General's Residence,

88
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,720
it's also where Shuang lives.

89
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,050
With women everywhere,

90
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,830
your frequent visits

91
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:21,970
may not be proper.

92
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,600
Miss,

93
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,810
you misunderstand.

94
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,050
I'm here to report
something important to General.

95
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,000
Judging from your expression

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,630
and gait,

97
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,210
it doesn't seem like an urgent matter

98
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,070
that requires a personal visit.

99
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,140
You know best
if there's any misunderstanding.

100
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,720
I am

101
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
just offering a friendly reminder.

102
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,390
Just now,

103
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,480
I took matters into my own hands.

104
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,280
You don't blame me?

105
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,830
You owned up to it.

106
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,180
In that situation,

107
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,360
you stepped out and took the blame.

108
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,560
Why would I blame you?

109
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,420
But what you did today

110
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,750
has pulled you

111
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,890
into this power struggle.

112
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,800
They won't

113
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,690
let you off easily.

114
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,730
Li Zhangyi is Prince Li's man.

115
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,630
Prince Li is

116
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,070
both favored

117
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,990
and trusted by His Majesty.

118
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,210
Why didn't you compromise?

119
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,820
Prince Li is ambitious

120
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,730
and aspires to be the crown prince.

121
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,830
If he truly gains military power,

122
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,490
he will certainly start a war.

123
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,000
When that day comes,

124
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,760
it's the common folks who will suffer.

125
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,830
Since ancient times,

126
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,750
the fight for the throne
has always been bloody.

127
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,600
Perhaps you're just a pawn too.

128
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,700
Why get yourself involved?

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,680
Perhaps

130
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,390
I am just a pawn.

131
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,800
But I don't want to be involved
in court politics.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,750
I only know

133
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,100
that behind me stand the Li family

134
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,280
and the Changfeng Army.

135
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,370
All I want is to protect

136
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,270
the people I should protect.

137
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,520
I decided to come back

138
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,850
because I wanted to face this with you.

139
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,780
It's my fault that I failed

140
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,460
to protect you—

141
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,250
letting Li Zhangyi hurt you like this.

142
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,560
Being in the eye of the storm,

143
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,150
I'm bound to suffer a little.

144
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:16,990
Gen…

145
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,670
General.

146
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,790
Li Zhangyi has sent word.

147
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,720
Tonight,

148
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,420
he'll visit you in person.

149
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,410
Make the arrangements.

150
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,790
Prepare a banquet for him.

151
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,200
Yes.

152
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,110
Your wound has opened again.

153
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,070
Let me bandage it for you.

154
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,550
It might hurt a bit.

155
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,000
Let me attend tonight's banquet

156
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,920
with you.

157
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,190
You said
I'm already involved in this struggle.

158
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,120
If you hide me away on purpose,

159
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,600
Li Zhangyi

160
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,900
certainly won't let it go.

161
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,980
Besides, if I'm there,

162
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,080
I can protect you.

163
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,590
Protect me? How?

164
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,170
You're as weak as a kitten now,

165
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,750
and you've lost the supernatural strength
you had as a child.

166
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,480
How are you going to protect me?

167
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,970
Last time you took a blade for me

168
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,750
and barely survived.

169
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,670
Instead of risking your life for me,

170
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
I'd rather

171
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,080
you stay alive and well.

172
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,150
As the mastermind behind everything,

173
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,390
she surely knows
you're bound by the blood pact

174
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,520
and can't leave her.

175
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,550
She wants you to obey her willingly.

176
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,760
What's wrong?

177
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,550
Nothing.

178
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:39,790
Don't move.

179
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
You're bleeding.

180
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,670
If I still had some of my strength,

181
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,730
I could at least do something for you.

182
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,440
But things are so unpredictable with me,

183
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
and I might never return to how I was.

184
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,120
I'm completely useless now.

185
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,170
Why are you still willing
to keep me by your side?

186
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,510
Most of the women

187
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,910
in my residence

188
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,320
are homeless castaways.

189
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,320
Since you have nowhere to go,

190
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,840
you might as well stay here for now.

191
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,670
Besides,

192
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
there's still

193
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,180
the blood pact between us.

194
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,910
There's a dense forest outside Lucheng.

195
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,720
Three days from now,

196
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,390
you must find a way

197
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,320
to bring Li Shuang there.

198
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,910
Only then

199
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,350
can I have a chance
to break your blood pact.

200
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,630
To you,

201
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,030
is this blood pact

202
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,120
a blessing

203
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,030
or a curse?

204
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,200
If it could be broken,

205
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,120
would you try?

206
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:11,930
Or…

207
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,530
would you still choose to keep me here?

208
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,670
Mr. Ji.

209
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,240
How is General?

210
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,240
Her wound's been dressed.

211
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
Nothing serious.

212
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,390
What did you

213
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,120
and General do

214
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,750
in Ninglan?

215
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,970
You're her right-hand man.

216
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,320
Why are you asking

217
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,440
an outsider like me?

218
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,930
Wouldn't it be quicker

219
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,330
to ask her directly?

220
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,820
When you speak of General,

221
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,240
show some respect.

222
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,530
Exercising your authority

223
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,440
on the battlefield is not enough,

224
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,700
and now you're forcing me
to be grateful?

225
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,200
You have no right
to complain about General.

226
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,400
If it weren't for you,

227
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,550
she wouldn't have been punished today.

228
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,790
Your past is suspicious.

229
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,590
She already showed you mercy
by sparing your life.

230
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,320
Before leaving for Ninglan,

231
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,490
she even asked me to find your portrait

232
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,080
and look into your past,

233
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,660
just to give you a surprise.

234
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,750
Why did she do that?

235
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,960
You saved Young Master.

236
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,880
That makes her indebted to you.

237
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,950
If you dare use that debt of gratitude

238
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,200
and be rude to her,

239
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,790
I'll kill you myself.

240
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,840
She cares so much about me,

241
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,270
yet I let others mislead me

242
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,770
and doubted her.

243
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,510
My sharp senses

244
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,830
are back.

245
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,170
General,

246
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,480
Lord Li has arrived.

247
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,970
General, I gave you strokes today.

248
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,880
Though it was official business,

249
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
I fear it might have offended you

250
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,830
and damaged our bond as colleagues.

251
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,120
I hope you won't take offense.

252
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,880
You overthink it, My Lord.

253
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,250
Achievements should be rewarded.

254
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,580
Mistakes should be punished.

255
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,710
That's the rule of the Changfeng Army.

256
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,720
Speaking of rules,

257
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,810
tell me then,

258
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,560
is Jin'an killing Huo Du

259
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:21,960
an achievement…

260
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,890
or a mistake?

261
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,110
I was just joking.

262
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,410
The Changfeng Army is known
for its strict discipline.

263
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,370
If you insist on protecting him,

264
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,270
you must have your reasons.

265
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,640
It's just that

266
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,070
when I think of Mr. Li,

267
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,410
who has illustrious military achievements

268
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,210
yet is affected because of this,

269
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,490
I feel bad for him.

270
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,140
This dagger is forged of cold iron,

271
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,100
sharp enough to cut through steel.

272
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,720
The pearl on its hilt
is from the southern seas—

273
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,800
a once-in-a-century find.

274
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,240
Prince Li,

275
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,070
knowing your fondness for fine weapons,

276
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,970
had this dagger made

277
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,360
especially for you.

278
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,920
Prince Li is

279
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,210
of noble rank.

280
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,750
His gift is

281
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,070
lavish indeed.

282
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,090
Unfortunately,

283
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,030
I,

284
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,110
as a rough warrior,

285
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,150
am not used to such delicate things.

286
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,230
I'm afraid I can't accept

287
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,940
His Highness's kindness.

288
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,530
General Li,

289
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,640
you truly don't know what's good for you.

290
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,350
Have you forgotten your place

291
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,080
after being admired for so long

292
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,540
at the border?

293
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,400
Lord Li,

294
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
you are mistaken.

295
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,070
The Li family
is Taijin's loyal subject.

296
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,290
The Changfeng Army

297
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,730
consists of Taijin citizens.

298
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,860
For generations,

299
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,890
we've only sought to defend Taijin.

300
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,770
We know

301
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,720
our duty

302
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and have never forgotten our place.

303
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,200
My Lord,

304
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,560
General Li is devoted
to serving the country.

305
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
That's a blessing to Taijin.

306
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,350
Indeed,

307
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,030
I came today

308
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,110
just to have a simple meal

309
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,720
and offer my apologies.

310
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,090
I didn't expect

311
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,700
to upset you again, General.

312
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,830
My bad.

313
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
My bad.

314
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,000
Just sitting here eating and drinking
is so boring.

315
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,830
Why not

316
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,140
arrange some entertainment?

317
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,440
No girl in your residence

318
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,480
is ordinary.

319
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,250
I'm afraid

320
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,350
they can't sing or dance.

321
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,960
I heard that you're skilled

322
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,400
in riding and archery.

323
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,170
As it happens,

324
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,070
I know a thing or two about them.

325
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,480
Why don't we

326
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,720
have a contest?

327
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,710
What do you say?

328
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,830
Lord Li,

329
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,720
General is injured

330
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,070
and shouldn't draw a bow.

331
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,000
Please allow me

332
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,030
to take her place.

333
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,070
Generals get injured

334
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,110
in battle all the time,

335
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,780
but the war still goes on.

336
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,550
Surely they wouldn't

337
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,010
surrender just because of

338
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,710
an injury.

339
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,830
-But...
-Ji Ran,

340
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,490
stand down.

341
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,730
Don't spoil the fun for Lord Li.

342
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,310
Yes.

343
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,160
Lord Li,

344
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:06,840
please.

345
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,880
General,

346
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,100
since it's a contest,

347
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,400
shouldn't we

348
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,100
place a wager to make it more interesting?

349
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,640
My Lord, what do you have in mind?

350
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,990
If I win,

351
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,410
you must accept

352
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,370
the precious dagger from Prince Li.

353
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,310
And if you lose?

354
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,240
If you lose,

355
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,570
you'll drop all charges against Jin'an.

356
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,330
As for Huo Du

357
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,020
colluding with the Yao State,

358
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,960
I will give His Majesty

359
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,620
a satisfactory explanation.

360
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,110
Report!

361
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,910
Lord Li scored nine points.

362
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,070
Seven points.

363
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,270
Eight points.

364
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,030
Nine points.

365
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,480
Six points.

366
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,530
A total of 39 points.

367
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,640
General,

368
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,560
you'd better think it through.

369
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,540
With Prince Li's help in the capital,

370
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,340
your father

371
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,800
would surely suffer less.

372
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,350
Since General's wager concerns me,

373
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,810
I should be the one

374
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,440
to shoot the arrows.

375
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,110
What do you think, Lord Li?

376
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,200
Your fate

377
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,400
should be in your own hands.

378
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,610
But if you take her place,

379
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,120
the rules are broken,

380
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,510
and the wager

381
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,580
must double.

382
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,450
Anything you say, My Lord.

383
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:18,750
Very well.

384
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,030
Then…

385
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,350
we'll wager your life.

386
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:22,970
Lord Li!

387
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,020
As you wish.

388
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,010
Missed.

389
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,970
Zero points.

390
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,640
10 points.

391
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,590
10 points.

392
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,780
10 points.

393
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,160
10 points.

394
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,440
Total of 40 points.

395
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,430
Since

396
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,430
we had a bet,

397
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,800
I hope you

398
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,690
will honor your agreement.

399
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,240
Fine.

400
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,630
Let's go.

401
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,240
You've been by my side for so long,

402
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,160
yet I had no idea

403
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,600
you had such remarkable skills.

404
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,240
Your wound is bleeding again.

405
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,640
Let me bandage it for you.

406
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,140
You deliberately
missed the target earlier.

407
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,270
You were testing me.

408
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,110
He threatened you with your father,

409
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,760
so I had to know where your heart lies.

410
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,400
You…

411
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,400
I heard it.

412
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,260
Where my heart lies has never changed.

413
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,030
Do you think I only care

414
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,030
about my father?

415
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,480
I care about your life too.

416
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,440
We've only

417
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,790
known each other for a few months.

418
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,480
I shouldn't

419
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,000
mean so much to you.

420
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,590
Why do you care so much

421
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,010
about whether I live or die?

422
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,140
In these chaotic times,

423
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,800
staying alive is hard enough.

424
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,600
How could I let you die so easily?

425
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,100
Ji Ran told me

426
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,810
you went to Zang Budu

427
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,880
to find out about my past,

428
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,540
not to investigate me.

429
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,180
Why didn't you tell me?

430
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,130
I haven't uncovered anything yet.

431
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,000
There was nothing to say.

432
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,590
Perhaps you're right.

433
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,830
We've not known each other long.

434
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,400
I shouldn't have pried.

435
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,310
It's my fault

436
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,270
this time.

437
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,820
If I'd had more patience

438
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,410
or thought things through,

439
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,050
maybe I wouldn't have misunderstood you.

440
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,410
I overestimated myself…

441
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,020
and underestimated you.

442
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,930
Then tell me—

443
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,190
back in Ninglan,
you were already acting strange.

444
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,720
After we returned, you kept testing me.

445
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,520
What is it you're hiding from me?

446
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,440
That's the whole story.

447
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,710
Do you have anything to say?

448
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,710
You already have doubts.

449
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,600
I have nothing to say.

450
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,720
Since I lost my memory,

451
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,160
that was the first time
someone had mentioned my past.

452
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,270
Naturally, I had to think it over.

453
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,610
But I figured it out.

454
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,870
I trust you.

455
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,080
You've lost all your memories.

456
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,880
What makes you trust me?

457
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,440
Without memories,

458
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,380
I still have my intuition.

459
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,030
You've never mistreated me

460
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,230
or anyone around you.

461
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,830
I trust what I see

462
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,480
and what I feel.

463
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,180
What about the blood pact?

464
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,470
It inflicts excruciating pain on you

465
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,880
and robs you of freedom.

466
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,500
If it could be broken,

467
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,800
why not give it a try?

468
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,680
If it can be broken,

469
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,120
I'll find the way myself

470
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,940
instead of putting you in danger with me.

471
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,140
Have you considered…

472
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,690
maybe that person

473
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,410
was telling the truth?

474
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,220
I want to tell you

475
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,400
that even if the blood pact

476
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,060
was deliberately made by you,

477
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,010
I still want to have

478
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,930
a deeper bond with you.

479
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,980
She keeps you by her side

480
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,440
just to use you

481
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,880
and turn you

482
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,970
into a bloodthirsty beast.

483
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,150
Since I've chosen to trust Li Shuang,

484
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,240
I can't let him influence me.

485
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,520
Master.

486
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,550
It's still early.

487
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,240
That shadow puppet

488
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,370
might show up later.

489
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,330
You still don't understand human nature.

490
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,480
I gave him three days.

491
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,110
If he meant to come,

492
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,460
he'd be here already.

493
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,850
Empress Dowager's 10-day limit
is almost up.

494
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,920
What should we do?

495
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,590
Ultimately,

496
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,060
a shadow puppet can't live
without their blood master.

497
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,420
If we control Li Shuang,

498
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,540
the shadow puppet
will be easy to deal with.

499
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,110
I've changed your dressing.

500
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,790
Be careful these days.

501
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,920
Don't get injured again,

502
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,650
understand?

503
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,480
Sorry for troubling you.

504
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,750
Don't be absurd.

505
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,610
There's no trouble at all.

506
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,880
Your quick recovery

507
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,830
is the best reward

508
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,230
for me as your physician.

509
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,560
I'll write you a prescription.

510
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,960
Take the medicine for a few days.

511
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,640
It's just a superficial wound.

512
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,160
Why do I need to take medicine?

513
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,220
That's exactly it.

514
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,220
Normally, this kind of wound

515
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
would almost be healed in a few days.

516
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,570
Why is it healing so slowly this time?

517
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,350
Your body must not be

518
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,720
as strong as before.

519
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,890
Look at you—

520
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,240
pale as a ghost.

521
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,070
One might think

522
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,730
you've been drained of blood.

523
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,350
Could it really

524
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,040
be related to Jin'an taking my blood?

525
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,400
This one

526
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,600
is the prescription.

527
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,190
And this map

528
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,510
shows a natural hot spring

529
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,140
in the forest outside the city.

530
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,200
You only need to soak in it

531
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,090
for about 30 minutes,

532
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,360
and it'll promote blood circulation

533
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,960
and fade scars.

534
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,160
When you're better,

535
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,290
go there regularly.

536
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,770
I don't have time for that.

537
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,550
Make time!

538
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,590
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

539
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,450
I'll go.

540
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,920
Who is there?

541
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,310
Don't waste your energy.

542
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,409
My camp was ambushed

543
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,320
twice before.

544
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,810
You were behind it?

545
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,310
Sharp as ever, General.

546
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,230
What is it you want?

547
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,000
What you picked up in the Barren Forest

548
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,679
was mine to begin with.

549
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,739
I just want it back.

550
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,190
You mean

551
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,560
Jin'an?

552
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,590
Your approach

553
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,800
is inappropriate.

554
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,900
Then call me presumptuous.

555
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,360
But I'm doing it for your sake.

556
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,070
Having someone of unknown origin
by your side

557
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,320
must be unsettling.

558
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,739
Give him to me

559
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,110
so we don't have to go against each other.

560
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,510
I took him in,

561
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,840
so he's mine now.

562
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,050
Whether I keep him

563
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,150
or kill him,

564
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,360
no one else has any say in it.

565
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,400
Is that so?

566
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,740
Then you'll have to suffer for it.

567
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,940
How is this happening?

568
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:41,950
Li Shuang.

569
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,880
Holding out until now

570
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,630
and still not begging for mercy.

571
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,030
You deserve your reputation
as Taijin's top female general.

572
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,630
I never expected

573
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,590
such a perfect fusion.

574
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,420
Li Shuang!

575
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,150
No!

576
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,560
If you don't want her to die,

577
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,940
you must come with me.

578
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Then I'll let her go.

579
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,700
I'll go with you.

580
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,030
So you truly love your blood master.

581
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,590
Tell me,

582
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,880
after each transformation,

583
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,590
are you always this lucid?

584
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,120
Yes.

585
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,430
How long does it last?

586
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,590
Two hours.

587
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,520
I never imagined

588
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,280
Jade Linglong could fuse with you
so perfectly.

589
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,230
So you're the one

590
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,760
behind all this.

591
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Now that you know,

592
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,220
you must realize—

593
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,630
only I hold the answers

594
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,420
to your past.

595
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,600
Come with me,

596
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,030
and I'll give you the answers.

597
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,150
What do you say?

598
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,510
Master.

599
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,710
Let's go.

600
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,500
[General's Residence]

601
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,360
Urgent military report!

602
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,940
General is not in the residence now.

603
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,820
Do you know

604
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,610
where she is at the moment?

605
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,360
General!

606
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,480
General!

607
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,190
General!

608
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,160
General!

609
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,240
General!

610
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,360
General!

611
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,720
General!

612
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,120
General,

613
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,760
the enemy has reached the border.
