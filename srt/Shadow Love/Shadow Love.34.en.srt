[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,960
[Episode 34]

3
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,280
The first rain of this year

4
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,480
has finally arrived.

5
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,640
May Yao State be blessed
with favorable weather,

6
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,970
peace, and prosperity,

7
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,910
and may the people

8
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,960
live better lives.

9
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,560
By the way, Prince Annan,

10
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,150
the house where Miss Li is being held

11
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,360
has long been in disrepair.

12
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,790
The roof has several leaks.

13
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,850
With the recent strong winds,

14
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,850
should we send someone to repair it?

15
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,570
What are you doing?

16
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,159
So clumsy.

17
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,350
Just like a prisoner indeed.

18
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,800
Since you can't do it properly,

19
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,770
why didn't you call the guards?

20
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,460
Aren't I a prisoner?

21
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,240
What right do I have to be picky?

22
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,190
Aren't you quite picky yourself?

23
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,370
Prince Annan,

24
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,340
what brings you here

25
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,830
in the middle of the night?

26
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,730
This house is so dilapidated.

27
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm afraid if it collapses
and kills my prisoner,

28
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,330
it would be quite a loss.

29
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,850
I'll take a look.

30
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,570
Since there are guards,

31
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,670
why trouble yourself, Prince Annan?

32
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,970
The guards...

33
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,390
have their own duties.

34
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,310
Prince Annan,

35
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,690
you're injured?

36
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,270
Do you need help?

37
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,930
It's fine.

38
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,390
Prince Annan,

39
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,390
you truly are farsighted.

40
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,420
You once sent over ointment for bruises.

41
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,530
Perfect timing.

42
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,660
You could use it yourself now.

43
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,720
Help yourself.

44
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,120
I heard Yao State rarely gets rain,

45
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,920
yet today

46
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,520
it pours so heavily.

47
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,840
If every year could be like this,

48
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,760
the people

49
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,549
would have better lives.

50
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,360
It's weird.

51
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,880
I feel like I've heard these words before.

52
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,400
They're so familiar.

53
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,050
Even this scene in the rain

54
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,820
feels like something I've experienced.

55
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,070
You took quite a fall today.

56
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,170
After all,

57
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,640
it was because of me.

58
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,410
I'm the kind of person

59
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,080
who doesn't like owing favors to others.

60
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,220
Remember this pain.

61
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,050
Even though our blood pact

62
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,200
will disappear
after the Jade Linglong is removed,

63
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,190
this mark

64
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,430
will remain on your body forever.

65
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,510
This is our new bond.

66
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,830
I was severely injured before.

67
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,740
I've forgotten many things.

68
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,340
This bite mark…

69
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,670
I don't even know where it came from.

70
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,930
Though you were trained in martial arts,

71
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,560
you do know how to take care of people.

72
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,500
Because in the past,

73
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,700
someone took care of me this way too.

74
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,550
That Jin'an again.

75
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,910
Since you can't let him go,

76
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,550
how about I bring him here

77
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,220
to keep you company?

78
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,730
It doesn't matter where he is.

79
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,390
We once promised each other:

80
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,270
born together,

81
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,100
and die together.

82
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,320
With our hearts connected,

83
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,860
wherever we go,

84
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,640
it's as if we're by each other's side.

85
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,990
You actually believe such sweet talk?

86
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,670
How many people in this world

87
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,860
live for a fleeting promise?

88
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,460
If a person

89
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,550
has no faith,

90
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,790
what meaning is there

91
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,810
in the long journey of life?

92
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,910
How can you be sure

93
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,040
his heart is unchanged,

94
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,820
just like yours?

95
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,120
It's raining heavily outside.

96
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,390
You're injured

97
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,650
and can't move easily.

98
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,070
Why don't you

99
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,740
stay here tonight?

100
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,630
You don't even care about propriety
between men and women?

101
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,540
Prince Annan,

102
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,510
are you afraid
I might have improper thoughts?

103
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,550
Walking out from here
in the middle of the night

104
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,810
with an injured waist…

105
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,660
it would cause even more gossip.

106
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,860
This medicine is good
for improving blood circulation.

107
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,910
You'll feel much better by morning.

108
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,490
Where will you sleep then?

109
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,580
Since you're so concerned
about your reputation,

110
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,910
I'll sleep on the floor.

111
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,310
Don't think you can pull any tricks

112
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,460
while I'm asleep.

113
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,110
I've been through countless battles.

114
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,950
I'm alert enough to notice that.

115
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,790
I told you...

116
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,700
I could die for you.

117
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,470
Every debt

118
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,010
has a debtor.

119
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,270
I will make Li Wei pay

120
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,910
the blood debt he owes me.

121
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,060
Although I know it's unlikely,

122
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,080
I still want to ask you—

123
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,430
will you go with me?

124
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,550
Prince Annan, you're awake?

125
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,540
Get up

126
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,540
and have some tea.

127
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,220
When did I

128
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,590
fall asleep last night?

129
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,540
I only know

130
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,300
that you slept very soundly.

131
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,740
Well, your alertness

132
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,780
was a bit lacking.

133
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,910
But for someone
who leads troops in battle,

134
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,830
it's rare to get a good night's sleep.

135
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,560
You should be happier about it.

136
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,230
Don't keep such a stern face.

137
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,950
She is an enemy general

138
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,750
and the daughter of my nemesis‌.

139
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,540
I stayed here overnight

140
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,870
to test her.

141
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,430
How did I end up

142
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,690
falling asleep without any guard at all?

143
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,280
Prince Annan.

144
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,520
Find a craftsman

145
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,260
to fix the roof.

146
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:49,890
Yes.

147
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,910
We're in Yao State territory.

148
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,190
Don't act rashly.

149
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,020
Jin'an...

150
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,380
is actually Duan Aodeng?

151
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,540
This year,

152
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,540
Shuang has worked tirelessly,

153
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,630
only to nurture a tiger that will harm us.

154
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,690
But they were once lovers, after all.

155
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,430
How could he harm Shuang?

156
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,220
It seems Jin'an

157
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,800
has completely forgotten Li Shuang.

158
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,110
Now, to him,

159
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,870
Li Shuang is merely an enemy prisoner.

160
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,220
I don't care who he is.

161
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,040
On Wuling Mountain,

162
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,910
Shuang almost died for him.

163
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,340
He is so utterly ungrateful.

164
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,020
I must teach him a lesson.

165
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,460
So what if you were to tear apart
the Yao State imperial palace?

166
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,930
The most important thing right now

167
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,580
is to rescue Li Shuang first.

168
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,700
What...

169
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,420
Did...

170
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,040
Did you really pin them down?

171
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,150
Not only that,

172
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,260
when they wake up later,

173
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,990
they won't remember seeing us.

174
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,190
But this trick

175
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,790
can only last for one hour at most.

176
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,850
We have to be quick.

177
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,090
Why are you following me?

178
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,820
To rescue her.

179
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,110
I should be the one saving my own bestie.

180
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,910
You keep watch at the door.

181
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,700
If anyone comes,

182
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,690
or if they wake up,

183
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,580
knock them out.

184
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,220
Be quick.

185
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,670
Remember, one hour.

186
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,240
I know that already.

187
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,740
Shuang?

188
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,300
Shuang!

189
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:48,590
Shuang.

190
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,390
Lu Xin?

191
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,880
Why are you here?

192
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,700
I heard you were captured,

193
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,900
so I came specially to rescue you.

194
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,830
Come with me now.

195
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,160
Lu Xin.

196
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,740
I can't leave now.

197
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,700
Why not?

198
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,880
Not only
is your living situation so humble here,

199
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,980
but that Duan Aodeng...

200
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,100
He doesn't even remember you.

201
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,630
He's no longer the Jin'an he used to be.

202
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,470
I'm not staying

203
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,540
because of him.

204
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,930
The misunderstandings
between the two countries

205
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,460
haven't been resolved yet.

206
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,440
If I escape alone,

207
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,720
it will surely endanger
my fellow prisoners.

208
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,220
If Yao State uses that

209
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,780
as an excuse to go to war,

210
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,110
it will be the people
of both countries who suffer.

211
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,950
Shuang,

212
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,670
I'm just a wandering doctor.

213
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,440
I don't have
your breadth of mind and vision.

214
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,360
I can't care for the entire world.

215
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,260
I just want you to survive.

216
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,900
If the bloodshed happens again,

217
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,700
what's the point of my survival?

218
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,150
But if you stay,

219
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,120
will the war really not break out?

220
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,020
Duan Aodeng

221
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,330
is bloodthirsty and warlike.

222
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,620
Can you guarantee
you'll survive in his hands?

223
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,520
Actually, during this time

224
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,590
with him,

225
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,870
I've found

226
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,770
he's not someone
who slaughters the innocent.

227
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,480
Sometimes,

228
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,990
he does show kindness.

229
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,370
Since he wants to use me

230
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,830
to force Taijin to comply,

231
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,560
he won't rashly start a war.

232
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,470
You're my best friend.

233
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,630
If you want to stay,

234
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,710
I'll respect your decision.

235
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,480
But I won't let anything happen to you.

236
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,680
Mo Yin and I will protect you in secret,

237
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,260
until Duan Aodeng

238
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,210
lets you return safely to Taijin.

239
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,590
Stay calm.

240
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,740
Two days later,

241
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,940
we'll meet at the inn.

242
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,070
Where did all these scars

243
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,560
come from?

244
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,980
She's just a defeated general
of our enemy nation.

245
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,910
Why is it that everything
she says and does

246
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,000
stirs my heart?

247
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,000
Why is all of this

248
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,560
happening?

249
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,350
Prince Annan.

250
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,140
Take this to her for me.

251
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,610
Yes.

252
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,110
Never mind.

253
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
I'll do it myself.

254
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,330
What are you doing up there?

255
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,760
Getting some fresh air.

256
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,300
Don't worry.

257
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,220
This roof is sturdy.

258
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,870
I won't fall to my death.

259
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,760
Prince Annan, you've been

260
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,680
visiting too often lately.

261
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,390
What do you mean by that?

262
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,230
After staying a few days,

263
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,280
now you act like you own the place,

264
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,870
telling me to leave?

265
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,700
I can't escape anyway.

266
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,060
If there's nothing urgent,
you don't need to come.

267
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,390
Your eyes look bloodshot from staying up.

268
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,430
You care about me?

269
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,790
You almost starved yourself to death
before.

270
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,930
If something really happened to you,

271
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,520
what will I use to negotiate with Taijin?

272
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,630
Someone sent me a bolt of fabric,

273
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,210
saying it's a popular pattern in Taijin.

274
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,480
I don't like it.

275
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,350
It's useless to keep it

276
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,670
and wasteful to throw away.

277
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,270
Here.

278
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,170
Someone gave you fabric
for women's clothing?

279
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,260
You didn't like it,

280
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,920
yet you had clothes made from it?

281
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,450
Thank you.

282
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,740
I used to think

283
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,430
people from Yao State

284
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,870
were all fierce, brutal,

285
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,250
savage, and strong.

286
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,870
Now I see

287
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,730
they're just ordinary flesh and blood.

288
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,260
Everyone in this world is the same,

289
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,750
longing for a peaceful life

290
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,150
and tranquility.

291
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,540
With such good days,

292
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,570
why should we wage war?

293
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,910
What you see

294
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,060
is a scene of peace,

295
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,160
but in the distant borders,

296
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,220
many people can't even get enough to eat.

297
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,390
Taijin

298
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,590
is rich in resources,

299
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,610
with all natural advantages.

300
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,950
Yet your ruler

301
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,790
is incompetent and corrupt,

302
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,000
squandering a prosperous land.

303
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,840
Our Yao State suffers from harsh cold.

304
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,800
If a natural disaster strikes,

305
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,560
with withered grass and smoke
over the cold land,

306
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,890
nine out of ten households would be empty.

307
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,080
If our border could move a bit south,

308
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,560
there would be fertile land,

309
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,390
and our people

310
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,010
could then live in peace and prosperity.

311
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,040
But is what you're doing

312
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,320
truly for your people,

313
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,870
or for your private vendetta?

314
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,550
In your heart,

315
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,850
you've always harbored hatred
for your brother's murder.

316
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,450
That's why you hate my father

317
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,730
and Taijin

318
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,590
to the core.

319
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,610
But think about it—

320
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,560
if one day Yao State builds up its army

321
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,150
and wages war again,

322
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,550
won't the ones suffering

323
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,190
be your own people?

324
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,330
Being born into a royal family

325
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,360
comes with many responsibilities

326
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,020
and burdens.

327
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,590
As a general,

328
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,790
you should understand these principles.

329
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,110
The blood and sacrifices
of countless people

330
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,290
are reduced to just a few lines

331
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,990
in history books.

332
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,960
One person's compassion

333
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,020
is truly too small a force.

334
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,980
But sometimes I can't help but think

335
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,350
that if rulers

336
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,260
and the people

337
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,740
all voluntarily

338
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,870
uphold the hard-won peace,

339
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,200
then

340
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,030
the world could be free of war.

341
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,760

I'm glad

368
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,870
you came to see me.

369
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,560
Jin'an used to love this piece
most of all.

370
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,120
You can listen to it on behalf of him.

371
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,040
Who are you really?

372
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,719
Prince Annan, why did you say that?

373
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,409
Have we met before in Taijin?

374
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,389
Back then,

375
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,830
who was I?

376
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,949
Since you've already forgotten,

377
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,010
why bother asking?

378
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,840
If you refuse to speak,

379
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,710
I'll kill all those brothers
you care about

380
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,950
one by one before your eyes,

381
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,060
until none remain.

382
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,620
And then?

383
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,870
March south again

384
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,110
to slaughter the Central Plains?

385
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,370
Does war and bloodshed

386
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,270
bring you such pleasure?

387
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,770
Someone gave you
the Brain-Devouring Powder.

388
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,960
As long as you poison me, you'd be safe.

389
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,880
With so many chances, you never acted.

390
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,580
That rainy night,
I fell asleep in front of you,

391
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,060
and you still didn't make a move.

392
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,880
Since you know everything,

393
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,310
why do you keep me by your side?

394
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,830
Why not just kill me?

395
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,180
I also want to know why!

396
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,750
Tell me.

397
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,080
What exactly are your intentions
toward me?

398
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,980
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me
because I resemble Jin'an

399
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,910
or...

400
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880

Prince Annan.

437
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,630
You want to see me?

438
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,910
You've been in charge of
the residence's security.

439
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,750
Recently,

440
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,670
have you noticed anything suspicious?

441
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,460
Prince Annan,

442
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,540
I've sent men to patrol repeatedly

443
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,310
but found nothing

444
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,000
out of the ordinary.

445
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,110
Then how did these things

446
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,760
appear before me?

447
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,150
Prince Annan,

448
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,710
I failed in my duties

449
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,870
and someone with ill intentions

450
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,160
took advantage of the situation.

451
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,460
Please forgive me, Prince Annan!

452
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,060
I'll ask you one last time!

453
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,580
What exactly happened in Taijin?

454
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,920
What is my relationship with Li Shuang?

455
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,900
Speak.

456
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,720
You've followed me for years.

457
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,880
You should know my temper well.

458
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,710
If you don't speak now,

459
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,180
I'll make sure you never can.

460
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,790
It concerns our nation's fate.

461
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,840
I cannot say.

462
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,180
Prince Annan,

463
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,380
here is an urgent report from the front.

464
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,350
Read it.

465
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,460
Li Wei is leading troops

466
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,420
and will arrive

467
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,860
at our gates within half a day.

468
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,970
He's also bringing

469
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:28,520
the Yao State prisoners
that Taijin refused to release before.

470
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,380
Prince Annan,

471
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,180
I am willing to be the vanguard

472
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,640
and drive the Taijin forces out
of Yao State.

473
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,920
Li Wei's arrival may not necessarily
be an act of war.

474
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:02,820
Issue my order:

475
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,350
all troops, take formation,

476
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,310
and whether we fight or not,

477
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,580
we must not lose the initiative.
