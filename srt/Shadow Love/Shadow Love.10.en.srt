[Shadow Love]

2
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,950
[Episode 10]

3
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,560
What's the situation now?

4
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,120
The Yao Army

5
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,710
has advanced more than 20 li forward.

6
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,150
They're expected to reach our borders
by dusk tonight.

7
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,870
Pass down the order:

8
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,680
count the weapons,

9
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,740
prepare the troops,

10
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,000
and all officers ranked
Lieutenant and above

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,890
should report to
the main tent for instructions.

12
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,820
Yes, Commander.

13
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,710
Go back to the city immediately

14
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,910
and check if Jin'an is at home

15
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,260
and whether he's injured.

16
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,190
Yes, Commander.

17
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,280
I made your favorite pear blossom pastries

18
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,430
and wanted to bring them here
while they're still warm.

19
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,310
But it seems

20
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,810
this isn't a good time.

21
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,410
Military matters are urgent.

22
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,540
You'll have to wait.

23
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,090
The Yao Army has been resentful ever since

24
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,720
their defeated last time because
of our fake defense map.

25
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,980
This time they'll surely come prepared.

26
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,829
With Shi Du, someone I have
defeated before, leading the troops,

27
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,230
there's nothing to fear.

28
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,260
But according to reports,

29
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,220
the Yao Army

30
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,190
has deployed 50,000 troops,

31
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,630
far exceeding our military strength.

32
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,430
I'm afraid we

33
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,090
need to respond with caution.

34
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,810
Indeed,

35
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,280
I've heard

36
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,420
Shi Du has a strategist named
Liu Yun by his side.

37
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,100
This man is full of tricks,

38
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,310
we must be extremely careful.

39
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,520
You are indeed wise.

40
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:38,910
However,

41
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,630
in this battle we must use our wits.

42
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,790
In military strategy,

43
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,800
the supreme tactic is to
attack the enemy's mind.

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,120
Fighting against superior numbers,

45
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
creating an illusion of
strength is crucial.

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,000
Our forces

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,240
are less than 20,000,

48
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,280
but we'll claim to have 40,000.

49
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,470
This way,

50
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,680
when the battle begins

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,400
and they only see half
our claimed numbers,

52
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,310
they will surely think we're
holding troops in reserve,

53
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,440
making them hesitant to commit fully.

54
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,430
Furthermore,

55
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,740
the Yao Army is penetrating deep
into our territory

56
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,960
without thorough knowledge of the terrain.

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,280
The northwestern plains

58
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,750
are the best place to break through,

59
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,630
but they only know it's flat land,

60
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,360
unaware of the trenches there.

61
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,120
When the time comes,

62
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,960
we'll feign defeat and retreat,

63
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,339
luring them into the narrow passage.

64
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,360
By the time they realize
they've fallen into our trap,

65
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,430
they'll already be trapped
in the narrow terrain.

66
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,560
As long as we

67
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,680
position archers in the
high ground beforehand,

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,560
we can wipe them out completely.

69
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,950
Wait.

70
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,040
Her plan is clever,

71
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,090
but it still has flaws.

72
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,850
With this strategy,

73
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,480
victory is within our grasp.

74
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,210
What brilliant plan, General.

75
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,909
Stop there!

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,870
I wonder how many arrows
we have in our arsenal.

77
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,480
Are they enough

78
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,680
to kill all the Yao soldiers on the spot?

79
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,870
If we can't stop them,

80
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,000
they'll keep coming in waves,

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,390
walking over dead bodies
of their own.

82
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,310
This pass

83
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,380
would be impossible to defend.

84
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,040
What kind of beasts

85
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,160
would trample over their
own brothers' bodies

86
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,310
to charge forward?

87
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,430
Let him in.

88
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,950
The enemy

89
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,630
has already arranged
civilians as suicide troops.

90
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,120
So, after the vanguard withstands
our ambush,

91
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,180
reinforcements will surely follow.

92
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,870
Since this is the situation,

93
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,130
we must see it through.

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,310
We must burn

95
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,310
that passage

96
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,200
to completely block the enemy forces.

97
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,420
Shoot!

98
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,159
Also,

99
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,400
those civilians at the front,

100
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,690
if they don't resist stubbornly,

101
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,020
there's no need to slaughter them all.

102
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,080
The Changfeng Army aims for victory,

103
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,490
not massacre.

104
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,270
The Changfeng Army

105
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,750
has won a great victory!

106
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,750
Changfeng Army will triumph!

107
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,770
Changfeng Army will triumph!

108
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,020
Changfeng Army will triumph!

109
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,280
We've won! Victory!

110
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,920
Our first battle was successful,

111
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,480
and Yao's remaining forces have
retreated to their camp.

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,160
This time,

113
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,360
the enemy's morale has been
severely damaged.

114
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,070
If we fight again,

115
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,120
we'll surely have the advantage.

116
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,240
This tough battle

117
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,490
has only just begun.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,950
Send orders

119
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,090
for all troops to take shifts and prepare,

120
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,680
remain vigilant at all times,

121
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,410
and never let down their guard.

122
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,560
Yes.

123
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,760
Where is Jin'an?

124
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,870
Outsiders are strictly forbidden to
move freely in the camp.

125
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,600
I've arranged for him to
stay in the barracks

126
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,800
under special guard.

127
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,630
Go bring him here.

128
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,170
General,

129
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,180
this man's identity is unknown.

130
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,250
He has repeatedly put you in danger,

131
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,500
and now he's offering military advice

132
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,620
with such insight,

133
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,800
which makes him highly suspicious.

134
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Therefore, I believe

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,600
keeping him close to you

136
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
is truly inappropriate.

137
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,480
Recently,

138
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,310
though there have been many troubles,

139
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,110
since he entered our household,

140
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,550
he hasn't shown any signs of betrayal.

141
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,410
But General,

142
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,490
his strategy today

143
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,490
shows how wise and insightful he is.

144
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,460
If he's deliberately lying low,

145
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,270
it could lead to endless trouble later.

146
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,630
Just follow my orders.

147
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,930
As for the rest,

148
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,920
I know what I'm doing.

149
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,270
Yes.

150
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,360
Sir.

151
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,030
Sir!

152
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,570
You nearly scared me to death!

153
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,080
Is the carriage ready?

154
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,720
Sir,

155
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,510
great news!

156
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,750
The Yao Army

157
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,820
has retreated!

158
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,970
Is this true?

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,240
Absolutely true.

160
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
The frontline has just

161
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,630
sent news of a great victory.

162
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,360
I

163
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,440
wouldn't dare to lie.

164
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,150
I never thought that lady

165
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,720
actually had some skill.

166
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,000
They're just a bunch of infantry soldiers

167
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,360
copying from military manuals.

168
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,720
If not for your lordship commanding

169
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
this battle from the rear,

170
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,910
planning strategies and
stabilizing morale,

171
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,150
Lucheng would

172
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,910
have fallen long ago.

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This woman is playing dirty tricks!

174
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,000
I warned against
underestimating the enemy.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,480
Now our army has suffered heavy losses.

176
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,990
[Counsellor of Yao, Liu Yun]

177
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,120
General Shi, what's your plan?

178
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
It's all my fault,

179
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,200
for not

180
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,400
heeding your words before.

181
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,440
I plan

182
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,390
to let our troops rest and recover,

183
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,630
wait until morale is restored,

184
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,160
then attack Lucheng again.

185
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,920
What does you think?

186
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,120
So we're just going back like this?

187
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,780
Since we've started this war,

188
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,050
we must see it through,

189
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,440
just not right now.

190
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,030

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,320
to our people inside Lucheng to
take action.

192
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,850
Yes, sir.

193
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,790
General.

194
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,870
Know yourself and your enemy,
coordinate inside and outside forces,

195
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,470
and victory will be certain.

196
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,840
Now that

197
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,810
the threat to Lucheng has been resolved,

198
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,390
I must celebrate.

199
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,320
All my recent

200
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,720
exhaustive efforts weren't in vain.

201
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,720
I've heard there's a brothel in Lucheng

202
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,000
with a unique style.

203
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,960
Would you

204
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,240
be interested

205
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,370
in experiencing it yourself, sir?

206
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,490
What quality could a
frontier town possibly offer?

207
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,100
However...

208
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,170
it wouldn't hurt to take a look.

209
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,670
Just to

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,270
experience the local customs.

211
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,200
General.

212
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,080
You deserve great merit

213
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,280
for today's victory.

214
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,180
Isn't there anything you want to ask?

215
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,630
We've been through so much together,

216
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,360
I understand your intentions.

217
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,600
If something's really wrong,

218
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,660
I don't need to ask.

219
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,150
You'll tell me yourself.

220
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,630
Actually, those strategic plans

221
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,120
seemed like they were already in my mind.

222
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,270
Somehow,

223
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,230
they just came out on their own.

224
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,960
I don't understand why either.

225
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,550
Perhaps

226
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,510
you're just learning things by

227
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,670
living here.

228
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,030
Maybe.

229
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,510
The military camp is no place to linger.

230
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,360
I've instructed Ji Ran

231
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,760
to escort you back first.

232
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,510
All right,

233
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,240
I'll wait for you at home.

234
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,030
Wait.

235
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,240
Though the Yao Army has retreated,

236
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,630
it's still chaotic outside.

237
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,270
Those clothes from the general's mansion

238
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,960
are bound to attract attention.

239
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,360
Change before you leave.

240
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,120
Change here?

241
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,030
Yes, here.

242
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
No wounds.

243
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,320
How is this possible?

244
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,150
Was I mistaken?

245
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,630
What's wrong?

246
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,240
Nothing.

247
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,340
You should hurry back.

248
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,870
What's the matter?

249
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,870
Are you all right?

250
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,840
I'll go get a physician.

251
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,630
It's fine.

252
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,960
It happens all the time.

253
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,870
I just need some sleep and I'll be fine.

254
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,030
All the time?

255
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,750
When did it start?

256
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,480
Probably...

257
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,390
since the Battle of Lucheng.

258
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,960
So it started after I came to you.

259
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,610
Actually, I don't think so.

260
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,390
Come to think of it,

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,240
it started long ago.

262
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,050
With the recent border conflicts,

263
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,720
even the healthiest body
would be exhausted.

264
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,320
It has nothing to do with you.

265
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,080
Then promise me,

266
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,430
once the fighting eases,

267
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,270
you'll let Lu Xin

268
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,530
examine you properly.

269
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,360
Sure.

270
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,270
Mr. Ji.

271
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,080
When will

272
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,200
this war be over?

273
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,360
I'm not trying to spy on military matters.

274
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,440
I just want to know

275
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,580
when the General can return home.

276
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,200
Why do you care

277
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,210
when the General returns?

278
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:40,870
Mr. Ji,

279
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,590
why have you stopped?

280
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,360
Who are you really?

281
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,600
What do you mean, Mr. Ji?

282
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,010
Don't you recognize me outside the camp?

283
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,490
Since you appeared,

284
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,200
the General has faced danger
multiple times.

285
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,240
She's always been cautious,

286
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,840
yet you show up with an unknown background

287
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,030
and find every way to stay by her side.

288
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,010
I'll ask you once more:

289
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,250
who are you really?

290
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,460
I was in trouble when I came here

291
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,840
and was fortunate the General saved me.

292
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,100
That's the only reason

293
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,940
I'm alive and by her side.

294
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,670
I only wish to repay her kindness.

295
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,800
What about the flame mark on your neck?

296
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,500
Before you appeared,

297
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,910
there was a child in the army
named Jin'an too.

298
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,630
You showed up

299
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,760
and he disappeared.

300
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,330
You both have the
same flame mark on your necks.

301
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,930
Could you be the same person?

302
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,600
Mr. Ji,

303
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,360
there are many things
I don't understand either.

304
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,720
I can't remember either.

305
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,870
No matter how much you pressure me,

306
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,730
I can't tell you what I don't know–

307
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,440
Speak.

308
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,440
It seems

309
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,370
he won't let this go easily.

310
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,390
But my strength is depleted,

311
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,390
and I have no power to fight back now.

312
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,070
Mr. Ji, are you planning to

313
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,400
act first and report later?

314
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,790
If you deal with me without authorization,

315
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,750
aren't you afraid the General will
hold you accountable?

316
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,480
My life belongs to the General.

317
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,670
For her safety,

318
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,860
I'm willing to take all the blame.

319
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,240
He's dead?

320
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,930
It happened so suddenly.

321
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,620
I couldn't save him in time.

322
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,050
Who gave you permission to
act on your own?

323
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,410
I have failed in my duty

324
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,810
and deserve to die for it.

325
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,070
But General,

326
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,750
this man refused to talk
even as he was dying,

327
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,070
he must be hiding something.

328
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,750
Please think–

329
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,550
Enough!

330
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,590
He just helped us defeat the enemy,

331
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,790
and based on your mere suspicion,

332
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,850
you decided whether he lives or dies?

333
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,380
You've violated military law

334
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,770
by acting without orders.

335
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,140
When we return to the city,

336
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,850
you'll be thrown in prison immediately.

337
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,510
Right now,

338
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,410
take a team and search for him.

339
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,040
Bring him back alive if possible,

340
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,200
or at least recover his body.

341
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,920
I...

342
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,110
understand my orders.

343
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,140
I still have so many questions for
you to answer,

344
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,190
so you're not allowed to die.

345
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,520
You must come back alive.

346
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:03,960
Sir.

347
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,000
Beautiful lady,

348
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,270
drink up.

349
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,030
Sir,

350
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,750
I really can't drink anymore.

351
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,880
Drink.

352
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,000
I truly cannot drink anymore.

353
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,240
Can't drink?

354
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,980
I'll feed you myself.

355
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,680
Open your mouth.

356
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,920
Be good.

357
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,150
You wretch!

358
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,200
How dare you ruin my good time!

359
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,480
I can't handle alcohol well,

360
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,830
I don't mean to offend you.

361
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,440
Please forgive me, sir.

362
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,960
Tears on your pretty face,

363
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,440
how can I

364
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,090
not teach you a proper lesson?

365
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,270
Wine.

366
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,640
Sir,

367
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,920
punishing this girl is a small matter,

368
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,070
but if you harm yourself with anger,

369
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,510
my heart

370
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,270
would break.

371
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,070
You're the sweetest.

372
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,880
Since you're

373
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,360
so considerate,

374
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,880
tonight I will

375
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,840
certainly give you some special attention.

376
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,920
You little slut!

377
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,640
How dare you compete
with me for his favor!

378
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,600
Sir, please wait a moment,

379
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,030
don't let her ruin our fun.

380
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,970
I'll report this to the madam

381
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,900
and have you beaten black and blue!

382
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,070
Go quickly.

383
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,470
I can't let you suffer in my place,

384
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,960
he'll torture you to death.

385
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,560
Don't worry,

386
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
I can handle it.

387
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,770
It seems

388
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,090
that strange power has
saved my life again.

389
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,480
That's so unexpected of Ji Ran.

390
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
He's usually so quiet and reserved,

391
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,720
yet he's so

392
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,580
ruthless and decisive in action.

393
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,690
I should return to
the general's mansion first.

394
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,960
Sir.

395
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,440
Sir.

396
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:38,300
[Granary]

397
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,280
Who's there?

398
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,350
There's an emergency at the front line.

399
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,590
I've been sent by the Military Supervisor

400
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,240
to inspect the granary reserves.

401
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,040
Open the door.

402
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,350
Opening the granary is a serious matter,

403
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,110
always requiring the general's orders.

404
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,960
We haven't

405
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,000
received any prior notification.

406
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,830
Lord Li is specially appointed by
the imperial court

407
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,880
with the emperor's decree to
supervise military affairs.

408
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,720
Even the general must follow his orders.

409
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,200
If you don't recognize this token,

410
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,400
do you expect him

411
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,440
to come all the way here himself?

412
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,180
-We dare not.
-We dare not.

413
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,510
Beautiful lady.

414
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,350
Bring me some water.

415
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,810
Put out the fire, quick!

416
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,920
Quick!

417
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,160
Hurry!

418
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,750
Water!

419
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,310
Water!

420
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,830
Signal flare!

421
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,680
Catch her!

422
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,430
Quick!

423
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,310
Take this

424
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,110
and report to the military camp.

425
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,550
Go!

426
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,110
Yes!

427
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,070
General.

428
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,520
It's coming from
the direction of the granary.

429
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,210
General!

430
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,920
The city reported that

431
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,200
a woman with Li Zhangyi's token

432
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,000
claimed she needed to inspect the granary,

433
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,350
but instead set fire to it,

434
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,110
causing severe damage.

435
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,360
What's her background?

436
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:30,920
No idea.

437
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,830
She's already escaped.

438
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,350
This was

439
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,350
left at the scene.

440
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,680
This is from Yao State.

441
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,640
The granary is a highly secured location

442
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,400
with multiple layers of defense,

443
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,130
yet she moved freely in and out.

444
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,200
She must

445
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,000
be a spy planted by Yao State.

446
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,920
It seems Li Zhangyi fell into their trap.

447
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,280
This signal flare is intact.

448
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,880
The news probably

449
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,280
hasn't been sent out yet.

450
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,400
How much longer does
our army need to recover?

451
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,680
We can move out at dawn.

452
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,310
Though we won this battle,

453
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,910
the enemy has 50,000 troops,

454
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,110
greatly outnumbering us.

455
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,650
Now that our supplies have been burned,

456
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,310
we shouldn't stay any longer.

457
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,500
Send the order:

458
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,120
we break camp after dawn!

459
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,280
Yes, General.

460
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,480
Luo Teng.

461
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,310
Take this back to the general's residence

462
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,040
and tell them

463
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
that before dawn,

464
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,810
they must capture that woman.

465
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,350
Yes.

466
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,440
Sir.

467
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,240
I've cleared out everyone

468
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,310
from the entertainment house.

469
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,110
But Yunge...

470
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,000
What about her?

471
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,400
She wasn't among them.

472
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,830
You!

473
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,330
I deserve to die!

474
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,960
Useless fool.

475
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,550
Li Shuang is about to return to the city.

476
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,830
If Yunge falls into Li Shuang's hands,

477
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,680
and she learns about the lost token

478
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,400
and how all the burned supplies

479
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,240
are due to my negligence,

480
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,550
do you know what the consequences will be?

481
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,830
Sir, please don't worry,

482
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,640
you are the military supervisor

483
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,920
personally appointed by the Emperor.

484
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,880
Surely they wouldn't dare.

485
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,510
You know nothing!

486
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,430
If Yunge is truly a Yao spy,

487
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,830
they could easily accuse me

488
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,240
of treason.

489
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,160
Dying hundred times over

490
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,900
wouldn't be enough a punishment for me!

491
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,030
It's all your fault!

492
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,370
For persuading me to go to that brothel,

493
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,040
causing so much trouble.

494
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,400
Let me tell you,

495
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,790
if I'm implicated,

496
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,070
you won't live either.

497
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,270
Sir, please be wise!

498
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,960
I truly didn't know!

499
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,400
Please have mercy, sir.

500
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,580
Considering how loyally

501
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,790
I've served you,

502
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,000
spare my life.

503
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,680
Enough!

504
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,640
At this point,

505
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,510
there's only one way out.

506
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,350
We absolutely cannot let

507
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,150
Li Shuang meet Yunge alive.

508
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,270
Sir, you mean...

509
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,770
But Li Shuang is with the Changfeng Army,

510
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,660
it's difficult to make a move.

511
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,640
As a general, Li Shuang

512
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,350
cannot die mysteriously.

513
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,080
But what if she dies by
a Yao soldier's blade?

514
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,430
That'd be killing two birds with
one stone.

515
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,110
How brilliant, sir.

516
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,040
Using someone else's knife to kill,

517
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,900
eliminating Prince Li's concern

518
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,660
while keeping yourself safe.

519
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,990
Continue searching.

520
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,270
Even if you have to turn Lucheng upside down,

521
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,200
you must find Yunge,

522
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,470
dead or alive.

523
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,510
Also,

524
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,680
immediately send men

525
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,880
to replace all the city guards

526
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,240
with our own people.

527
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,530
Seal the city gates.

528
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,350
Until this matter is resolved,

529
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,310
Li Shuang must not enter the city!

530
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,640
Yes.

531
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,920
Urgent military report!

532
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,950
Urgent military report!

533
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,360
[General's Residence]

534
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,480
What is it?

535
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,930
Someone set fire to the granary.

536
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,720
The general orders

537
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,680
the arsonist be captured tonight.

538
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,590
Who did it?

539
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,700
It's only known it was a woman,

540
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,960
likely a Yao State spy.

541
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,880
This is our only lead.

542
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,400
Since she's been exposed,

543
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,000
trying to leave the city openly

544
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
won't be easy.

545
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,070
She must be disguised

546
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,030
and hiding somewhere in the city,

547
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,360
waiting for her chance.

548
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,550
Quickly tell Cuiyun

549
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,720
to make the arrangements.

550
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,830
Everyone from the mansion should
team up in pairs

551
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,030
and search throughout the city,

552
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,240
especially in
remote areas and poor alleys.

553
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,440
Don't let her escape.

554
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:13,960
Got it.

555
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,030
This scent...

556
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,720
it's the unique fragrance from
Fragrance Garden.

557
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,160
The intruder moved so efficiently,

558
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,820
they must have come prepared.

559
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,880
If we don't find this person quickly,

560
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,010
once Yao State gets the news,

561
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,650
they'll surely strike again,

562
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,650
and then Li Shuang will be in danger.

563
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,650
I'm still one step too late.

564
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,410
Miss?

565
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,120
Miss?

566
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,450
What happened?

567
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,370
Who did this?

568
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,960
Li Zhangyi...

569
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,120
He claimed Yunge is a Yao State spy

570
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,670
and forced the madam to hand her over.

571
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,390
Yunge...

572
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,050
Is she the one with a sachet

573
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,650
embroidered with the characters "Yanzhi"?

574
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,920
That was my gift to her.

575
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,840
Yanzhi is my name.

576
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,160
Yunge would never do that.

577
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,000
She's been wrongly accused.

578
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,730
Say no more,

579
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,830
let me take you to a doctor.

580
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,480
No.

581
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,590
City...

582
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,300
City God Temple.

583
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,540
City God Temple...

584
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,580
Ms. Yanzhi...

585
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,200
Ms. Yanzhi!

586
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,290
Have you seen this person?

587
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,270
Have you seen this person?

588
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,200
Never seen them.

589
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,650
Have you seen this person?

590
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,780
I haven't seen them.

591
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,050
Have you seen this person?

592
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,880
Report!

593
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,550
Mission accomplished.

594
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,080
The granaries in
Taijin have been destroyed.

595
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:23,930
General.

596
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,440
With the granaries destroyed,

597
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,000
Li Shuang will surely withdraw
her troops back to the city.

598
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,440
When the gates of Lucheng open wide,

599
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,590
our army can seize this opportunity

600
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,440
to charge straight in

601
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,570
and launch a surprise counterattack.

602
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,400
Soldiers!

603
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,550
Follow me to battle!

604
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,110
The General has returned!

605
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,030
Open the gates!

606
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,090
Without Lord Li's orders,

607
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,660
I cannot open the gates.

608
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,270
They're not our men.

609
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,990
Li Zhangyi deliberately arranged this.

610
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,790
The Northern Commander is here!

611
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,530
Who does Li Zhangyi think he is?

612
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,270
Tell him to get down here and
explain himself!

613
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,070
How dare you!

614
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,540
Lord Li is here by imperial decree.

615
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,550
You're just a minor officer,

616
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,450
how dare you be so disrespectful!

617
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,280
Luo Teng.

618
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,160
Officer Luo meant no disrespect.

619
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,070
I

620
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,160
will discipline him accordingly.

621
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,070
Please, Lord Li,
give the order immediately

622
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,680
to let our troops enter the city.

623
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,590
The city's

624
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,290
granaries caught on fire.

625
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,240
I've ordered men to capture the suspect.

626
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
To prevent

627
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,240
the criminal from escaping
during the chaos,

628
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,550
I hope the General

629
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,820
can wait a moment.

630
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,030
The situation is urgent

631
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,160
and brooks no delay.

632
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,790
The Yao Army

633
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,390
has mobilized 50,000 troops

634
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,310
and has spies hiding in our Lucheng,

635
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,710
plotting for a long time.

636
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,240
Sir, why are you delaying

637
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,200
at such a critical moment?

638
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,920
Li Shuang.

639
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,680
As a general,

640
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,750
I never expected you to be such a coward.

641
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,880
The battle has barely begun,

642
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,200
yet you're already thinking of retreat.

643
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,750
His Majesty ordered me

644
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,160
to supervise this military campaign.

645
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,030
I will fulfill my duty faithfully.

646
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,480
This battle

647
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,510
must be fought.

648
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,440
Delicious.

649
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,660
How is it?

650
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,810
Good wine, isn't it?

651
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,440
Yunge.

652
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,310
She's got something.

653
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,920
But not much.

654
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,030
So you're Yunge?

655
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,989
Take her away.

656
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,320
Your timing is impeccable.

657
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,120
A moment later

658
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,080
and I would have caught her myself.

659
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,870
Aren't...

660
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,360
Aren't you dead?

661
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,590
Do you only wish the worst for me?

662
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,030
I'm trying to catch someone here.

663
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,440
Jin'an.

664
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,190
It's alright, Sister Qiao'er,

665
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:26,920
don't worry.

666
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,360
The message has been sent out.

667
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,290
There's no time.

668
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,489
Come with me.

669
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,440
Who do you think you are?

670
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,000
Come with me.

671
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,480
Yes.

672
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,440
Yes.

673
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,030
Our soldiers have fought hard until now

674
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,699
and are completely exhausted.

675
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,900
Sending us now

676
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,320
would be sending us to our deaths.

677
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,400
A mere lieutenant

678
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,960
dares to undermine morale like this.

679
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,480
You!

680
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,150
Do you know I have the Emperor's authority

681
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,440
and can execute you
without prior approval?

682
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,280
Report!

683
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,700
Sir.

684
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,480
Someone downstairs requests an audience,

685
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,670
claiming to be from the General's mansion.

686
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,360
Refuse it.

687
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,590
He brought a brocade box

688
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,320
and insists you must accept it.

689
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:12,950
Sir.

690
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,450
Where is he?

691
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,610
Below the city wall.

692
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,480
Bring him up.

693
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,190
Yes, sir.

694
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,690
You again.

695
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,670
I humbly beg Lord Li

696
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,110
to open the city gates

697
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,970
and let the Changfeng Army enter.

698
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,920
The Changfeng Army

699
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,550
is the last line of defense
against the Yao State.

700
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,750
If they are defeated,

701
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,420
Lucheng will certainly be at
the enemy's mercy.

702
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,350
Can you afford to

703
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,770
let that happen?

704
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
How dare you.

705
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,780
Are you threatening me?

706
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,250
I wouldn't dare.

707
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,110
By the way,

708
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,590
I've sent Yunge

709
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,200
safely to the general's mansion.

710
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,230
I assume you agreed to meet me

711
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,360
because you recognized

712
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,710
that sachet.

713
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,800
If you open the city gates

714
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,410
and let the Changfeng Army in,

715
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,210
I'll return Yunge to you.

716
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,360
It's never too late

717
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,070
to mend the fold,
even after the sheep are lost.

718
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:34,550
Sir,

719
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,480
at this point ,

720
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,250
we might as well go all the way.

721
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,840
Since he's talking like this,

722
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,920
he's clearly trying to claim

723
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,440
that you're connected to Yunge.

724
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,100
You mustn't fall for his trap!

725
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,800
Report!

726
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,630
The Yao Army has launched
a surprise attack

727
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,030
and is only 10 miles away.

728
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,810
Trying to negotiate with me?

729
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,290
Who do you think you are?

730
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,840
The Yao Army will be at
our gates any moment.

731
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,590
As long as Li Shuang dies,

732
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,630
I can still rest easy.

733
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,000
You dare threaten an imperial official!

734
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,550
Jin'an!

735
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,730
If anything happens to Official Li,

736
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,450
do you think you can escape?

737
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,010
My life means nothing,

738
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,800
but Official Li,

739
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,650
your life is so precious.

740
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,990
To have a companion like you

741
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,220
on my journey to the underworld...

742
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,650
would be my greatest honor.

743
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,950
Report!

744
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,510
The Yao Army is

745
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,570
only three miles from the city gates.

746
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,980
Open the gates!

747
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,210
Open up!

748
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,290
I said open the gates! Are you deaf?

749
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:42,890
Wait!

750
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:44,920
General!

751
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,850
The Yao Army is at our gates.

752
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,110
Opening the gates now

753
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,340
would be like letting wolves
into our home.

754
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,200
The civilians would be in danger.

755
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,880
Our only option

756
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,110
is to lure the Yao Army

757
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,480
to the dense forest outside the city,

758
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,010
