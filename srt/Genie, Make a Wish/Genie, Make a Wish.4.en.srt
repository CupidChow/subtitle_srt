[guard] Someone's trying to
hack into the system.

4
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,238
What do they want? Do we know who it is?
Russia? North Korea?

5
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,407
[guard] They're trying to
figure that out. Hurry!

15
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:01,996
Let's kiss now.

00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,874
[hesitates] Oh, I…
I need to plant those onions!

Finished with the onions? Let's kiss.

22
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,349
[shudders] But I left
that thing over there.

23
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,935
So out of it,
I forgot to grab it. [whimpers]

- You were looking for the coffin?

26
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,689
- Since you found it, let's kiss!
- Wait. Hold on. You can't rush it.

27
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,983
You know? It happens when it's right.

28
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,571
There are rules to this.
Rules around these sort of things.

29
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,156
- Okay?
- So what are they?

30
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,158
Yes, well, then about those rules, uh…

31
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:25,204
The first one's the weather.
Raindrops. It must rain.

32
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,749
It didn't rain yesterday.

33
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,626
It was the first time yesterday.

34
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,838
For the first kiss, rules can be
somewhat relaxed, even spontaneous,

35
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,549
but now that that's happened,
it must rain from now on.

36
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,218
We also need alcohol.

37
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,013
A drink before a kiss. That's when.

38
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,600
It's really that complicated?

39
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,436
Actually, way, way more complicated,
but I condensed it.

40
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,938
You can put the lid back on.

41
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,150
But you're not really a vampire, are you?

Hey, Ki Ka-young and Choi Min-ji
were in your class at school?

56
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,113
- Yeah.
- Their bags are pricey.

57
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,364
They're both Hermès.

58
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,201
She just places it on the floor. [scoffs]

59
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,787
You two, hey. Two iced coffees, okay?

60
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,916
[groans] Every time we break for lunch.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,627
- Great.
- Go on ahead. I'll take the usual.

62
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:59,132
Looking over your accounts, you should
set up a retirement savings plan.

63
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,800
A good way to set up for your future.

64
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,136
I don't need it.
There's no point in retirement.

65
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,763
[laughs] What do you mean,
there's no point?

66
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,309
It's just that she's not interested
in low-risk stocks.

67
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,102
She tends to invest more aggressively.

68
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,813
Of course, yes, I understand.
Okay. [chuckles]

69
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,399
That's good to know. Bo-gyeong,
the towel sets. Where are they?

70
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,609
- Oh.
- They're not prepared?

71
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,989
Bo-gyeong, why is it that you need
to be told every single thing?

72
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,282
I'll get the towels now.

73
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,535
Let's continue to prepare
for your retirement.

74
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,246
Let's discuss the advantages.
Your nest egg will…

[intriguing music plays]

76
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:44,218
The construction is complete. You just
need to decide when you want to move in.

77
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,805
- Do you like it?
- Yes, Papa.

78
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,566
- Daddy! Daddy!
- [squeals excitedly]

79
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,735
- Oh, yes, my sweet angel!
- [both chuckle]

Did our smart little princess
study hard today?

81
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,156
Of course! I'm so tired. I need a break.

82
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,534
You know, there was a new student
in school today.

83
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,828
- He's really cute.
- [Chang-sik] Oh, cute?

84
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,122
You found him cute? How cute is he?

85
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,249
- He looks like a little king.
- Oh.

86
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,085
- So I asked where he lives.
- Yeah?

87
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,754
- He said that big house we wondered about.
- The one that a way?

88
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,464
- Yep.
- They live in that house?

89
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,342
Let's go see them and bring them
our good rice cakes.

90
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,344
We have to welcome them to our town.

91
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,012
[both] Ah!

are actually accurate?

96
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,031
Genie, tell me what tomorrow's weather
is going to be like.

97
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,659
The weather? How would I know that?
It's a touchy subject, okay?

98
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,371
What are you so riled up about?
I'm just asking about the weather.

99
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,582
Hey, Genie,
what's the weather like tomorrow?

<i>it's going to be a clear and sunny day.</i>

101
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:04,257
That's right. You should try asking it
something. It knows everything.

102
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,556
[Iblis scoffs] Okay, other Genie.

103

110
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,540
Find out how much rain
is expected this week.

111
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,835
I already looked it up because the cherry
blossom festival starts very soon.

112
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,088
- We've got clear skies most of the week!
- Ugh! Why?

[trunk thuds]

114
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,966
How about next week?

115
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,346
Uh, the spring rainy season
probably starts next week after Monday.

116
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,640
- Why is Monday excluded?
- You want me to exclude it?

117
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,933
Can you really do that?

118
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,062
- Since you're a fairytale creature?
- I don't have that range.

119
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,732
I could recite a devotion. [laughs]

120
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,819
Not the helpful type.

121
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,198
Why don't you put down the wrench
and tell me what this is about?

122
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,324
[Sade exhales nervously]

123
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,244

- Yes, today I'm pretty.

128
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,838
Beautiful.

[panting]

130
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,344
It's like the town got short on cash.

131

They couldn't invite some bigwig
for the jamboree?

[Sade] This isn't your fault, Master.

139
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,835
Psychopaths are known to have
narcissistic personality traits.

140
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,339
Is that so? Oh, that's good to know.

141
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:12,260
I thought I made her pretty somehow.
I mean, I really brought it that night.

142
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,805
[sighs] Why did I put it all out there
at that very moment?

143
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,224
What are you going on about?

144
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,059
You must put it all out there!

145
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,353
Kissing is a good first step
towards corruption.

146
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,355
Right. That's how I used to do it.

147
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,525
[sighs] Though
it's been a thousand years.

148
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:32,488
It's really been the first kiss since
that long ago. Oh, I was so nervous.

149
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,447
[chuckles, sighs]

150
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,158
My goodness,
it makes me feel bad for Ejllael.

151
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,412
You know, Master, he works nonstop
in hopes of slitting your throat.

152
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:43,291
He goes through all that effort when just
one kiss has you digging your grave.

153
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:48,212
- Although, first kiss in a millennium?
- What's the problem?

154
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,216
Shouldn't you have gone to
a dentist first? Ugh, so gross. Ew!

155
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,803
- Ugh!
- A dentist?

156
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,598
What's that?

[yelping loudly]

165
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,588
So, you don't have any money,
or any form of ID?

166
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,549
No one bothered to get this info
before the cleaning?

167
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,093
He said the owner of the repair shop
was a good friend of his.

168
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,221
Ki Ka-young? Aside from me,
she has no other friends. Oh!

169
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,223
- You're from the Middle East?
- Min-ji?

00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,393
[Iblis] Oh.

172
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,397
You ate gamja-tang before. I saw you
eat gamja-tang at her favorite joint.

173
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,607
[Iblis laughs]

174
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,401
So because you watched me
eat gamja-tang one time,

175
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,153
you think you get a free service?

176
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,822
[Ka-young] <i>No money?</i>

177
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,075
[Min-ji] It's crazy, right?

178
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,077
Can you believe this guy?

179
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,329
He doesn't even have any kind of ID.

180
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,914
He just keeps saying his name…

181
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,334
[laughs] …is Lee Beu-li.

182
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,420
What kind of name is that?
It's so ridiculous.

183
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,714
What else could I say to him
at that point?

184
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,592
How am I supposed to trust anything
about this guy?

185
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,262
I can say one thing for sure.
He's not a real man.

186
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,391
[Min-ji] Of course not!
There's no way he could be!

187
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,394
No real man would date someone
when he's flat-out broke.

188
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,065
I was told to raise these when I'm feeling
uneasy. I'm feeling very uneasy right now.

189
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,608
Ugh, you really suck.

190
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,611
Dr. Choi, we got to get set up
at the festival.

191
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,196
All right, let's go.

192
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,616
Can't you tell he's using you?

193
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,745
Get it together!
Miss Ki, take care of yourself!

194
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,748
[scoffs] He has a pretty face.

195
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,126
And he's tall,
and he has a nice voice too.

196
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,711
What else does he have going for him?

197
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,758
[Ka-young sighs]

198
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,513
I had to get my teeth cleaned
for the rainy season.

199
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,058
When I become a pro gamer,
I'll pay you ba-- [sighs]

200
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,726
Pro gamer?

201
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,773
You haven't won a single game against the
local kids, and you think you're a gamer?

202
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,401
All right.

203
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,533
- [comical music plays]
- [sighs]

204
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,618
Only one side of my face.

205
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,122
I took that beating well. [chuckles]

206
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,376
[mimics engine revving]

207
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,306
- [remote clicks]
- [car engine starts]

208
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,766
Whoa! What the… [gasps]

209
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,562
Miss Ki! Check the tire pressure,
would you?

210
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,063
[Ka-young] Okay!

211
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,025
[mimicking engine revving]

212
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,907
You having a beer?

213
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,241
Yeah, that's right.

214
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,620
And with the engine on,
you're at the wheel of a car?

215
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,455
Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm behind the wheel.

216
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,583
Engine? Which one is that?

217
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,503
Okay, sir, go ahead
and blow into this now.

218
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,506
What is it? A pipe?

219
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,757
[chuckles] Come on.

220
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,051
[blowing]

221
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,677
- Yes, go.
- More.

222
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:28,057
- [officers] More, more, more, more!
- [horn honking]

223
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,683
- [rapid beeping]
- [sustained honking]

224
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,562
[woman] Hello, my homies!
Hey! It's Da-jin of Sky Farm Life.

225
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,982
I'm coming live to you from
the Cheongpung Cherry Blossom Festival.

226
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,528
Let's start by raiding
the For Daughter Strawberry stand.

227
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,323
What happens when strawberries
are stuck in traffic?

228
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,450
- [man] What?
- A berry jam.

229
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,869
[both laughing]

230
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,205
"Strawberry jam!"

231
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,250
[both laughing]

232
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,211
See that? There's a reason
these things don't work out.

233
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,964
- Great. Good. [continues indistinctly]
- Yeah.

234
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,216
[Min-ji] Say "Ah." That's right.
Really good.

235
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,677
[sucks breath] Let's try opening wider.
A little more.

236
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,970
"Ah." Wider. "Ah, ah."

237
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,097
Hello there. We're Cheongpungho Bank.

238
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,141
We're having a promotion for savings
account. Come by for a consultation.

239
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,102
Hello.

240
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,859
[in Arabic] Where is the bathroom?
Is the subway station close by?

241
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,987
Without cilantro, please.

242
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,282
[in English] What's he saying?
Are you Arabic? Is that it?

243
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,409
Before, you were speaking Korean properly.

244
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,660
[Iblis] Hmm?

245
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,454
- He's asking to leave the cilantro out.
- What?

246
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,082
[chuckles] Arabic was all the rage
when I was in school,

247
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,709
so I learned it as my second language.

248
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,878
I can try speaking to him.
[clears throat]

249
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,838
[in Arabic] My name is Oh Gyeong-yeol,

250
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,798
a police officer
from the Republic of Korea.

251
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,801
Sir, you have violated the traffic laws--

252
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,802
[snaps fingers]

253
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,307
[in English] Get over here now!
You said I just had to talk in Arabic.

254
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,727
Oh, well, it worked for me,
but that was 100 years ago.

255
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,063
Go ahead, I'll take care of things.

256
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,231
- You shit!
- [whimpers]

257
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,737
[upbeat music playing over speakers]

258
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,532
Oh Pan-geum! Buy that,
it's yummy. That one.

259
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,369
Why are you eating a bag of raw tofu?

260
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,955
This is what you eat
after a visit to the slammer.

261
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,084
Pan-geum, get black goat extract.
Black goat, okay? For longevity.

262
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,421
How would I afford that?
Why don't you buy it for me then?

263
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,467
Sorry, I can't afford it either.
I can only make suggestions.

264
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:31,805
I can't tell if you're a rascal,
or just poor, and good for nothing.

265
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,723
- [squeaking]
- Oh, my!

266
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,600
- Hmm?
- Hey, hey, look over there!

267
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,768
[toy squeaking]

268
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,395
My goodness! That puppy's bopping!

269
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,105
How wonderful, don't you think?

270
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,733
- Whoa! Wow! What is that? [laughs]
- [vendor] Come and see.

271
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,652
- How adorable!
- Super cool!

272
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,111
[laughs]

273
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,906
[Iblis] Wow, it's walking
but somehow stays in the same spot.

274
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,532
How does it do that?

275
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,826
[toy squeaking]

276
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,080
[Iblis] At least her joints
are in good shape.

277
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,751
- Oh!
- Hi there. So sorry, okay?

278
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:04,880
What's wrong?

279
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,010
I heard about something called fireworks.

280
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,805
- Do you know when and where?
- [chuckles]

281
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,226
Ah, the fireworks?
They'll go off after the sun sets.

282
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,646
Uh, over there.
Those are the best views.

283
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,439
- Have a good time.
- Ah.

284
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,192
The best views are there.

285
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,988
[humming]

286
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,533
[music continues over speakers]

287
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,081
[thug] Ta-da! That's it! Uh…

288
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,752
Ah, shit. That asshole seemed like
he was loaded. All he had was this.

289
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,421
[sighs] This is nothing!

290
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,049
Look over there at those motherfuckers
with no decency.

291
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,385
This is our turf.
What are you doing on it?

292
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:55,472
Oh, we're here for the cherry blossom
festival. The spring breeze is good.

293
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,475
This cherry blossom festival
is part of our turf.

294
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,645
You didn't see us bumming around
at your salmon festival.

295
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,398
Well, then, you're welcome
to come to next year's one.

296
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,774
Want a personal invite, huh?

297
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,486
Yeah. You can get a new arm
while you're here.

298
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,072
The prosthetics in Cheongpung
are exceptional.

299
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,907
You're gonna need it.

300
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,243
[thugs grunting]

301
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,995
- Whoa.
- What the hell?

302
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,461
[sighs] Phew, what a relief!
She would've beaten me up again.

303
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,379
- Huh? Who's this stupid prick?
- [blows]

304
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,923
- Hey, you. What gang do you belong to?
- Huh?

305
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,675
- Huh?
- [thug 2] Why doesn't he answer?

306
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,470
- Hey, let's fucking wipe him out!
- [thugs yelling]

307
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,389
- [gasps]
- [gasps, whimpers]

308
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,475
[Iblis] <i>My, oh, my.</i> [scoffs]

309
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,809
<i>How about some flowers?</i>

310
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,937
[upbeat music plays]

311
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,732
[thugs yelling, grunting]

312
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,695
[grunts, exclaims]

313
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,449
[both grunting]

314
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,704
[fireworks exploding]

315
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,375
[Pan-geum] Those are so bright
and beautiful!

316
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,836
[Heung-rye] My gosh. How dazzling!

317
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,963
- Oh.
- Oh, my.

318
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,966
Oh, how mesmerizing.

319
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,807
[indistinct chatter]

320
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,851
[Pan-geum] Oh, my goodness.

321
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,521
That's… that's Ka-young's name,
isn't it?

322
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,525
"Heart. You. Live, fuck"?

323
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,068
What? I don't get it.

324
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,028
So that asshole does have money.

325
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,366
So you're saying girls love
to be spoken to that way?

326
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,994
Yes, sir. If you believe in me,
I promise I'll never steer you wrong.

327
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,538
They all fall for it.

328
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,083
Now it's just a waiting game
until she's corrupted. [cackling]

329
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,042
I like that.

330
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,295
[upbeat music continues]

331
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,346
KI KA-YOUNG
FUCK OFF

332
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,015
[sighs] That ass.

333
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,978
I have that exact same thought
when I see Iblis.

334
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,313
It's good to know you can relate, Miss Ki.

335
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,986
Why are you here?
You don't need repairs, you can fly.

336
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,656
Everyone's at the festival,
so this neighborhood's a ghost town.

337
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,535
- I thought I'd visit so we can talk alone.
- What do you have to say then?

338
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,954
No point asking for your feather.

339
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,540
[laughs] No, it's yours.

340
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,128
What's your species anyway?

341
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,881
Yorkshire Terriers and Chihuahuas
are a kind.

342
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,968
There are also angels, humans,
devils and Genies. So what one are you?

343
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,180
Let's say I'm his servant. You saw
my wings, so you should know I'm an angel.

344
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:47,060
Oh, an angel? Clarify that for me
since you have black wings.

345
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,855
You're the food bank volunteer.

346
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,566
I've been thinking this over.

347
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,361
It's strange that every time
you come with meals, a life ends.

348
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,197
Older people die.

349
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,699
I suppose you could maybe see it that way.

350
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,868
Mmm. Here's another perspective.

351
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,163
I visit the elderly
who are already at death's door.

352
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,789
It's normal some end up dying.

353
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,834
[tense music plays]

354
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:13,962
I see.

355
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,716
By the way, several of your buildings

356
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,136
are located within just a few blocks
of this repair shop.

357
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,223
You also don't bother hiding
your true identity.

358
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,560
- Are you trying to keep an eye on me?
- Oh? That's correct.

359
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,230
I work on his mandate, to be more precise.

360
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,523
What's that? His mandate?

361
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:38,278
"If Iblis decides to bow his head
to a human, you'll then…

362
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,739
slit your brother's throat."

363
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,868
Thrilling, isn't it?

364
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:50,415
That's why I'll do whatever it takes
to ensure that you don't fall for Iblis.

365
00:20:59,049 --> 00:20:59,925
It's too late.

366
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,260
[tense music continues]

367
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,177
What?

368
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,888
The repair store is closing up.

369
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,976
Ah. [chuckles]
It's that time already? Hmm.

370
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,064
But why the sudden tone shift?

371
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,859
Let's see. It could be that psychopaths
can't hide their irritation.

372
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,405
Or because you're trying to kill my Genie
before I do. Or maybe…

373
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,574
it's because I've fallen for him.

374
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,078
Which reason is it?

375
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,038
[tense music continues]

376
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,963
[Ejllael] <i>I knew it.</i>
<i>I was right about her.</i>

377
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,132
[sighs]

378
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,972
Did something happen, sir?

379
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,641
- I found all these--
- Get rid of all these books!

380
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:53,603
- Psychopath? How about deranged?
- [books clattering]

381
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,273
I should have known it was too easy.

382
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,652
[sighs] The two remaining wishes
could be at risk if she's this way.

383
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,613
<i>I should have taken my scythe with me.</i>

384
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,491
I mean, she spoke to me like a child!

385
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,826
Can you believe the audacity?

386
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,078
- That's so disrespectful.
- Mm-hmm.

387
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,914
You do look very young, for your age.

388
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,374
[scoffs]

389
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,209
[buttons clacking]

390
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,795
Did you see the fireworks?
I did the big ones.

391
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,299
- Weren't they cool?
- Uh, why pick those ones?

392
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,344
- [gasps] No!
- [video game announcer] <i>K.O.</i>

393
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,013
Hey, are you bamboozling me or what?

394
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,766
- So, you were behind the fireworks?
- Uh-huh.

395
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,186
[sighs] I wondered
what maniac would do that.

396
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,687
Mani-- What?

397
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,232
[sighs] Hey.

398
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,986
- Where do you live? Show me the way, kid.
- [Min-ji] And where do you live?

399
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:44,821
Show me the way.

400
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,825
What?

401
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,704
Overall, psychopaths

402
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,624
hurt others, okay?

403
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,709
To get what they want.

404
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,380
But our dear Ka-young,
she is a bit different.

405
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,926
Her grandma and the whole neighborhood
rallied together to raise her.

406
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,053
Though she may not feel guilt,

407
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,389
there are basic boundaries
she has learned to keep.

408
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,558
Mmm.

409
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,811
[clicks tongue, inhales] Okay, so what?

410
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,730
So I'm saying
that I'm watching you, asshole.

411
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:23,235
Ka-young has to keep
within her boundaries.

412
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,654
And I keep her safe from any threats.

413
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,866
Psychologically… [grunting]

414
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,703
…or physically.

415
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,457
I'm her knight in shining armor.

416
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,127
You are, aren't you?

417
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,756
All this time, I was thinking
you were a girl. Oh, my gosh. [chuckles]

418
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,466
This is on the house. [chuckles]

419
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,224

- [laughing]
- What are you laughing about?

423
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:14,202
That's the funniest thing I've heard
in 1,000 years.

424
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,871
- [both laughing]
- [Min-ji] 1,000 years?

425
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,165
What are you talking about?

426
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,753
You came to a seafood restaurant
just because a guy is with us?

427
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,299
- That's annoying.
- I only walked in when I saw you here.

428
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,218
I'll drop Min-ji off.
Go ahead and I'll see you at home.

429
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,929
Why don't I take her home?
We've gotten really close.

430
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,224
- Wait, Ka-young!
- [laughs] Excuse me, sir?

431
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,228
- Is there anything else you need?
- Mmm…

432
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,190
- Charity?
- What?

433
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,358
[amusing music plays]

434
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,236
Min-ji didn't leave any cash.
And, well, I… [claps]

435
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,448
I have no money at all. [laughing]

436
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,158

438
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,249
Oh, I know what that is. I got it.

439
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,672
- [line rings]
- This the police?

440
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,133
I'm turning myself in.

441
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,719
[distant siren wailing]

442
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,685
You dined and dashed? Huh?

443
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,437
[sighs] This is so unfair!

444
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,689
I didn't really dine. I didn't even dash.

445
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,815
Will you shut it?

446
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:30,153
Why call me to bail you out? And what
about the other one, huh? The angel?

447
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,823
[sighs] You don't know the whole story.

448
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,746
Ejllael and I are not only different,
we're also on very bad terms.

449
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,624
You and I are also on very bad terms.

450
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,920
[sighs] Why are you lowering your voice?

451
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,422
Even for Satan,
this isn't a laughing matter.

452
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,885
Ejllael and I fought a long war
against each other.

453
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,430
It was a devastating war.

454
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,516
Why did you two go to war?

00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,655
<i>And the genies were made</i>
<i>from smokeless fire.</i>

458
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,787
<i>The genies created from fire</i>
<i>became increasingly arrogant.</i>

459
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,748

<i>And Ejllael, he led the charge.</i>

465
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,128
The war lasted almost 300 years.

466
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,714
I lost most of my brothers in the fight.

467
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:18,053
You turned a petty fight
into a 300-year war?

468
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,597
I've barely seen my brothers since then.

469
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,352
I had defied His orders, so as punishment,
I was sent to Hell.

470
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:30,398
And when I was released, I got stuck in
a lamp for 1,000 years. So, you know.

471
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,570
Where are your surviving brothers now?

472
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,032
I don't know.

473
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,993
Out in the world, in some pot or a lamp.

- Huh?
- Can you find the brother who does that?

00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,825
- Tell him--
- He's moved to somewhere unknown.

Hey, miss. Does the owner
of this car live nearby?

Yes.

Total crypto king, huh?

492
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,678
I used to have one of these.

[tool whirring]

495
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,727
Oh, hey, you! Stop. I said patch the tire.
Why are you removing it?

496
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,775
You need to change it.
Have you even disclosed all of this?

497
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,485
It's a lot. Every customization?

498
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,321
What are you, a cop?
Why would I report that?

499
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,530
Hey, put it back on.

500
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,454

- [scoffs] What makes you ask that?

You got the hots for me?

502
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,584
I just have this sense
that you'll die on the way there.

503
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,628
- [scoffs]
- These wheels were customized for you?

504
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,631
The tire sizes are wrong.
If I just fix the hole,

505
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,925
it won't last an hour
before it breaks away.

506
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,512
I've explained it to you now.
Call a tow truck to take it out of here.

507
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,638
I refuse to fix it.

508
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,517
You treat your clients this way?
Hey, come here.

509
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,893

511
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,487
[exhales contentedly] Is everything okay?

512
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,406
Did you just drink that?

513
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,826
There's still a lot left.
These are for us, aren't they?

514
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,745
[sighs] That's why they keep going fast.

515
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,082
Oh, so what were you saying?

516
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,627
Uh, I need the tow truck's number, please.

517
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:43,258
0-1-0-6-3-4-2--

518
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,718
Please wait. I couldn't catch that.
[chuckles nervously]

519
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,638
You hit him or something?

520
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,682
[burps, exhales]

522
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:52,809
Whoa.

523

6-3-4… [sighs]

524
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,609
You're ruining the vibe!
This isn't a little kid's birthday party!

525
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,903
I'll report everything. I'm so very sorry.

526
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,947
- Thank you.
- [Sade] Where are you going?

527
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,824
- Why is he leaving? Don't go.
- Oh, shit!

528
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:08,992
[staff] Hello, ma'am.

529
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,122
Hello, ma'am.

530
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:20,003
Who's in charge of the display here?
Tell me, who's in charge here?

531
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,298
- Uh… Oh, she's here!
- [pants] I'm here. I'm sorry.

532
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,342
I ran quickly.
I had to just go out for a second.

533
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,720
I'm having tummy issues again. [laughs]

534
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,848
What makes you think that's an excuse
to leave your station?

535
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,310
We all get sick when we get to our age.

536
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,520
You want to keep your job,
just do it! Is that hard?

537
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,066
- [staff] Uh…
- I won't put up with this.

538
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,570
Ms. Jung Yeong-sun, what did you just say?

539
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,533
I won't put up with it anymore.
I'm fed up with you so I'm quitting.

540
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,535
Your behavior lately has been crazy.

541
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,537
Have you let that promotion
get to your head?

542
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,788
Ms. Jung Yeong-sun!

543
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,540
I don't know how you got that promotion,

544
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,001
but who do you think you are
treating people like this?

545
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,462
There are rumors
that you're taking bribes.

546
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,089
- That true? You think we're stupid?
- Okay, okay.

547
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,633

[Im-seon breathing heavily]
<i>I was such a fool.</i>

549
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,680
How could I ask to be a branch manager
at this age?

550
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,767
Everyone looks down on me,
and I'm bad at the job.

551
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,769
- [breath trembling]
- [chuckles softly]

552
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,774
I should've become manager sooner.

553
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,693
[pants] Hey, you! Here.

554
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,904
Here's my second wish.

555
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,450
Take me to 20 years ago.
I want to be manager then.

556
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:37,705
[gasps] If I became branch manager then,
how much would I have made?

557
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,334
[laughs] Mmm.

558
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,087
[chuckles softly]

559
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,217
Then back we go?
To 20 years before?

560
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,177

- [gasps]
- [cell phone ringing]

565
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,954
Once you walk through that door,
it will be 20 years in the past,

566
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,123
and you'll still work as the manager.

567

- [chuckles softly]
- [cell phone ringing]

568
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,591

[ominous music plays]

570
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,204
Why are you here alone? Where's your dad?
He said he was going to get you.

571
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,457
Well, Papa has work to do.

572
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,256
It's been a while.
Do you still drink chamomile tea?

573
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:14,177
Yeah, I continue to be a psychopath,
so caffeine's not for me.

574
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,888
[laughs]

575
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,931
Some people never change.

576
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,601
I thought you'd at least ask
what I'm doing here.

577
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,145
I live here now, with my wife and kid.

578
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,398
We just bought a house.
You put this area on our radar.

579
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,196
I've never told you
exactly where I happen to live.

580
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,657
It's not every day that a fellow alum
opens her own garage.

581
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,909
Oh.

582
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,080
Anyway, it's nice to see you again.
Looks like you're doing well.

583
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,790
And the garage is okay?

In 20 years, you're going to grow up
to be really pretty.

So try not to hurt yourself.

how did you cut your head?

[Iblis] Tsk.

608
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,308
Who do you think did it? [sighs]

609
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,351
Twenty years before, she was even worse.

610
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,437
Did you go to the past
to grant a wish for someone?

Where were you? It rained tonight!

Do you know how long I searched
the neighborhood looking for you?

635
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:10,538
Jeez. Hey. You took
a rock this big and you--

636
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,000
Wow. I mean, I heard you were "odd,"
but that's just--

637
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,210
You're changing the subject
as a defense tactic.

638
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,005
By the way, who's the dope that went
and visited you at the garage?

I heard you were kiki-ing together.

You can kiss me or beat me up.

But you can't do both, you kissing maniac!

00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,223
That right? Then I'm beating you up.

- [barking]
- They're worried I might take them in.

651
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,997
They rely on reading human feelings

If they keep barking even one more time,

into a cat.

00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,433
TO BECOME A PERSON, WITH SPECIFICS

676
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,395
CHARMING MIDDLE-AGED MAN IN HIS 40S
WHO LOOKS LIKE DANIEL HENNEY

677
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,022
Wow. That's not a face you often see here.

678
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,982
[chuckles] Are they shooting?

679
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,693
You know how I was sad
about losing my eyesight?

680
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,363
- Yeah.
- I'm not worried anymore. [chuckles]

681
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,031
- [chuckles] Let's go then.
- Yeah.

682
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,908
[woman chuckles] Wow.

683
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,495
[upbeat music playing]

684
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,678
[women gasping]

685
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,054
I'm so hungry.

686
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,139
Galbi?

687
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,433
Sounds good. Okay, let's go.

688
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,309
- [gasps]
- [passerby gasps]

689
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,063
Nice hair, nice suit. So handsome.

690
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,525
He's coming toward us.
Do you have makeup in your bag?

691
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,028
[sniffs]

692
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,405
[sniffing]

693
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,034
[sniffing]

694
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,327
[woman gasps]

695
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,913
[continues sniffing]

696
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,208
[comical music plays]

697
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,502
- [gasps]
- [man] Gross, what's he doing?

698
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,628
[woman] He must be crazy!

699
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,838
- [barks]
- [woman] Disgusting!

700
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,674
I've heard the handsome ones
are either dogs or gay.

701
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,093
Well, with how he's acting…

702
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,596
he's clearly a dog.

703
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,682
[objects thudding, clattering]

704
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:18,893
[Ejllael sighs]

705
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,066
You don't have any water here.

706
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,700
Eat the food tomorrow morning.

707
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,329
[groans, mutters indistinctly]

708
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,165
What?

709
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:48,255
I don't like the food you give us.
It tastes stale.

710
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,715
[laughs]

711
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,510
Oh, you're saying
it has no flavor. [chuckles]

712
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,221
I could've been heavier-handed
with the salt.

713
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,014
[strained laughing]

714
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,559
It was a joke. [chuckling]

715
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,397
What else does life have in store for me?

716
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,817
Mmm. I'm tired
of that question. [chuckles]

717
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,905
There's one thing I know for certain.

718
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,699
I'll be saving on the cost of salt.

719
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,369
[foreboding music plays]

720
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,715
[tool whirring]

721
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,890
- [blows]
- [cell phone vibrating]

722
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,352
Hi, Grandma.

723
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,605
<i>Ka-young, sweetheart,</i>
<i>you're not seeing things again, are you?</i>

724
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,692
<i>You're taking your medication</i>
<i>and not missing any doses?</i>

725
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,152
Yeah, I'm taking medication
every day. Why?

726
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,989
<i>And if you have any wishes,</i>
<i>you'll tell me about them, right?</i>

727
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,075
<i>- I'll get them for you.</i>
- Wha-- Wishes?

728
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:01,036
<i>I found this notebook in your room.</i>
<i>What is it? Did…</i>

729
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,788
<i>Did you have a crush on Daniel Henney?</i>

730
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,542
You can… see that?

731
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,295
She's able to see that?

732
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,213
[Iblis] Huh.

733
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,049
Was it always visible to everyone else?

734
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,676
You're seriously asking me that?

735
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,470
[sighs] This stupid magic
is too complicated.

736
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,140
This isn't going to work.

737
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,684
We need a place that's safe and private
to hide the notebook.

738
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,105
Your lamp. No one but you and Sade
are able to get into the lamp, right?

739
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:32,151
[inhales sharply] If they really
wanted to, Ejllael or Irem could.

740
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,485
You can't enter alone.

741
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,987
Which means it's safe.

742
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:39,158
What does it look like inside?
Is it warm and cozy?

743
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,243
[clicks tongue, sighs]

744
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,037
It's dismal.

745
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,371
[clicks tongue]

746
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,344
Mmm.

747
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,062
You get it now? Can you picture
how lonely I was in here?

748
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,772
I was trapped for 983 years.

749
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,815
I'm sorry, but I don't feel loneliness.

750
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,652
Are you able to feel sorry?

751
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,528
Of course not.

752
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,407
I say the word "sorry" to be considerate.
Min-ji told me that.

753
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,411
You know what consideration is?

754
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,456
Yes. That one's easy.
As long as I'm honest, it's fine.

755
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:32,044
For example, I might say something like
this. That relative of yours said that

756
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,464
if you bow your head to a righteous human,
he'll slit your throat.

757
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,049
Ejllael, that asshole!

758
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,636
[scoffs] You think that was considerate?
That's a big threat.

759
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,682
I can't believe it. [exhales]
I'm not scaring you at all.

760
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,101
If I'm being honest,
I don't know what fear is.

761
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,436
Grandma said apathy
is the worst quality in a person.

762
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:55,484
My grandma is a safety net to my apathy,
and if that safety net…

763
00:44:57,694 --> 00:45:01,740
were to disappear, then I might become
my most violent self.

764
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,327
I'm preparing for that possibility.
You probably know that from spying.

765
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,330
[Iblis] <i>You want to make your death</i>
<i>seem natural.</i>

766
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,165
[hesitates] Of course I know.

767
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,334
It'll be as close
to a natural death as possible.

768
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,420
Like some equipment malfunction at sea.

769
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,800
But what's the point if you don't have
any affection for humans?

770
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,719
Growing up, I learned I'm a stone
in everybody's shoe.

771
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,722
I make people uncomfortable.

772
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,434
So when I remove myself, the stone's gone.

773
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:30,727
For Grandma's sake.

774
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,650
Kill me if you're going to, and make it
quick. Don't get your throat slit.

775
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,656
Ejllael?

776
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,743
The more I see that angel,
the more he sucks.

777
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,956
- You can't ever lose to him, okay?
- So you're going to take my side now?

778
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,500
- I can't do that?
- No, you can't!

779
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,878
If you help me win, then… [sighs]

780
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,588
When I…

781
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,757
kill you…

782
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,468
Be so strange.

783
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,011
We're beyond strange already.

784
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,306
We're both considered anti-social.

785
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,058
Why do I get the finger-pointing
when everybody loves you?

786
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,940
So what was even the point
of bringing us back together again?

787
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,069
You're right.

788
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,533
That's something
I should've thought about.

789
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,952
At least you seem to understand.

790
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,040
Let's bring furniture. All right.

791
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,960
We'll put the table and chairs
I made in the workshop here.

792
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,045
[sighs heavily]

793
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,840
[lively orchestral music plays]

794
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,302
[whooshing]

795
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,682
They look like you bought them in a store.

796
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,726
I can't believe you created these.

797
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,771
No matter which way
you look at them, the details…

798
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:59,399
Will you stop talking?
Furniture count, two.

799
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,946
A rug over here would be nice,
wouldn't it?

800
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:05,656
[scoffs]

801
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,628
Closer, closer.

802
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,172
[Iblis] Hmm?

803
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,677
[automated voice]
<i>Starting the cleaning cycle.</i>

804
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,559
[Iblis] What's this for?

805
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,604
Is it used to fix things,
or maybe to destroy things?

806
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,731
That's up to you, I guess.

807
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:41,441
[lid thuds]

808
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,527
Hey!

809
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,699
You can't re-enter if you go that way.
It'll take longer than 1,000 years.

810
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:50,784
That thing.

811
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,160
[vacuum whirring]

812
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,037
[chuckles sheepishly]

813
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,001
[Ka-young] It looks
a little bit nicer now.

814
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,794
I'm feeling better.

815
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,049
Let's talk about Ms. Im-seon.

816
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,345
She could have wished for anything.
She chose a promotion.

817
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,974
What's with the supermarket
that makes her unable to leave?

818
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,976
Humans are like that.

819
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:20,063
They don't have the confidence to be kings
outside of their own castles.

820
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:24,651
They only want to rule what they already
know, so that's what they wish for.

821
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,863
It's one of the most
pathetic human traits.

822
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,324
And the reason I hate them all.

823
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,200
- [book thuds]
- [scoffs]

824
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,413
[Ka-young] Mmm. Mmm.

825
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,378
He knows so much,
but understands so little.

826
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,381
Humans hate you too, you know.

827
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:50,093
[nervously] Ah, so that's the other
use for that. [chuckles nervously]

828
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,474
If I kill you on behalf of all humans,
would that ensure I go to Heaven?

829
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,185
You think you would end there?

830
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,729
He'd give you Heaven if you asked.

831
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,689
Come here, now!

832
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,275
Come on, show yourself!

833
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,153
- I'm going to get you! Get here!
- Ooh! [laughs]

834
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,864
- [Ka-young shouting indistinctly]
- [Iblis laughing]

835
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,616
- [Ka-young] Get over here.
- No way.

836
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,077
[indistinct shouting]

837
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,705
[muffled shouting]

838
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,707
Where is that weird sound coming from?

839
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,627
[muffled shouting continues]

840
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,004
What's this? The sound's coming from here?

841
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,965
- This a radio?
- [muffled shouting]

842
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,052
[Heung-rye] Pan-geum, you here?
Pan-geum, are you home?

843
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,887
- Hello!
- Yes, Seongnim!

844
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,514
- [rumbling]
- [Pan-geum] Whoa!

845
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:38,100
You came all this way
when it's raining so much?

846
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,104
[Iblis breathing heavily]

847
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,275
The rain.

848
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,529
I heard her say it's raining.

849
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,447
[soft music plays]

850
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,867
That sounds right, doesn't it?

851
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,161
Is there alcohol here?

852
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,124
I could get it.

853
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,670
Couldn't we both go together?

854
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,048
Be quicker if we do.

855
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,970
- Do you have money for the alcohol?
- You pay with this.

856
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,847
- [Pan-geum sobbing]
- Oh, as collateral?

857
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,016
- I wanted to tell you as soon as I heard.
- Grandma?

858
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,435
[sobbing]

859
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,022
Grandma! Why are you crying?
What happened?

860
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,150
- [sobs] What do we do?
- Why is my granny crying?

861
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,403
We just heard
Mr. Kim, the craftsman, has died.

862
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:34,573
He was the man, the man who taught you
how to carve wood.

863
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,325
Okay, but why is Grandma crying?

864
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,870
A man passed away, so she's sad.

865
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,330
She's sad because he was her friend.

866
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:45,917
This is exactly why, you know,
why you get called a psychopath.

867
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,210
- Seongnim!
- Oh?

868
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,088
Oh! Oh, my! Oh, no!

869
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,842
My goodness.
Death makes it all seem meaningless.

870
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:57,220
[both sobbing]

871
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:03,018
[Heung-rye] It brings out all of the…
all of the tears! [wails]

872
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,645
- [indistinct chatter]
- [people crying]

873
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,446
[Pan-geum sniffles]

874
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,994
[Pan-geum] Oh, my. Oh, goodness.

875
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,039
It's so awful. I can't bear it.

876
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:27,000
The world casts away someone like him.

877
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:29,085
[Chang-sik sighs] Well, even so,

878
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,380
he passed comfortably,
as if he were sleeping.

879
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,965
That must be considered a good death.

880
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,010
That's a myth. There's no such thing
as having a good death.

881
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:41,640
You kids have no idea,
you still have so many years before you.

882
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,520
[Pan-geum] I have no fear
when it comes to dying.

883
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,690
But, when I… I think of Ka-young…

884
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,400
[sobbing]

885
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,613
I worry that my heart will stop beating
because of…

886
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,574
a heart attack.
Or what if I have a stroke?

887
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:03,620
What if I get cancer and diabetes,
and end up with dementia?

888
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,832
Oh! I would only burden her!

889
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,417
How will she ever take care of me?

890
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,503
Why would you say something like that?

891
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:16,466
It was in that moment, I realized
she read the exact same articles I did.

892
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:21,263
"The Rapidly Growing Aging Society."
"Getting Ready for Age-Related Illnesses."

893
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,849
"Medical Tomorrow."

894
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,518
If Grandma dies, I have to die too.

895
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:31,147
Yet, Grandma, she wants to live
a long and pain-free life.

896
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,233
So, what are you saying?

897
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,571
I am ready to make my second wish.

898
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,076
I want Grandma young.

899
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,871
So make Pan-geum my exact age.

900
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,498
That's it.

901
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,084
This will be the second wish.

902
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:53,837
[gasps softly]

903
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,089
[upbeat dance music playing]

904
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,636
[music continues]

905
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:28,927
[music ends]
