You were gone all night. Where did you go?

7
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,375
I distinctly remember saying
I'd go change--

[breath trembles]

9
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,593
What's wrong? What is it?

10
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,307
I was paid a visit just now…

[cries]

16
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,988
My arrogance resulted in…

17
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,742
I saw it all. Everything.

We are living in the now.

That's in the past, all of that.
It doesn't matter anymore.

21
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,757
You can't bring back the dead
or take us to the future.

22
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,593
But the future is happening now.

It's moment to moment.

24
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,013
But always moving.

25
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,642
The past is closed off.

26
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,519
Don't think of before.

27
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,063
But just think of moving forward.

28
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,444
Even if we don't know how it'll end.

29
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,536
[sniffles] All right.

30
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,206

- Okay, stop joking.
- It's not a joke.

36
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,310
It's driving me crazy too.
I honestly can't remember it.

37
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,187
That two-factor authentication bullshit.
Update the password that way.

38
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,107
I tried, but the verification texts
aren't coming and I'm not sure why.

Da-jin, stop messing around, seriously!

41

I don't know what to tell you!

42
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,450
It's like my brain has
a huge hole in it or something!

44

48

I wish she not remember anything!
Da-jin forgets everything!

49
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,381
She forgot everything.

50
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,676
The password counted in the wish?

51
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,303
[sighs]

52
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,639
What are we going to do?

53
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,308
[panting] Yeong-hyeon, I'm sorry.

54
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,310
I mean it. I don't know what happened.

55
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,104
Why I changed the password,
oh, it makes no sense, seriously!

56
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,317
Our wedding anniversary, our first date,

57
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:59,280

to marry you, it's none of those.

59
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,324
Hang on.

60
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,995
So, your passwords
were all things like that?

61
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,041
How did I just forget? I'm going crazy.
I swear… [whimpers]

Your father…

72

will recover.

Hmm? What did you say?

74
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,533
Wait, where are you going?

What's going on? What is all this?
What's happening?

00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,546
That bastard dropped your name
to the cops.

- It's all right. It's all right.
- [sighs]

It's going to be all right.

81
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,386
Let's get out of here. You too, Min-ji.

82
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,514
We need to keep you hidden for now.
I know a place.

83
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,726
You're right. We can't let bastards
like him put us in even worse danger.

84
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,602
Hiding is a good idea.

85
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,981
We can discuss more once we're there.
Where is it? Nearby?

[pills rattle]

87
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,698
What about the wake for Heung-Rye…

88
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,034
[Ka-young] I'll make a contribution.

89
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,244
For now, just take this
and get some sleep.

90
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,332
I have to go for a while.
I have to do something to resolve this.

91
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,794
No matter what,
you have to stay here, Grandma.

92
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,839
- Okay?
- All right.

93
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,844
Promise me to be careful.
You're going with her, yes?

94
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:49,390
Mm-hmm. I am, Oh Pan-geum.
I'll stay with her the whole time.

- That thing I said I'd tell you later…
- Forget it.

96
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,820
Already figured it out.
She's Grandma, I know.

97
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,616
I'll consider this a housewarming.
She and I can make ourselves cozy.

more or less.

- which one do you want?
- A genie, his beast,

105
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,430
and a lamp that looks like
a billionaire's penthouse.

106
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,184
Despite witnessing all of this magic,
I would still like to express

107
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,269
I still think we evolved from monkeys.

108
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,564
Hmm?

109
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,193
Yeah… That's, uh…

110
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,279
Uh, we can discuss that another time.

111
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,490
Why don't you get some rest for now?

112
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,407
Oh, you little…

113
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,538
- Kim Ha-neul, you found your toy, huh?
- Yeah.

114
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,165
See? You found it like I said,
because you had a proper look.

115
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,626
But you had to throw a tantrum,
cry and scream, didn't you?

116
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,420
So where was it? I swear,
we looked all over, up and down.

117
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,382
Ppoppi hid it. He told me where it was.

118
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,927
Come on, Ha-neul. You know Ppoppi
lives on a farm now, like we said.

119
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,014
It's true. Ppoppi whispered it
to me, remember?

120
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,141
In my ear.

121
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,980

I give you this money.

I'm ready for my final wish.

183
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,453
But tell that bitch, Ka-young,
I did exactly what she asked.

hundreds in order to get into heaven.

190
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,481
And here you are once again, destroying
chances for others, Ms. Ki Ka-young.

191

That's rich coming from you.

192
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,861
You bullied a small child.

193
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:21,198
You made me use up my wish
so Iblis would suffer the consequences.

194

You're doing it in this life too.
Get lost.

195

All I did is state what happened.

196

What happened isn't the whole truth.

197
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,165
I hate to break it to you,

198
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,376
it doesn't matter what you do,
Iblis will perish by my hand.

199
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,172
I followed his orders,
I bowed down to mankind.

200
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,258
However, Iblis disobeyed his every word.

201
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:43,721
Not for one minute has Iblis ever followed
his orders obediently.

202

The fact that he still shows
that shaytan grace to this day

203
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,226
has to be so that I can complete my task.

204
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,270
It means that me slitting his throat

205
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,691
will be the thing that elevates me
to his right hand side.

210

you're committing the sin of envy.

211
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,292
And what's worse?
You have an inferiority complex.

212
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,170
It's more complicated than that.
I act only for His--

Oh, shut up!

214
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,009

Iblis' throat. Do you know why?

What's wrong?

- "Your father will recover."
- Huh?

- Authentication?

Dad, you should be getting another message
right now. Read it out to me.

- Yeong-hyeon.

- [yelping] I'm sorry.

So, that means I won?

I won in the end?

280
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,173
I'd say Gu Bo-gyeong's final wish
half counts.

281
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:53,345
So, I guess I could try to make my case
that you and I have tied. [chuckles]

once and for all.

So make your last wish.

349

Any resistance will bring harm
to those you love.

350
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,551
Your grandmother, your friend,
all the people in your village.

351
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,346
Wish the lamp over to me
and let's be done with it.

352
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,681
A zero-sum game, huh?

353
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:35,228
[sighs] Okay. You'll stop going on
about how we're connected.

354
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,357

you son of a bitch!

That bitch used up her final wish
on this bullshit?

360

Find her. Track her down now!

361
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,751
Yes!

362
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,673

Well, that's what I've got.

373
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,605
- Don't know what to do now.
- That's okay, I'll take it from here.

374
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,442
We have the thread. I'll take it with me
and bring it to my brother's garden.

375
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,864
You two, follow me.
The rest, spread out! Find her!

378
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,165

This is a gift from Ejllael.

396

From Ejllael?

397
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,779
This is it.

398
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,490
It's Iblis' lamp.

399
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,452
Irem. What are you doing?

400
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,747
I told you that one day
you would need to choose.

401
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,250
I serve only my master and no one else.

402
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,377
This is what your master ordered? No way!

403
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,587
That is not for mythical beasts to ask.

404
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,798
We do as we're told.

Hang on. How come I still see it?

407
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,562
They said it would evaporate
the minute her wishes were made.

408
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,483
She still has a wish left?

409
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,694
She deceived me.

410
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,239
[sighs] That bitch.

I thought I'd stall.

435
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,571
If you destroy that flower
before she makes it,

436
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,283
that ruins everything I've worked towards.

438
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,581
You asked why I bore out the eyes.

439
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,668
I saw their ambitions.

440
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,672
This, right here,
is the ambition of the angels.

441
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,175
Still fighting that 300-year war.

442
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,012
- Even now.
- You really thought the war had been won?

443
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,932
Where is the peace our battle won us?

444
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,060
You should've never removed that sword.

445
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,147
That sword brought calamity to us angels.

446
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,984
Nor should you
have ever met her again either.

447
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:01,781
Seeing as you've recovered your memories,
it should be clear how that ends. [scoffs]

448
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,660
I hope Ka-young's wish is a righteous one.

449
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,704
I will then slit your throat.

450
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,914
She'll go back to how she always was.

451
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,586
She'll forget you
and go back to her life of torment,

452
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,837
ostracized, denounced.

453
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,759
Because that is the appropriate fate
for a human who is loved by a satan.

454
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,345
Just as it was, it will be again.

455
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,599
I too hope her wish

456
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,811
is a noble wish, whatever it may be.

457
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,230
She may not know goodness,

458
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,692
but she saw to it that
she only made good choices.

459
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,946
I hope the rest of her life is peaceful.

460
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,616
Her memories will vanish.

461
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,953
She'll go back to her life,
rebuked for being a psychopath.

462
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,247
Her life indeed may be boring again…

463

464
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,501
…but she would still be righteous,

465
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,712
she'd still be worthy of love,
just as he intended.

466
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,133
That, right there,
is why I met her in this life.

467
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,095
So that the end of this war

468
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,599
would give heaven to Ki Ka-young.

469
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,859
And so you will…

00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,472
<i>I shall show you the equal face of sorrow</i>

700
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,567
<i>When I called to you from the shadows</i>

701
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,574
- [crying]
- Please leave us.

702
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,994
We will wash and dress the deceased.

703
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,537
[Min-jae crying] Please, leave us.

704
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,041
[Iblis] <i>Not once did you show me</i>
<i>An equal smile</i>

705
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,793
OH PAN-GEUM

706
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,338
<i>When someone huddled under a straw sack</i>
<i>Freezes to death</i>

707
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,257
GRANDCHILD: KI KA-YOUNG

708
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,678
<i>You did not so much as put</i>
<i>A single straw over them</i>

709
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,478
<i>For your indifferent love</i>

710
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,525
<i>For your tears</i>
<i>That seem incapable of flowing</i>

711
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,322
It's painful.

712
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:08,825
[Iblis] <i>I will now also give wait to you</i>

713
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,997
Just deal with the pain for today.

714
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,292
You have to.

715
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,170
I thought I made all the right decisions.

716
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:26,802
Grandma is lying in a casket,
and now I'm miserable, so get off!

717
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,220
Miserable?

718
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:32,349
You're miserable because you don't like
that you made a bad decision?

719
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,518
It's not just you.

720
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:38,647
I lost Grandma. I was in love…

721
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,860
even though it was brief.

722
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,410
[sighs]

723
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,124
So you need to bear it too.

724
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,710
[Min-ji sniffles]

725
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,796
If I make a choice for someone,

726
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,925
everyone's unhappy afterwards.

727
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,803
[young Min-ji] Be my friend.

728
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,930
And what if I don't
wanna be friends with you?

729
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:16,018
- You and I are both negative ones.
- You have no other option.

730
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,228
So, we are friends from now on.

731
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,480
You're terrible at school.

732
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,192
So it appears I'm a negative one still.

733
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,118
Your mother offers this
to offset the costs.

734
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:35,996
[sighs]

735
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,583
[Iblis] <i>I will stop the blizzard of snow</i>
<i>That fell on the world</i>

736
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,297
You said you were going
somewhere nicer than Hawaii.

737
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,175
How have you returned to us like this?

738
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,177
[low chattering]

739
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,101
[Ka-young's aunt crying]

740
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,482
[Ka-young's aunt sobbing]

741
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:12,407
[Iblis] <i>I will take the spring snow</i>
<i>That fell on the barley fields</i>

742
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:17,663
<i>And take them to visit the sorrow</i>
<i>Of the people shivering with cold</i>

743
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,126
<i>I will walk the snowy paths</i>

744
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,922
<i>No longer snowing, with you</i>

745
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,222
[Ka-young's aunt bawling]

746
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:40,852
Oh, my gosh. She behaves like this
at her grandma's funeral?

747
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,731
Such a strange, strange girl.
Not even crying.

748
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,491
Do you have to act so strange today? Huh?

749
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,828
I knew from the start
Gyeong-seok should've held it!

750
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,538
[wailing]

751
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,250
Ma!

752
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,672
Mama! [wailing]

753
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:13,677
Mama!

754
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,679
[bawling]

755
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,681
[mourners murmuring]

756
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,975
[Iblis] <i>We will talk</i>
<i>Of the power of sorrow</i>

757
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,646
<i>And walk all the way</i>

758
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,816
<i>To the sorrow of waiting</i>

759
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,368
[sentimental music plays]
