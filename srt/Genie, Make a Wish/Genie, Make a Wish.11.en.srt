[gentle music plays]

177
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,445
Why do you live like this anyway?
Don't you get angry?

178
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,701
I was given a second chance at life.
I don't remember dying, though.

179
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,581
These bite marks on my body
are surely connected to it.

180
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,253
I know that I was kept alive
for a reason, though.

181
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,715
And so, I should live with joy.

182
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,635
[chuckles softly]

183
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,905
[gentle music continues]

184
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:54,124
How foolish. Do you truly believe
there's a right kind of wish?

185
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,378
To gain something,
one has to lose something.

186
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,464
For a person to live, someone's life
must end. That's how it goes.

187
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,550
Sade!

188

194
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,774
Khalid.

195
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,866
I bought this from a stall selling linens.

196
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,078
He said this is good for coughs.

197
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,664
You must boil it and drink it,
then you'll be all better.

198
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,711
You take care of the children
and the elderly alike?

199
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,296
Stop that.

200
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,007
Your kind sells out the people
closest to them

201
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,508
and never shows a bit of gratitude.

202
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,803
Isn't that right?

203
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,974
After all, you're half-human
and half-spirit.

204
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,228
You know, his father sings like an angel.

205
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,563
Are you the spirit Shadi's son?

206
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,485
You are sick and weak because
you were cursed with a mortal body.

207
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,404
[suspenseful music plays]

208
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,907
Are you Iblis?

209
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,536
Could you cure this sickness?
You can do anything you desire, can't you?

210
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,748
You are the leader of spirits,
are you not?

211
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,667
I hate being weak.

212
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,176
This body is cursed. Please get me out.

213
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,222
This thread here can bind souls.
I will give it to you in exchange.

214
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,598
An enticing offer.

215
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:20,312
But I couldn't accept this request,
even if we are kin.

216
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,398
[Iblis] Let's go.

217
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,093
[groans softly]

218
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,975
- [Iblis grunts]
- [gasps, yelps]

219
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,936
- [groans]
- Hey, lie down if you're tired.

220
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,814
- Why are you forcing yourself awake?
- [sighs]

221
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,859
I said to warn me before
you just showed up like this.

222
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,153
How could I have been any clearer?

223
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:10,946
[sighs]

224
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,491
What are you staying up at night
to make anyway?

225
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,910
- Instead of resting.
- Hanbok.

226
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,914
I'm going to wear it
when we arrive at Goryeo.

227
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,334
But I have to work during the day.

228
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,089
It's so dark, how can you see like this?

229
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,383
Come on.

230
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,386
[captivating music plays]

231
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,022
[past-life Ka-young]
This is where you live?

232
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,442
Wow. It's like a palace.

233
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,985
You've clearly never seen a palace.

234
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,489
Hey. I'm from Gaegyeong.

235
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,700
There are tons of beautiful
and grand palaces there.

236
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,954
Even looking at them from the gates,
even seeing them from far away.

237
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,627
- Even the shape is… You know?
- So you've never been inside.

238
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,673
- Got real close up to one, one time.
- So what else is in your hometown?

239
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,593
[grunts] How different could it be
from here?

240
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,261
[past-life Ka-young] Mmm…

241
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,309
Goryeo has all four seasons.

242
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,105
In summer, it's lovely and warm.

243
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,482
And in autumn, the leaves change.

244
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,903
And in winter, white snow falls.

245
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,908
And when you see
the plum blossoms start to bloom,

246
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,077
spring's arrived.

247
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:46,708
And once the plum blossoms wither away,
then cherry blossoms grow in their place.

248
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,545
[chuckles softly]

249
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,715
The cherry blossoms are especially pretty.

[romantic music plays]

253
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,831
[past-life Ka-young] In Goryeo,
we'd write out our wishes

254
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,916
and send them on boats down the streams.

255
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,921
We believed that if the boats reached
the ocean, they would come true.

256
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,926
Consider this the ocean at night.
Shall I send them out to sea?

257
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,764
Even further.

258
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,977
To the place where the land meets the sky.

259
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,063
Beyond Earth.

260
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,151
To Goryeo.

[romantic music continues]

262
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,666
[Iblis] What did you write
on those boats anyway?

263
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,170
[past-life Ka-young]
No need for you to know.

264
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,087
[Iblis scoffs]

265
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,548

it's raining stars.

Ejllael! Ejllael has arrived

[Ejllael] My sacred wings
shall guide you to the afterlife.

Hey, before you even take a feather
from my wings, first tell me what's--

284
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,604
What's wrong with you?

[Ejllael] <i>What could a mere</i>

[weapon thuds]

298
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,748
He was more interested in that human
than any other.

299
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,794
He seemed far more excited
figuring out how to make her laugh

300

and what to feed her…

301
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,882

Look, I'm over here complaining about

But I can't complain
if you're just crying.

Apologies, I was too busy crying
to read your lips.

Everything you find
is full of these stones.

So, when will you be done
with your clothes? For Goryeo?

Really? You mean that? We can go?

- What about your lamp, though?
- Hmm…

329
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,433
I'll just see if I can convince Him
to hurl it with all his might at Goryeo.

330
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,897
You, who are all-knowing,
and strong and great.

331
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,025
And benevolent and noble.

332
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:51,156
And also merciful, and of course,
wise and, uh, um…

333
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,033
Hmm, and…

334
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,203
- You're desperate and it shows.

You're glowing.

A new master? But how?

339
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,056
I'm still tied to your final wish.

340
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,142
No one should be able to conjure me yet.

341
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,353
This is far too soon.

342
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,231
Couldn't this be a good thing
when you think about it?

343
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,693
You were bored without anyone to tempt
with wishes. Isn't that what you said?

344
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,904
[exhales] You're right.

345
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,699

[man] Finally we meet, Iblis.

00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:06,273
You have cursed me to live as
an oppressed Arab migrant for two decades.

[Iblis] <i>Huh, it seems I missed someone.</i>

358
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:57,032
Please, I want to have more
than anybody else in the realm.

359
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,078
Listen carefully to my first wish.

360
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,833
I wish to have more than even
the wealthiest person in all of Arabia.

361
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,925
I knew you would ask for that.

362
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,388
Your wish has been fulfilled.

- I have decided on my second wish, Genie.

368
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:09,396
Kill whoever has sneered at me
or dared to cause me any pain of any kind.

I got lucky today.
Look, I got some dates for us.

386
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,135
Have some, all right?

387
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,262
Thank you.

388
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,264
Yes. So you do know who I am.

389
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,685
Those dates you gave me
were very delicious.

390
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,856
As thanks, I shall now give you more
than you could possibly imagine.

Clothes, food, houses, servants, jewelry.

392

Anything you like.

393
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,618
All I want is what I can earn,

394
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,704
but only by my own effort.

395
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,292
I shall be leaving anyway.
I'm planning to return to my country.

397
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,089
You're leaving?
You're too good for my offer?

398
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,343
Now that I am up here,
looking down on you,

399
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,930
I see you're that same slave girl
I bought to feed to my animals.

400
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,933
And even so, you dare think
so highly of yourself?

[exhales angrily]

402
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,358

[Iblis gasps softly]

404
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:24,989

[chuckles softly]

406
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,910
I had finished it a while ago.

407
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,832
However, there was a chance
you wouldn't be able to leave yet.

408
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,084
Because of the wishes.

409
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,670
I don't know the way to Goryeo.
And anyway,

410
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,047
I wouldn't want to go without you.

411

Muttalib's final wish.

414
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:55,186
That means you'll be free after this.
We'll head out tonight.

415
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,065
- For Goryeo.
- Yes. Let's go.

416
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,986
I shall experience
the four seasons of Goryeo.

417
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,488
The bright red leaves, the snowfall,

418
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,241
the cherry and plum blossoms.

419
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,202
If you can't find me, call my name.

420
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,207
You may call me… [enunciating] Iblis.

421
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,002
Iblis.

422
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,172
It's very unique.

423
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:25,842
Is that good?

424
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,845
If so, yes, it is. [chuckles]

429
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,955
Well, then. What is your final wish?

430
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,126
It has dawned on me that I left something
very valuable behind in the desert.

431
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,797
Something so valuable that no amount
of money can possibly obtain it.

432
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,343
My final wish is for her
to submit to me fully.

433
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:13,389
I wish that this girl remain by my side
for the rest of her life.

Your last wish has been fulfilled.

00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:33,326
Now, I'd like to see this unique woman
that no amount of money may ever buy.

Why you?

444
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,517
[Muttalib] What are you doing here?

445
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,187
I see. You've come crawling back!

446
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,774
I knew no one could ever resist
all my riches.

447
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:09,028

460
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,655
You refused my gift to you.
You were convinced the thread was useless.

461
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,824
It has a use, you see.

462
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,120
- A great use.

She loves the Shaytan!

Listen now, I am a Genie!

My lamp can grant any human three wishes.

I ask you to grab ahold of the lamp
and claim yourself as my owner.

518
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:28,663
You must swear, though,
to use the first of your wishes

to save the life of this girl here.

520

Yes, I will do it, Genie.

528
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,867
I wish that I was
the richest man in Arabia.

529
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,744
Richer than Muttalib!

530
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,663
You…

[tense music plays]

532
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,634
All right, then.

533
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:28,347
Now, you must use your next wish
to save this girl here.

534
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,183
Do it.

535
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,935
Do it!

536
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,605
<i>Mashallah!</i> I'm so rich now!

537
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,442
- But it's not enough. It's not enough.
- [Iblis] No.

538
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,986
I need more. I need even more riches!

539
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,281
[crying] But, you can't. No.

540

[gusting]

541
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,959
This is your final wish.

542
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,255
Repeat this. "I wish to save this girl."

544
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,721
Do it now! You have to do it! [sobbing]

545
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,561
I wish for more gold, Genie.

546
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,981

[sobbing] No. No, no, no.

561
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,386
No, this can't… this can't.

562
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:34,348

our punishment.

594
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:52,189
I have lived for so long,
suffering pain in this body.

595
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,735
It does seem, though, that this
eternal body finally released me.

596
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,404
Then, I became a wandering soul.

597
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,573
<i>Until I met her and you.</i>

598
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,120

I know.

602
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,134
I caused that too.

603
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,469
[Hunbish] I now return to you,

604
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,057
this tragic and beautiful story,

605
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,644
as punishment
for granting me eternal life.

606
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,607
Born with no grasp of goodness
and being good anyway.

607
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:39,027
Her last wish, whatever it is,
please protect her.

608
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,871
I offer you my deepest apologies.

609
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,375
You were a noble child,
one of the finest I've known.

00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,613
She didn't fly anywhere. I'm telling you,
she didn't even go to Hawaii.

How did you get your youth back?

00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,045
Tell me right now!
Tell us all what you've done!

Let go! You'll see,
that bitch is playing us!

00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:01,516
She bartered with the devil!
She became that young lady! Okay?

678
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,853
Hey! I'd like to be young again too!

679
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,813
- Do me next!
- [Min-jae] No one's getting young.

680
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,483
- Let go! Let go of me, you brat!
- [Jong-heon] It's dangerous.

681
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,194
- Ms. An, stand back. It's dangerous!
- [Bok-ja grunts]

682
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,280
Tell me. Is the Lord even there?

683
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:19,618
If He is real, He wouldn't let me be
so unhappy.

684
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,580
Why, Lord?
Why do I have to be old? [wails]

685
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:27,209
- [Chang-sik] Please try to calm down!
- [Heung-rye] When did I get so damn old?

Wait. I know where she is.

689
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,510
- The field!
- [Min-jae] Where are you going?

690
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,012
- [Chang-sik] What now?
- [Min-jae] Ms. Park, stop!

691
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,014

- Oh. Don't get out.
- [Chang-sik] Calm down!

693

Stay and we'll sort this out!

694
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,562
- Let's go! I'll take care of it.
- [Chang-sik] Where's she running to?

695
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,022
I'm positive she's at the field.

696
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:51,691
- [Chang-sik] You'll hurt yourself!
- [Min-jae] Calm down!
