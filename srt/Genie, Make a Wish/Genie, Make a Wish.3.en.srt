[theme music playing]

2
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,982
GENIE, MAKE A WISH

3
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,779
I want you to prove it to me.
That all humans are corrupt at heart.

4
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,073
That's my first wish.

5
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,660
You've tempted me. Well done.

6
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,957
You would gamble your life away

7
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,127
just to validate the human race?

8
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,463
Wow. [laughs] That's ridiculous.

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,719
No matter what's next,
I'm going to make sure you lose.

10
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,805
I'll crush you, mortal.
You're gonna cry so--

11
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,056
Save it for if you do win.

12
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,225
Just wear it.

13
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,854
Let's get started so I can win.

14
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,816
You're following my lead, okay?

15
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,362
Get a move on, mortal.
The spring nights are short.

16
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,576
So, if you have been imprisoned
for 983 years,

17
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,870
why are you the most famous Genie?

18
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,874
I was famous well before
because I dared to defy His orders.

19
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,209
And why did you defy Him?

20
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,171
- You've tempted me. Well done.
- I was tempte-- [clears throat]

21
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,219
I refused to bow to a creation
forged out of clay of all things.

22
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,929
- A coin on the ground.
- Where?

23
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,682
[amusing music plays]

24
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,060

[hums]

26
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,151
No, please take your time.

27
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,945
Take all the time in the world.

28
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,577
I will corrupt you
if it's the last thing I do, you hear?

29
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,829
I'm gonna snap your neck. Yeah?

30
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,499
I'll hang your head
on the doorknob of hell and…

31
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,918
[Im-seon] Ka-young, is that you?

32
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,630
[Iblis] Huh?

33
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,885
Ah, our first human to corrupt.

34
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,512
I'm overdue for an oil change.

35
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,099
I'll swing by this weekend, okay?

36
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,225
Sure. Come by.

37
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,437
Kang Im-seon.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,023
Works at the supermarket.
Wife of Grandma An's son.

39
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,692
Huh. I know that look well.

40
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,154
That's a woman who'd smile
if the world ended tomorrow.

41
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,238
[cell phone chimes]

42
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,535
Gu Bo-gyeong.

43
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,287
Works at the bank.

44
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,164
We went to school together.

45
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,421
Did you get the message
regarding the towel sets from the bank?

46
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,927
Though, I'm sure
you already have nicer ones.

47
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,225
- Going out?
- Just walking. Good night.

48
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,142
Huh?

49
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,228
Ah.

50
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,319
I also know that look well.

51
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,864
One more who would also smile
if the world ended tomorrow.

52
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,205
That's two. Good as corrupted, no?

53
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,249
[dog growls]

54
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,208
- [dog barks]
- [gasps]

55
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,507
Aw. Another look I know well.

56
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,593
- [continues barking]
- What? Do I not look like I belong here?

57
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,178
Is the lamp oil too strong?

58
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,268
Is your hairpin still in?
Why's he barking at you?

59
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,353
Satisfied?

60
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,315
Dogs can perceive the supernatural.
They can see me no matter what.

61
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,276
- Hmm?
- Is that so? Interesting.

62
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,280
Of the neighborhood, he barks at me
the most out of all the dogs.

63
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,614
Oh, yeah?

64
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,742
I suppose that makes you
our special third mortal.

65
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,828
Nice to meet you, little buddy.

66
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,996
[dog whimpers]

67
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,331
What are you doing?
Our deal doesn't apply to dogs.

68
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,459
Sure about that?

69
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,963
You said the first five lives
we encounter, did you not?

70
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,842
"All mortals" means all life-forms.
That's the rule. Wouldn't you agree?

71
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,302
Ki Ka-young and her rules.

72
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,012
[sighs]

73
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,723
THIS WAY TO CHEONGPUNG VILLAGE HALL

74
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,311
Ms. Ki?

75
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,771
Where are you headed this late?

76
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,690
You know better
than to be out alone at night.

77
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,607
[Iblis] Mm?

78
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,776
- Want a ride?
- No.

79
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,863
I'm waiting for someone here.
I'm not alone.

80
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,577
Okay.

81
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,287
See ya.

82
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,375
[Iblis] Huh.

83
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,502
Eom Sang-tae.

84
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,672
His mother is Grandma Sa.
She owns the gamja-tang joint.

85
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,217
Eom Sang-tae is clearly unaware
that the only menace out here is you.

86
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,677
No, he knows.

87
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,763
Everyone knows all about the weird girl.

88
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,224
But he knows nothing at all
about what I know.

89
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,226
[Iblis scoffs]

90
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,354
Ow, you scared me.

91
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,023
- [Iblis] Hmm?
- [sighs in relief]

92
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,611
You're out for a walk
in the middle of the night. Cool.

93
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,488
YouTube still going well?

94
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,908
- And Da-jin is doing okay?
- [man] Da-jin, lock the doors!

95
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,910
Just kidding. [laughs]

96
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,078
- Okay.
- [Iblis scoffs]

97
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,829
- Have a good night.
- [Iblis scoffs]

98
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,872
[man panting]

99
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,337
I think it's been a year.

100
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,339
He got married and started a farm.

101
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,674
He makes these YouTube videos
with his wife.

102
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,219
That means we have our five.

103
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,137
You must win at least three.

104
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,098
I will make it with all five.

105
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,185
Won't be long
before they've sunk to rock bottom.

106
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,939
And that bottom goes quite deep.

107
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,608
If you ever want to see behind the mask,

108
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,903
just present them with wishes.

109
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:45,988
Really?

110
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,242
Well, I made a wish.
What's behind my own mask, then?

111
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,577
A psychopath.

112
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,041
Four humans, one dog, all damned.
Thanks to your one wish.

113
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,585
Oh…

114
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,255
I should also mention one other thing.

115
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,134
There are good genies
and there are bad genies in the world.

116
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,887
One, just one can produce hell on Earth.

117
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,641
They call that genie "Iblis"

118
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,811
or "Shaytan" sometimes.

119
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,106
To use a language you'll recognize…

120
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,317
"Satan."

121
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,489
Well…

122
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,035
It appears I've met an evil genie.

123
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,788

[captivating music continues]

130
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,547
[Sade] What are you gonna do now?

131
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,383
Even in this life,
she used a wish for the sake of others.

132
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,595
It's not for the sake of others,
not really.

133
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,181
Did she not just wager her life
on humans being good?

134
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,100
What do you call that?
And what did you say? "Psychopath"?

135
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,311
"I'm Satan"? Oh, yeah. Great job.

136
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,314
Who'd have thought rats
would be so reliable in relaying info?

137
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:44,941
[whimpers]

138
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,983
[sniffs]

139
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,569
I didn't want to lose.

140
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,072
[sighs] What now?

141
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,574
Should I just skip this life?

142
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,702
Ka-young could live
up to 80 years at most.

143
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,872
- [buttons clack]
- Those 80 years

144
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,208
would slip by with this lamp
and those aluminum kettles.

145
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,919
And the money to do that,
how will that work?

146
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,213
Yeah, you're right.
Better to skip this life.

147
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,465
So, for now, I'll just pass undetected.

148
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,469
You need to get hired at her garage
so you can rummage for info. Okay?

149
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,806
Oh, so you're just gonna live off me…

150
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,267
Where can I find you, Master,
if I need you?

151
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,730
I shall hide away above the ground.

152
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,358
Somewhere close to Him.

- [Pan-geum] Come on. Time to eat.
- No, sorry. I'm in a hurry.

156
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,330
Oh, wait.

157
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,915
I know just where to eat that.

158
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,543
If you don't mind,
don't tell Ka-young about this.

159
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,261

Mm!

164
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,612
This is really scrumptious.

165

[daunting music plays]

167
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,039
[man on radio] What's going on?
Status report.

168
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,249
[pilot 1] Unidentified
flying object spotted.

169
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,167
[chuckles]

170
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,502
Is… Is that a carpet? Over.

171
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,671
Whoa.

172
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,549
[pilot 2] What the--
He's eating bibimbap! Over!

173
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,261
[man] What are you talking about?
Give me a proper report!

174
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,393
Hmm? What is it?

175
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,895
What do you want?

176
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,812
Huh?

177
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,775
Oh! Are you two meeting each other?

178
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,193
Gotcha!

179
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,903
[pilot 2] He's fleeing! Awaiting orders.

180
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,613
[pilot 1] Permission
to shoot down. Over.

181
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,947
[announcer] At 3:39 p.m. today,

182
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,909
the Ministry of National Defense
reported an unidentified flying object

183
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,662
in the maritime border area
between South Korea and Japan,

184
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,498
leading to a fighter jet standoff
between the two countries.

185
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,834
They've avoided providing any details
regarding the flying object.

186
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,051
[Ka-young] It seems
I've identified our flying object.

187
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,387
With remarkable detail.

188
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,806
I just took a little excursion
to think about it all.

189
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,183
Little?

190
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,520
Your little excursion
nearly caused a war to break out.

191
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,106
You just had to take
to the skies to have your lunch.

192
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,190
Bibimbap!

193
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,610
I hear you're looking for help, Ms. Ki.

194
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,029
[whispering] Stop.

195
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,240
Just wait.

196
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,825
[sighs]

197
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,078
I'm a very good employee.
I'm passionate about cars.

198
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,331
- They're my bread and butter.
- Oh, uh, why don't we…

199
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,835
maybe not talk about food right now?

200
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,713
What's going on?

201
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,632
[suspenseful music plays]

202
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,717
You two are clearly friends.

203
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,183
I thought you said
you were gonna, you know,

204
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,144
keep yourself out of sight from her.

205
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,063
You blew your cover. I have an idea.

206
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,400
I better change tactics.

207
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,987
But what can you possibly do
under a bridge?

208
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,324
Why did Ki Ka-young die for them
when she had no interest in dying for me?

209
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,577
What about them versus me?

210
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,163
I must find the answer.

211
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,373
Wait here.

212
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,834
Huh? Damn it.

213
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,419
[shouts] Where are you going?

214
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,755
[suspenseful music plays]

215
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,677
Comrades. May we will meet again,
alive at Harbin Station.

216
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,804
Yes.

217
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,185
[Iblis] Ki Ka-young?

218
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,770
Oh. [chuckles]

219
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,314
Who are you?

220
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,357
Pleased to meet you,
past-life Ka-young.

221
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,525
One quick question.

222
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,946
- Do you know an An Jung-geun?
- [running footsteps]

223
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,407
Comrades! We've been compromised!

224
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,534
Everybody run! Now! [panting]

225
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,329
Been spying on us, have you?

226
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,873
Spying? What's spying?

227
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,126
- No, I just wanna ask you something.
- [running footsteps]

228
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,961
[guns cocking]

229
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,630
- [man 1] Fire!
- [man 2] Run!

230
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,173
[gunshots]

231
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,966
Ah, so loud. I don't like it.

232
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,056
[groaning] Stop it! That hurts!

233
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,308
Hey! We were in the middle of something.

234
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,851
I don't want these things.

235
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,940
[soldiers grunting and groaning]

236
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,112
Oh, no. I was just trying to return
those things to you. Right, Ki Ka-young.

237
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,366
Where are you going? Ki Ka-young! Hold up!

238
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,826
I haven't asked you my question.
It'll only take a second.

239
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,662
[panting]

240
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,247
Thank you for saving me.

241
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,708
If there's more life beyond this,

242
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,127
I hope we meet again.

243
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,547
Wait, no.
I wanna talk to you in this life.

244
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,340
[man] Get that one! Him!

245
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,675
- Fire!
- [gunshots]

246
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,970
[groans] That stings, that stings!
I told you, I don't want these!

247
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,930
[soldiers groaning]

248
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,557
- Oh, Ki Ka-young.
- [man 2] Over there!

249
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,809
- Don't let him get away!
- Oh. Wait…

250
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,644
[sighs] This life won't do.

251
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,440
- [man 3] Where'd he go?
- [man 2] Find him.

252
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,734
THE YEAR 1592

253
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,279
[dramatic music playing]

254
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,618
[horse neighing]

255
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,079
[Chang-sik] A messenger
from the naval command

256
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,747
of the Jeolla province has arrived.

257
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,832
[king] Let him in.

258
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,169
Deliver your scroll.

259
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,088
Yes, sir.

260
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,011
[Iblis] Ki Ka-young.

261
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,061
Ki Ka-young.

262
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,023
- [man 1] Who's saying that?
- [man 2 whispers] Is someone's speaking?

263
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,316
Oh, so you're a man?

264
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,068
- [Ka-young gasps]
- [man] Whoa.

265
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,529
- What's going on?
- Unusual.

266
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,157
[men whispering]

267
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,452
Ki Ka-young.

268
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,037
I've gotta ask you a question.

269
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,582
"Your Majesty. I, Yi Sun-sin,
General of the Jeolla Province,

270
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,875
- offer this report…"
- Right.

271
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,127
It's about that person there. Yi Sun-sin.

272
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,212
"…the front line of the enemy forces
at Busan Port,

273
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,756
and in doing so,
managed to sink…"

274
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,591
- Ki Ka-young.
- "…100 Ki Ka-young--"

275
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,844
[sighs] "One hu-Ki-- No, one hundred--"

276
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,930
Sire, I willingly accept death
as punishment.

277
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,514
- [king] Who was that?
- [Iblis] Mm.

278
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,432
Show yourself.

279
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,852
Who keeps going on
about this Ki Ka-young?

280
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,730
[chuckles softly]

281
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:41,941
[Iblis] Oh.

282
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,235
- Uh…
- [man 1] What is this sorcery?

283
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,530
- [man 2] Who is this?
- [man 3] Where did he come from?

284
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,990
[man 2] Is he a person or a ghost?

285
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,742
I just had an important question.

286
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,035
[man 1] How did he sneak in?

287
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,080
That-- That strange, tall, towering man…

288
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,666
- Seize that necromancer!
- [man] Yes, sir.

289
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,709
- Off with his head!
- [man] Yes. Yes, take him.

290
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,710
Off?

291
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,462
[man 2] Be gone with him.

292
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,546
How does that work?

293
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,259
[radio narrator]
One unofficial Joseon text stated

294
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,722
that the being stayed alive
for three whole days after being beheaded.

295
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,142
For all three days,
it continued its bizarre ranting,

296
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,062
crying out, "Ki Ka-young, Ki Ka-young,"

297
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,773
before suddenly disappearing
in a burst of dust.

298
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,610
Where have you been?

299
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,488
Far away. [chuckles wryly]

300
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,615
[bones crunch]

301
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,117
- [groans]
- [neck cracks]

302
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,289
I… met up with an old friend
from long ago.

303
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,749
[Iblis chuckles]

304
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,419
You. What are you playing at?

305
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,588
You wouldn't shut up about my wishes,
yet now that I've made one, you vanish.

306
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,466
You're just putting off
your end of the deal!

307
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,926
That's not it.

308
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,095
It's all going according to my plans.

309
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,639
They'll only see the lamp
when their desires peak.

310
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,768
I wonder, how would I know

311
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,187
if something in the world changed
because of their wishes?

312
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,605
That arranged too?

313
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,487
So you're saying there's a quill

314
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,241
that ensures whatever is written
will forever last no matter what changes?

315
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,994
The magic quill's here?
And we had to be here this early?

316
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,912
[Iblis] Yes. It'll be right here.

317
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,081
Truth is, the process is tricky.

318
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,752
I'll be expecting your assistance.

319
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,004
[door opens, closes]

320
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,467
[suspenseful music plays]

321
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,262
That man is the property owner.
He gave you permission to be here?

322
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,557
Permission is not a word
that's in our vocabulary.

323
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,852
So pull it quick when his guard's down.

324
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,771
Then run.

325
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,732
What?

326
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,442
[gasps]

327
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,944
Oh, you son of a…

328
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,988
[laughing]

329
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,698
[Ka-young screaming]

330
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,575
- [man shouting]
- [Ka-young] This is fun!

331
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,827
- [man screaming]
- [Ka-young laughing]

332
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,329
[man] I've got you. [gasping]

333
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,081
[man screaming]

334
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,834
[man whimpers]

335
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,336
[man screams]

336
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,006
[both screaming]

337
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,802
[man panting]

338
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,889
Are you okay?

339
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,265
Yes, I'm all right.

340
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,228
Uh, why were you screaming,
when you have wings?

341
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,438
I haven't flown in a while, that's all.

342
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,607
Your garage doing well?

343
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,192
Suppose you could say that.

344
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,654
I'm sorry, this might sting a little.

345
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,614
[groans]

346
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,742
Oh, come on,
I'm molting enough as it is.

347
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,703
Hey! How many did you pluck off?

348
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,330
[sighing]

349
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,958
[Iblis] It's been a while, brother.

350
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,294
Those thousand years just flew by.

351
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,838
Nice to see you, brother.

352
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,092
So, peace reigned on Earth
during my absence, I guess?

353
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,553
You claimed humans
were only ever corrupted

354
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,429
because I lure them to it. [laughs]

355
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,183
So I have to imagine there were only good
humans in the world when I was imprisoned.

356
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,312
Strange that war, greed, arrogance
and selfishness continued to exist,

357
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,148
even when I was gone.

358
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,025
Consider the power of the seeds
you dutifully planted.

359
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,571
Do you not think that even offering
humans wishes is wrong in itself?

360
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,407
- I'm not sure you do.
- You know like I do.

361
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,452
These half-finished lumps of clay
were a mistake of His.

362
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,164
It is he who has charged me
with proving this,

363
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,791
that Hell is their only recourse.

364
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,794
Don't forget that
He assigned a task to me as well.

365
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,089
Did you not also steal a feather from me
before you were detained?

366
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,674
What plot are you fermenting now?

367
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,551
[laughs] Oh!

368
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,927
You think I'll tell you?

369
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,306
I know that every day of my imprisonment,
no matter what,

370
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,726
you came to visit
the desert where I was buried.

371
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,521
And every day, you added
a handful of sand on top.

372
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,689
Heavy, was it?

373
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,151
You should try experiencing
the weight of life that humans feel.

374
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,696
[laughs] My goodness.
Talk about a true angel.

375
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,075
We do need to catch up properly.

376
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,287
If you'd like.
Though I must advise we do it soon.

377
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,208
Because I'll be coming
for your throat next.

378
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,793
- [gasps jokingly]
- [exhales derisively]

379
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,426
[laughs]

380
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,178
[panting]

381
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,431
What? Where did he go?

382
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,283
[upbeat soul music playing]

383
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,502
- [muffled thudding]
- [gasps]

384
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,047
Hey! Oh, come on! Damn it!

385
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,382
You, you, you, you, you--

386
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,927
My building. You flew right through it.

387
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,845
You crazy? All the units are sold.

388
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,514
They'll start moving in on Monday,

389
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,723
- you ass!
- [laughing]

390
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,809
Do you even know
the market value of this building?

391
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,102
Let's see.

392
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,980
Is it the price of your hypocrisy?

393
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,898
- Why, you little!
- [laughing]

394
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,694
Wow. For a minute,
I forgot your name is literally Satan.

395
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,487
I take it you remember now?

396
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,949
Watch your back, Su-hyeon.

397
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,286
I have returned. Get ready.

398
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:29,997
[laughs]

399
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,958
You, you, you, damn it!

400
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,127
[sighs]

401
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,962
[grunting in frustration]

402
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,646
So this quill will only write the truth?

403
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,489
WRITTEN BY KI KA-YOUNG

404
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,744
A NEGATIVE ONE AND STONE IN A SHOE.

405
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:19,212
THE GENIE HAS GOOD LOOKS.

406
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,757
It works.

407
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,051
THE GENIE HAS LOOKS.

408
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,803
Well, that's harsh but fair.

409
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,436
I AM…

410
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,400
I AM GRANDMA'S BURDEN.

411
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,697
I AM GRANDMA'S STRENGTH.

412
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,536
[pensive music playing]

413
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,375
Ka-young. Try some of these.

414
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,337
Chang-sik gave us a ton of them.

415
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,630
They're very sweet.

416
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,510
- Grandma.
- What?

417
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,722
For so long, I've believed a lie.

418
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,974
I'm not a burden on you,
I'm your strength.

419
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:14,810
Grandma!

420
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,396
Ka-young, you're only realizing that now?

421
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,442
You may've been top of your class,
but clearly you're not so clever. [laughs]

422
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,736
Eat up, so you can be strong too.

423
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,905
[laughs, sighs]

424
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:31,159
Grandma, strawberries contain vitamin C,
not strength.

425
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,789
For strength, you should consume
a primary energy source, like carbs.

426
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,873
Grandma?

427
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,543
[dreamy music playing]

428
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,341
[groaning]

429
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,180
What are you sitting here
daydreaming about?

430
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,932
Gonna do any work?

431
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,935
- Gonna sell these strawberries next year?
- [shouts]

432
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,395
I'm not thinking.

433
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,272
It was one-sided.

434
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,774
It wasn't mutual.

435
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,276
Oh, by the way,

436
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,071
I heard that greeting by rubbing noses
is common in the Middle East.

437
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,950
They do it if they have the utmost respect
for you, like dignitaries.

438
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,619
- What? So, I'm a dignitary?
- Sure.

439
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,371
[chuckles in disbelief]

440
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,414
[groans]

441
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,499
[laughing]

442
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,797
- You are my darling, love!
- Yeah.

443
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,300
Peace has returned
to our very briefly shaken-up family.

444
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,510
[woman] All right. All right. [groans]

445
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,970
- [squealing softly]
- Okay, enough.

446
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,763
What kind of bullshit is all this?

447
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,223
Come on, get back to work.

448
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,434
Didn't you say there's a raffle
for the festival too?

449
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,477
- Enough!
- [gasps, shouts]

450
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,688
I need everyone on their top game

451
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,232
to ensure sales do not drop
during the festival.

452
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,942
Corporate is strict about it.

453
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,236
It's crucial that the displays
are neat and full,

454
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,988
and don't forget to offer more samples.

455
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,281
[staff] Yes, ma'am.

456
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,407
[sighs] Kang Im-seon.

457
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,244
How many times have I told you
to put some effort into your appearance?

458
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,330
Remove that patch too.

459
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,083
Well?

460
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,210
You even listening?

461
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,795
Yes, Assistant Branch Manager Lee.

462
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,219
[groans]

463
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:22,896
[Im-seon] Huh?

464
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,481
What's this?

465
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,151
When did we start selling these?

466
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,488
[blows]

467
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,530
Wow, really?

468
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,865
Come on.

469
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,036
[magical music playing]

470
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,258
[soft boom]

471
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,384
[yelps]

472
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,387
[whimpering]

473
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,474
What the…

474
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,852
You have awoken the spirit of the lamp.

475
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,855
I shall grant you three wishes.

476
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,524
[gasping]

477
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,818
Make them.

478
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,571
No bringing back the dead.

479
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,573
Or travel to the future.

480
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,743
But anything other than that,

481
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,620
your wish…

482
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,456
is my command.

483
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,711
[Im-seon breathing shakily]

484
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,672
[music building]

485
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,592
She made her first wish?

486
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,305
[Iblis] Hmm.

487
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,098
I understand the negative one.

488
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,226
But what's up with the stone thing?

489
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,395
There always something with you.

490
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,479
None of your business.

491
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,774
Tell me, what did Ms. Kang wish for?

492
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,444
[scoffs]

493
00:26:55,739 --> 00:27:00,910
KANG IM-SEON, SUPERMARKET EMPLOYEE

494
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,044
Good morning, all.

495
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,880
My name is Kang Im-seon,
and I'm your manager.

496
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,470
I've been working
at this supermarket for 20 years,

497
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,638
ever since it opened.

498
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,434
[breath trembling] That young bitch
gets to be assistant branch manager

499
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,769
just because she has a degree?

500
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,229
I don't even get good hours.

501
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,106
[gasps]

502
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,318
I wish to be
that lady's superior officer here.

503
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,111
The store manager.

504
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,990
That's my first wish.

505
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,368
[dramatic music playing]

506
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,871
- [indistinct chatter]
- [man] Is she for real?

507
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,665
My goodness, Im-seon. Congratulations.

508
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,293
She's been working so hard.

509
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,252
Well deserved.

510
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,633
Assistant Branch Manager Lee?

511
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,010
You will display
the special frozen goods today.

512
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,387
- What?
- [chuckles dryly]

513
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,764
Well, you were never satisfied
with their layout.

514
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,350
And wear a lighter shade of lipstick.

515
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,603
Tone down the perfume
before you walk around the sample areas.

516
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,231
You have something to say?

517
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,149
[snaps fingers]

518
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,234
You even listening?

519
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,405
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

520
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,324
[Im-seon] Hmm.

521
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,744
Perk up. Let's open the doors.

522
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,870
[staff] Yes, ma'am.

523
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,374
What in the world just happened?

524
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:34,295
I know! How does one lowly restocker
become our boss just like that?

525
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,380
What is going on?

526
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,923
[woman] Who knows?

527
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,634
[Im-seon] Ah.

528
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,052
You're due for an oil change.

529
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,388
Oh, yeah.

530
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,642
Actually, I'm buying a new car.

531
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,477
A foreign one.

532
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,688
So, you don't have to worry.

533
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,737
Are you seeing it now?

534
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,530
How easily you're corrupted?

535
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,700
There's one thing
I definitely didn't think of.

536
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,410
Didn't know I'd lose a client.

537
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,497
Wait. Why are you
showing yourself like this?

538
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,458
She's already seen you as a Genie.

539
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,002
- Shouldn't you be staying out of sight?
- [scoffs]

540
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,213
In their eyes, I am but a tiny dust bunny.

541
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,426
But I do radiate a glow
to appear more magical.

542
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,220
That's it in a nutshell. [chuckles]

543
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,184
Min-ji wears a white robe at her clinic
to seem more like a doctor.

544
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,310
Oh!

545
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,229
If she were to hold a syringe
without the robe on…

546
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,482
Hmm.

547
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,569
That's where you're cutting it off?

548
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,696
Wow. That's cruel.

549
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,702
Hey, so who even is this Min-ji?
I've been dying to know.

550
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,207
[girl 1] Move your head out of the way,
Choi Min-ji.

551
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,793
You're blocking
Lil Miss Psychopath's head.

552
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,716
Hey! Is it true you think
about murdering people and stuff?

553
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,301
Like chopping them up?

554
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,096
I just did.

555
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,557
- You just did?
- [girls laughing]

556
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,226
Oh, that's fucked up. [laughs]

557
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,811
Stop pulling her hair.

558
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,897
She might not admit that it hurts,
but it's still painful.

559
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,857
That's the idea, weirdo. [laughs]

560
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:21,861
That's why we pull her hair.
'Cause it's painful. [chuckles]

561
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,658
[young Ka-young] You do it
even though you know it hurts her?

562
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,453
You know the rules,
and still you go and break 'em?

563
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,913
[suspenseful music plays]

564
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,456
[girls chuckling]

565
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,125
[girl 1] Fuck, this is boring.

566
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,837
Let's just finish this cigarette
and get out of here.

567
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,050
[watch ticking]

568
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,554
[stall door opens]

569
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,559
Ugh, what's that smell?
Is that gasoline?

570
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,352
Ugh, that gas stench.

571
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,729
This weirdo again.
What the fuck are you doing?

572
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,022
Setting the place on fire.

573
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,900
You were smoking,
so clearly you guys started it.

574
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,361
Ah, do we look like dipshits,
you psycho bitch?

575
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,488
- You see all these witnesses?
- [girls screaming]

576
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,948
- Shit!
- [girl 2] Fuck.

577
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:07,949
And now?

578
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,743
Shall I eliminate the witnesses, then?

579
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,912
- [lighter clicks]
- [girl 1] Okay, okay, we get it.

580
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,956
All right.
Okay, we'll do whatever you want.

581
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,541
Don't mess with Choi Min-ji.

582
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,543
This is our new rule.

583
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,420
[breathing heavily] All right.

584
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,047
[lighter snaps shut]

585
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,178
Be my friend.
Neither of us have any other friend.

586
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,224
It's more efficient to be a duo
than alone in South Korea.

587
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,102
And what if I don't
wanna be friends with you?

588
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,604
You have no other option.

589
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,439
So, we are friends from now on.

590
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,401
Also, you're terrible at school.

591
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,112
Memorize all of this.
I'll murder you if you don't.

592
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,739
MATH I

593
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,949
Complete these.
I'll murder you if you don't.

594
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,117
[sighs]

595
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,122
Make sure you pass the oral exam.
I'll murder you if you don't.

596
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,832
Honestly, it's a helpful motivator.

597
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,084
There's no other option.

598
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,128
Pass, Choi Min-ji!

599
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,592
How funny.
It says, "Weirdos especially welcome."

600
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,677
- How absurd.
- So strange.

601
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:14,057
My experience has taught me
that weirdos can change the world.

602
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,018
[woman] One of the people
chosen for Ms. Ki Ka-young's first wish

603
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,853
has in turn made their first wish.

604
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,898
Cheongpung has altered
from the reality of yesterday.

605
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,733
[squeals] Well done, Master.

606
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,779
As long as we steer
Ms. Ki's remaining wishes to plan,

607
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,990
you will be on track to do
what you have so long prepared for.

608
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,784
Slitting that evil Iblis's throat.

609
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,411
That's why they wanted my feather.
A record.

610
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,455
Hmm.

611
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,833
But you know, I've been studying
psychopaths for 20 years.

612
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,420
I thought Ki Ka-young
would never make any wish.

613
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,923
Still, I'm glad for this stroke of luck.

614
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,383
But something feels off.

615
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,929
Psychopaths are tricky.
I might need to read up on her kind again.

616
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,056
Back to business.

617
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,558
- What's Iblis doing?
- Gaming and chugging beer.

618
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,729
- He'll come when he's low on funds.
- Yes.

619
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,816
- He's mooching off Sade for now.
- Why, that…

620
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,652
And someone has been trolling
our website since yesterday.

621
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,989
Looking at the content and typos,
it seems quite clear…

622
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,949
the culprit is Iblis.

623
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,410
That son of a…

624
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,954
[grunting]

625
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,794
[grunting and groaning]

626
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,045
Oh.

627
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,798
Oh, no. No, no, no.

628
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,009
Come on. No.

629
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,719
[objects rattling]

630
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,722
Hang on, Sang-hyeok did this
and found money.

631
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,519
[game announcer] Game over!

632
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,067
Hey, human.

633
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,322
Who? Me?

634
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,120
What do you want?

635
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,873
Pick that up. The Earth is in pain.

636
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,667
Even Ka-young doesn't litter.
What makes you feel you can?

637
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,586
- [chuckles]
- In pain?

638
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,797
Ah, the poor Earth.

639
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,091
Ah, what a truly generous person you are.

640
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,807
[exhales loudly]

641
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,351
I think I'll toss this one too.
That make you mad?

642
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,561
What're you gonna do?

643
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,645
Wow.

644
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,898
Just my kind of guy.

645
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,441
[exhales loudly]

646
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,277
We'd be friends on any other day.

647
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,112
Today is the exception.

648
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,156
Sade!

649
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,742
[whooshing]

650
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,412
- [man gasps]
- Yes, Master.

651
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,456
What kind of magic trick is this?

652
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,208
How'd you run so fast?

653
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,709
Deal with that lump of clay.

654
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,878
And give me any change you've got.

655
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,048
[coins jingling]

656
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,550
[man] Not gonna lie,
that was smooth.

657
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,595
Stop staring at me
or I'll take your eyes out.

658
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,014
[man scoffs]

659
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,017
[tense music playing]

660
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,352
Go for it. Come on.

661
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,688
But I'm warning you. Touch me
and I'll sue your pathetic ass. Got it?

662
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,066
[grunts]

663
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,193
- [growls]
- [man screams]

664
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,278
No!

665
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,240
[crying and whimpering]

666
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,992
- Get away! Help!
- [growling]

667
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:20,952
[roars]

668
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,163
[Sade growling]

669
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,374
[owl hoots]

670
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,458
[woman] Nice going.

671
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,918
[Sade] Irem!

672
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,044
[Irem hoots]

673
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,214
[Sade] Has it been, what, 100 years?

674
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,093
Oh, excuse me.
Have you seen a lady who looks like this?

675
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,762
- [chuckles softly]
- [Irem hooting]

676
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,932
Oh? [chuckles]

677
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,768
- [Irem hoots]
- Irem!

678
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:50,606
Have you been here
the whole time, since then?

679
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,526
[Irem] Yes.
Ejllael decided to settle here.

680
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,653
There were a lot of deaths back then.

681
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,238
[wings fluttering]

682
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,490
[Jong-heon] They said it was black,
so keep an eye out.

683
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,867
[Chang-sik] Right, right. Black.

684
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,035
[Min-jae] Wait, why are we
searching at night, then?

685
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,583
Goddammit! What's that? Who's there?

686
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,419
That's Ms. Irem, Director Ryu's assistant.
And Mr. Seo I-deuk!

687
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,671
Now's not the time
for a secret nighttime date.

688
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:17,300
A cougar or a panther has broken loose
and everyone's on high alert.

689
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,677
Oh, isn't it a jaguar? I heard jaguar--

690
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,262
- Mm?
- A jaguar?

691
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,599
Look, whatever it is, it's hiding out
here. So let's all go back down right now.

692
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,726
- It's too dangerous to stay.
- Yeah, sure. Good work.

693
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,603
Hurry. Let's go. Let's go.

694
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,021
- [Irem chuckles]
- Come on.

695
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,440
Hold on.

696
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,150
[suspenseful music plays]

697
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,443
That tail…

698
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,487
And those ears…

699
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,073
[Sade sighs]

700
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,951
Irem and I went to the zoo.

701
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,244
They were in the gift shop.

702
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,787
Pretty cute, don't you think?

703
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,998
- [laughter]
- Is that so?

704
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,541
They look so real. Okay, go home.

705
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,126
- Get going. Hurry up.
- [chuckles]

706
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,419
[heavy footsteps]

707
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,087
[mice squeaking]

708
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,715
- [Sade] So, are you ready…
- [yelps]

709
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,343
…to fess up what you know about her?

710
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,094
[brown mouse squeaking]

711
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,847
- [chuckles]
- [brown mouse yelps]

712
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,767
Don't let this Jaguar lose face. [growls]

713
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,684
I'm hungry.

714
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,853
[white mouse squeaking]

715
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,148
Then…

716
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,234
tell me what you saw last night.

717
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,110
You can leave. Go on.

718
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,279
[squeaking nervously]

719
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,614
[chuckles menacingly]

720
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,283
Still wanna die honorably?

721
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,453
- [squeaking nervously]
- [Sade hisses, growls playfully]

722
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,163
[gulping]

723
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,041
So I did some digging
like you ordered me to.

724
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:36,003
The garage is actually her side hustle.
She has another job.

725
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:36,963
[keyboard clacks]

726
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,632
[Ka-young sighs]

727
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,008
Elon Musk.

728
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,635
Does he deserve to live?

729
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,136
[slams]

730
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,222
[upbeat music playing]

731
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,145
[groans]

732
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,315
She must've amassed a lot of money.
Didn't care about her pen.

733
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,194
And now, here comes the really big news.

734
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,570
[Iblis] Hmm.

735
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,407
Hey, why are you closed every day
with a four in it?

736
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,118
Some superstition
around the number, Ms. Ki?

737
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,246
Four signals death.

738
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,249
Mm? Forces of death?

739
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,710
Uh, no, that's not what I meant.

740
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,670
Even in rain or snow, she makes sure

741
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,922
- she sticks to her routine.
- Hmm.

742
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,841
On the 4th, it's scuba diving.

743
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,010
The 14th, it's hiking.
The 24th, woodworking.

744
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,720
- And Wednesdays--
- Gamja-tang!

745
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,430
Ah, you got it.

746
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,931
[gasps]

747
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,768
So that's what it's all for.

748
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,937
[somber music plays]

749
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,327
Making it seem as much
like an accident as possible.

750
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,747
An equipment malfunction in the deep sea.

751
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,541
[breathing heavily]

752
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,877
Or stumble off a cliff while climbing.

753
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,003
Whoa.

754
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,048
[sighs]

755
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,924
[machine whirring]

756
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,765
[Iblis] This entire routine

757
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,477
is Ki Ka-young's way
of preparing for her death.

758
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:19,690
The human body is 70% water
and blood is the heaviest part.

759
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,402
So thinking about it,
if you drain the body…

760
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,075
then cut here, and here, here, and here…

761
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,038
If you chop there, then stack the pieces,
then your coffin…

762
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,209
would just need to be that size.

763
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,003
Ms. Ki Ka-young.
I will be moving abroad soon.

764
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,631
Business that bad?

765
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,850
So she just bought the place.

766
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,728
[sighs]

767
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,149
Wow.

768
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,734
A coffin too?

769
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,611
[Iblis sighs]

770
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,322
Once her grandmother passes,
she's doing it.

771
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,909
And if she dies too early,
can't get revenge if she's already dead.

772
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,411
Yes, we must prevent that.

773
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,996
I have an idea.

774
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:21,043
Oh Pan-geum must live as long as she can.

775
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,007
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, my back. [sighs]

776
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,217
Good Lord.

777
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,138
What the hell's the point in being so old?

778
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,556
- No!
- What the--?

779
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,598
What hurts?

780
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,977
- Which part of your back? Face down.
- My God!

781
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,229
- Here? Or here? How about here?
- Oh, my goodness.

782
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,522
- What is happening?
- This part?

783
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,649
How's that? Much better?
Don't you feel young again?

784
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,362
[groaning]

785
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:52,491
I'm wasting time crushing all this garlic,
might as well give up.

786
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,493
- At my age…
- [Iblis] No!

787
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,744
The garlic, hand it over.

788
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,247
Do I grind it? Give it here.

789
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,583
[crushing and grinding rapidly]

790
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,963
So, you must really like Ka-young
if you moved from Dubai

791
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,007
just to be with her, wouldn't you say?

792
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,342
Well, I just knew the minute I saw her.

793
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,803
Ki Ka-young was just the girl
I was waiting for.

794
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,762
Oh, my.

795
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,266
You knew just like that? Immediately?

796
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,810
Well, at first,
Ka-young didn't believe it at all.

797
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,356
So I took her to the top of a skyscraper.

798
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,736
You mean that big one where you can see
for miles and miles under the stars?

799
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,281
So, what did the two of you get up to
all the way up there?

800
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,367
[inhales] That's not really suitable
for your ears.

801
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,786
But I'll tell you this.

802
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,748
Ki Ka-young is different
from all the women I've ever met.

803
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,291
She drives me crazy.

804
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,709
So I just grabbed her neck and--

805
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,712
God! Stop that right now.
I can't listen to this.

806
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,172
[Iblis chuckles]

807
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:52,384
The important thing is,
the stars aligned for you, and pow!

808
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,636
You two fell hard, huh?

809
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,762
"Pow"?

810
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,140
That wasn't quite the sound. Hmm.

811
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,725
More of a loud thud.

812
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,726
[chuckles]

813
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,019
It makes me cry still.

814
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,022
[crushing garlic]

815
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,607
What are your four pillars?

816
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,858
Uh, "four pillars"?

817
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:12,112
Oh, the day you were born.
Do you know the time as well?

818
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,074
Well, let's see.

819
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,451
I was born on Thursday.

820
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,706
13.8 billion years… ago.

821
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,708
[amusing music plays]

822
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,381
[smacks lips] I got a baby face.

823
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,512
Oh, my, the field.

824
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,431
I really should pull
those invasive weeds out.

825
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,101
[amusing music plays]

826
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,936
[grunting]

827
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,275
[sickle whizzing]

828
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,360
[continues grunting]

829
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,115
[pants]

830
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,454
Well, Pan-geum gets a long life while
Master's life is shortened drastically.

831
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,290
- [panting]
- Here, I brought you a snack.

832
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:07,084
There's something else I need to tell you.

833
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:11,630
My employer asked
if she and I met in the past too.

834
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,424
[panting]

835
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,260
Meaning what?

836
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,555
Of course. We met yesterday,
so we have met in the past.

837
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,432
No, no. I mean in a previous life.

838
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,516
[gasps]

839
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,145
- Do you recall that time now?
- No.

840
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,939
Your Genie friend said
we met 983 years ago,

841
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,649
so did you and I meet too?

842
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,276
Well, actually, we did.

843
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,069
But why is it so important to you?

844
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,447
I just wanna know
what happened back then.

845
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,159
All those years ago.

846
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,078
How did I die then?

847
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,204
[sighs]

848
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,041
She doesn't care about that life.

849
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,876
She only cares about her death.

850
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,337
I was imprisoned.

851
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:56,050
[choking up]
983 years, thinking only of…

852
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,968
[Iblis sniffles]

853
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,928
Thinking of what?

854
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,055
[Iblis sighs]

855
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,390
Whether or not, at death's door,

856
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,518
that mortal regretted
sacrificing her wishes for others.

857
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,063
Why am I always
reclining in this position?

858
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,731
It's so uncomfortable.

859
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,192
Why do I only have one piece of furniture?

860
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:17,154
Hundreds of years spent thinking,
obsessed with three questions.

861
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,031
And even still--

862
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:23,077
Whatever you say next,
make sure to choose your words carefully.

863
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,246
It's still a giant mystery to me.

864
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,707
Uh, okay. Damn it.

865
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,626
Not the intelligent type.

866
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,002
Don't you dare mention

867
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,713
that her three wishes
were nobly spent on others, okay?

868
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:38,801
Or about her being virtuous
in every life since and, well, everything…

869
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:39,843
Never, yeah?

870
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,637
Do not ever let the mortal know.

871
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,514
[Sade] I wouldn't dare tell her any of it.

872
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,975
But did you know Master's master
is standing just outside?

873
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,186
[gasps]

874
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,481
So… So, how much did you hear?

875
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,776
Not the observant type either.

876
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,363
[Iblis] Wait.

877
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,073
Why'd you close the door?

878
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,118
What are you dressed up for?

879
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,412
Hey, Ki Ka-young.
Where are you going?

880
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,163
- [car door closes]
- Ki Ka-young!

881
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,581
[Newton's cradle ticking]

882
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,166
YOO PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC

883
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,087
Ms. Ki Ka-young, right this way.

[romantic classical music plays]

885
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,727
[Iblis gags and groans]

886
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,609
Why do I have to carry all these?
I think I'm getting sick.

887
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,652
And I'm dizzy.

888
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:39,903
I've got heels on.

889
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,868
I need a better reason than just that.

890
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:49,997
What are we doing here?

891
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,584
Normal people go out for dinner
at places like this

892
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,335
and take photos and such.

893
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,929
[chair scrapes]

894
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,764
Right this way.

895
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,478
[Iblis grunts]

896
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,230
Hmm?

897
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,905
Hmm? [pants]

898
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,408
[exhales]

899
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,327
[chuckles softly]

900
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,289
Mm!

901
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,001
Mm!

902
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,378
Mm.

903
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,925
So, the doctor's office you were at,
is that where you get your pills from?

904
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,927
Do they help you a lot?

905
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,553
Is that what you think?

906
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,181
The pills are
for my grandma's peace of mind.

907
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,141
A few are vitamins.

908
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,524
Why? Are you hoping
there's some cure out there?

909
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,276
Do you spend every day
wishing that you could kill me?

910
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:03,820
'Cause you're Satan?

911

- [cutlery clatters]
- [clears throat]

912
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,825
That's not what I said.

913
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,286
So, what, then?

914
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,998
So you're abnormal,
where do you actually want to be?

915

[romantic classical music playing]

916
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,777
You're not gonna push me off this time?

917
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,325
[romantic classical music continues]

918
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,091
There are no cameras
this high up, are there?

919
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:08,802
Not sure.

920
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,976
I could still push you off, you know.

921
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:20,439
I'll never understand
why you're always so angry.

922
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,149
Right now, you know why.

923
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,739
Even so, it's nice to know there's a place
where you can feel at peace.

924
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,491
This is one nice perk
about being your master.

925
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,287
It's dark here,
so you might not have noticed.

926
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,164
I have no emotions.

927
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,292
But as much as I can, I like you.

928
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:46,798
Uh…

929
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,093
Stop being… so forward.

930
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,183
Why?

931
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:58,518
Why do you like me?

932
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,270
You're…

933
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,315
like the cars I work on.

934
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,818
The combustion engines,
the brake fluid, the tires.

935
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,196
I don't need to make sense of you.

936
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,156
You're sturdy.

937
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,201
- And sometimes you shine.
- [chuckles]

938
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,578
Out of everything I valued in life,

939
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,873
- Grandma, Min-ji, the garage…
- Hmm.

…my car, gamja-tang, the frogs…

941

- The frogs?
- …dental drilling…

942
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,798
I'd like to point out
I'm still not on the list.

943
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,675
You're not making a very good case.

944
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,844
[scoffs] All right.

945
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,597
I'll try to rise up in the ranks.

946
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:41,061
My dear master, tonight, we shall bask
in the darkest of midnights.

[thudding subsides]

951
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:12,175
Now we can finally see the stars.

[gasps]

953
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,409
What?

954
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:39,953
Do it.

955
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,457
Do what?

956
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,710
[Min-ji] When a man talks to you
about seeing the stars or whatever,

957
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,587
then the moment is coming.

958
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,213
It's coming.

959
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,257
The kiss.

960
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,928
I'll admit, I've thought about it.

961
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,388
[scoffs]

962
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,681
Whoa, easy now.

963
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,017
What do you take me for? [laughs]

964
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,437
I'm not kissing you.

965
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,564
That's not fair. Why not?

966
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,940
You brought the stars!

967
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:13,862
Okay, then.

968
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,447
Don't move.

969
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,699
I'll do it.

970
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,076

971
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,997
- [swallows]
- Weird.

972
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,832
Is this usual?

973
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,042
No, it's just, uh--

974
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,294
I said don't move. Let me try again.

975
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,432
Yeah, no, it's just weird.

[stumbles]

977
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,895
Why even do this at all?

[chuckling in disbelief]

979
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,325
Wow.

980
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,205
I really didn't want to do this.

981
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,253
You're wrong.

982
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,963
It's different when I do it.
