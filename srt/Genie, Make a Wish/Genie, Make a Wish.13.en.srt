- Just these two to start. Two wishes.

363
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,210
[chiming]

364
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,838
Both fulfilled, Choi Min-ji.

365
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,465
Oh. Call me "Master." [chuckles]

366
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,802
KING ARCADE

367
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,516
SMILE DENTAL CLINIC

368
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,476
ODD TEETH AND ODD PEOPLE WELCOME

369
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,686
Huh?

370
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,066
Wait, isn't this an arcade?

371
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,734
Yes, the best arcade.

372
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,654
Shall we go fight off tooth bacteria,
you and me?

373
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,241
By the way, I heard your grades are poor.

374
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:11,578
- What?
- Solve these math problems beforehand.

375
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,875
If you don't finish them,
then no anesthesia.

376
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,630
[Ka-young] <i>You'll probably hear what</i>
<i>I'm saying as if I'm speaking Korean.</i>

377
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,756
[wind blowing]

378
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,136
<i>That is because I am a jinniya</i>
<i>who does not speak any foreign languages.</i>

379
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,347
<i>So from now on,</i>
<i>just listen to a lot of K-pop</i>

380
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,308
<i>and binge-watch a bunch of K-dramas.</i>

381
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,393
[upbeat music plays]

382
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,401
[Ka-young] <i>There's a new jinniya in town,</i>
<i>and she doesn't speak Arabic.</i>

383
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,319
Hmm.

384
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:49,824
[Da-jin] We are back at the Cheongpungho
Cherry Blossom Festival!

385
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,036
These are a town favorite.
Five-grain crackers! Ah.

386
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,747
- Let's go to the next booth.
- Yeah.

387
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,125
Over here,
we have For Daughter Strawberry!

388
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,044
- [Da-jin] Strawberries!
- [chuckles]

389
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,465
Here's your popcorn.
Would you like a drink?

390
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,633
[indistinct chatter]

391
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,929
Hello, we are Cheongpungho Bank.
Come for a free consultation.

392
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,808
Ki Ka-young.

393
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,977
Here you are. Huh.

394
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,648
Seriously, every time I see you here,
my heart races.

395
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,275
You sure you won't be spotted back here?

396
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,987
Everyone sees a different face on me.

397
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,365
It is a shame, to be honest.

398
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,576
I'm so pretty.

399
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:39,791
[sighs] Despite everything
I've learned, I still vote for science.

400
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,378
Hey, come over here.

401
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,055
Thought you'd be off the hook this year?
Don't be naive, my friend.

402
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,226
Three, two, one.

403
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,270
[fireworks bursting]

404
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,985
AS SEXY
FUCK YOU

405
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,070
[gentle music plays]

406
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,154
[gasps softly]

407
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,451
KI KA-YOUNG
YOU'RE IN MY HEART

408
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,787
Wasn't cheap, but worth every cent.

409
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,927
[Min-ji sighs softly]

410
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,265
[sniffles]

411
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,478
[Min-ji] I had spent
a lot of time thinking

412
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,772
about what I would do if you died.

413
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,693
But I was wholly unprepared for what to do

414
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,945
if you cried.

415
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,448
So I thought about it for a few days.

416
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:55,908
What, then?

417
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:01,581
You see, whoever you are,
a jinniya or Ka-young,

418
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,416
whatever.

419
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,003
I just want this new life
to make you happy forever.

420
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,341
So, don't cry

421
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,385
and don't die.

422
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,224
I want you to reunite
with the one you miss the most.

423
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,812
That is my third wish.

424
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,690
Wait, no. You'll forget me.
You can't do it yet!

425
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,739
Oh. Why am I not glowing?

426
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,407
What's happening?

427
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,119
Oh, does that mean this wish
has been fulfilled already?

428
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,038
Ah, yes.

429
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,664
Of course, I've met you again.

430
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,374
Ah, that was scary.

431
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,754
[exhales] Here's the thing,
the moment the wishes have been--

432
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,673
[Min-ji] I'll come back soon. Be well.

433
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:54,926
Ki Ka-young.

434
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,053
[bouquet rustling]

435
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,725
- [Min-ji] Oh.
- [chiming]

436
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:07,939
Excuse me.

437
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,624
[soft ballad music plays]

438
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,793
[sighs softly]

439
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,651
[light chiming]

440
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,920
Grandma?

441
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,843
Grandma, you here?

442
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:01,928
[light chiming]

443
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,558
Grandma, wait!

444
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,528
Come visit again.

445
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,281
Come next year too.

446
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,326
Please come every year!

447
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,295
So, this here is a painting

448
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,340
that belonged to my forefathers
six generations ago.

449
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,591
The style is very unique.

450
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,677
[on TV] <i>I wanted to get it</i>
<i>properly authenticated</i>

451
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,929
<i>and see if it's indeed</i>
<i>a Joseon dynasty artifact.</i>

452
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,681
<i>Yes, this is technically speaking</i>

453
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,683
<i>a portrait of an unknown</i>
<i>but beautiful woman.</i>

454
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,560
<i>However, most portraits of women</i>
<i>from this time have an eastern flair,</i>

455
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,063
<i>or as this one appears to be done</i>
<i>in the Egyptian style.</i>

456
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:59,402
So many things have happened,
but I'm still just the assistant manager.

457
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,863
I want a rival company to poach me.

458
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,116
This is my final wish.

459
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,369
Give me a key trade secret,
something the supermarket keeps hidden.

460
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,579
Simple.

461
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,209
- [inhales, sighs]
- [chiming]

462
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,381
Listen closely.

463
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,425
[inhales excitedly]

464
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,011
I'm going to tell you
an important trade secret.

465
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,638
[mysterious music plays]

466
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,729
Display the Jin Ramen
at the front of the store.

467
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,605
[mysterious music distorts, stops]

468
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,785
[sighs]

469
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,705
You must have felt lonely as well.

470
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,666
People would always forget you.

471
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,337
Leaving you all on your own.

472
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,674
It's raining.

473
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,843
A rain full of petals.

474
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,015
- [can crinkles]
- This here is the time for it.

475
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,395
[sighs deeply]

476
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,275
[gentle music plays]

477
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,025
- [music turns upbeat]
- [Ka-young gasps]

478
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,195
[shrieks excitedly]

479
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,073
[shrieks excitedly]

480
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,377
Hey, lump of clay.

481
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,214
I sure missed you.

482
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,342
How are you even here?

483
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,344
Min-ji's wish.

484
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,930
You can't bring back the dead, though.

485
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,767
I have no idea. Let's just enjoy it.

486
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,647
[groans] Seriously, just go!

487
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,733
Why'd you come all the way here
just to mess with the system?

488
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,110
- You brat!
- [gasps]

489
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,946
How dare you raise your voice! Huh?

490
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,782
I have literally nothing
to be afraid of now,

491
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,784
not even if you said
I'd die a second time.

492
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,703
And I'm not scared of hell either.

493
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,247
- [Ejllael scoffs]
- You have nothing to threaten me with.

494
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,875
All I want is for you and I

495
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,377
to have a word with the big man upstairs.

496
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,464
Human lunatic!
You can't march up to Him like that!

497
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,842
Come on! You're guaranteed
a spot in heaven already!

498
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,844
Why are you here instead of going there?

499
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,137
Heaven?

500
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,891
- I don't give a damn about that.
- Huh?

501
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,810
What use is heaven to me
now that Ka-young is a Satan?

502
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,897
And you. You revealed to me
the day I would die.

503
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,192
Is that even allowed?
You were awfully cryptic about it too.

504
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,444
I barely managed to figure it out.

505
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,738
I only got it because I'm so clever.

506
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,408
So, you owe me, wouldn't you agree?

507
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,243
You said you're an angel.

508
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,747
After all the havoc you've caused,
it's the least you could do! Right?

509
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,209
[yells in frustration, grunts]

510
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,461
What do you even want?

511
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,632
Yes, sir. I know she's still at it.

512
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,091
[thunder rumbling]

513
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,052
What's that? Oh, well, but--

514
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,930
[sighs] Even so!

515
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,808
- Despite that--
- [thunder crashing, rumbling]

516
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,144
Yes, I understand.

517
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,689
So, then.

518
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,817
To Goryeo? With all my might?

519
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,194
[chimes]

520
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,446
[whooshing]

[whimsical music plays]

523
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,415
[music ends]

524
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,418
So once again you're clueless, right?

525
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,963
You're being like this
the second you see me?

526
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:33,676
Whatever. I won the title
of "Most Famous Genie" anyway.

527
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,719
I never agreed to that. No way!

528
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,224
- I'd rather die than let you have that.
- Why not? Let me have it!

529
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,811
Look what else I can do.

530
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,148
- [bones crack]
- [gasps]

531
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,734
- [bones crack]
- [Iblis gasps]

532
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,278
[Iblis] Oh.

533
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,531
- Ha!
- [exclaims nervously]

[comical music plays]

535
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,789
[sighs] You're just the same as always.

536
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,585
Creepy as hell.

537
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,420
[chuckles]

538
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,462
And really cute.

539
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,466
[chuckles softly]

540
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:19,638
[chuckles]

541
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,937
Oh, can you hurry up?
We need to get seats right at the front!

542
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,691
Why are we even here this early?

543
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,445
Harvesting cabbage is a great gig.
It pays well and they feed you too.

544
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,698
These jobs are hard to get
in the current unemployment crisis.

545
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,366
See, there's already three people here.

546
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,160
- Mr. Kim, you're here. Hi.
- Oh. Hi.

547
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,080
Hurry up and sit down.
I hope they take at least four.

548
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,832
- Have you eaten?
- Oh, of course.

549
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,543
My goodness, aren't you
a strapping young man.

550
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,838
Pretty hard time out there, huh?
You're even talking to yourself.

551
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,675
Wait, am I only able to see you?

552
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,971
That's… that's really,
really difficult to do.

553
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,557
It took me over 10,000 years.

554
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,226
The typical, slow to learn type.

555
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:08,812
Shit.

556
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,773
Can't have that.

557
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,150
Change your clothes.
They could choose up to five people.

558
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,151
Why should I?

559
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,362
So you can work. Come on.

560
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,072
Don't you know? Genies don't have money.

561
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,949
Says who? You think I don't?

562
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,078
What? You have money?

563
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:27,956
[Ka-young grunts]

564
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:29,792
[Ka-young exhales]

565
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,004
- Told ya.
- [gasps excitedly]

566
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,465
Whoa! Wow!

567
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,343
Whoo!

568
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,554
- Please give me some!
- My money!

569
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,266
As if you even deserve any of it.

570
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,853
You go play video games
and stuff like that.

571
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,855
The only thing you can use this on
is a haircut.

572
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,732
It's for a good cause.

573
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,984
I want to try making Sade again.

574
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,113
This time, I'm using masks and pomades.

575
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:02,908
I want it to be extra healthy.
That way he might have a nicer face.

576
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,452
Ah, yes, that's right.

577
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,162
I can get on board with the long hair.

578
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,040
Why did you make him
from hair you'd cried on?

579
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:14,128
Well, the first Sade died protecting me
in our great war.

580
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,799
After the war ended, I included a drop
of my sadness and made a new one.

581
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,218
The beast you saw was the second one.

582
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,221
Mmm. I should have known.
He was pretty damp.

583
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,517
I intend to make him dry this time around.

584
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,978
- [chuckles]
- [chiming]

585
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,896
Mmm. Duty calls.

586
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,275
[grunts, laughs]

587
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,403
[sighs]

588
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,488
[peppy music playing over speakers]

589
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,953
Mmm… Hmm.

590
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,414
Ooh.

591
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,376
Oh. [gasps loudly]

592
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,964
- Who are you?
- [mysterious music plays]

593
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,257
What's with your hair?

594
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,094
My hair is on its own journey.
Sorry if I startled you.

595
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,471
I have a message for you.

596
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:11,018
I am a Genie, a spirit of the lamp.
I shall grant you three wishes.

597
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,188
Okay. I'm talking to a genie.

598
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,982
Nice try, buddy. I know this is a con.

599
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:20,527
[chuckles] That's a common reaction.
This manual will clarify.

600
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,655
First page wishes I can do,
last page wishes I can't.

601
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,034
[clears throat]

602
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,535
WISH-MAKER'S MANUAL

603
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,370
Now, think carefully on the details.

604
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,705
Immortality? [clicks tongue]

605
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,582
Instant regret.
Watched three vampire movies.

606
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,958
Change the past? [clicks tongue]

607
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,169
A butterfly effect
that could destroy everything.

608
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,880
Just pass on that one.

609
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:43,759
Now, if you have the means,
would you buy me one of these coffees,

610
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:44,968
as I cannot? [clicks tongue]

611
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,138
[laughs]

612
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,516
So you say you're a genie?

613
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,392
- You can grant wishes?
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,978
So why are you here begging me for a wish?

615
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,276
Well, didn't you ever have faith
in a higher power?

616
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,404
A pure soul, manifesting divinity,
all that? [chuckles]

617
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,573
Ah, you believe in ancestral deities?

618
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,326
[gasps, chuckles]

619
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,620
- Ah, now I'm in a good mood.
- [chuckling]

620
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:12,788
[amusing music plays]

621
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:16,333
We have a higher power too.
Diamond levels have high status.

622
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,795
"Germanium jade mats"?
Right, what kind of carpet is that?

623
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:23,382
To put it simply,
it generates heat all on its own.

624
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,759
[snaps fingers] Just like magic. [laughs]

625
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,010
Oh.

626
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,887
You start off with ten.
And then after that,

627
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,390
once they've been sold,
you get another one completely free.

628
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:32,849
- Free?
- Mmm.

629
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,810
- Uh… I can get one for free?
- Yes.

630
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:38,647
And that is why we never ask our clients
for money upfront, unlike others.

631
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,857
This deal is once in a lifetime.

632
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,902
- So no money upfront ever?
- Mmm-hmm.

633
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,780
I'll stop working in the cabbage fields,
in that case.

634
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,742
Oh. No, I can pick cabbage
and sell carpets too.

635
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,660
[gasps]

636
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:56,248
Okay, Mr. Kim, Mr. Choi, Mr. Park.
Sang-hyeok when he's grown.

637
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,375
Ejllael…

638
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,587
- Hmm, he won't buy one from me.
- Excuse me? If you could sign here.

639
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,422
Min-ji! [sighs]

640
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,674
- Has forgotten who I am.
- [snaps fingers]

641
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,134
Oh Pan-geum!

642
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,052
Has… Oh.

643
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,388
[sighs] Never mind.

644
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,474
This is such a great product,
but I can't sell it.

645
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,603
No matter what, I'm always short.

646
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,271
Irem is smoke again, Sade is gone.

647
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,940
I miss Grandma Pan-geum.

648
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,026
[amusing music plays]

649
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,819
Are you well?

650
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,864
You're keeping an eye on us, right?

651
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,366
We're doing well, I swear.

652
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,036
Uh, I don't think
you're the right fit.

653
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,621
- [chuckles hesitantly]
- [whimpers]

654
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,497
Let's just forget
the whole thing, all right?

655
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,790
[Iblis whimpers]

656
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,295
Where are you going? You haven't wished
for anything yet. Wait!

657
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,299
Make your wish.
No bringing back the dead.

658
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,468
No traveling to the future.

659
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,845
Otherwise, anything you want,

660
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:55,724
your wish is my command.

661
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,979
You're headed straight for the road!
Why do you always run that way?

662
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,606
[music fades]

663
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,317
[scissors snipping]

664
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,201
Hey.

665
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,246
Did you use a whole bottle of conditioner?

666
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:22,751
Well, I had to do it to recreate Sade.
[chuckles nervously]

667
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,213
I'm going to kill you! [panting]

668
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,925
- Come here!
- You come.

669
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,635
- Get over here!
- [grunts, pants]

670
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,303
- [Ka-young] Come here!
- I don't wanna!

671
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,514
- [Ka-young] Get back here!
- I said, I don't wanna!

672
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,391
[Ka-young] Don't steal my things!

673
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,142
[Iblis in mocking tone] Don't be a child!

674
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,813
- Get over here! I said, get over here!
- [laughing] No.

675
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,440
Oh. Oh, look it's back!

676
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,112
Look. Look what else is here.

677
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,409
You used up an entire bottle
of conditioner

678
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,910
and he looks exactly the same?

679
00:49:56,993 --> 00:50:00,163
I used to feel ashamed.
I thought his face was because of my hair.

680
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,332
I gotta say, I'm kind of relieved.

681
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,294
Hi, Master. Miss Ki.

682
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,297
[wailing]

683
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,469
I missed you!

684
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,394
- Not again! Ow, let me go!
- [Sade growling]

685
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,604
- Let go! [yells]
- [Sade snarling]

686
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,232
Hey! You want to get stabbed again?

687
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:31,737
- I'm busy trying to grow back my wings!
- [muffled] You're evil, Ejllael!

688
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,322
Bring Irem back! [growling]

689
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,659
- Aah! Let go! Come on, please!
- [growling]

690
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,619
Ugh, get off!

691
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,996
[bubbling]

692
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,919
[magical music plays]

693
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,256
[coughing]

694
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,760
It's been a minute, brother.

695
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,136
[Ejllael coughing]

696
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,889
I suppose you got your head back on?

697
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,974
Oh, yes, thank you for the well wishes.

698
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,893
And thanks for throwing the lamp
this way too.

699
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,728
But why haven't you gone home yet?

700
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,813
You are aware of how many buildings I own.

701
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,316
Land is meant to be
a long-term investment.

702
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,778
Oh, and know what else?
Ki Ka-young still hasn't bowed either.

703
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,864
Where did you hear that? She bows
before her grandma's grave every day.

704
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,824
Dead humans don't count!

705
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,787
[scoffs] I'm still traumatized
by Pan-geum's bellowing.

706
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,872
Threats?

707
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,291
I'm so sick of her kind.
They're so unpredictable.

708
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,585
She refused heaven and reincarnation.

709
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,254
For days on end, she shouted for Him
to bring you back!

710
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,715
Ugh, I feel like such a loser now.

711
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,425
[chuckles softly]

712
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,011
Wow.

713
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,224
So I was brought back because of her.

714
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:46,478
The point is, Oh Pan-geum asked
that I relay this, to you and Ki Ka-young.

715
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,396
I'm all ears.

716
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,025
[Irem hoots] Sade!

717
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,654
Jinniya! Iblis!

718
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,989
Mr. Village Chief!

719
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,618
GERMANIUM JADE MAT

720
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,876
- [gasps, sighs]
- What's that?

721
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,423
Oh, uh, it's from, uh,

722
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,342
ages ago.

723
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,387
If I sell ten, I get another one
entirely for free.

724
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,348
It's like magic.
It generates heat on its own. [chuckles]

725
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,434
Well, you know,
I give one smack free after ten.

726
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,228
- Get over here!
- Okay, hear me out!

727
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,356
Now that Sade and Irem are back,
I've got nine customers to sell to!

728
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,359
- I just need one more person. Hey!
- You should have a coffee.

729
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,613
Oh, by the way, I heard Mr. Kim
from the cabbage patch died yesterday.

730
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,993
- What?
- Where… where did you get those?

731
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,037
- Did you also join a pyramid scheme?
- [gasps]

732
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:49,416
- Wait, where did you--
- They're pretty, aren't they?

733
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,209
They were buried
in the corner of the lamp.

734
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,836
[gasps]

735
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,170
[whines playfully]

736
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,839
[comical music plays]

737
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,758
[sniffs] I think it's still got
Jinniya's perfume on it.

738
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,552
Sade, you idiot!

739
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,640
Happy early wedding. [chuckles nervously]
A wedding gift for you.

740
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,393
Pretty sure you made it clear
we can't go to the future.

741
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,146
So you missed the part
where I beat you to a pulp!

742
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,731
Get over here, right now!

743
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,817
- [Iblis yelling]
- Get back here!

744
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,695
Oh, hot. Ouch. [slurps]

745
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,659
[whooshing]

746
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,704
[wind gusting]

747
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,335
[man] The sword came back?

748
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,923
[gusting]

749
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,094
[tour guide] Do you see
that dust devil over there?

750
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:46,848
In Arabic culture, that's referred to
as the "waltzing genie sandstorm."

751
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,100
Oh, a genie? That's amazing.

752
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,853
- Like all those old stories?
- [tourists chatter indistinctly]

753
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:56,232
[tourist 1] Wow, look at that!
So impressive! My goodness!

754
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,401
Dr. Choi. You're doing this tour again?

755
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,779
Yeah.

756
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,949
I just cannot get enough of this view.

757
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,868
[indistinct chatter]

758
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,453
[enthralling music plays]

759
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,457
[camera shutters clicking]

760
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,258
[gentle music plays]

761
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:31,309
Oh.

762
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:37,232
We've been waltzing for decades now
and you still step on my feet?

763
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:41,236
I did it on purpose, so that
we don't forget where we started.

764
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:44,114
There's something I've wanted to say.

765
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,449
- Ha--
- Don't!

766
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,578
Let's keep them in suspense
a little longer.

767
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,499
- Everybody watching is waiting for it.
- Mmm-hmm.

768
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,668
- Thinking we'll end with <i>"habibti."</i>
- [chuckles]

769
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,091
I thought I could sense prying eyes on us.

770
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,179
What I was going to say was
"Hi, Grandma."

771
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,142
Mmm. Oh, I see.

772
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,645
Grandma? My grandma?

773
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:20,066
Yes. Your grandma is why
I'm even back at all.

774
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:21,943
And,

775
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,280
she wanted to relay one last thought.

776
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:32,328
I SHALL NOW LEAVE YOU EACH
WITH ONE SATAN AND ONE PSYCHOPATH

777
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,290
MAY YOU BOTH LOVE AND LONG FOR EACH OTHER

778
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:38,084
[pop ballad music plays]

779
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,634
- [chiming]
- [Iblis] Hmm?

780
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,428
Duty calls.

781
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,514
Give it your best, psychopath.

782
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:56,478
Oh, I'll be just fine.
See you in a bit, Satan.

783
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:58,813
[chuckles]

784
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,732
[chuckles softly]

785
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,165
[pop ballad music continues]

786
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,101
[music ends]
