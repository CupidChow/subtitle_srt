00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,982
GENIE, MAKE A WISH

3
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,276
My name is Hunbish.

4
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:09,861
[scoffs softly]

5
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,655
[Sade growling softly]

00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,657
<i>What happened last night?</i>

7
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,886
[woman] <i>Shadi came,</i>
<i>and he took us out of the ring.</i>

8
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,390
[grunts, panting]

9
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,268
Run away.

10
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,070
[woman] The entire world
had fallen into a deep sleep.

11
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,907
Shadi pulled a string off of Father's rug,

12
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,243
and he took it with him
as he left the house.

13
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,203
He said

14
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,789
to run away, so I did.

15
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,047
What was the string for?

16
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,717
Why did you put everyone to sleep?

17
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,513
Tisah.

[Jun-u retching]

22
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,164
What did you find out yesterday?

23
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,875
A way to cut off those shackles?

24
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,711
Or someone to do it for you?

25
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,590
When Iblis wakes up, be aware,

26
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,341
he will know that I was here.

27
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,218
- [tense music plays]
- [apple thuds]

28
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:01,014
Ah! You have this silly hope
that your brother will show,

29
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,891
and that he will free you. Is that right?

30
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,978
Do you know why
I didn't bind your feet together?

31
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,397
Or fuse your stupid mouth shut,

32
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,775
even though I knew you could
make the world sleep at will?

33
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,906
I was curious to see

34
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,326
<i>if she could break</i>
<i>my thread off this time or not.</i>

35
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,706
I was also anxious to see
if you would reveal your true intent.

36
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,129
Now my questions' been answered.

37
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,048
You still want to do this, Khalid?

38
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,843
You must be careful.
My brother could kill you for this.

39
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,347
How would he do that?
Once I get my hands on that lamp,

40
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,059
and I become the master
controlling the wishes,

41
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,520
then I'll be the only one
who can remove my threads.

42
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,483
And I would become the leader
of all the spirits in the world!

43
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,527
[tense music intensifies]

44
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,281
[music fades]

45
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,950
- Who's Khalid?
- What in the--

46
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,204
- What are you still doing here?
- What am I still doing here?

47
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,666
All of you left me here!
How could I get out?

48
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,292
Oh, right.

49
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,711
Wait, isn't that thing kind of heavy?

50
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,007
So tell me about Khalid.

51
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,051
Khalid?

52
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,179
- Not sure who he is.
- You don't know who he is, how would I?

53
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,349
You're the one detained me here.
We're in this mess because of you.

54
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,851
You're kidding. I saw what went down.

55
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,896
You would've gotten detained
even if it weren't for me, you Satan!

56
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,484
That God of yours was using me to test out
how resilient his creations are!

57
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,446
You're… right. [chuckles]

58
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,324
At least you owned up to that.

59
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,580
[sighs] I touched it
because it was flowing.

60
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,377
- And then I saw something in it.
- Hmm? What did you see?

61
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,883
[Ka-young] <i>It seemed like a distant past.</i>

62
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,720
<i>A boy was weaving a rug.</i>
<i>It was still light out.</i>

63
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,556
I was there next to him.

64
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,850
Then I called out his name.

65
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,268
Khalid.

66
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,645
[chuckles softly]

67
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,607
- It was you?
- I know it was.

68
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,277
- I was as beautiful as I am now.
- [chuckles softly]

69
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,824
And now, get me the hell out of here.

70
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,452
Oh, dear! [sighs]

71
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,038
Come on, you're getting it everywhere.

72
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,131
Grandma, shake your arm.
Is it heavy?

73
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,219
I don't get it. What is it?
Part of a new trend?

74
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,971
Oh Pan-geum, try to break it.

75
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,765
You want me to break it?

76
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,892
- Okay. [grunts]
- Huh?

77
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,143
That was easy.

78
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,353
No effect on humans, apparently.

79
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,067
- Try it on my wrist.
- [sighs] Be careful.

80
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:04,781
As a spirit, I have… [straining]
infinite magic powers.

81
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,116
[grunting]

82
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,245
[exhales]

83
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,413
See? Huh?

84
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,623
Clearly, you don't.

85
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,627
No effect from a spirit to a mortal.

86
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,130
- Try tying yourself.
- What?

87
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,383
Uh… [chuckles nervously]

88
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,929
The thing is,
we shouldn't take any chances.

89
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,680
- I don't wanna end up like before.
- Do it.

90
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,598
I'll do it.

91
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,934
[grunts, groans]

92
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,853
[vibrating]

93
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,146
[strains]

94
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,231
- [grunts]
- Oh.

95
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,775
[Iblis] I did it. Now break it.

96
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,610
You're gonna do it, right?

97
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,154
Grandma, you try to break it.

98
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,075
Okay. Is this some kind of game
the kids are playing now?

99
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,035
All right.

100
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,209
[grunts] Oh, whoa. It was easy before.

101
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,088
- [sighs] Let me grab something.
- [Iblis] You can't?

102
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,673
[Mi-ju] Let's see here.

103
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,591
Mm, let's see.

104
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,135
Great.

105
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,387
[Mi-ju sighs, grunts]

106
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,848
[Mi-ju] I can't even cut it.

107
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,767
Wait here.

108
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,061
I got stronger ones in the shed.

109
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,646
Hey, you tried for two seconds.

110
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,481
[strains] Hey!

111
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,401
It's only effective
when a spirit ties up another spirit.

112
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,112
- That's the rule of the string.
- Okay, understood.

113
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,030
Break this off, okay? [chuckles nervously]

114
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,950
By the way… [retches]
the string smells like blood.

115
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,536
- Huh?
- Blood?

116
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:45,089
It was originally white.
But now it's black from the blood.

117
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,468
Given what we learned about the string
and who can break it,

118
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,094
the blood is probably mine.

119
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,929
[gasps] Really?

120
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,433
Okay, break it. Let's get it off
and take a closer look at it.

121
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:01,647
[sighs] About that floating urn,
the grains are so fine.

122
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,150
I was out there a long time
before you buried me.

123
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,361
- Grandma! You find the garden shears yet?
- [Iblis] Hold on.

124
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,655
- Wait. [grunts]
- [Ka-young] We have a bunch in the shed!

125
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,241
Hey, wait. Master! [groans]

126
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,577
- [vibrating]
- Wait, could you just--

127
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,581
Stop stuffing your face, idiot.

128
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,791

How long are you gonna stay here?

132
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,100
What are you?

133
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,354
You and everyone in this house.
What's happening here?

134
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,065
And why do you call Hunbish your father?

135
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,193
We made a deal to pay off
all of your gambling debts.

136
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,736
You said that's all you wanted.

137
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,614
Why are you asking questions now?

138
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,867
You didn't tell me
I'd be putting lives at stake!

139
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,497
I can't make more mistakes.

140
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,291
After all, I'm his father.

141
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,219
Why the hell are you all so helpless
against that kid?

142
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,762
[laughs derisively]

143
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,640
Oh, how original.

144
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,644
All of Father's previous parents
asked the same thing.

145
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:26,357
You don't know how it is, growing up
as an orphan with no one.

146

- Don't do anything stupid.

We'll listen to Father
no matter what you try.

158
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,463
This horseshit stops today.

159
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,923
Because tomorrow,
you're getting hiking gear.

160

Oh.

165
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,524

- You getting an extra shot?
- [gasps]

I won't ask anything else.
Only about your coffee, all right?

170
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,914
Uh, just a shot.

171
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,667
You want whipped cream?
And caramel syrup too?

172

[sighs] I keep asking more questions.

173

It'll be delicious.

This isn't a question,
don't feel like you've to answer.

177
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,145
I'm just jumping to conclusions.

178
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,106
- Oh.
- [plastic rustles]

179
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,816
You said your name's Lee Mi-ju, right?

180
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,612
That's fake, isn't it? And Lee Beul-li
isn't actually your brother?

181
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,453
[sighs] If you could do me a favor
and answer this one.

182
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:49,166
Are you running from the law for treason
or some other kind of illicit activity?

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,962
Oh, my goodness! It's…
It's not anything like that at all!

184
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,965
[chuckles] Just wanted to check.

185
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,592
And I'm saying this to reassure you.

186
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,012
Ka-young is…
she's the best person I know.

187
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,723
So whatever rumors you hear about her,

188
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,184
there's absolutely no point
in taking them to heart.

189
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,938
[sighs] Oh.

190
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,401
Thank you so much. [crying softly]

191
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,862
Are you crying?

192
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,946
[chuckles softly]

193
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,282
[sniffles]

- [gentle music plays]
- [chuckles]

195
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,086
Are those cherry blossoms?

196
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,965
Huh. I thought the season was over.

197
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,094
[chuckles]

198
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,932
[Yeong-hyeon] <i>All right, everyone,</i>

<i>the one to discover it and call it in?</i>

201
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,731
<i>I just want a quick look.</i>

202
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,859
<i>So, everyone, based on the size</i>
<i>of the pelvis that was found,</i>

203
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,111
<i>they're saying the corpse</i>
<i>is likely to be a female.</i>

- [snickering]
<i>- She may have had red hair,</i>

205
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,990
<i>but her hair was dyed</i>
<i>after she was killed.</i>

206
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,658
<i>Let's think this through.</i>

207
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,245
<i>That means that this is</i>
<i>a very, very serious crime.</i>

208
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,872
<i>And guess who discovered it?</i>

209
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,425
Ms. Ki?

210
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,595
What brings you all the way out here?

211
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,183
This was stuck in your taillight.
I saw it when I was fixing your car.

212
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,561
- [suspenseful music plays]
- Well, what are you getting at?

213
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,315
- What… What is this?
- Go on, take a look.

214
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,611
I would say, it looks like a strand
of a woman's bleached blonde hair.

215
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,121
I don't understand. What's going on here?

216
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,750
- Why are you giving this to me?
- Your face says you do understand.

217
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,504
The body they found recently,
you were behind it?

218
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,132
And the person that hair belongs to
is your victim?

219
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,054
Ki Ka-young, if someone overheard us,
they could get the wrong idea.

220
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,057
Just curious…

221
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,187
- did you come here alone?
- Of course not.

222
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,940
You'll never guess
who I'm here with, though.

223
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,247
Don't waste my time and listen carefully.

224
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,042
The police are looking for this woman.
She looks familiar, right?

225
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,836
I mean, just look at that hair.

226
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,381
<i>I actually looked in your truck bed</i>
<i>that day.</i>

227
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,009
<i>Nothing out of the ordinary,</i>

228
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,720
BLACK HAIR DYE

229
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,305
When the news broke, I understood.

230
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,933
[gasps] Ah, he dyes their hair
after he kills them. That seems fun.

231
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,185
"That seems fun"?

232
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,814
After all, every masterpiece
has a signature.

233
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,193
That's why I'm here. To give you a gift.

234
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,404
Take it.

235
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,080
You're giving this to me
instead of the police?

236
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,957
You want me to have it?

237
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,209
Why?

00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,053
[man 2] Oh, your dinner want
to pay its respects too?

240
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,847
- Well, finish up.

[man 2] No, no, not that. Finish bowing.

[mourners laughing]

244
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,568
I guess it's the same reason
you came to me to fix your taillight.

245
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,737
You and I are alike, right?

246

[cackling]

248
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,579
That's what I thought.
You and I are exactly alike!

249
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,207
No. Had it been me,
I wouldn't have left a trace.

250
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,836
If only there was a way to remove
the blemishes from your greatest work.

251
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,422
Oh, but there is a way! Don't worry.

252
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,051
If this all works out,
you wanna do one together?

253
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,678
Fix it and then we'll talk.

254
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,347
Amateurs get in the way.

[music fades]

257
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,908
Why did you do that?
Why give the evidence to the culprit?

258
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,079
Right now, he's the only one who knows
where the missing girl is buried.

259
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,708
If I had told the police
and they brought him in,

260
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,919
then that bastard
would just wish his way out.

261
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,629
That woman would never be found.

262
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,674
That's why I gave him a push
to make his last wish sooner.

263
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,844
[sighs] What does that have to do with me?

264
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,345
Why would I deal with this?

265
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,765
Eom Sang-tae will want to find a way
to get rid of any evidence

266
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,100
so no one could track it.

267
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,813
And when he finally makes his last wish,
you'll give my notebook to my past self.

268
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,064
Why should I?

269
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,358
My job is fulfilling wishes.
That's all I need to do.

270
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,403
You're a big liar, you know?
I looked at your lamp some more.

271
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,781
The writing on the bottom says it was made
in a different year than you said.

272
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,408
The Arabic underneath?

273
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,618
It was made in year 1061.

274
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,288
- You haven't seen it?
- Do you check under your floorboards?

00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,587
You're right!

277
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,841
Haven't you been complaining
that I got you trapped for 983 years?

278
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,384
But you're off by 20 years.

279
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,262
You could've fooled around for 20 years
and got yourself detained.

280
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,515
That's not it. I counted
every passing year precisely.

281
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,518
So what the hell? How's it off?

282
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,563
- Master. That smell, I found it.
- Oh.

283
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,565
What smell?

284
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,275
I investigate things too, you know.

[ominous music plays]

287
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,039
The smell is slightly different
from the first one we found,

288
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,375
but not entirely different.
Either way, I'm not sure why that is.

289
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:09,088
However, the scent is coming
from that immortal in that house.

290
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,261
[sniffs] It seems Shadi is here too.

[whirs, stops]

292
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,269
You wanna visit Dubai?

293
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,771
Why?

294
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:29,233
I have a brother in Dubai who might know
what happened while I was detailed.

295
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,945
We still don't know when Eom Sang-tae
will make his last wish.

296
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:37,574
Whenever he does, I'll come back.
The notebook's inside the lamp anyway.

297
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,618
I guess you're right.

298
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,121
But why do you want me to go?

299
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,040
You want me to feel safe?

300
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,293
No. <i>I</i> wanna feel safe.

301
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,880

Oh, I see. He's finally leaving for good?

In your dreams.

308
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,282
I'm pretty sure I only invited you.

309
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,410
She makes me feel safe,
so <i>I</i> want her to come.

310
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,330
I've got things to do when we get there.

311
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,543
Look after Mi-ju for me.
She's never left the country before.

312
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,295
I thought you told me they're siblings.

313
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,214
- But this is her first trip to Dubai?
- [gasps]

314
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,551
- [both] We're new to being siblings.
- Uh-huh.

315
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,306
[scoffs] I don't care anymore.
It's a trip to Dubai.

[Min-ji] I can't take
a bad picture of you.

324
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,076
I didn't see you on the plane.

325

- Were you sitting by yourself?
- Huh?

We got pickup service in a limo.

00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,941
You were rubbing the jar so vigorously,

343
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,570
I picked this face from a K-drama
on Netflix that I just binge-watched.

344
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,117
[sighs] This was a setup.

345
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,995
- Would you get lost?
- [Iblis grunts softly]

346
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,873
So you're a spirit too? A genie?

347
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,169
You made her rub the jar
without telling her?

348
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,047
Me? His ex-girlfriend.

349
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,383
Ah. Jinniya.

350
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,968
Hmm?

351
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,513
It's been a <i>really</i> long time, hasn't it?

352
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,224
Why don't we have a chat?

353
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,810
A chat? You wanna chat,
just the two of us?

354
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,481
That coffee set I gave you,
from 10 BC, I want it.

355
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,276
[gasps, whines]

356
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,992
I have no idea where that is.
It's probably buried somewhere.

357
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,203
How about the rug I got you?
At least give me that.

358
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,664
[Iblis] <i>Really? That old thing?</i>

359
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,293
If it is out there,
it's probably all gross.

360
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,046
All right, enjoy your chat together.

361
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,757
You're dead meat. See you later.

362
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,383
[sighs]

363
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,512
Wait, I know you.
You're that little shit, aren't you?

364
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,556
- Uh--
- You're another freak who knows me too?

365
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,475
We call it reincarnation.

366
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:15,894
[scoffs]

367
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,688
Well, her comebacks are quick.

368
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,024
[Iblis] So, do you think…

369
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,276
we could go… into your jar?

370
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,112
You think I'm insane?

371
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,697
[sighs] I am insane.

372
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,367
Why did I let you in here again?

373
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,245
I'm impressed
with your decorative restraint.

374
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,830
It's pared down from before.

375
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,249
Time has helped, I see.

376
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,585
Spit it out. What? Why?
Why have you come to see me?

377
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,130
Just let me ask two things.

378
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:47,467
Number one, did you ever pull a prank
by disguising your face?

379
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,178
Something like today,
with this face you have on.

380
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:54,099
Would you have used the face
of that woman there who you just met,

381
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,270
who had, you know,
a big, wide, pretty smile?

382
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,356
Get out. And do us all a favor.
Kill yourself.

383
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,900
I guess it wasn't you. Huh.

384
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,654
All right, then, of all our brothers,
do you recall

385
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,406
a brother who controls sleep?

386
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,158
Shadi?

387
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,325
- Yes.
- What about him?

388
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,287
It's been at least six centuries
since I've seen him.

389
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,874
After I fell asleep, he tied a thread
that was really hard to break.

390
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,333
So, you have any info?

391
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,003
Was that the unbreakable thread?

392
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,383
[gasps softly] Now that I recall,
there was a son he had with a human woman.

393
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,385
He used to weave rugs.

394
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,221
He died a while ago.

395
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,516
Half human, half spirit.
He had a human lifespan.

396
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,145
Huh? Shadi, he had a son?

397
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,314
[door opens]

398
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,693
[somber music plays]

399
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,909
We've made it so Shadi's able to talk
only by your command, Father.

400
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,581
At the cherry festival,
I saw Iblis was there.

401
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,461
- [Pan-geum] Buy one or two.
- Sorry, I can't afford that.

402
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:12,135
[in deep voice] His face was
the same from 963 years ago.

403
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,056
[Shadi] <i>My brother can hide his face,</i>
<i>so you'd never recognize him.</i>

404
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:20,227
You would be able to recognize him
even when I can't.

405
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,686
You know your brother well.

406
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,357
[in normal voice] If I get rid of Iblis…
[slams cage]

407
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,692
you will bring the lamp here,
will you not?

408
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,028
[sighs]

409
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,248
[Iblis] <i>His son's name, was it Khalid?</i>

410
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,709
I don't know his name.

411
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,172
But in any case, why are you
entangled again with that young woman?

412
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,342
I didn't look for her.
She was reincarnated and found my lamp.

413
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:53,760
Wait.

414
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,470
Wait a minute.

415
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,600
You recognized Ki Ka-young? She died
at the age of eight in her past life.

416
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,770
What are you saying?
You took a city because of her--

417
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,564
[groans] No way.

418
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,900
Your memories
of those 20 years were sealed.

419
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,945
Forget it. Get lost.

420
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,948
Go. You and I never talked, okay?

421
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,535
Look, wait up. What are you talking about?

422
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,578
[sighs]

423
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,748
So-- So I forgot 20 years?

424
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,001
[laughing]

425
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,002
Huh?

426
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,629
[huffs]

427
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,966
[tense music plays]

428
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,444
[sighs]

429
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,780
[Ejllael] Zahara, that look suits you.

430
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,616
Millions of beautiful flowers suffered
because of you.

431
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,912
You have one flower left,
which is this immortal one.

432
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:10,962
[scoffs]

433
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,341
Enough of that.

434
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,594
Are you aware that Iblis is out?

435
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,349
He has his freedom so soon?

436
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,601
Where is he, then?

437
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,938
All of you, including Shadi,
get on my nerves.

438
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,524
Each one of you is worse that the next.

439
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,363
Anyway, there's a chance
Iblis will come to you.

440
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,697
Stay vigilant.

441
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,369
And don't tell him about the past.
What was sealed stays sealed.

442
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,835
Your error had consequences. Right?

443
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,550
[tense music intensifies, fades]

444
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,512
Iblis had a meeting?

445
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,391
[Irem] With Jinniya.
They may be meeting right now.

446
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,184
He asked me where she was.

447
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,603
Your insolence knows no bounds.

448
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,440
I'd just restrained Zahara,
now this? Jinniya?

449
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,485
[gasps]

450
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,738
[choking]

451
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,533
What made you think you could do things
without my permission?

452
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,870
Jinniya will let something slip,
and Iblis will surely keep on digging.

453
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,164
He'll shake his brothers down
for any clue!

454
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,707
[mouthing] I… made…

455
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,669
a huge mistake.

456
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,548
I did block your ears, but now you fly
around here, there, and everywhere.

457
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,509
I'll take away your speech
for saying things freely.

458
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,177
[Irem choking]

459
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,595
You'll be careful now

460
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,515
if you want to keep your other senses.

461
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,060
- [tense music playing]
- [soft whirring]

462
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,285
[tense music intensifies]

463
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,333
[music stops]

464
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,088
What the hell are you doing here?

465
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:21,801
Iblis told me to follow and protect you…
from anything bad happening.

466
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,095
In case I die, he wants me to be with you?

467
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,223
He's waiting for the right time
to kill you. He's waited a thousand years.

468
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,810
He had a thousand-year love with Jinniya.

469
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,438
Why did that love end?

470
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,440
Ah, you figured that out?

471
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,483
Irem ended our fling.

472
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,570
Whoa, TMI.
I was referring to Jinniya with Iblis.

473
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,490
Oh, my master and Jinniya. Those two.

474
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,910
My poor master was rejected by Jinniya.

475
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,578
- Why?
- She's so beautiful.

476
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,457
Master is barely in her league. Frankly,
I'm not surprised she ditched him.

477
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,083
[Sade chuckles]

478
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,713
You know that wiper fluid you drank?
I'm taking that out of your check.

479
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,799
That's rough.

480
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,343
[gentle music plays]

481
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,393
[both chuckle]

482
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,313
[sighs contentedly]

483
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,777
[Mi-ju] Oh, my goodness.
How much gold is this?

484
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,113
Over there. There, look.

485
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,119
[Min-ji] Sounds like
you don't know her illness.

486
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,704
It's not a curable condition.

487
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,794
I see her take pills though,
and set alarms for them too.

488
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,547
[Min-ji] She takes one for sleep,
another to suppress her cravings,

489
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,465
but the rest might as well be candy.

490
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,801
They're more
for her grandma's peace of mind.

491
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,387
- Don't mention that to her grandma.
- [gasps softly]

492
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,308
She's kept secrets. So many secrets.

493
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:56,145
Hey, you. That face, I know it.
No, don't worry.

494
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,608
She may not have emotions,
but she's amazing, truly.

495
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,569
The medication is helping her a lot.

496
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,864
That right? Yeah, of course it is.

497
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,575
If I don't believe you,
who would I believe?

498
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,368
You're Ka-young's closest friend.

499
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:15,206
Right. Now stop worrying about other women
and start thinking about me.

500
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,544
I've never gotten heels
because I'm so tall.

501
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,213
Should I get these or not?

502
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:26,259
[gasps] If the shoe fits,
then it's found its rightful owner.

503
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,928
Get them. I'll buy them for you.

504
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,847
Yeah? Excuse me!

505
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,390
- Oh. Oh, oh.
- I'd like to buy these.

506
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,475
- Hey--
- Oh, you're out of your mind.

507
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,935
You know how much these are?

508
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,313
- You're supposed to talk me out of it.
- No. Don't!

509
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,481
Wear those out. I have money.

510
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,693
I made so much from stocks. Mm?

511
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,613
I just wanna buy you something, okay?

512
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:49,824
Mm?

513
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:57,582
[tour guide] The blade in the rock
is called Muttalib's sword or Iblis' rage.

514
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,835
According to legend, Muttalib,
the outsider, stole Iblis' treasure,

515
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,964
and the enraged Iblis struck this sword
into this rock as an act of warning.

516
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,341
It has stayed here ever since.

517
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,469
No one can remove the sword
no matter how hard they try.

518
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,471
As the city developed,
they made a square here

519
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,097
and built buildings around it.

520
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,354
[slow surreal music plays]

521
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,242
Satan's shown his face here!

522
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,746
- [gasps softly]
- So, you're sightseeing?

523
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,539
Oh. Not at all.

524
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,420
I heard you went to the desert,
so I was out for a walk.

525
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,759
- So that's your rage over there?
- Pardon?

526
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,388
Hmm?

527
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,896
What? How's that there?

528
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,985
- [mysterious music plays]
- [energy whooshing]

529
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,786
Is this sword really your deep rage?

530
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,122
I don't know if I'd call it rage.

531
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,002
This is my sword,
but why is it stuck in this rock?

532
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,381
- Uh--
- Huh, it really is mine.

533
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,383
Guess I got drunk one night…

534
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,428
and left it here. [chuckles]

535
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,179
I did do that regularly.

536
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,557
- Stick the sword in the rock again.
- Hmm?

537
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,142
This is a tourist attraction.

538
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,310
That's a rule here.
You have to follow the rules.

539
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,520
I'm putting it back, okay?

540
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,648
I only carried it with me
to show off anyway.

541
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,986
Seeing them enjoy it
makes me really proud.

542
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,490
I'll just leave it until I figure out
the reason why it's here.

543
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,080
- [claps]
- [energy whooshes]

544
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,794
- [strains] I think I made it move.
- [tour guide] Of course. Who's next?

545
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,338
You've no money,
so what precious things do you own?

546
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,507
Ah, the coffee set your ex got you?

547
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,718
- Ah, the rug that your ex got you?
- Oh, by the way,

548
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,803
who was that woman at the airport?

549
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,473
[groans] It's been bothering me.

550
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,808
I know her. Min-ji's ex-girlfriend.

551
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,769
You and her both have ex-girlfriends.

552
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,604
Ah. [laughs]

553
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,273
That's why she was looking forlorn.

554
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:30,902
Do exes always evoke that emotion?
Is that how you feel about yours?

555
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,862
Why do we always talk in circles?

556
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,450
Why was Min-ji's ex-girlfriend
glaring at you?

557
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,453
I don't know. She's always been that way.

558
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,709
Gamja-tang again? Really?
Do you know what day it is today?

559
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,045
I do. Of course, my love, yeah.

560
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,299
It's our 300-day anniversary.
We had already set the date.

561
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,343
[woman slams cutlery]
I'm not hungry anymore.

562
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,553
There are other places
we could've gone to.

563
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,222
Why gamja-tang?

564
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,891
You can munch on the marrow and the bones.
Very satisfying.

565
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,310
Would you stop already,
so we can talk without you?

566
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,853
[sucks, slurps]

567
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,482
[sighs] Choi Min-ji, it's me
or your best friend. Choose.

568
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,360
Just go.

569
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:14,904
I loved you.

570
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,281
[scoffs]

571
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,619
All right, fine.
Goodbye, have a nice life.

572
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,793
What's wrong?
She said, "Have a nice life."

573
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,546
You can still see me and keep seeing her.

574
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,005
[sighs]

575
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,633
That's not how it works.

576
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,763
[cries softly]

577
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,141
[Sade] I'm experiencing
unrequited love too.

578
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,059
It's heartbreaking.

579
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,103
My sweet love has a coat,

580
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,605
it's fluffy and very cute--

581
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,023
We didn't ask you.

582
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,236
What should we do today?
Today is our last day.

583
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,906
Ka-young said we'll go,
just the two of us, somewhere.

584
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,325
Oh, just you two? Why? Where?

585
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,744
[grunts dismissively]

586
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,789
[gasps in pain] Ah, goodness.

587
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,668
Hey, Ka-young, come.

588
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,546
Hurry. Will you put this on me?

589
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:15,882
Here.

590
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,550
All right, over here.

591
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,219
Will you stop relying on pain patches
and get checked out?

592
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:25,725
This is all I need. The hospital will want
to perform surgery, and who has the time?

593
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,935
I can't have a knife cutting into my body.

594
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,271
The Miss Korea competition's still on.

595
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,815
I could still have a chance
to compete in it.

596
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:37,195
My mom was angry when I married.
She threw a huge fit.

597
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,490
"Don't get married,
go to a salon instead." She was furious.

598
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,950
Should I be laughing?

599
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,410
- [Pan-geum laughs]
- [dryly] Ha-ha.

600
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,122
[sighs] All right.

601
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,416
So, Grandma, do you… do you miss Mother?

602
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:51,876
Mine?

603
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,338
Yeah, I miss her. Of course I do.

604
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,343
I got married, then she was gone
less than a year after.

605
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,386
No, not your mom, my mom.

606
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,849
Your daughter.

607
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,894
Oh.

608
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,897
Uh, well, I don't know.

609
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,234
I think of her, of course,

610
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:21,113
even though she hasn't even visited
in 20 years, so…

611
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,659
That brat.

612
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:26,911
You do miss her.

613
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,997
[sentimental music plays]

614
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,086
[breath shudders]

615
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,797
[crying softly]

616
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,552
[softly] Oh, whoa. Oh, whoa.

617
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,056
My daughter. [cries softly]

618
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,522
My… My goodness. [crying]

619
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,994
[sentimental music continues]

620
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,382
My mother had a far better mom
than she deserved.

621
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,012
How frustrating.

622
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,610
[banging loudly]

623
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:45,448
Psychopathic bitch! Hey, you!
You need to make your wish right now!

624
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,743
CLOSED TODAY

625
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,579
You better do it.
Don't think I'll make mine first!

626
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,124
I don't wanna waste that chance. Fuck!

627
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,710
- Hey!
- [engine rumbling]

628
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,921
[Bo-gyeong whimpers]

629
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,214
[engine accelerating]

630
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,509
[distantly] Come on! Do it now, bitch!

631
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:13,476
Your marriage is over, Mom?
You got fired and now you're leaving Dad?

632
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,271
You leave too.
You've wanted to be on your own.

633
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,358
For real? Are you buying me an apartment?

634
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,444
You make your plans, it's your life.
From now on, you're on your own.

635
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,781
- I wish you'd never been born.
- What mother says that?

636
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,866
You wish I wasn't even alive?

637
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,952
You can hate me and I can't?
That's how it is?

638
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,748
- I resent having you!
- [gasps]

639
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:40,419
I gave you two chances.
Everything still went to shit!

640
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,255
[breath trembling]

641
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,594
[suspenseful music playing]

642
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,891
This is your final wish.

643
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,104
[Im-seon] Yes, it is.

644
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,856
As my final wish, I want…

645
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,323
I want you to forget I already…

646
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,951
used the two other wishes.

647
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,412
[sighs, tuts]

648
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,499
The greed of humans.

649
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,002
[whooshing and chiming]

650
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,264
The wish was granted.

651
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:34,974
[chuckles in relief]

652
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,144
It was? [laughs in relief]

653
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,857
Mortals always fall into this trap.

654
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:48,279
Think about it. If that wish he made
after 72 years worked…

655
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,032
could I tell you his wish?

656
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,202
What?

657
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,330
- [music intensifies]
- [gasps]

658
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,958
[breath shuddering]

659
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,674
[chiming]

660
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,842
[rumbling]

661
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:10,801
[Im-seon gasps]

662
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,392
KANG IM-SEON, AUGUST 2, 2024
MADE HER FINAL…

663
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,563
You're going…

664
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,273
to win this one.

665
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,943
We don't know yet.
That was her. There's others.

666
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,154
The YouTuber. The dog too.

667
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,657
Eom Sang-tae and Gu Bo-gyeong
are going to fail? You're certain?

668
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:39,455
Listen, you have one more wish left.
With that, you can reverse it all.

669
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,208
- Say, "That's my final wish."
- I can't do that.

670
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,502
I won't be able
to catch Eom Sang-tae, and also…

671
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,547
you would lose.

672
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,094
[clears throat]

673
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:59,016
I'm just curious. After they've used
their three wishes, do they give up?

674
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,726
Don't they ask, "Just one more"?

675
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,612
Once their last wish is finally granted…

676
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,908
do they forget their memories of you?

677
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,536
Do they forget who they've met?

678
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,371
Or what has been lost or gained?

679
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,666
Do they forget all about you
and what they've gone through?

680
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:25,793
Is that it?

681
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,175
So…

Mm.

Why don't you speak? Huh?

694
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,027
What's happened to your neck?

695
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,946
So that bastard took your voice?

Let's have a rest. I'm exhausted as hell.

Good, then.

730
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:54,978
Just tell me one thing.

731
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,064
You said I took your feather.

732
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,275
This was before I was detained?

733
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,947
What did I do with that feather?

734
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,616
How would I know? I have no idea.

735
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,912
Then when was it?
When exactly before I was detained?

[groans]

737
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,249
There's 20 years of memories gone.

738

Who said that? Did Jinniya?

739
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,093
Wait, I know you.
You're that little shit, aren't you?

740
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,263
There's something you all know.

741
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:33,809
That's fine. For now,
just go after the life of that immortal.

742
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,020
He's going to come for Ka-young
because she broke the string.

743
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,272
[laughs]

744
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,526
How could I do that?
You seem to have forgotten three things.

745
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,488
Number one. I'm not able
to take a life of an immortal.

746
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,823
I can't even revoke your magic.

747
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:52,452
Number two. The immortal
isn't after Ka-young, he wants you.

748
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,788
He plans to rule and become your master.

749
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,958
And number three.

750
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,545
I said this already. Shadi's not a slave.

751
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:04,923
That immortal…

752
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,927
[sighs] he's Shadi's son.

753
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:09,845
[gasps]

754
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,014
His son?

755
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,391
[sighs] Yes.

756
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,311
[breathing heavily]

757
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,062

[panting]

763
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,739
- You come hiking here often?
- No.

764
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,741
It's my first try.

765
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,869
Hell of a course.
I almost fell. [chuckles]

766
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,704
Anyway, it's good to see you.

Ka-young.

769

How many wishes do you have?

[scoffs softly]

771
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,806
I thought it seemed quiet here today.

772
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,518
Please go.
You're not the one who's asking.

773
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,519
So you know.

774
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,772
But I don't know anything.

775
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,982
So just be honest with me, okay?

776
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,360
They want me to ask you.

777
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,696
I don't know what else to do.

778
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,572
They'll murder anyone.

779
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,159
When I answer that question,
I'll be killed anyway.

780
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,204
And all my loved ones
will be in danger again.

781

It's-- Well, I'm in some debt.

784
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,590
I need to do what I was sent to do.

785
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,512
They told me to do it
if you didn't answer.

786
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,056
I hope you know that

787
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,767
it's not personal whatsoever.
