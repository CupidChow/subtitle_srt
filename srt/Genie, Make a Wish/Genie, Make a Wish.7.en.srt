the face…

6
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,623
of remorse.

7
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,126
True sorrow.

Just read the book.

Iblis does not have the heart
you think he does.

37
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,404
His sole purpose is to hoodwink humans
and drag them to Hell.

The only thing he can give you

I prayed, of course.

00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,266
I am His warrior first

You feel okay now?

58
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,715
I never felt my heart in pain before.

59

Any chance…

60
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,680
that you saw me weeping blood
before my detainment?

61
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,350
No. You were the one making the humans
weep blood, that's for sure.

00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,268
Oh.

63
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,438
Did you see if I was ever with

I wouldn't know. You were always flitting
from one jar to the next.

Are you sure it wasn't Jinniya?

It wasn't her.

Why do I see that lump's face?
What a strange thing to happen.

68
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,584
Hey, by the way,
when did that start flowing?

69
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,585
Flowing?

Oh, boy.

72
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,384
It was simply contained
for almost 1,000 years.

73
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,511
Why is it flowing now?
It wasn't doing it earlier.

74
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,806
- Why is it? Do you know?
- Oh, well, don't you think…

75
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,685
It is Master who is bottled up in here,
right? Then it can only mean one thing.

76
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,563
It's the amount of time left
for you to corrupt her.

77
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,816
Your heart must have hurt
because this started flowing.

78
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,234
Your time is running out!

79
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,153
Is that really it?

80
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,658
Was that a small sampling
of what death is like?

81
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,536
So how much time is left?

82
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,705
Is this all I have remaining?

An actual pile of ash? It was that bad?

I see. Why is that?

89
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,810
- Because I took his master to her past?
- What?

00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,105
[sighs] The timing suggests
that's the case.

91
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,775
But why did you show Ki Ka-young
her past life?

92
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,402
I wanted her to be so utterly enraged
by her past death

93
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,571
that she pursued vengeance via good wish.

94
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,823
- But it was pointless.

Not her own demise,
but Iblis grieving a mortal's death.

98
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,337
The contract was important. [sighs]

00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,548
Wait, she even learned
there's a 20-year difference?

100
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,966
No, she doesn't know that.

101
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,678
But I'm right in concluding
that pressuring her was wrong.

102
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,473
And her lifespan has changed too.

103
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,063

I'll instill them in her.
Joy, sorrow, waiting, craving.

exactly how that works.

00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,569
[music distorts, stops]

175
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,155
I considered both,
but I guess neither works.

176
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,410
Don't tell me you're…

177
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,745
CHOI YOUNG-DO

178
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,497
[romantic music playing]

179
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,832
I really didn't want it to come to this.

180
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,752
It seems I have no alternative
as my life is on the line.

181
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,092
Why do you point things like that?
I feel compelled to protect you.

182
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,676
[music continues]

183
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,262
That's actually convincing.

184
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,099
- [music stops]
- Ugh, whatever.

185
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,141
Take a seat, kid.

186
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,060
Whoa.

187
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,396
Did I manage to spark something?

188
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,652
About my past life, when I died…

189
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,861
Yeah?

190
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,696
…didn't you detest me back then?

191
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,614
[scoffs]

192
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,576
What, are you saying that I don't?
Can't you see it on my face?

193
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,876
- [gulps]
- I don't believe I can.

194
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,839
Well, I'm good at hiding.

195
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,593
The expression you showed me
was definitely profound sorrow.

196
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:04,056
The only people who've made faces
like that to me are Grandma and Min-ji.

197
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,643
They say that kind of thing
is called a stab to the heart.

198
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,064
- So what stabbed your heart?
- What are you saying?

199
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,858
What could you have possibly seen?

200
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,319
I wonder. Are there girl genies too?

201
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:22,700
Huh? Well, what if there are? Why?

202
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,286
- Are there?
- Jinniya?

203
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,497
Uh, of course there are.
That's what we call female genies.

204
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,916
[chuckles nervously] Jinniya. [chuckles]

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,126
Have you seen one?

206
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,840
- Years ago.
- Did you date?

207
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,259
[playful music playing]

208
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,053
Years ago.

209
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:49,268
It was… Uh, I mean, it was before Christ,
and I was just a baby back then, and, uh…

210
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,897
I got it. Go put that face on
when you're admiring your Jinniya.

211
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,317
Oh. I'm not sure how.

212
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,612
I wasn't even using this face then.
It was arranged in a…

213
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,406
The eyes, the nose, the mouth,
were all different.

214
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,785
How? A different number
of mouths, eyes, nose, what?

215
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,919
I don't suppose the genie
that controls the rain is Jinniya?

216
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,712
It must have poured every day.

217
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,256
Huh?

218
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,385
- Did you kiss?
- [nervously] Uh…

219
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,223
The-- The eyes, the nose, the mouth
were arranged different, okay?

220
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,433
These lips were different in those days.

221
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,438
Ah! Ah. Oh, darn, I just remembered.
I'm late. I'll see you at home in a bit.

222
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,691
Yeah, he kissed her.

223
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,776
Coward!

224
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,784
That woman, she gleaned the truth.

225
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,329
Not her own demise,
but Iblis grieving a mortal's death.

226
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,914
[sighs]

227
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,583
[whooshing, chiming]

228
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,296
It's been a while, Iblis.

229
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,217
I should be saying that to you. It's been
quite a while since I've seen you.

230
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,596
My dear Irem, you spent every day
for 983 years

231
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,517
accompanying your master as he poured sand
over where my lamp was buried.

232
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,688
- So, do you have something to request?
- A small favor.

233
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,441
Do you know the place and vessel
Jinniya is inhabiting these days?

234
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,112
It'd be great if you could find out,
and keep this a secret. [clicks tongue]

235
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,029
Thank you.

236
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,241
[exhales nervously]

237
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,619
[panting]

238
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,291
Mark down any items approaching
the expiration date.

239
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,208
- Okay?
- Ah, yes, sir.

240
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,002
[breath trembling]

241
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,129
[tense music playing]

242
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,922
[Im-seon] Sir. When did you…

243
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,134
I was scheduled
with a new supplier earlier.

244
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,678
Ten minutes to break time,
I see how it is.

245
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,472
Seems you view the workplace
as a brunch cafe, Branch Manager Kang.

246
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,809
Well, who's this new supplier?

247
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,978
Timing is right,
so might as well meet them too.

248
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,816
Oh. Well… [breath trembling]
it was a family situation actually.

249
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,110
I'm so terribly sorry. I have no excuse.

250
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,070
You're groveling over this?

251
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,366
Branch Manager Kang, you can't
be apologizing for tiny things like this.

252
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,911
You're a manager. Take responsibility.

253
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,538
Your reputation is awful,
your sales are awful.

254
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,457
Even your work ethic is fucking garbage.

255
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,793
- Sir, I--
- You weren't even aware I was coming.

256
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,630
Not one subordinate filled you in
or gave you a hint.

257
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,758
How did you even become manager
in the first place, huh?

258
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,426
You make a pact with the devil?

259
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,679
Twenty years is a lot
for someone at your level.

260
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,057
You may leave your resignation
on your desk.

261
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,059
We don't need
an official handover from you.

262
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,393
[footsteps departing]

263
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,896
I heard the Korean thistle rice
is good here in Cheongpung.

264
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,481
- Oh, yes, sir.
- [chuckles]

265
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,734
- [clattering]
- [grunts]

266
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,321
Kang Im-seon, stop!
What are you doing? Are you insane?

267
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,114
Oh, my gosh! Oh!

268
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,660
This is my resignation letter,
like you asked.

269
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,331
Seeing as you won't be needing
a handover, I'm out of here, bitches.

270
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,167
I've got to finish my pact with the devil.

271
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,174
[director] What--

272
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,343
[director gasps]

273
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,812
I will help you.
I'll help you find your family.

274
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,106
No prying, I promise.

275
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,486
So, why don't we stop tracking car models
and try to remember your past?

276
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,904
My past?

277
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,241
[chuckles]

278
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,201
"Let's go for a walk!"

279
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,250
"That Shih Tzu is so noisy! Stop whining!"

280
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,628
The woman in 904 is freaky. Mm.

281
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,340
The building was named…

282
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,511
Veteran? V… Veggie…

283
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,513
[growling]

284
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,849
Dr. Kim, watch out.

285
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,102
- [growls]
- "Veggie"?

286
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:01,937
[Gae] Hmm.

287
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,737
[Chauffeur Kim] <i>Valet, veal,</i>
<i>vegetable, veterinarian?</i>

288
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,406
<i>There's a chance he was mistaken.</i>

289
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,701
<i>If Dr. Kim was a doctor,</i>
<i>then his surname is Kim.</i>

290
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,618
Oh.

291
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,661
THE ANIMAL HOSPITAL

292
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,620
Bingo!

293
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,791
I got it. Let's go. If we book it,
we can make it there by four o'clock.

294
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,002
Really?

295
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,423
[doorbell rings]

296
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,803
Um, you sure this is the right place?

297
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,971
This is the place.

298
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,933
Mm. Absolutely. The scent from the vet
led me here.

299
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,810
Thank you, Chauffeur Kim.

300
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,025
Looks like it's been at least three days
since they were here.

301
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:48,942
[Gae sniffing]

302
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,486
I'm going to wait.

303
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,071
I will.

304
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,530
"Good boy."

305
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,075

- [sniffing]

306
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,036
[gasps] I can smell my brother.

[cries]

312
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,644
[sighs] Maybe we moved to a town
that's too dull.

313
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,481
Nothing to vlog about…

314
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,358
- Oh, it's so boring here.
- [chimes]

315
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,988
Hmm? What's that? A phisher?

Click. Mm.

00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,994
I AM GENIE, THE LAMP SPIRIT.
I SHALL GRANT YOU…

[sighs] These emojis
really suck balls, man.

320
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,126
I SHALL GRANT THREE WISHES…

321
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,004
WHATEVER. I'LL DM YOU THE DETAILS,
SO JUST MAKE A WISH.

322
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,674
Mm, is Da-jin trying to trick me?

323
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,177
Oh, okay. [chuckles] Let's do it, why not?

324
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,054
Let's see.

325
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,725
I'm looking for something to film
that will make waves. It's boring here.

326
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,811
It's so damn quiet.

327
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,897
SO WHAT? YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE A RACKET IN THE VILLAGE?

328
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,818
These small towns always have
some kind of, you know… Right.

329
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,030
Something like a… a mystery or crime
within the village.

00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,941
Okay, I've… I've had
a few drinks… [chuckles]

345
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,651
Huh?

346
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,862
Oh. No, I didn't fall down.

347
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,740
I was already lying down-- [yelps, groans]

348
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,617
[groaning]

349
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,329
Ah, damn it, why is there a hole here?

350
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,080
[breathing heavily]

351
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,416
Huh?

352
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,336
Mm? What, is something there?

353
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,339
Ah, your wish is my command.

354
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,507
[groaning] All right. Okay.

355
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,801
Thanks to you guys,
I'm digging through the dirt

356
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,346
in the middle of the night.
What are you saying was there?

357
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:24,848
Oh.

358
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,935
What is this?

359
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,189
[screams] What the fuck? [yelps, whimpers]

360
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,607
END OF LIVESTREAM

361
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,817
[gasps] Oh, shit, shit! Shit!

362
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,944

366
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,664
[panting] Huh?

367
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,415
[pants, gasps]

368
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,209
Huh? [pants]

369
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,169
Uh…

370
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,421
[dramatic music continues]

371
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,174
Oh… Holy shit!

372
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,718
[panting]

373
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,180
- [music fades]
- Whoo! [laughs]

374
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,641
[Yeong-hyeon over vlog]<i> …serious crime.</i>
<i>Who discovered it? </i>

375
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,184
<i>Me. One and only, Ko Yeong-hyeon.</i>

376
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,310
BACK AT THE SKELETON SITE!

377
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,687
<i>I discovered the body.</i>

378
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,648
What were you doing around there?
The middle of the night, drunk too?

379
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,565
Oh?

380
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,609
Uh…

381
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,112
I AM GENIE, THE LAMP SPIRIT

382
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,530
IT'S BEEN FULFILLED.

383
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,073
[mysterious music playing]

384
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,283
No way.

385
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,368
The genie?

386
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,370
I heard from the police chief.

387
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,164
It looks like that dead body
is just a skeleton.

388
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,916
[indistinct murmuring]

389
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,335
You should all stay home at night
if you can.

390
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,005
If you have to go out,
make sure you don't go out alone.

391
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,382
Oh, this is scary.

392
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,927
Where did this trouble come from
in our little town?

393
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,012
I know.

394
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,517
- [woman 1] She owns the repair shop.
- [Min-ji] Bite down.

395
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,687
[woman 1] No way she only killed one.
It's just they've only found one so far.

396
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,897
[woman 2] I heard
she's always been a psychopath.

397
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,442
- They should investigate her shop.
- [Min-ji] Just a minute.

398
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,735
It wasn't Ka-young.

399
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,030
Where do you get off saying
such horseshit lies?

400
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,198
I'll not be treating you. Leave.

401
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,243
You can't speak to us like that.
We'll take our business somewhere else.

402
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,497
Yes, so get out of here,
or I'll report you to the police, okay?

403
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,833
[scoffs] We weren't claiming
anything ridiculous.

404
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,377
- [scoffs]
- How dare she shout at her clients!

405
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,547
[door opens, closes]

406
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,548
[sighs]

407
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,633
[indistinct chatter]

408
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,222
[gasps] Goodness.

409
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,143
[pants]

410
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,395
There. That one.

411
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:36,855
[exhales]

412
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,776
[Heung-rye] I wonder if Pan-geum
knows what's going on here,

413
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,943
wherever she is.

414
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,072
Do you know why
she still hasn't come back?

415
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,533
She's abandoned her granddaughter.
She's run off.

416
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,660
Ka-young was hiding behind her grandma,

417
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,413
pretending to function
like a normal human being.

418
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,582
We all just looked the other way.

419
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:59,503
Let's be honest, Ka-young is
the most suspicious of anyone.

420
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,130
You think people can
actually change inside?

421
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,341
[sighs] You're spouting nonsense.

422
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,427
I used to be a soldier. I'm all over this.

423
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,346
All that was left was a skeleton.

424
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,473
It takes 20 years
for a corpse to decompose.

425
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,683
Wasn't Miss Ki barely eight years old
20 years ago?

426
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,061
How does an eight-year-old kill someone?

427
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,480
She could do it if she wanted to. Huh?

428
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,982
She's for sure got all sorts of stuff
in her garage.

429
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,902
Stuff that could melt flesh into liquid.
Stuff like that.

430
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,905
[sighs] You've always had
a vivid imagination, Ms. Park.

431
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,785
[Mi-ju cries, sniffles]

432
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,080
What's wrong? Why are you crying again?

433
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,873
Who died this time?

434
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,800
Ka-young, no matter
what the villagers say,

435
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,137
if they suspect you or anything…

436
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,890
you cannot ever harm them, understand?

437
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,810
Why are you saying this? I didn't do it.

438
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,188
Of course, darling Ka-young.

439
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,482
I know that, I do.

440
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,611
It's the other people who don't get it.
They could accuse you of bad things.

441
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,657
You crying makes me angrier
than any of that. Stop it.

442
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,619
All right. I won't cry.

443
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,540
My tears are all… [sniffles] …dried up.

444
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,376
[sniffles] Oh, gosh.
Gosh, I'm so out of it.

445
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,172
I bought some pollack to make
spicy fish stew, but forgot the greens.

446
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,257
I'll get it. Don't go out
if you don't have to.

447
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,177
Right. You can start the broth.

448
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,309
- [plastic crinkles]
- [door closes]

449
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,981
[sobbing]

450
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,649
[pensive music playing]

451
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,911
[Bo-gyeong] I called you 30 times.
You never called back.

452
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,623
Why did you call anyway?

453
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,917
Come to the bank now and explain yourself.

454
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,253
Don't pretend you don't know your money's
being transferred to my account.

455
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,297
My accounts have been frozen
because of you.

456
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,842
- This is proof of tax evasion.
- I didn't realize I was evading taxes.

457
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,261
Don't play stupid.

458
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,097
You transferred the funds
of your own free will, no matter why!

459
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,140
That makes it a gift!

460
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:21,144
So come to the bank and explain
how all these transfers were gifts.

461
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,271
I'll report you otherwise.

462
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,775
[sighs] Report me?

463
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,821
You're the one committing the crime,
and you're going to report me?

464
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,869
You're a murderer. Everyone says
you killed that body they found.

465
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,915
You seem to think you're so fucking cool,
but I could just kill you.

466
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,292
How do you think I got your money, huh?

467
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,836
It was a wish I made to a spirit,
a real life genie!

468
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,675
I don't care if you believe me
or not, just deal with it.

469
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,427
If you don't,
I'll wish to have you killed.

470
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,264
Do it, then. Just kill me now.

471
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,853
But you know, if I die now, Grandma's
going to receive all of that wealth.

472
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,772
You won't keep one single penny
of that money.

473
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:10,235
Oh, you're fucking batshit crazy!
[yells] You psychopathic asshole!

474
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,070
Yes, psychopath, that's right.

475
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,657
The advantage is, it's easier to choose
the wrong thing over the right.

476
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:19,202
Still, I made the right choices
so I can be decent and kind.

477
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,706
So, life, unfortunately,
has become annoyingly dull.

478
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:24,916
You, though.

479
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:29,004
You have no excuse, so why do you think
you can get away with these choices?

480
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,465
If the bank reaches out,
I'll just say you were embezzling.

481
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,802
It's the truth after all.
You could try pleading with the genie.

482
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:41,433
But you know, no matter what, Bo-gyeong,
your wish will be forfeit. You know why?

483
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,811
It's because whatever you wish for,
I'll just wish for it to be undone.

484
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,731
The genie's my friend.

485
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,863
You know, I still have
one wish remaining too.

486
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,741
[hesitates] What?

487
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,208
A clear example of corruption.
To think that Satan was right,

488
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,503
about her and me too.

489
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,425
You all right?

490
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,722
About the whole village suspecting you.

491
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,641
I've been suspected since childhood.

492
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,978
After all, crime and psychopathy
are famously linked.

493
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,233
[Iblis sighs]

494
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,905
What's the highest point
around the neighborhood?

495
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,751
[soft music playing]

496
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,420
[Iblis] You can push me if you want.

497
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,006
It's been a while since you've done that.

498
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,762
It's too low.
There'll be no satisfying crunch.

499
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,806
But you knew that.

500
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,478
That's Cassiopeia up there.

501
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,231
And that's Orion.

502
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,318
Right. Everyone seems to know those two.
What about others?

503
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,531
I see. Those are the two most popular.

504
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,741
That's why that's all I found
when I researched it.

505
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,911
Even genies have limited knowledge?

506
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,665
Whoa! Wow!

507
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,793
It looks like stars are raining down.

508
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,879
Rain? No. We don't even have alcohol.

509
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,675
And, most importantly,
you're not that pretty.

510
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,804
I asked Min-ji about kisses again.
She said stars are secondary.

511
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,640
It's how pretty the other one comes across
that counts.

512
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,183
Oh, yeah?

513
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,770
This face, the prettiest of all faces
since the dawn of Heaven and Earth,

514
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,855
this face isn't pretty?

515
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:52,772
Your hair part.

516
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,692
Do you really need to have it
on that side?

517
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,068
It looks like you're off-kilter.

518
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,698
Come over to this side then, and look
at it from an angle, why don't you?

519
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,119
I don't think I can.
My face is also off-kilter.

520
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,497
Why can we never have
a normal conversation? [scoffs]

521
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,835
I suppose you can lean on my shoulder.

522
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,129
Or, I could tousle your hair?

523
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,591
Or, I'll wear a coat and strut over.

524
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,139
What's happening?

525
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:33,313
The hair part can't change. I've invested
too much into my looks already.

526
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,858
- Let's go with the first one.
- Uh, the first what?

527
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,195
Ah. The shoulder.

528
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,072
Here.

529
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:50,455
Whoa! Damn it! Hey, Ki Ka-young!

530
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:54,918
Nice try! I gave you my shoulder
so you could push me off!

531
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,921
Mm. Tends to safeguard his pride.

532
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,380
Hmm.

533
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,970
Where could she have gone
without her phone?

534
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,181
- Ka-young! [gasps]
- [cell phone vibrating]

535
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,059
- [line ringing]
- [cell phone vibrating]

536
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,312
Oh. Ka-young wasn't answering
her phone, so…

537
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,525
You're living in this house here
for six months?

538
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,860
Oh, well, you see…

539
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,823
Ka-young is a…

540
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,785
a younger close friend. Yes.

541
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,329
- Ka-young is a friend of yours?
- [chuckles nervously]

542
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,622
[chuckles]

543
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,083
- That's quite odd.
- [sighs nervously]

544
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,502
Have you seen her by any chance?

545
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,797
Yeah, but your hair part
also isn't-- [gasps]

546
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,385
[mouthing indistinctly]

547
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,762
[Min-ji] What is this, Ka-young?

548
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,307
Why is this man just letting himself
onto your property?

549
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,477
And why is this lady
randomly staying here?

550
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,189
She's a close--

551
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,359
I'll kill you if you pretend
she's a close older friend.

552
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,070
I've known you for 14 years,
even when away at school.

553
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,489
Every Wednesday,
you'd go from Daejeon to Seoul

554
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,450
to have gamja-tang with me,
and now you have a new friend?

555
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,327
Maybe you can help out like last time?

556
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,746
You're saying
you didn't think this through?

557
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,418
- You mean you lied about being smart?
- [Min-ji scoffs] Classy choice of words.

558
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,170
You, don't move an inch.
I'll call the police.

559
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:26,092
Look, everyone's going on
about that skeleton they found.

560
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,344
Ki Ka-young, come on.

561
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:32,015
- Oh, uh…
- Oh, ooh, my brother!

562
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,393
Oh. [gasps nervously]

563
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,899
My brother is visiting
from the Middle East.

564
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,151
So I came to visit.

565
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:48,698
Yeah. Lee Mi-ju. Lee Beul-li.
I'm his sister. Family.

566
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,743
[laughs] "Family"?

567
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,494
[chuckles nervously]

568
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,872
[scoffs] I know what's going on.

569
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,125
Bong Joon-ho's
Oscar-winning film, <i>Parasite.</i>

570
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,587
You're worming in new family members
until you completely take over.

571
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,964
Although, this house has no cellar.

572
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,717
What about the shed?
Anyone maybe hiding there?

573
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,719
- [sighs]
- [door opening]

574
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,137
[dramatic music playing]

575
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,725
[Iblis gasps]

576
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,935
[gasps]

577
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,438
No way.

578
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,816
[panting] Come over here.

579
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,070
IDs. All you people, right now.

580
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,113
Mm. True loyalty.

581
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,783
Of course, brat. This is loyalty.

582
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,618
Get moving already.

583
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,829
I told you to show me your IDs. Right now!

584
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:42,085
I won't tell you right now.
No matter how much you ask, I won't.

585
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,878
But I will tell you everything later.

586
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,214
Just don't ask me anything
about the siblings.

587
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,634
If you ask me about them,
it would derail everything.

588
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:50,843
And when is later?

589
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,179
I don't know. Just later.

590
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,101
- Just have some faith.
- [breathes deeply]

591
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,647
All right, I'm sure you have a reason.

592
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,815
I believe you.

593
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,610
Wait, there's also that other guy.

594
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,196
Are you counting the one
who lives in the shed?

595
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:14,784
Mm… Mm. He and Lee Beul-li are a set. Mm.

596
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,879
Two female guests checked out
a few days early.

597
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,090
- The town freaked them out.
- I know.

598
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,008
Got the message.

599
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,220
Oh, did something happen?
You look a bit tired.

600
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,556
Well, you're being annoying,
so you should go turn in.

601
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,766
[laughing] All right.

602
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,895
Always chopping firewood
despite the heat. Weirdo.

603
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,071
Shit.

604
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:57,326
[grunts] What the hell
have they left behind this time? [gasps]

605
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,662
Oh, finally!

606
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,166
It's come back, yes!
It's finally appeared again!

607
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,418
[breathing heavily]

608
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,296
[yelps]

609
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,762
[shouting] Why have you only returned now?

610
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,597
I went back out to where I hit that deer.

611
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,891
I thought I had to be in that area
to see you again!

612
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,602
Right. This is the second wish.

613
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:26,773
I want to visit the 23rd of December,
at 11:40, 2004, 20 years ago.

614
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,108
[exhales]

615
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,323
I just want to check on a thing.

616
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,874
CHEONGPUNG VILLAGE HALL

617
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:48,377
Wait, what? Why is it daylight?
I said to take me to 11:40!

618
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,589
- 11:40 is the middle of the day.
- Ah, damn it!

619
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,509
Maybe you should've specified "p.m."
if you wanted to be here at night.

620
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,636
Am I to just sit around
and wait for 12 hours?

621
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,223
- I'm impatient! This is so annoying!
- [baby cooing]

622
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,643
[Bok-ja] Darling Jeong-hwa,
do you like seeing Ka-young? [chuckles]

623
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,938
Here, look. She smiles
when she's around you.

624
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,483
You know, Ka-young,
all those people who say nasty things,

625
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,904
they do that because they're suspicious.
Do you follow, little Ka-young?

626
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,989
[baby Jeong-hwa giggling]

627
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,744
I'm confused. This is hard.

628
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,162
[Bok-ja laughing]

629
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:28,084
[sighs] To think that weirdo
will one day own the town repair shop.

630
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,752
That brat is a psychopath.

631
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,964
Well, since we have time,
how about we play hide-and-seek

632
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,507
with that brat-- [chokes]

633
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,717
[choking]

634
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,721
[groans, grunts]

635
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,099
[panting]

636
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,935
What the hell was that, you asshole--
[muffled groaning]

637
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,107
Why do these mortals
always have unresolved issues?

638
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,943
[Sang-tae whimpering]

639
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,946
Where are you trying to go?
The exact destination.

640
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,907
20 YEARS AGO, 23:39

641
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,950
20 YEARS AGO, 23:40

642
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,535
BLACK HAIR DYE

643
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:05,580
Indeed. Absurd, dyeing your pretty hair.

644
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,416
That color isn't very ladylike, is it?

645
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,879
Huh. Got some on your face. [pants]

646
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,756
[gasps]

647
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,636
[wood creaking]

648
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,437
[panting]

649
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,816
[suspenseful music playing]

650
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,910
[panting] Fuck. Shit, fuck.

651
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,667
Damn it.

652
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,629
Damn it.

653
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:56,964
Ah, shit!

654
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,592
Shit! Damn it!

655
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,764
It was Mother. [chuckles] Just Mother.

656
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,183
[chuckles] I knew someone had been there,

657
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,894
but I couldn't understand
why they didn't call it in.

658
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:14,565
No police involved, and I couldn't
figure out why. [cackling]

659
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,528
Does it bring you that much joy
to find out the witness to your sins

660
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,572
was her?

661
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,908
Mother would never turn me in anyway.

662
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,578
She's looking out for me,
just like you are.

663
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,123
Now I can relax. I can kill
more of those vulgar ones.

664
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,960
And that way, the world
will be cleansed! Quickly!

665
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,588
[cackling]

666
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,924
Is this how the lump of clay really felt?

667
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,760
My logic was similar, I suppose.

668
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,221
This is just appalling.

669
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,352
EOM SANG-TAE, JULY 20, 2024
MADE HIS SECOND WISH

670
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:55,982
WENT BACK 20 YEARS TO CONFIRM THE WITNESS

671
00:37:56,065 --> 00:38:00,278
THE WITNESS WAS HIS MOTHER

672
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,363
[ominous music playing]

673
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,871
You never said anything, Mother.

674
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,375
I found out the truth.

675
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,585
You saw me, Mother.

676
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:23,134
If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have
held back on my urges for so long.

677
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,014
[ominous music intensifies]

678
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,729
- [music fades]
- He was doing what?

679
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,273
He was dyeing the corpse's hair black.

680
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,608
It had been red before.

681
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,696
This son of a bitch is a serial killer.
Detectives stopped by the garage

682
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,948
saying that a young woman
had recently vanished.

683
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,785
BLACK HAIR DYE

684
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,997
Given the circumstances, it's likely
the missing girl was his victim too.

685
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,123
[Ka-young sighs]

686
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,084
Either way, because of you,

687
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,378
the perpetrator of a 20-year-old murder
has been found.

688
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,507
[scoffs] I'm not the one responsible,
it's all because of your wish.

689
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,719
I can kill him if you want. Say the word.
I'll fold him right in half.

690
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,430
And then, send him down to Hell for you.

691
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,974
No. We need to deal with this properly.

692
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,186
This asshole needs to be locked away.
He can go to Hell after.

693
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,105
Our chance will come when Eom Sang-tae
makes his final wish.

694
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,358
That will serve us well.
I'll take care of this.

695
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,778
[sighs] I'm starting to really wonder.

696
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,323
Will I actually be able
to win this? [chuckles]

697
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,410
"If Iblis decides
to bow his head to a human,

698
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,538
you'll then slit your brother's throat."

699
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,000
Is it that important to you?

700
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,003
Grandma is now young again.

701
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,172
Life has become dull and stale.

702
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,634
I could let you win.

703
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,220
[gentle music playing]

704
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:51,972
[sighs]

705
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,726
[music continues]

706
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,500
[whooshes]

707
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,428
[chuckles]

708
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:41,897
[exhales softly]

709
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,485
[gentle music continues]

710
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,309
- [Ok-nam] Hello. Welcome.
- [man] Hello.

711
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,269
Here we go.

712
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,691
- What would you like?
- A small gamja-tang.

713
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:29,111
- All right, with greens or aged kimchi?
- [man] With greens, please.

714
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,321
- [Ok-nam] Greens?
- [man] Yes.

715
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,866
Is that gamja-tang spot over there
for sale?

716
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,328
Yes. How did you know? It's well below
market value. It's strange.

717
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,955
Are you interested by chance, Miss Ki?

718
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,545
[ominous music playing]

719
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,471
[Hunbish] Hello. I'm here.

720
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,890
Eat up.

721
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,943
[singing lullaby]

722
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,531
[hooting]

723
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,659
[birds squawking, stops]

724
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,166
[bus engine idling]

725
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,217
[snoring]

726
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,137
[hoots]

727
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,936
[breath trembling]

728
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,647
- [Irem] Long time no see, Mr. Shadi.
- [pulsating]

729
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,691
Why did you put the world to sleep?

730
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,693
I was confident you would be nearby.

731
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,697
And you being here means Ejllael
is not far from you, is he?

732
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:59,868
I have no knowledge if Ejllael or Iblis
have any camaraderie,

733
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,663
but I still abhor the traitor Ejllael,

734
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,666
because he obliterated our brothers--

735
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,211
I want to know if I have to stop you
from seeking out my benevolent master.

736
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,298
You have nothing to fear.
This does not involve you in any way.

737
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,426
The night is short.

738
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,721
I will move how I please.

739
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,765
I will only go visit whom I want to visit.

740
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,060
[breathing heavily]

741
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,530
[snoring]

742
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,198
[ominous music playing]

743
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,037
[exhales]

744
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,122
[snoring continues]

745
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,418
[panting]

746
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,670
We're in trouble, Ki Ka-young!

747
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,673
We're in trouble, Ejllael!

748
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,928
We're in trouble, Irem!

749
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,600
[panting]

750
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,102
Take a look.

751
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:11,690
- Someone tied him up, and he can't move.
- What?

752
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,735
- [pulsating]
- [Ka-young] This black string?

753
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,571
You called us here
without trying to cut it?

754
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,908
That's the first thing I tried,
but this is some super string.

755
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,827
I swear, it's impossible to cut
and it's absurdly heavy.

756
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:24,745
Really?

757
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,749
I should buy a few of these.
These would really come in handy.

758
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,250
- Uh--
- [both chuckle]

759
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,173
Servant of my brother,
you're incapable of lying.

760
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,802
Nobody else was free to roam last night.
Do you know anything?

761
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:43,013
[sighs] I… I may have
run into Shadi last evening.

762
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:48,811
He put the world to sleep. He was walking
slowly, like he couldn't lift his feet.

763
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,690
- Little busy bee today, are we?
- Who's this Shadi?

764
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,526
He's a brother of ours
who controls sleep with song.

765
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,403
I know Shadi was here since I fell asleep,

766
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,447
but it's just not conceivable
that Shadi's behind this.

767
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,408
- This…
- [pulsating]

768
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,285
[strains] This is clearly
not Shadi's doing.

769
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,539
This string is special,
beyond any of my brothers' abilities.

770
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,002
If they're your brother's… Do all genies
share the exact same birthday?

771
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,754
Their birthdays are all Thursday.

772
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,215
Mine is Wednesday,
and you were born on Friday.

773
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,217
Excuse me, what do you know
about my birthday?

774
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,886
I was born at dawn on a Saturday.

775
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,514
[inhales sharply]
That's not what that means.

776
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,558
Can we focus on the task at hand?

777
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,145
And you! You're chit-chatting
after getting here so late?

778
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,439
You know I can only run
at 30 miles per hour.

779
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,190
I can only get here so fast.

780
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:38,235
Really? You do look quite tough
in your pictures on the web.

781
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,697
That's right. I try to, you know,
to not show off too much.

782
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,033
Shadi is the one who did this,
so can we figure out where he is?

783
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,536
- Ejllael?
- Oh, please. You know he loathes me.

784
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,664
Plus, that looks comfy.
Seems like an improvement.

785
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:53,125
Once I'm out of these,
the first thing I'll do is kill you!

786
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,586
- [Ejllael chuckles]
- Huh?

787
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,005
- Oh, damn.
- [Iblis] Hmm?

788
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,466
[comical music playing]

789
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,010
[chuckles]

790
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:04,887
[shrieks]

791
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,265
Ka-young! Did you…
did you cut my hand off?

792
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,143
We can't cut the string,
so I tried cutting your hand off instead.

793
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,604
- Or should I have not done that?
- [exhales in disbelief]

794
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,523
I know you've heard it all,
but it won't be so simple.

795
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,441
Oh.

796
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,485
- Oh!
- Whoa!

797
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:21,778
[Ka-young grunts]

798
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:24,865
[Iblis groans]

799
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,703
How did… How did sh-- How did she do that?

800
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,663
Who knows? I am pretty strong.

801
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,249
Or maybe it's because I'm your master.

802
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,671
[clears throat] The foodbank
is in need of me.

803
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,381
[Iblis huffs]

804
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,885
VAT settlements are due,
so, excuse me too.

805
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,137
Where are you going?
Come back! I have questions!

806
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,183
Uh, well, thank you.
I need to go grab her.

807
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:54,353
By the way, I saw you left me
in the desert to decompose.

808
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:55,938
I saw it all.

809
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,525
Because the angel that just left
revealed the truth of my past death.

810
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,361
That son of a… [inhales] Uh--

811
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,448
About that… [chuckles nervously]

812
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:11,119
the situation was, well…
Mm, well, a bit, you know…

813
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,163
[chuckles nervously]

814
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,874
Sade, I don't make you do this often.

815
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:17,584
Sorry.

816
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,670
- Bite her.
- [Sade] What? Me?

817
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,505
Oh, my fingers. Hey!

818
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,427
I don't bite. I swear.

819
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,806
I know dear Sade never bites anyone.

820
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,100
Oh, good. I was worried. [chuckles]

821
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:37,521
No, you just paved the way for
a horde of wild dogs to rip me to shreds.

822
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,690
Right before I was left to die.

823
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,149
Oh. But… but… but…

824
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,987
Help! Master! Please save me!

825
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,906
Hey, wait a second. If you all leave me…

826
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,866
[yelling] who's going to take me
out of here?

827
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:55,080
- You just had to do it!
- Shall we talk about Shadi?

828
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,165
That takes priority, wouldn't you say?

829
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,710
- I'll keep my mouth shut, otherwise.
- Oh, you!

830
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,879
Shadi snuck in and tied me up
with the string.

831
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,090
I haven't seen him
since the 300-year war.

832
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,883
He was dragging his feet with heavy steps,

833
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,844
which means he's also tied up
with the string.

834
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,596
- [sighs]
- He came to convey that warning.

835
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,599
Shadi is a hostage again,
just like he was back then.

836
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,727
You cannot lie under any circumstances,
and you know something for sure!

837
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,690
- Was it your doing again?
- No.

838
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,318
It was your doing.

839
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,695
Shadi has a master,
but he's not a hostage.

840
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,865
He chose his own master
by gifting the ring he was living in.

841
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,451
- That's all I'm saying.
- [zips, unzips]

842
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,077
What're you talking about?
What'd I do?

843
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,579
<i>♪ I can't hear you, not listening ♪</i>

844
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,331
<i>♪ Yes, you heard me, you heard me ♪</i>

00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,125

<i>Go on, go on, blah, blah ♪</i>

00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,257
So who is Shadi's master?

849
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,093
Smug bastard.

850
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,639
You want to know who his master is?

851
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:57,559
An immortal being.
Thanks to you. Your pride made him.

852
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,189
Would you please save Hunbish
from the wolves?

853
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,609
<i>Please, let him live a long, long life.</i>

854
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,444
The kid?

855
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,447
- [ominous music playing]
- [panting]

856
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,177
[panting]

857
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,261
[crunching]

858
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,889
[Iblis] <i>I don't even remember his face.</i>

859
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,933
<i>Are you saying he's in this town</i>
<i>right now?</i>

860
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,185
No. I don't want to.
I don't know. It doesn't exist.

861
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,187
Whatever you ask,
my answer'll be one of four--

862
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,897
Servant of Him, Ejllael.

863
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,025
Where is he? What color is his front door?
Tell me what his roof looks like.

864
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,111
You're so satanic! [grunts]

865
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,655
[panting]

866
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,076
Damn it! My shirt!

867
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,161
Sade.

868
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,334
[Sade] Hmm. This air,
the smell of blood.

869
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:08,547
Isn't this where my boss died
in her past life, 983 years ago?

870
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,633
That's right.
I made an immortal by accident.

871
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,930
I overinterpreted that lump of clay's wish
a little, I guess.

872
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,017
[sighs] But I can't recall his face.

873
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,770
He'll be passing by here soon.

874
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:27,983
Remember his smell,
and find him upon return.

875
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,570
I'm sure he's somewhere in Cheongpung.

876
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,030
[growls]

877
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:38,994
[somber choral music playing]

878
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,121
[panting]

879
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,094
[breath trembles]

880
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,558
[galloping]

881
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,811
- [screams]
- [snarls, growls]

882
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,358
[low growling]

883
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,194
[snarling]

884
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,656
[footsteps approaching]

885
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:21,912
Huh?

886
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,083
[sighs]

887
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,588
You're the man who saved me earlier.

888
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,550
My name is Hunbish.

889
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:37,719
Thank you, sir.

890
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,389
[scoffs] Huh.

891
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,893
You aren't thankful in the future.

892
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,561
I don't understand.

893
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,855
Don't try to remember my face.

894
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,899
I'll just appear to have
a different one to you.

895
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,573
Don't even think of doing anything
to my brother,

896
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,243
for I will soon seek you out.

897
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,912
[dramatic choral music playing]

898
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,547
[music fades]

899
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,925
[dramatic rock fusion music]
