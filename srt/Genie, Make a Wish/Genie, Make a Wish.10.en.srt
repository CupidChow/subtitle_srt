PLEASE RETURN YOUR ID
AND YOUR LOCKER AND BUILDING KEYS

00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,297
Gu Bo-gyeong, your actions
are unacceptable. You are fired, got it?

6
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,800
Thanks to you, the branch's
highest earning client is gone!

7
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,097
Fuck!

[Da-jin] <i>A genie?</i>

9
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,604
What are you talking about? Our channel
went viral because of the skeleton.

10
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:48,066
Exactly! And the genie made it so
I'd uncover the skeleton.

11
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,693
I'm being serious.
How else could I find that body?

12
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,238
Out of the blue like that? Huh?

13
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,698
You have to believe me!

14
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,868
[grunts] We only have
two more chances left, Da-jin.

15
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,745
We both have top degrees.

16
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,039
We gotta think long and hard,

17
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,458
come up with a way
to turn our lives around. Right?

18
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,426
Seeing as it's a wish,

19
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,303
what about getting
on a billionaire's will?

20
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:21,474
[sighs] You gotta think bigger.
<i>We</i> should be the billionaires. [scoffs]

21
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,520
Wait a minute. Just how rich
is the richest person in Korea?

22
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,523
We don't need that much money, do we?
We're not business people.

23
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,108
Say, we have two kids.

24
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,069
Private schools, homes for them,
setting them up when they get married?

25
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,280
That's tons of money.
And what about when we're old?

26
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,782
Yeah, you're right. Better to be prepared.

27
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,202
You're sure there's no stipulations
or conditions?

28
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,164
Isn't there usually some catch
like "careful what you wish for,"

29
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,458
when it comes to fables involving genies?
"It's gonna bite you in the ass."

30
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,462
What if there's something
like that? [sighs]

31
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,299
- It'd be helpful if we could ask.
- Hey!

32
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,176
What happens if he says
that counts as one of my wishes?

33
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,094
[gasps]

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,013

- Mm!

[Da-jin sighs heavily]

36
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,978
Then, why don't we each think of a wish,
so you get one and I can get one?

37
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:07,896
What?

38
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,900
- But why would we do that?
- Um…

39
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,611
[scoffs] I wouldn't have told you
if you were gonna ask that.

40
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,947
But we're married, so isn't it a given?

41
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,825
We can make money,
but some things, money can't fix.

42
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,536
What can't money fix for us?

43
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,205
Like my dad's cancer.

00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,543
[sighs] Come on!
Doctors can do anything these days!

45
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,338
Why would you waste a wish on that, huh?

46
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,797
Anyway, money can fix that.

47
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,133
Yeah, but it's terminal.

48
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,344
Terminal means no hope for recovery.

49
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,138
It's not like he's on hospice
right this second or anything.

50
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,890
And besides, our views.

51
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,100
We're gonna be so rich soon.

52
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,727
Let's just wait a few months.

53
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,771
Hold off on making wishes, okay?

54
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,105
No, it's not okay.

55
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,107

He was killing everyone.

65
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,528
It was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen, Father.

66
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,572
Tell me what happened to that girl.
Did you hurt her?

67
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,324
I have no pain anymore.

68
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,286

I learned so much.

112
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,351
I've learned to do everything in my power

Shadi is willing to sacrifice himself
for his son.

His love is so strong.

It stabs right to his core.

So proud and haughty.

00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,130
Sounds like such a hassle to travel
at our age. What's so great about that?

174
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:35,384
Hawaii? That tiny island?
I could go tomorrow if I wanted to.

175
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,011
My eldest son is a judge,

176
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,555
and my younger son
is an executive at a top firm,

177
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,808
and their children are all geniuses.

178
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,060
Ok-nam is a mess.

179
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,563
<i>Dropped her whole life,</i>
<i>ran away 'cause of her child.</i>

180
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,776
If anyone thinks
they could've done better than <i>I</i> did,

181
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,444
then just come forward and prove it.

182
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,614
Yes, of course. I'm with you.

183
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,367
We all know. We all agree with you.

184
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,035
[all chuckle]

185
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,453
AN BOK-JA

186
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:08,459
[Bok-ja] <i>Don't worry about Ka-young.</i>
<i>Send us some photos of your new place.</i>

187
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,046
[sighs] Where's my daughter gone to?

188
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,175
She changed her number without telling me.

189
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,431
- What's that smell? Baeksuk?
- Yes.

190
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,226
Tell that lanky fellow that it's ready.

191
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,436
[grunts]

192
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:32,274
I hope you will continue to get along
with my dear Ka-young.

193
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,736
- [grunts in agreement]
- Please watch over her, don't pick fights.

194
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,407
If she behaves in a rude manner,
try to respond with kindness.

195
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,787
I get the legs.

196
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,623
[sighs] Oh, come on now.

197
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,209
Just share them.
We're all friends here. Mm.

198
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,503
We should be sharing everything.

199
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,383
Whether you're happy or sad,
for better or for worse, no matter what.

200
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,677
What's this rule?
I always get the chicken legs.

201
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,887
Goodness' sake! Just let him eat it!

202
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,973
You know it's important to share!

203
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,808
So what? The legs are always mine!

204
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,061
- Don't you dare touch those.
- [chicken clucking]

205
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,439
[chopsticks clatter]

206
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,315
Spit it out.

207
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,363
- Still want it?
- [Mi-ju sighs]

208
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,031
- I said, spit.
- No.

209
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,034
- [sighs]
- Want me to kill you?

210
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,703
[classical music playing]

211
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,746
- I want you to not kill me.
- Give me the chicken!

212
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,958
- [mockingly] Don't be a child!
- Give me the chicken now!

213
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,544
- [Iblis] I said, don't be a child.
- Stop repeating things!

214
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,547
There's so much chemistry.
That's all you need.

215
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,174
- [Iblis laughs]
- Get over here!

216
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,010
- [Ka-young grunting]
- [Iblis grunts, laughs]

217
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,808
[gentle music plays]

218
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,858
Mm. This word here comes up the most.

219
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,319
Is this <i>habibti?</i> "My true love"?

220
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,236
Huh?

221
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,155
Uh-huh. [mumbles]

222
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,616
You don't remember,
yet you're sure it's me?

223
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,451
- Mm?
- You know it's equally likely

224
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,495
that it's about Jinniya. 50/50.

225
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,458
We've already kissed.
Shouldn't you have asked this earlier?

226
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,419
If it's about Jinniya,

227
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,256
you will die for wasting my valuable time.

228
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,424
[gasps]

229
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,510
So hurry up with finding the truth.

230
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,223
Look at this one.
You spent every night sewing

231
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,393
so you'll have new garments for
your return to Goryeo. [chuckles softly]

232
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,354
Sewing?

233
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,649
Hmm. I guess I must have liked needles
back then too.

234
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,360
- [Iblis] Mm?
- [wrench clatters]

235
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,195
Where is Khalid's name?

236
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,906
Here and here.

237
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,741
Why?

238
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,994
Because, in Korea, it's bad luck
for names to be written in red.

239
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,957
Little shit.
If he started his mission this long ago,

240
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,043
we're far less equipped than we thought.

241
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,965
There is something that we do have.

242
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,008
No matter how much info Khalid has on us,

243
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,261
ultimately, you're making the wish,
not him.

244
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,847
Let's get out of here.

245
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,850
From now on, make sure
you always have the lamp.

246
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,564
So, what, I should carry it around?

247
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,315
I guess it could be a container

248
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,192
to hold curry.

249
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,152
That's believable, right?

250
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,946
That's why… [snaps fingers]

251
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,323
There.

252
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,160
Well, I've seen bottles like this
carried around.

253
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,622
- The adaptable type.
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,461
I guess time is running out.
He'll strike soon.

255
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,595
On that matter,
I need you to listen carefully.

256
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,056
Khalid will definitely try to bind me
again, and he will use Shadi.

257
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,436
So if he does tie me up,
and I can't help you,

258
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,773
you must spend your final wish
on saving yourself.

259
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,028
The wish must be righteous. All right?

260
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,575
So you've already decided
what your plan is.

261
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,289
But I refuse to let you go.

262
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,707
[chuckles, smacks lips]

263
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,044
Too bad, I thought
that would work. [chuckles]

264
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,630
[sentimental music playing]

265
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,511
[Yeong-hyeon on video]
<i>I'm just so curious.</i>

266
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,765
<i>Do psychopaths really not know</i>
<i>what love is?</i>

267
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,559
<i>Like, being willing to sacrifice yourself</i>
<i>for another?</i> [chuckles]

268
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,852
<i>I think I could kill…</i>

269
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,063
<i>for another person.</i>

270
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,483
<i>- Does that count as love?</i>
<i>- </i>[key clacks]

271
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,985
Wow, hot damn! Hey, Da-jin, come look.

272
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,780
Our interview with the psychopath
is viral. It's popping off.

273
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,200
It's the ninth most
trending video! [laughs]

274
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,244
They've even made it into a meme
in the comments. [laughing]

275
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,040
"I worked late for my manager.
Does that count as love?"

276
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,627
"I binge ate for my boyfriend.
Does that count as love?"

277
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,421
"I only ate the pie crust
and left the middle for--"

278
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,507
Just the crust? That's mental. [laughs]

279
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,217
What the hell? [laughs]

280
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,010
Oh, that's hilarious. [laughing]

281
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,887
- So, what?
- Let's see…

282
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,181
Have you decided about the wish?

283
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,143
Are we still talking about that? [sighs]

284
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,979
Seriously, I'm over it.

285
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,816
Let's enjoy our fame
for a little while! [scoffs]

286
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,442
[sighs softly]

287
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,444
I can't.

288
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,824
I think we should get a divorce.

289
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,535
- Huh?
- You've two wishes left, don't you?

290
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,162
I would like one. It'll be alimony.

291
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,664
A divorce?

292
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,333
[sighs] Come on, you've gone nuts.

293
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,713
Huh? You can't possibly mean it.
They're my wishes, my choice.

294
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,007
- It's nothing to do with you.
- Oh, yeah?

295
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,342
And us being married is what?

296
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,344
You asshole.

297
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,889
What? Wait a minute, the fuck you say?

298
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,811
So this person really is Ms. Oh Pan-geum?

299
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,813
[woman] Yes! That's Oh Pan-geum.

300
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,190
Third daughter of the family in Bukcheon.

301
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,818
Ah, she was such a pretty young lady
in Hadong.

302
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,737
She moved to Seoul when she got married.

303
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,864
Oh, I know that smile.
That's her, all right.

304
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,199
Her husband was from Chungcheong-do.

305
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,161
Last I heard, their daughters
had families of their own.

306
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,121
Let me see that.

307
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,168
Oh, oh! This was
when she was a young lady.

308
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,879
Why are you looking for her anyway?
Is she okay?

309
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,381
- Did Pan-geum pass away?
- Hey.

310
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,926
No. She's in great health.

311
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,636
- [woman 1] Good to hear.
- [woman 2] Good.

312
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,680
[sighs]

313
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,853
[Ka-young] <i>What does he do for a living?</i>
<i>I'm not quite sure yet.</i>

314
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,272
It's strange he's always asked me
what my wish is.

315
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,107
Oh, my goodness,
my teeth got younger too!

316
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,860
Just don't ask me anything
about the siblings.

317
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:50,903
My deal?

318
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,822
[Ka-young] <i>I can say one thing for sure.</i>
<i>He's not a real man.</i>

319
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,700
If I'm not to ask questions
about all this,

320
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:02,331
and he's not human like we are,
and he gives us wishes to make…

321
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,418
[laughing]

322
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,882
Wow. It's just so unreal, I'm speechless.

323
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,764
Don't! Wear those out.
I just wanna buy you something, okay?

324
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,351
You deserve them.
Wear these and go anywhere you want.

325
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,436
Anywhere in the world.

326
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,147
Just trust your instincts.

327
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,566
Hmm?

[crying]

330
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,699

331
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,829

Why does his wrath come out as gold?

517
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,210
I don't know.

518
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,672
- Meaning what?
- I don't want to know.

519
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:10,094
You don't find it strange that Iblis
has no memories of that time?

520
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,058
- Ah. I'm sorry.
- Don't come back if you mean it.

521
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:19,479
We're now even when I danced for joy
when Muttalib killed you. Get out.

522
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,982
Ah. The guy who killed me back then.

523
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,446
I appreciate it. Mm.

524
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,534
Any chance Iblis called you <i>habibti</i>
when you were together?

525
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,332
Any chance you've had bees pelt your face?

526
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,249
[scoffs]

527
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,836
- So I'm the one.
- [thunder rumbling]

528
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,926
[pop music playing over speakers]

529
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,514
[Sade] Irem! Irem!

530
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,432
[chuckles]

531
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,144
[panting]

532
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,313
Whew. [pants]

533
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,151
I was in bed when you called.
I just threw this on.

534
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,863
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

535
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,536
[sighs] I can't be sure about it,

536
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,622
but there are peculiar things going on
that they aren't telling us.

537
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,208
There's something you'll have to do
when that day comes.

538
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,629
Getting to business before cotton candy?
What could it possibly be?

539
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,008
You and I serve our masters faithfully.

540
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,011
So if a time comes
when you will have to act decisively,

541
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,472
it is crucial that your decision
is worthy of your master's strength.

542
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,017
I'll do the same as well. All right?

543
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,354
I got all fancy for you.
Odd way to get dumped.

544
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,859
You said you were in bed.
Your ears are showing.

545
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,027
I like to sleep this way.

546
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,903
- Check those out.
- Those are cute.

547
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,573
- [woman] I want a pair.
- [man] Let's get them.

548
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,704
MY CHANNEL

549
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,789
SKY FARM LIFE

550
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,082
[sighs]

551
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,551
NEW PASSWORD: 1 GENIE WISH IS MINE!

552
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,932
PASSWORD CHANGED

553
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,768
[mouse clicking]

554
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,853
[suspenseful music playing]

555
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,940
YOUR CHANNEL HAS BEEN DELETED

556
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,821
Hey, Choi Da-jin! Da-jin, Da-jin! Hey!
What's wrong with our channel?

557
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,950
Quickly. You-- You gotta look.
The whole channel was erased like that!

558
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,453
The fuck is going on? What the hell!

559
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,458
You think we got reported?
Why were we reported?

560
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,877
- This'll be the death of me! [groans]
- We weren't.

561
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,337
I decided to delete my account.

562
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,548
Have you lost your mind?

563
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,051
Do you know what it took
to get all that traffic?

564
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,011
- You've gone insane!
- Hey!

565
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,554
[Yeong-hyeon sighs]

566
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,765
All I've done
is exactly what you suggested.

567
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,892
It was made with my account,
so I can do as I like.

568
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,895
Just like your damn wishes.
You're the one who said

569
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,022
we should separate what's mine
and what's yours!

570
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,234
Wow. You really have totally lost it!

571
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,694
Hey! You need to cut the crap!

572
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,696
I'm the reason the channel
is doing well at all!

573
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,697
Quiet.

574
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,617
- You bring the genie to me.
- [sighs]

575
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,204
You know it'll be erased for good
if we don't restore it within two weeks.

576
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,247
So think carefully.

577
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,541
I changed the password.
I'm the only one with access.

578
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,878
Seriously, what you have just done…

579
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,714
I hope for you that you can bring it back.

580
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,677
<i>This is my second wish.</i>

581
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:42,306
I want it so that Da-jin forgets
everything I said about the wishes.

582
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,391
I wish…

583
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,643
that she forgets everything.

584
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,938
Right now! Are you listening?

585
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,274
[Iblis] <i>Hey.</i>
<i>Chill out, it's been fulfilled.</i>

586
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,527
<i>I was halfway across the Gobi Desert,</i>
<i>but sure, let me drop everything for you.</i>

587
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,989
<i>You're reading this, but I know you can</i>
<i>hear it too. A strong, resonant voice?</i>

588
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,533
<i>While we're at it, you gonna make</i>
<i>your final wish? What is it?</i>

589
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,703
<i>Even if you've thought about it, think</i>
<i>harder. Be thankful I show you grace.</i>

590
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,414
<i>And don't ever use words like "right now"</i>
<i>with me, got it?</i>

591
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,223
Why is the lamp not on you like I said?

592
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,976
It's at the hotel, it's safe.
I bolted out in a rush.

593
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,022
I came hoping I'd remember something,
but no luck.

594
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,065
Goodness.

595
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,862
Glad you're okay.

596
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,035
Hug me tighter.
It could trigger something in my memory.

597
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,245
What do you want to recall?

598
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,582
The Muttalib from the sign over there.
Or that damn villain, Khalid.

599
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,920
Or the joy or sorrow
we both felt in our shared past.

600
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:54,837
[chuckles]

601
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,798
Sensing an ulterior motive here.

602
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,009
Says who? Squeeze tighter!

603
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,431
[Iblis grunts, sighs]

604
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,852
[somber traditional music plays]

605
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,739
[Iblis gasping]

606
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:30,957
You.

607
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,502
Your clothing is unusual today.

608
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,837
Your hair is shorter too.

609
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:41,550
- Are you almost ready to leave?
- Ready to leave?

610
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,179
[chiming]

611
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,476
You're here. Why would I leave?

612
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,105
Do I not still owe you wishes?

613
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,525
You certainly seem odd today.

614
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,527
Muttalib has one wish left.

615
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,322
You must be ready to make it.
After this, no one could be your master.

616
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,077
That means it's time, isn't it?

617
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,704
We can leave tonight?

618
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,206
For Goryeo?

619
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,542
Muttalib has a wish left?

620
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,300
[music intensifying]

621
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,388
[rumbling]

622
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,645
[Ka-young] What's wrong?

623
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,152
Hey.

624
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,738
Where'd you go?

625
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,994
There is a chance that…

626
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,120
[music fades]

627
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,081
…you and I never made it to Goryeo.

628
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,503
And I think the reason as to why

629
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,882
is also why the sword was stuck in there.

630
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,010
What are you saying?

631
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,348
Oh.

632
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,393
Why did it work for you?
Why can't I remember anything?

633
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,356
That's not fair. Hey, swap places with me.

634
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,650
[sighs]

635
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,904
Mm.

636
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:38,250
[Heung-rye] I still feel young inside.
When did my outside become so old?

637
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,844
[gasps] Oh, my. Oh, hey!

638
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,430
When did you get back home?
Why didn't you tell us?

639
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,017
Hello.

640
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,644
[sighs]

641
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,606
Oh, my. I was positive it was Pan-geum.

642
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,982
I guess I was mistaken.

643
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,319
- Forget what I said.
- [chuckles nervously]

644
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,408
Why is she bothering
with a field that isn't hers?

645
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,826
[Mi-ju chuckles nervously]

646
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,668
Hang on a minute.

647
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,177
OH PAN-GEUM

648
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,013
[automated voice] <i>The person</i>
<i>you're trying to reach is not available.</i>

649
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,182
<i>Please leave your message after the beep.</i>

650
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,645
Something is very strange about this.

651
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,774
Mm. I can't imagine why
Min-ji is the only she talks to.

652
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,652
Her husband's death anniversary
was yesterday.

653
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,779
And she didn't even call us.

654
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,740
No ancestral rites?

655
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,621
[dramatic suspenseful music plays]

656
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,539
Whoa…

657
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:03,794
Those groceries were for the rites!
What is she doing? Huh?

658
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,838
Oh, boy!

659
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,844
[Iblis] I thought for sure you'd ask to go
to the top floor of an observation deck.

660
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,597
I don't wanna stand
on the edge of anything.

661
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,309
So why did your rage come out as gold?

662
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,020
It was a truly dazzling,
beautiful hell on earth.

663
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,731
"The wrath of Iblis" they called it.

664
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,901
How would you say wrath manifests
for you? As gold?

665
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,986
Gold? What do you mean?

666
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,155
You don't remember, I don't answer. Pass.

667
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,408
[chuckles softly]

668
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,704
We might not remember
that time period, you or I,

669
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,500
but we knew each other,
we spent time by each other's side.

670
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,544
[tuts] Still, Muttalib means "foreigner."

671
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:49,632
We only spent time?
I thought I was your <i>habibti,</i> wasn't I?

672
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,426
Our dynamic was definitely
incredibly serious.

673
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,887
You said the odds of it being Jinniya
were 50/50.

674
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,182
Don't tell me…

675
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,645
[sighs]

676
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,147
[thunder rumbling]

677
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,566
- Got an umbrella?
- An umbrella?

678
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,198
Wow, your ex is certainly meticulous.

679
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,202
- It's raining. Kiss.
- Hey, we're in Arabia.

680
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:19,995
[man] <i>What?</i>

681
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,248
[romantic waltz music playing]

682
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,379
You can't whisk us
somewhere it's not raining.

683
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,382
- We haven't followed that rule for ages.
- You didn't fall for it.

684
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,343
I'm starving.
What even is there to eat around here?

685
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:39,473
- I'm so hungry, I'm about to wish for it.
- [laughs sarcastically] Make it.

686
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,268
[laughs sarcastically]
Give me a reason. Feed me now!

687
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,145
[scoffs] You've never cared
when I've been hungry.

688
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,107
Change your clothes
while I set the table.

689
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,282
Huh. Hmm.

690
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,664
[Iblis] Mm!

691
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,468
[gasps]

692
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,680
This-- This was here?

693
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:23,392
Oh, no, get rid of this right now!
Burn it! No, just hide it. Let it rot.

694
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,436
Ah, this is… [inhales] Uh, maybe…

695
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,313
[Ka-young] Do I look like my past self?

696
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,024
Huh?

697
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,862
[pensive ethereal music plays]

698
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,209
Yeah.

699
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:51,712
Your past self.

700
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:53,672
I do?

701
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,760
Seems to me I also resemble
how I looked in the hourglass.

702
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,930
Who looks nicer, current me or past me?

703
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:03,891
- Uh--
- No, don't tell me.

704
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,226
- Mm-hmm.
- Go ahead, tell me.

705
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,604
- Uh--
- No, let's just say I am.

706
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,189
[grunts softly]

707
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,232
What's that there?

708
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,193
- [comical music plays]
- Huh?

709
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,865
[hesitantly] What?

710
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,785
[gulps]

711
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,208
Move. It's ramyeon.

712
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,839
Oh! I told them to prepare Korean food.

713
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,883
[chuckles forcedly]

714
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,137
[clears throat]

715
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,475
- We need that fruit over here too.
- Huh? Sure.

716
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,395
[slurps]

717
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,232
Mm.

718
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,777
Mm.

719
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,073
So, do you really dance the waltz
on your own? No partner?

720
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,118
- The waltz?
- [slurping]

721
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,328
I've never danced the waltz.

722
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,664
I don't know how.

723
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,419
Then how come the sandstorms in the desert
are called "the waltzing genie"?

724
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,295
Uh…

725
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,674
Pass.

726
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:25,973
- Fine, then.
- Hmm?

727
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,517
I'll teach you how to waltz
with a partner.

728
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:31,770
[slurps]

729
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,439
[grunts softly]

730
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,485
Let's go. Shall we break the beat down…
[cracking knuckles]

731
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,862
for old time's sake?

732
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,573
Right.

733
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,244
[clears throat, hums]

734
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,165
[pop ballad music plays]

735
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,293
[Iblis] Mm?

736
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,753
Mm?

737
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,135
[grunts]

738
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,682
Just picture a large, round ball
squished between you and I.

739
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,392
That ball represents a universe.

740
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,645
The waltz is about preserving
that space. Got it?

741
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,940
We dance around an even larger universe.

742
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,152
- Understand?
- Yeah. I do.

743
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:23,322
Look right into my eyes,
let yourself be entranced.

744
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,658
Now, left foot goes first.

745
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:31,288
- One, two, three, back.
- Okay.

746
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,041
- One, two, three, and forward.
- Two, three…

747
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,335
- One, two--
- [Iblis grunts nervously]

748
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,214
- [chuckles]
- Are you gonna step on my feet like that?

749
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,216
That's a battle, not a dance.

750
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:45,135
I suppose just everything
turns into a fight with you.

751
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,973
So, when were you first entranced by me?

752
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,393
And one, two, three.

753
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,395
The second time I saw you.

754
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:59,483
The second time
was in the hotel room. Really?

755
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:01,944
That fast?

756
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,739
Yeah. The minute I walked in and saw you.

757
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,284
You come after the cars I fix.

758
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:14,248
- The combustion engines. Brake fluid.
- [laughs] Stop, come on. Oh.

759
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,168
The tires I rotate.

760
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,255
- The hammer I use.
- I said, let's stop.

761
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,631
[grunts]

762
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,009
My crowbar.

763
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,179
Sound of dental drilling.

764
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:33,433
My auto repair shop. Gamja-tang. Grandma.

765
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,227
[laughs]

766
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,858
[pop ballad music continues]

767
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,236
[imperceptible]

768
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,720
[music ends]

769
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,401
[suspenseful music plays]

770
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,909
Pan-geum did make this.

771
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,329
That bitch.

772
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,955
She's here.

773
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,126
Ouch. Why is my tooth hurting
like this?

774
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,879
[inhales sharply] Oh, my.

775
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,422
[inhales, groans]

776
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,257
[gasps]

777
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,261
Why are you in my house?

778
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:55,849
You better start coming clean.
Pan-geum, where is she?

779
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,768
[gasps] She-- She's in Hawaii.

780
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,980
Don't give me that bullshit!
She's been cooking, I'm sure.

781
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,232
- Pan-geum is here, isn't she? Huh?
- [gasps]

782
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,443
Where are you hiding her, you con artist?

783
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,820
Release her. I said, let her go!

784
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,365
- I'm on to you!
- No! Why are you doing this?

785
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,824
- Let go of me!
- Hey!

786
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,285
Where do you think you're going?
Get back here!

787
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,872
- Oh, that mole!
- [gasps]

788
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,832
Pan-geum has a mole on her body too!

789
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,335
- What have you done? Huh?
- [gasping]

790
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,462
Are you Pan-geum? [gasps]

791
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,757
- You're Pan-geum?
- No, you're wrong!

792
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,386
- Seongnim!
- Seongnim!

793
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,553
Oh!

794
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:37,057
You are Pan-geum! You are! [gasps]

795
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,685
It's Pan-geum! [yells]

Seongnim! Seongnim!

797
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,147
Oh, my goodness!

798
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,817
- How'd this even happen?
- Seongnim! Seongnim!

799
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,112
Seongnim. Listen to me.
I beg of you. You have to--

800
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,072
Let go, you absolute devil!

801
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,074
- [cries]
- Let go of me! Lord!

802
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,868
You were Pan-geum all along.

803
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,870
- I spent so much time worrying.
- [crying]

804
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,956
What did you do? How the hell…

805
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,501
- How the hell did you pull this off? Huh?
- I'll confess everything.

806
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:07,879
I swear! I beg you!
I beg you, please don't tell anybody!

807
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,423
- Please!
- You disgust me!

808
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,342
- Let go, you witch! What's happening?
- [sobbing]

809
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,595
Oh, God, Seongnim. Oh, no!

810

[sobbing]

811
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,565
[Wahid] What? That bitch is Oh Pan-geum?

812
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:30,485
[laughs] That's how she managed
to keep her hidden.

813
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,573
Ah! That's how Ka-young used her wish.

814
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,200
Let's get rid of
the old lady anyway, please?

815
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,203
She'll just run her mouth
otherwise. Ishrun.

816
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,664
Remember the way to the house?

817
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,880

Two, two, three.

It's time to go home.

820
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:59,264
I'll go and get changed.
They've dried, right?

821
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,516
Of course.

822
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:11,318
One, two, three. Two, two, three.

823
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,319
One, two--
