I want to live. [breath trembling]

9
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,542
You're asking for mercy
with the hands that pushed Ka-young?

10
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,671
Your murdering hands deserve no mercy.

I've confirmed his existence.
But you are now a widow, Mother.

00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,981
I say good riddance.

17
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,777
I wonder, do you think
he saved Ki Ka-young,

18
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,071
or do you think she used a wish?

19
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,322
That level of fury…

20
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,866

00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,930
You've lived a thousand years, but still
you act like such a fool, Khalid!

25
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:24,269
You should be so grateful that Iblis
didn't let her use up her final wish.

26
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,272
If that had indeed been her last wish,

27
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:32,026
I could then claim the lamp as my own
and be the ultimate master.

28
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,319
Who do you think you are?

29
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:37,115
[Ejllael] All of that girl's wishes
have been for the sake of others,

30
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,327
and her final wish
must be a righteous one as well.

31
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,374
It's under my control.
Iblis will succumb to his inevitable fate.

32
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,420
Therefore that means
he will never serve anyone new.

33
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,588
He'll be damned by my hand.

34
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,883
So, even if the lamp's
present master dies,

35
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,385
I cannot have the lamp for myself?

36
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,971
You are merely half a genie.

37
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,183
Do not anger me. Do not interfere
in what does not concern you!

38
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,562
I am Ejllael. My destiny is to kill Iblis.

39
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,442
This is your absolute

She took a few sleeping pills.

45
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,974
Sade, there's somewhere I have to go.

46
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,061
I'll need you to stand guard over her
while I'm gone.

47
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,440
This means, you're allowed to use
your beast powers today.

48
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,692
Yes, Master.

[Iblis] It's been a long time, brother.

53
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,457
I haven't seen you since our battle days.

54
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,799
It seems your garden
has grown a little sad.

55
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,926
Hasn't it?

56
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,095
You forget that you were the reason

57
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,139
for the garden spoiling
in the first place.

58
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,143
Yes, well, I was all the way
on the front line

59
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,354
of our great war,
with you all the way in the back.

60

Quiet! Why have you come here?

61
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,195
Do you have any foreign flowers?

62
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,614

that the wind brought all the way
from the East in 1040 AD?

67
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:45,011
If so, when did the flowers fall
and the seeds get redistributed?

68
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,095
Oh.

69
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,600
You want to fill an empty void
in your mind, don't you?

It seems the cough has worsened.
Are you feeling all right, Khalid?

76
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,092
[Khalid grunts] You never get sick,
nor can you die, Father.

77
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:28,137
I have nothing to do
but weave these unbreakable threads.

78
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,975
[coughs] This incessant weakness
is too much to endure.

79
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,853
Why did you have me
knowing I'd have such weaknesses?

80
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,982
Sickness and mortality
are the law of life.

81
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:45,071
But this limitation can be a blessing.
Mortals live their lives more diligently.

82
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:48,032
It's not fair. You're an immortal being.

83
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:52,245
And yet, you can't do anything
for your son who will one day die.

84
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,996
All you can offer me is an apple.

[Shadi] Stop!

He is just a child
and he is starving to death.

If you aren't going to pay for the bread,
do not interfere.

Come on, eat this.

95

within an eternal body?

104
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,295
I helped Shadi do so.

105

173
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,922
This here is our newest volunteer,
Miss Lee Mi-ju.

174
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,007
- [both chuckle]
- Pleased to see you again.

175
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,844
I wanted to see that face of yours.

176
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,597
[Mi-ju] <i>What the…</i>
<i>He wants to see my face?</i>

177
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,434
<i>Don't tell me… </i>[gasps]

178
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,396
<i>Oh, Pan-geum, you little minx! </i>[giggles]

179
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,816
Have we met? I don't believe we have.

180
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,361
[chuckles] Indeed, we have. Hmm.

181
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,948
Your kind, you crave beauty and youth.

182
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,201
But don't expect for your lifespan
to be extended further.

183
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,537
Though your body is young,
your age is still the same.

184
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,247
How naive.

185
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,332
[ominous music plays]

186
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,668
[hesitates] My age?

187
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,213
- Wait. Wait, hold on!
- Hey!

188
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,510
Excuse me, Mr. Ryu!
What exactly did you mean by all of that?

189
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,179
[sighs]

190
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,684
What did I mean by that?
You sure you want to know?

191
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,271
You've already met a genie, now an angel.
You sure have been lucky, haven't you?

192
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,899
I've met a…

193
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,485
An… an angel?

194
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:00,946
[gasps]

195
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,324
[gasps]

196
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,868
You have. The angel, Ejllael.

197
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,370
I am also the harbinger of death.

198
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,707
[spluttering] The harbinger? [gasps]

199
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,751
Arrogant human.

200
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,045
Volunteering at a foodbank.

201
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,923
You thought such a pathetic act
would alleviate your secret?

202
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,550
Did you think your younger body
would give you a longer life?

203
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,177
How completely absurd.

204
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,721
I… I don't understand.

205
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,348
Explain yourself!

206
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:31,060
It means that though you seem young,
your lifespan is still unchanged. Mortal.

207
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,855
Since you have done a fine job
raising your granddaughter,

208
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,649
you'll be granted passage into heaven.

209
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,860
[Mi-ju breathing shakily]

210
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,821
[Ejllael scoffs]

211
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,282
Listen.

212
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,036
When the flowers next bloom
in your front yard,

213
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,039
you will die.

214
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,801
[manager] We are so very ashamed.

215
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,722
The full amount that was transferred out
due to a processing issue

216
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,183
has been reimbursed
to your account, Miss Ki Ka-young.

217
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,813
Fine.

218
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,733
I fell off a cliff recently,
so I'm a little out of sorts.

219
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,859
I'm going to go now.

220
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,489
- Uh…
- [manager hesitates] Oh, what?

221
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,866
Is there an issue?

222
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,993
Is the amount of money wrong?

223
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,119
The amount is fine.

224
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:35,916
Although, I think
I'll take the balance in cash.

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,128
[spluttering] In cash?
The entire balance? What?

226
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,631
You see, with such a large amount,

227
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,884
you must disclose the reason
for withdrawal.

228
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,887
[nervously] It's such a large amount,
you understand.

229
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:53,017
Many often just say it's for their wedding
and just leave it at that.

230
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,186
Yes. I suppose it's all for my wedding.

231
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,690
Every last cent. It's all mine.

232
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,192
You bastard, psycho bitch!

233
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,028
Have you gone insane?

234
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,031
[mouse clicking]

235
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,954
Hmm.

236
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,207
[Ka-young] Those bastards.

237
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,754
[Ka-young] Hmm.

238
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,888
[cars approaching]

239
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,768
[suspenseful music plays]

[car doors open]

241
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,232
[car doors close]

242
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,410
I heard you had an accident on the cliff.

243
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,829
I wanted to see
if you were all right, sweetie.

244
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,875
"Sweetie"? That makes this a little weird.

245
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,585
Your father and I were fellow students.

246
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,463
Wait, is it not weird anymore?
Since he's dead?

247
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,632
You are indeed smart.

248
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,467
You know who I am.

249
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,637
I have an inkling.

250
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,682
Is it you?

251
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,476
Are you the same boy
I saved centuries ago?

252
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,187
Not that smart, I see.

253
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,233
[man] It's Shaytan!
It's the wrath of Iblis!

254
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,068
It's the wrath of Iblis!

255
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,112
Khalid. Khalid!

256
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,699
Khalid!

257
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,162
What have you done, Khalid?

258
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,249
[Khalid] <i>You were only half-right.</i>

259
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,543
You did start it,
so you should end it too.

260
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,797
Where is the lamp?
You have one wish remaining.

261
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,384
And it would please me greatly
if you made that wish.

262
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,679
I'd like to terminate
my tedious immortality.

263
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,183
[suspenseful music continues]

264
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,566
I can see through your lies. You punk.

265
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,155
You've got my back?

266
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,243
[tense music plays]

267
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,161
[slashes]

268
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:19,788

[Sade growling]

273
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,469
[Ka-young] It heals right away.

274
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,555
I could open your throat
and you wouldn't die.

275
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,307
I'm afraid not.

276
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,351
[Chang-sik] I've got you!
I've got you! I got you!

277
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,519
What the-- [yelps]

278
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,105
- [yelps] It's a jaguar! A jaguar!
- Oh!

279
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,941
I've known this jaguar
since the 11th century.

280
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,151
They're the dangerous ones.

281
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,154
Yes! Yes, we know. We've seen them around.

282
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,449
Hey, hey. Do you remember me?

283
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,910
You get to decide.
Will you be captured alive

284
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,661
or be captured stone dead?

285
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,830
But no matter what, you will be caught.

286
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,750
Korean men have an obligation
to our national defense.

287
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,628
- So we're basically killers. And we are--
- Retreat.

288
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,464
[Chang-sik gasps]

289
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,888
[Chang-sik] Ha! See that?

290
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,974
Look at those chickens!
Yeah, run away. Chickens.

291
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,393
- [Min-jae chuckles]
- You all right?

292
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,188
They really seemed sketchy,
so we decided to tail them,

293
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,148
and those bastards
were following you around.

294
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,360
But what's really weird is that
one of them vanishes every day.

295
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,905
I'm saying that one of them dies
every day, over and over.

296
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,782
[cars departing]

297
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,826
- Chang-sik.
- Huh?

298
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,494
- May I ask you a favor?
- Uh-huh.

299
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,371
I know this is all very weird.

300
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,957
I'm afraid you have all entered
a very weird world.

301
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,127
- Uh, a world with jaguars like this one.
- [low growling]

302
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,337
- [gasps] Oh!
- [Min-jae gulps]

[Jong-heon gulps]

304
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,298
Don't worry about me.

305
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,718
I'd appreciate it if you could take care
of Mi-ju and Min-ji.

306
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,220
I assume that…

307
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,640
these two cannot know
of this dangerous situation.

308
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,767
They must not be left vulnerable
to attack, right?

309
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,644
- Yes, spot on.
- Don't worry, Miss Ki.

310
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,770
Yes.

311
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,357
Seeing this guy in person,
I can see he's not so scary.

312
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,984
He's a kitty. Big kitty.

313
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,778
[Sade snarls]
I'm glad we could clear the air.

314
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,822
Get him away! Back off, panther!

<i>You came to me at my worst.</i>

319
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:39,428
Yes. It's truly been a while.
Wouldn't you say, brother?

320
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,054
[ball thuds]

321
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,182
[Shadi] <i>Should I be concerned?</i>

322
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,185
<i>Does your presence here</i>
<i>mean my son is in danger?</i>

323
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,896
He might be.

324
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,858
[Shadi] <i>How the wishes of your master</i>
<i>enraged me.</i>

325
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,487
<i>And your reckless decision</i>

326
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,405
[Shadi] Khalid!

327
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,408
<i>How I regret putting my son's soul</i>
<i>into that body.</i>

328
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,494
Yes.

329
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,040
My hubris caused me
to make a wrong decision.

330
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,044
That's why I've come here now
to give you a chance.

331
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,965
But that immortal, he cannot be the one
to decide her final wish.

332
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,803
That boy may try to threaten her,
as menacingly as he can.

333
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,014
She has the final say over it.

334
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:28,227
I'm determined that her last wish
will be a righteous one.

335
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,272
[Shadi]<i> You believe that strongly in your</i>
<i>friend? If you're right, you'll be killed.</i>

336
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,025
That's no longer my concern.

337
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,987
I've already decided to let Him
send me to Hell once and for all.

338
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,325
And if you wish to protect your son
from danger,

339
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,411
you will see to it he doesn't make
the wrong decision either.

340
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,998
And if your son
does make the wrong decision,

341
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,459
if the lamp should be his,

342
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,836
I will end his life.

00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,137
[Shadi sighs] <i>I cannot restrain my son</i>
<i>for too long.</i>

345
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,683
<i>That could harm those</i>
<i>who are innocent in this matter.</i>

346
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,853
He is a being even worse than me.

347
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,190
An actual, real shaytan.

348
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,569
[Shadi]<i> I will try to hinder my son</i>
<i>for as long as possible.</i>

349
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,906
<i>That is all I can promise.</i>

350
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,119
If that's to be the case,

351
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:31,081
I'm afraid your son's fate
is still precarious, brother.

352
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,834
I am not merciful.

353
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,796
I will show him none,
even if he is your son.

354
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,881
[music continues]

355
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:56,523
CLOSED TEMPORARILY
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

356
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,694
- [thug 1] Right. That's her.
- That's her there?

357
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,488
I saw her walk out of the bank
with a ton of cash today.

358
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,158
Careful. They say she's a psychopath.

359
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,367
Oh. Is that so?

360
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,453
That means she's rich!

361
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,413
- Those Wall Street bankers are psycho.
- Yeah!

362
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,123
- [dialing phone]
- Regular people like us

363
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,000
aren't as successful as psychos like her.

364
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,544
- You bitch!
- [grunts]

365
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,714
- [groans]
- [thug 1] Fuck you.

366
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,217
All right now.

367
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,928
There's an easy solution to all this.

368
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,223
Psycho sweetie, hand over the money,
am I clear?

369
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,767
[footsteps thudding]

370
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,684
Huh?

371
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,605
[footsteps approaching]

372
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,357
[dramatic music plays]

373
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,953
Who is that? Whoa.

374
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,831
Were those stairs always there?

375
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,502
Uh, I'm pretty sure
they weren't there before.

376
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,967
I left Sade with you,
so why did you call me?

377
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,055
He just popped out to relieve himself.

378
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,682
I was just punched in the face.

379
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,975
Beat them up!

380
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,312
They punched you in the face? Wow.

381
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,524
Well, that's something I can't tolerate.

382
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,027
- [thugs yelping]
- [rock fusion music plays]

383
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,115
- What's going on?
- Who are you?

384
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,076
- [thug 3] What's happening?
- [thugs screaming]

385
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:31,993
[grunting]

386
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,830
[sighs in relief]

387
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,998
[screams]

388
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:40,710
Don't wait up.

389
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,720
Hey, hey. You're not supposed to be here!

390
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:01,398
[whimpering] What is this?
I swear, I'll be good from now on.

391
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,441
- Someone help me!
- Where am I?

392
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,153
How do I get out of here? Help!

393
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,072
[thug 1] I swear!
I promise to change! Please!

394
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,323
What's this place?

395
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,117
Where are we?

396
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,619
This is where I landed
when I was kicked out of heaven.

397
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,080
The Underworld.

398
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,208
This is where you were?

399
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,752
For how long?

400
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,505
I'm not sure.

401
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:31,261
[Iblis] <i>But I suppose you humans</i>
<i>would call it "eternity." </i>[scoffs]

402
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,433
Even with this fate, you still wouldn't
bow your head to humans?

403
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,602
That bad?

404
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,146
That was the case.

405
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,444
Just to be sure,
you'll take me out of here, right?

406
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,446
You haven't treated me as a human
all that much.

407
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,532
I would just like to be sure.

408
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,702
Remember how you wouldn't spot me any cash
when I asked?

409
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,038
And dinner?
You'd get annoyed when I asked.

410
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,999
And the black string?
Instead of breaking it off my wrist,

411
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,667
you ran to the shed to get the giant--

412
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,297
I'm treating you with care.
Oh, my dear Genie is warm.

413
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,549
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

414
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,968
I do not consent. [chuckles]

415
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,470
Hmm.

416
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,265
I guess for us… [grunts softly]

417
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,186
it always ends this way. Let's go.

418
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,773
Come on.

419
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,446
[footsteps approaching]

420
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,782
Where have you been?
I told you to rush over.

421
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,786
I'm sorry, but where does one find
a velvet coat hanger at this hour?

422
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,496
Luckily, Irem had one.

423
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:43,416
From now on, you and I
must be on the same page.

424
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,085
Now,

425
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,463
very carefully pull it over the top
to the bottom.

426
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,091
We can't let any dust
fall off of this coat.

427
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,344
All its molecules, filth, air, atoms,
brightness, saturation,

428
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,430
every piece of evidence of Hell.
Every souvenir.

429
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,182
Dust from Hell?

430
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,523
Gosh, you're in an awfully good mood
for someone just back from Hell.

431
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,776
I dodged every hit today. Not one landed.

432
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,863
I think I've clocked your pattern
of attack. It's right, left, left, center.

433
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,907
[chuckles smugly] Easy. [clicks tongue]

434
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,158
[Ka-young] Not exactly.

435
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,202
Go hang this over there.

436
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:21,621
[grunts softly]

437
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,792
The immortal being was that kid.
My classmate's son.

438
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,795
He brought his car into the garage.

439
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,340
You're kind of right, but only half-right.

440
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,012
He said that too.
I'm only ever half-right, I guess.

441
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,264
Pray tell me what I've gotten so wrong?

442
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,268
Shadi swapped his son's soul
with the immortal being's.

443
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:48,231
The boy you hoped would live a long life
was unable to do so.

444
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,401
The immortal one… [sighs]

445
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:53,945
is Khalid.

446
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,573
Khalid.

447
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,950
[Ka-young] <i>The one in the hourglass?</i>

448
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,955
That ingrate. I was so nice to him,
and this is how he treats me?

449
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,916
Mr. Genie! Mr. Genie!

450
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,002
Mr. Genie.

451
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,797
I found my dad! I found my home!

452
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,884
I saw my brother, Ha-neul too. [sniffing]

453
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,470
Are you… Kim Gae?

454
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,641
Oh. Has anyone told you
you look so much like Daniel Henney?

455
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,018
[growling]

456
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,228
- Hey. Bad dog.
- [barks]

457
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,647
Oh. Sorry.

458
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,524
Habit.

459
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,985
Mr. Genie.

460
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:38,448
I'd like to return to being a dog. Please.

461
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,410
[gags]

462
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,580
- [Chauffeur Kim] Sir!
- [gagging]

463
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:46,498
What's wrong?

464
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,585
Oh, no. Mr. Kim, are you sick?
We need to get you to a hospital.

465
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,004
No. No. No. [coughs]

466
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,466
[weakly] Every time I go see the doctor,
they get mad.

467
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,302
"We can't afford this dog's surgery."

468
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,553
See, my dad gets angry.

469
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,224
"Ppoppi, bad boy. Bad boy!"

470
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,935
- [coughs]
- [Chauffeur Kim] Let me clean the blood.

471
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,773
Hang on, sir, I'm confused.
Why do you say you're a dog?

472
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,485
You can't think like that.
I've known assholes who are absolute dogs.

473
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,406
Sir, believe me, you're a good person.

474
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:20,865
Chauffeur Kim.

475
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,910
Thank you. I leave all my money to you.

476
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,371
It's all yours. All of it.

477
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,081
I'm done with it.

478
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,376
Mr. Genie, please do it.

479
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,253
You want this to be your final wish?

480
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,756
Wait. Look, before that,
ask your family first.

481
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,843
Ask if they lost a dog,
if they're looking for one.

482
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:42,887
If they miss it.

483
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,141
No, it's… it's too late now.

484
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,270
I need to tell Ha-neul goodbye.

485
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,064
- Don't say that.
- So I have to go.

486
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,693
This is my final wish.

487
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,322
[sighs] How'd we get here?

488
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,285
[sighs softly]

489
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,000
[melancholy music plays]

490
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,921
[Iblis] It's been fulfilled.

491
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,262
[panting]

492
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,140
[car approaching]

493
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,106
[music continues]

494
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,153
[whimpers]

495
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,496
[mouse clicks]

496
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,335
[mouse clicks]

497
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,923
She got to the bus terminal,
but never got on one.

498
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,925
Then she went back out to catch a taxi.

499
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:04,844
Why?

500
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,932
[Ka-young] If that kid is Khalid,

501
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,976
can't you just go back in time
and see what happened back then?

502
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,770
Believe me, I tried.

503
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,981
Thing is, I can't travel
back to that time.

504
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,734
- Why?
- He is blocking me.

505
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,446
He has given me three wishes as well.

506
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,449
Wow, you get around.

507
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,994
And then? Tell me what you wished for.

508
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:35,375
Well, my first wish was the ability to
offer wishes to send His creation to Hell.

509
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,295
My second wish was
to no longer be contained,

510
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,464
so that I might corrupt a new master.

511
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,050
That means you've got one final wish left.

512
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,512
I thought so too.

513
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:51,891
See…

514
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,020
I think the third wish

515
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,190

accompanying you in 1041?

Yes, I'll bear witness.

She was from the East. She was beautiful.

So I'm scared.

When I was falling, I was scared too.

536
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,524
Scared about who I'd never see again.
Grandma and Min-ji.

537

And you. The thought of never seeing
any of you again,

That's fear, isn't it?

692
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,187
[scoffs] Wow, she's tough.

693
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,400
Have you ever seen us two at any point
in the last couple 1,000 years?

694
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,485
I mean, just blink once to mean, "yes."

695
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,529
[grunts] Just a moment.

696
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,198
- [eyeball squelching]
- [Sade wails]

697
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,075
[Sade] Master, aren't you being harsh?

698
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,035
Your love shouldn't be allowed

699
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,829
- to cause pain to my love.
- Um, okay.

700
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,498
[Sade sobs] Irem! [cries]

701
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,543
[Sade] Open your socket wide,
we need to put this back in.

702
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,254
- I'll just toss a soft ball.
- [Sade] Hold on.

703
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:13,591
Did this Genie kiss Jinniya,
or did he not?

704
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,594
Was his mouth in the right spot to do so?

705
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,846
- That, I can answer.
- Irem is out due to her injuries.

706
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,807
You and I, one-on-one. Him on the line.

707
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:25,853
I have things to do.

708
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,273
[crashing, rumbling]

709
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,277
[Ka-young] Mmm. So you both pretend
to be busy as an excuse.

710
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,737
- [sobbing]
- [muffled] Wait!

711
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,033
- [hoots]
- Irem! Watch out for your wings!

712
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,035
You're a national treasure!

713
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,037
[Sade wails]

714
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,664
Irem!

715
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,878
We did learn that we've forgotten
our history together.

716
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,838
That's a win. [chuckles nervously]

717
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,551
I learned you kissed Jinniya.
I wouldn't call that a win.

718
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,305
I didn't say that.

719
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,932
[chiming]

720
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,477
[gasps]

721
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:07,936
Eom Sang-tae.

722
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,484
Will he really go to the past?

723
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,403
Even if he does, you won't know
any of the circumstances.

724
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,448
Sure you want to take part in this?

725
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,700
Absolutely.

726
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,373
Hmm. Although I should bring
the wooden bat I keep next to the closet.

727
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:31,168
I already know. I'm definitely
going to try to save the girl.

728
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,880
- This wish is important.
- I know. I'll lose again.

729
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,509
And I'm fated to die if I lose,
since it's tied to my first wish.

730
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:42,221
But I'll still do it. I can be selfless,
even though I was born evil.

731
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,264
Despite that, I can still do a good deed.

732
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:50,813
Besides, if we're meant to die,
let's make it a fun death.

733
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,316
Protect me as you always do.

734
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,860
If I should die,
then I should die for you.

735
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:01,365
And if you are meant to die, die for me.

736
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,163
Okay. I can do that.

737
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:10,999
Let's do that.

738
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,967
You want to go back
to before you killed her?

739
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,218
Isn't it obvious?

740
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,888
To get to experience that thrill again?
Why would I waste that chance?

741
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,934
But this time, I won't hit her
against my taillight or dye her hair.

742
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:33,480
They'll never link it to the case
20 years ago. [cackles]

743
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,942
This time around,

744
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,321
I'll just chop her up
into little teeny bits. [cackles]

745
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,782
Ah. That's your plan?

746
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,412
I should rework my approach
if that's how it is.

747
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,497
Do it! Put the effort in!

748
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,040
You're my genie, aren't you?

749
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:56,086
At night this time, p.m. 10 after 9:00.

750
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,881
April 10th. You better make it p.m.!

751
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,383
<i>In front of</i>
<i>the Gangma Waterfall sign. Got it?</i>

752
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,509
GANGMA FALLS, 500M

753
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,429
Absolutely.

754
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,140
It's been fulfilled.

755
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,183
[chiming]

756
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,478
[Pan-geum] What were your test scores?

757
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,855
APRIL 10, 2024

758
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:16,857
Phew.

759
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,777
- Your grandma is really angry.
- Why?

760
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,196
It was about…

761
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,782
you achieving so much.
Just don't do it again.

762
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,370
Also, I've arrived from your future.

763
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,332
You were dug out of a sand dune. Get lost.

764
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,459
It's true.

765
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,962
This is what your future self
asked me to give you.

766
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,882
Mmm?

767
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,598
WRITTEN BY KI KA-YOUNG
A NEGATIVE ONE AND A STONE…

768
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,101
[chuckles]

00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,443
EOM SANG-TAE IS THE MURDERER
HE WILL KILL AGAIN

DYEING HIS VICTIMS' HAIR BLACK

773
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:14,581
SHE WILL GO MISSING TONIGHT
(APRIL 10, 2024) AROUND 9 P.M.

774
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:16,959
[watch ticking]

775
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,546
I knew that asshole
would do something like that.

776
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,259
You were right.

777
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,594
You'll be too late.

778
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,224
Hold on to me.

779
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:35,769

Hmm? Hmm?

783
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,252
[Sang-tae] I've definitely
been here before.

784
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,717
April. Right.

785
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,844
[woman] Mr. Eom.

786
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,100
Huh? What?

787
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,477
- [woman pants]
- I remember now.

788
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,438
I'm so sorry.

789
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,941
My phone. I wasn't paying attention
when I left.

790
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,568
Your phone?

791
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,865
[chuckles nervously]

792
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,495
I had it all wrong.
[chuckles maliciously]

793
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,333
Yeah, that's right, your phone.

794
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,752
- It's over here. This way.
- Great.

795
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,755
You know…

00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,549
[sinister music plays]

797
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,386
I'm afraid I don't think
it's the right color, your hair.

798
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,639
[nervously] What?

799
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,435

803
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,071
- Where are you going?
- [woman whimpers]

804
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,697
Get over here, you fucking bitch!

805
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,033
- [bat clangs]

807
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,040
- [Sang-tae] Fuck.
- Oh, yikes.

808
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,542
He bought a chainsaw for this occasion.

809
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,379
I made sure to only send his soul back
to this night. [chuckles]

810
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,131
[Sang-tae groaning] Miss… Miss Ki.

811
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,592
[breathing heavily] What are you doing?

812
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,720
- It's not what it looks like.
- Oh, no?

813
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,348
- [groans]
- Ooh!

814

Don't you dare talk, you serial killer.

You bitch! Why are you doing this?

817
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,274
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- Just you wait.

818
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,778
- I'll kill you next.
- Oh, shut up. You can't stop me.

819
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,407
This is far too much fun!

820
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,783

00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,411

- Ooh! Ooh!

00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:00,247
- [Sang-tae groaning]
- Yikes. Oh, gosh. Not his heel!

823
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,166
Sir! Sir! Wait.
We need to call the police.

824
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,752
- Oh, God. Oh, no.
- They're coming already.

825
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,755
We go way back, you know. Oh!

826
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,467
- [Sang-tae groaning]
- [grunting]

827
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,179
- [yelps]
- Oh, that was a good one.

831
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,399
He tried to kill that woman.

832
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,193
He smashed her head
right against this taillight here.

833
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,195
You can see her hair stuck in it.

834
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,157
- [officer] Oh.
- And this woman here took her bat and…

835
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:37,909
Let's skip that part.

836
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,831
I have a feeling a YouTuber will uncover
a 20-year-old skeleton soon.

837
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:45,208
So I recommend you go through
that guy's house.

838
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,711
Especially, his cellar. Mmm-hmm.

839
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:53,008
How do you know about-- Who are you?
Were you that witness back then?

840
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,888
Oh, no, that wasn't me.
Sorry, but that was actually your mother.

841
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,682
Oh, right. You should also
look into his mother.

842
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,767
Right, right.

843
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:03,894
Huh?

844
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:09,983
[Iblis sighs]

845
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,986
Are the police normally this friendly?

846
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:15,071
They even gave me a coffee.

847
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,533
Do you cause a lot of trouble
in the future? Here.

848
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,746
[sighs] To think that asshole and I
have the same condition.

849
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,414
No.

850
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,959
You're different.
That guy is just a killer.

851
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,922
You're on my side? For real?

852
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,549
Have we gotten close in the future?

853
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,635
I guess you haven't killed me yet.

854
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,178
[woman] Excuse me.

855
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,266
Thank you so much. You saved me.

856
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,937
If not for you, I'd be dead.
You're the reason I'm alive.

857
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,524
- But I'm a psychopath, you know.
- Huh?

858
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,610
- Ah.
- [Iblis] Mmm.

859
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:57,364
Uh, then you're a psychopath
who saved my life.

860
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,951
Thank you. I'll be grateful
for the rest of my life.

861
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,578
Well, the cops need me to go back inside.

862
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,373
Thank you again. Thank you.

863
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:07,999
Thank you so much!

864
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,920
- [door opens]
- [Iblis chuckles]

865
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,548
- Wow. No one's ever thanked me.
- [door closes]

866
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,216
I've never heard that.

867
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,096
Wow. So no matter the day,

868
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,849
all sorts of fun things happen
when we're together.

869
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,725
Almost like the stars align.

870
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:31,565
- Stars?
- Stars. I mean, the most unusual things.

871
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,482
Oh!

872
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,569
Hey. [chuckles]

873
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,989
No, no. That's not what I meant.

874
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,115
One minute.

875
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,204
- [line connects, rings]
- Hey, Min-ji, it's Ka-young.

876
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,039
This guy almost killed a girl,

877
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,709
but now another guy is spouting off
about the stars.

878
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,628
- [Iblis chuckles]
- Yeah, he's not a human. That's right.

879
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,964
He's actually really not human.

880
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,926
- No. Right. You're right.
- [chuckles]

881
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,888
Right, this is how you were. [laughs]

882
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,557
[Ka-young] Hang on, I'm--
No, I'm not saying you're wrong.

883
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:07,893
Ki Ka-young.

884
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,771
I have to go now, to return to you.

885
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,482
[Ka-young] No. I'm not taking sides.

886
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,067
'Cause watching you like this,

887
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,570
I just miss you even more.

888
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,947
- [whooshes]
- Uh… [sighs]

889
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,202
[gasps]

890
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:28,872
Oh, no.

891
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,416
But it's not raining.

892
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:32,876
[sighs] Shit.

893
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:35,837
[grunts]

894
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,681
You acted like I was creepy,
and now you're asleep?

895
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,099
[Ka-young groans]

896
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,520
[chuckles]

897
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,692
[whooshes]

898
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:06,660
[sighs]

899
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,707
You still fall for tricks like this?

900
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,085
Well, you know… [sighs]

901
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,712
I wasn't trying to, that is--

902
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,925
[gentle music plays]

903
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,436
I swear to you.

904
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,857
[Zahara] <i>During all of your lost years,</i>
<i>the immortal flower lived on.</i>

905
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,026
I'll remember.

906
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,363
What?

907
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:45,907
You.

908
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,201
Inside the lamp,

909
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,997
<i>of all the phrases you traced over,</i>

910
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,624
the one most often repeated…

911
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,970
is <i>habibti.</i> That's it.

912
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,890
And that means what?

913
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,812
My true love.

914
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,032
[music continues]

915
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,647
[music continues]

916
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,230
[upbeat music plays]

917
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:24,978
[music ends]
