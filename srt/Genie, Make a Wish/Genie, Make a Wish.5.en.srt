2
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,982
GENIE, MAKE A WISH

3
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,403
- So, what are you saying?
- There's something I do want.

4
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,697
I've thought of something
I don't want taken away.

5
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,907
Grandma.

6
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,492
Huh?

7
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,993
Pan-geum?

8
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,455
- I am ready to make my second wish.
- Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

9
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,166
Just think about it carefully.

10
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,795
Think long and hard about this calmly.

11
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,964
Are you really willing
to give up your soul for this?

12
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:37,889
I want Grandma young.
So make Pan-geum my exact age.

13
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,519
That's it. This will be the second wish.

14
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,898
- [scoffs]
- But not immediately.

15
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:47,982
Tomorrow's the wake.

16
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,904
Fulfill it in… three days, precisely.

17
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,950
You're scheduling your wish?

18
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,747
- Hawaii?
- [Ka-young] Mm.

19
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,459
Yes, we are going to Hawaii.
Some fresh air. We fly in three days.

20
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,045
- Monday.
- On Monday? But there's so much to do--

21
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,798
It's all been planned.
All you have to do is join me.

22
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,135
I bought the tickets already.
Non-refundable.

23
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,138
Already? Oh, wow. Oh, well, in that case…

24
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,266
In that case,
we can't let these go to waste.

25
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,018
We have to go, of course we do.

26
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:28,064
My goodness. Ka-young, am I dreaming?

27
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,567
Go brag about it
to the other grandmothers. Okay?

28
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,610
Tell everybody, all right?

29
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,487
All right.

30
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,074
- [Heung-rye] Hawaii?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,370
I told her it wasn't worth the bother,
but dear Ka-young insisted on a vacation

32
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,998
and booked the flights just like that!
Non-refundable.

33
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,209
- So, I have to go.
- How rich is she?

34
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,211
Working like that on cars?

35
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,132
- I guess she saved everything she could.
- [laughs]

36
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,802
You must be getting your good karma
in one fell swoop. I'm so jealous.

37
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,513
When do you leave?
Take some kimchi with you.

38
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,557
- I've heard the food is heavy.
- On Monday.

39
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,477
Oh, you know, I'm heading
to the market today to get what I need.

40
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,396
Does anyone want me to pick up anything?

41
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,650
She's heading to Seoul tonight. You didn't
forget we're seeing the doctor, did you?

42
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,112
The only trips you book for me
are appointments with that damn doctor.

43
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,740
Why don't you ever
book a flight to Hawaii?

44
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:22,035
[Da-jin] My goodness. [claps]
All right, everyone, class has begun.

45
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,746
Let's start with a nice, big stretch.

46
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,830
Up!

48
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,626

- Oh, my right.

49
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,170
Oh. Manager Kang.

[line ringing]

51
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,173
Manager Kang, hello.

52
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,426
It appears Ka-young
is taking Pan-geum to Hawaii.

53
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,888
She's had a hard time,
but I'm glad she gets a vacation.

54
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,016
If you want a vacation,
you could see if your son will take you.

55
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,978
[chuckles] Oh, no. I couldn't, no.

56
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,482
- Can't have him splurge on little ol' me.

- [line rings]

58
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:58,488
I'll have your sister-in-law do
the ancestral rites, so don't you worry.

59
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,823
- [line ringing]
- All right.

60
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:05,745
I won't be able to attend anyway.
I'm supposed to go to Seoul for Jeong-hwa.

61
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,330
What?

62
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,457
Why, is everything all right?

[Jeong-hwa] <i>I'm at the prep academy.</i>
<i>Where else would I be?</i>

66
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,762
Well, I'm at your place right now.
You thought I'd never swing by here?

67
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,139
- Ugh.
<i>- I swear, I am ending your lease!</i>

68
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,433
Is this why you never wanted me here?

69
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,771
[shouts] Do you know what the hell
I just found in your trash?

70
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,816
You're pissing me off! Who gave you
permission to snoop through my stuff?

71
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,442
[scoffs] Permission?

72
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,278
Do you even go to class?

73
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,863
<i>Right. Well,</i>
<i>I was gonna tell you anyway.</i>

<i>exam. I'm not gonna go to college.</i>

Oh, you're just not going?

76
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,248
[scoffs] Tell me how you're gonna
make it in life without college?

77
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,041
Tell me how.

78
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,085
Tell me how you'll manage,
help me understand!

79
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,087
I can still have a good life
without school!

80
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,757
Do you even know the privileges you enjoy?

00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,028
I'm surprised so much occurred
in such a small town.

175
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,407
[grunts]

176
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,869
[Ejllael exhales]

177
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,414
Am I mistaken or have you
been exercising more lately?

178
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,208
I might be deploying my wings more
in the coming days. [pants]

179
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,378
My clothes keep tearing.

180
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,631
So, you're just not gonna wear anything?

181
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:35,009
Manufacturing one piece of clothing
uses 7,000 liters of water.

182
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,511
So you plan to just fly naked.

183
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,222
[sighs] Focus. Anything to report?

184
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,392
Ms. Ki Ka-young has made another wish.

185
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,395
And it is indeed a noble one.
Congratulations.

186
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,690
You know a noble wish
doesn't guarantee noble results.

187
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,692
We need to stay vigilant.

188
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,779
And Iblis, where is he?

189
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,324
[Iblis] So what?
She made her grandma young.

190
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,160
What about it?
That count as righteous? [scoffs]

191
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,204
[sighs nervously]

192
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,375
Whatever. Don't get obsessed
by such minor details.

193
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,002
That market employee,
her first wish was wicked.

194
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,714
Yeah. You're doing great.

195
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,802
But why do you insist
on sitting like this?

196
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,969
[groans] My back.

197
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,516
[groaning]

198
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,856
[tense music plays]

199
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,859
When did I give you permission
to just waltz in here?

200
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,529
Did I give you permission
to show up at my building?

201
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,367
So Irem chirped away again. Hey.

202
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,496
I imagine you're all excited about
Ki Ka-young making a righteous wish.

203
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,290
But her first wish was still enough
for me to slit her throat.

204
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,708
[scoffs] Blah, blah, blah.

205
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,294
So, being that was born on Wednesday,
would you kindly let me

206
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,713
continue my internal contemplations
and get the hell out?

207
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,049
[laughs] Contemplations?

208
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,302
Looked like panic to me, wouldn't you say,
Satan, born on Thursday?

209
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,848
Huh? You think I… [laughing]

210
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,226
Oh, if you were to analyze the faces
of the other two wishers,

211
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,646
oh, it's so amazing.
They're all but guaranteed to be damned.

212
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:14,817
Oh, and the dog?
Ooh, yeah, it's in the bag. Sorry, bro.

213
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,111
Didn't I warn you
to stop disrupting the human world?

214
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,155
A dog turns into a man
and you think that's that?

215
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,449
- Meh, meh, meh, meh…
- An old lady becomes young again.

216
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,577
What about everyone's memories, huh?
Giving them gold? How's that gonna work?

217
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,122
You can't walk into a bank with massive
bags of gold without getting flagged!

218
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,874
Your methods? They're really outdated.

219
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,002
Face it.
You no longer have a purpose here.

220
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,921
Well, even so, that's mean.

221
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,841
You're just gassing.

222
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,509
"Gaslighting."

223
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,427
Oh.

224
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,679
Sade, you idiot!

225
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,267
And what if I can prove to you
I've got value?

226
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,187
- [sighs]
- [man] Genie! Genie!

227
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,607
Where are you? Mr. Genie, sir?

228
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,066
Do your best to prove it, then.

229
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,903
Everyone's gonna want you now.

230
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,697
You better not disturb me
in my lamp again.

231
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,783
Okay, I'm coming, dog!

232
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,035
Where are you?

233
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,578
[whooshing]

234
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:14,084
Can you help me? I only know dog things.
[breathing shakily]

235
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,631
I look like a human, you know?
But what can I do?

236
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,009
Nothing. I'm hopeless.

237
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,511
Help me.

238
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:27,056
So, your second wish
is the same as your first wish?

239
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,391
What's with the speech? [laughs]

240
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,351
Is it a shtick?

241
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,061
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

242
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,939
No, no, my father was
a show dog. High class.

243
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,193
But I can't do anything
without, uh, money, uh, picture ID.

244
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,738
- Money. A picture ID. I need them.
- [sighs]

245
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,535

- I know how hard it is, buddy.

- [sniffing]
- I also find it bewildering.

249
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,171
Okay. Better idea.

250
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,216
You'll be so powerful,
you don't even need an ID.

251
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,886
Huh? What… What kind of person is that?

252
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,596
A person who simply…

253
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,225
hires others to carry ID for him.

I'm going to relay some rules
that you must follow no matter what.

347
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,124
First, do not answer this phone ever.

348
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,752
Come on! I'm not an idiot.
My voice is as light as a bird.

349
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,380
Of course I won't.
I'll use this new phone. What else?

350
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,257
- Uh, hey, guys--
- Second.

351
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,427
- If someone asks why you've come here?
- I'm just here to try out country life.

352
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,720
Third rule. Origin?

353
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,598
Hadong?

354
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,976
- Hey, so, Ka-young?
- Hadong is also a country province, so no.

355
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,811
You're from Cheongdam-dong, Seoul.

356
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,565
- Your name is--
- Ooh, I already know. Lee Mi-ju. Nice, no?

357
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,484
Great. And then, from now on,
you talk modern.

358
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,446
This stays between him, you and me.

359
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,158
So stick to the rules
and don't get caught. Can you do that?

360
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,744
Really. I'm not a moron.

361
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,912
When I was young…

362
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,664
Actually, I'm young now.

363
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:12,044
Hey, so, uh, just wondering
what we're having for dinner tonight.

364
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,254
Stop thinking about food.
You don't even need to eat!

365
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,341
- Grandma, can you speak young?
- Pshh.

366
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,930
[gasps] Oh, my goodness!
I get so startled every time he does that.

367
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,019
I mean, I am for real bugging at that guy.

368
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,731
Anyway, when I was young,
I was cool and ambitious.

369
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,777
Is a salon mandatory
when applying for the Miss Korea?

370
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,446
You'd be cut because you don't have
the right eyelids.

371
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,366
Look, just go to the salon,
try something new.

372
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,202
What if I got
some plastic surgery? [gasps]

373
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,579
Why is she so stingy?

374
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,873
I don't even eat that much. Pshh.

375
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,333
[scoffs]

376
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,670
Wow, this young man sure is early.

377
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,464
Seems like a strong one too.
He'll for sure get picked.

378
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,757
- Yeah, move over.
- Scooch.

379
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,842
- Great. Thank you.
- Oh, hey.

380
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,010
- Oh, hey.
- Shove down.

381
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,054
[man] Here, here. Yeah, that's it.

382
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,515
- Uh, wait--
- Scooch down, a little more.

383
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,599
Don't fall off the edge.

384
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,853
All right, everyone. I need 15 people
to work the cabbage patch today.

385
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,022
[men] Me! Me! Me!

386
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,525
What the…
You don't like this bench either?

387
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,860
- [man] Me! Me! Me!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

388
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,571
I don't like this bench either. Hey!

389
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,949
I agree, this bench isn't big enough.

390
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,828
[workers grunting]

391
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,301
[energetic music playing]

392
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,553
[Iblis grunting]

393
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,390
[man] Come on, lunch time!

394
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,059
[indistinct chatter]

395
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,566
Mm. Scrumptious.

396
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,782
You dined and dashed? Huh?

397
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,578
Huh, my goodness.
Thanks to you, we're almost done.

398
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,496
[chuckles] Here.

399
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,042
- Oh, what's…
- It's your pay for today.

400
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,503
- I get money?
- Huh. [chuckles]

401
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,839
- Oh, my.
- Wow.

402
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,093
[comical music plays]

403
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,470
Oh, you're here too?

404
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,387
Sit, sit.

405
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,474
- Yeah, scoot over. Yeah.
- Oh.

406
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,852
- Hi.
- [man] You're back again?

407
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,145
Hi, Mr. Kim. [chuckles]

408
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,568
- [tires screech]
- [crashing]

409
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,694
[thudding]

410
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,078
[breathing laboriously]

411
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,341
[Sang-tae] What is this?

412
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,094
[lamp thuds]

413
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,472
[deer breathing laboriously]

414
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,519
How fucking annoying. Ugh.

415
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,106
You should have just died.

416
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,818
- [wind gusting]
- [groans]

417
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,034
What-- Who are you? Where did you--

418
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,458
- You saw me?
- Yes, I saw everything.

419
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,960
And it's totally irrelevant.

420
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,921
I'm a genie of the lamp.
I shall grant you three wishes.

421
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,257
No bringing back the dead.
No traveling to the future.

422
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,051
Anything other than that,
your wish is my command.

423
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,054
Um, sir, are you drunk?

424
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,265
Just continue on your merry way.

425
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,976
I'm only letting you live
because you're a guy.

426
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,397
You can see my form? Damn!
I came as myself, I was distracted.

427
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,817
I would've been picked first for the
cabbage patch, so hurry and make a wish.

428
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,610
What the fuck? [chuckles]

429
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,488
This imbecile out at the crack
of dawn, what gives?

430
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,240
So you're a genie?

431
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,326
Then bring this thing back to life.

432
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,830
I'm pleased with your efficiency.

433
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,457
I can heal it because it's still alive.
[grunts softly]

434
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,543
[energy humming]

435
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,842
[deer grunts]

436
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,761
- [gasps]
- There it goes.

437
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,805
Do you need to think
about your second wish

438
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,599
or shall we push ahead?

439
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,476
Ah, shit! Fuck!

440
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,440
This is real? That's seriously twisted!

441
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,776
[panting] Why didn't you tell me
it was real, you bastard?

442
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,614
I just used a wish on nothing,
motherfucker!

443
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,407
[grunts, pants]

444
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,952
- [engine revs]
- [tires screech]

445
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,038
[yelps, gasping]

446
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,546
Why, you little!

447
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:12,052
I'm your master, right? I control you!
You can't do this shit!

448
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,471
Oh, yeah? Says who? That's just a myth.

449
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,641
I grant your wishes,
but I can also be quite awful.

450
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,437
Like this.

451
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,023
[groaning]

452
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,279
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second.
Let's just hold on here.

453
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,324
That means I got two wishes remaining.

454
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,250
Huh?

455
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,921
Why is the lamp not there? Where is it?

456
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:51,424
Only when you know your greatest desire
will the lamp appear.

457
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,678
Give it careful consideration
before next time.

458
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,264
You're just a lump of clay,
so you'll never control me.

459
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,977
Oh, this? Next time,
my face will be different.

460
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,063
So don't waste energy memorizing it.

461
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,148
[laughs]

462
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,485
[panting]

463
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:17,909
Son of a bitch! [panting]

464
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,120
[Da-jin] <i>Good morning,</i>
<i>everyone.</i>

465
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:23,206
It's a gorgeous day,
so we're going to plant lettuce heads.

466
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,876
I'm sure there are a lot of you
that have insomnia, huh? I do too.

467
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,504
So I decided to wake up
and plant these to… [snarls playfully]

468
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,589
eat 'em up so I can sleep better.

469
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:36,594
All right. So, baby lettuce needs
to be planted 20 centimeters apart.

470
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,430
We'll plant one right here…

471
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,766
and another one over here. Like that.

472
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,393
And here.

473
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,479
Uh…

474
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,481
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT!

475
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,191
I think I'm going to sign off now.

476
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,403
- I'll do another live when the crops grow.
- Huh? Hey.

477
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,321
Hey, hold on.

478
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:55,905
[sighs]

479
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,908
What happened?
We were getting so much traffic.

480
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,202
- You zoomed in again.
- Huh?

481
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,457
Oh, um, well, you leaned over,
so… [chuckles]

482
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,543
- What? You bastard!
- [grunts, groans]

483
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,546
Here's my left cheek.

484
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,801
Ugh, they say sex sells! Mm.

485
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,929
Ugh, you son of a bitch!

486
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,973
- I'm gonna kill you for that!
- Ow! Wait! No! Stop!

487
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,016
[upbeat music playing]

488
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,186
[Sade] So, I looked into it.
You know the sleazy guy?

489
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:31,441
Turns out, she and him met at this
top university, the famous science one.

490
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,276
Really? They met how?

491
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,862
[sighs, pants]

492
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,989
A club for waltzing.

493
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:39,824
What?

494
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,452
Waltzing?

495
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,663
[classical waltz music playing]

496
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,926
I will say, I never thought of you
as someone who waltzed.

497
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,302
I didn't before.

498
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,514
I was told my a friend
to try breaking down dance moves

499
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,057
instead of breaking down skulls.

500
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,185
[laughs]

501
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,187
Wow, you really are bizarre.

502
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,732
By the way, I saw you turned down
that scholarship.

503
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,360
And because of you,
I get to study overseas.

504
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,196
The Arab League, doing research.
I'm grateful.

505
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,242
Don't mention it. I've got money,
so I can always pay my own way if I do go.

506
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,162
Didn't you say you're from a village
in Chungcheong-do?

507
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,956
Our chilies are growing well lately.

508
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,003
Gosh, you're so… [laughing]

509
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,427
[music continues]

510
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,055
[slows to a stop]

511
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,765
- Whatever.
- I know, right?

512
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,100
- [man] Buddy!
- Jun-u!

513
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,435
- Whoa!
- Oh, man.

514
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,187
- [groaning in pain]
- You okay?

515
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,106
- What'd you trip on? You okay?
- What is it?

516
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,983
- What's wrong?
- It's true.

517
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,445
- You did fall in a very strange way.
- What's gotten into you?

518
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,197
[gasps]

519
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,992
Is your face okay? Or was it
already like that before you fell?

520
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,118
What's up with this bast--

521
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,121
Oh, you're hurt. Don't bother trying
to answer your buddies.

522
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,416
Man, is that painful?
Do you think it's broken?

523
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,835
- [bones crackle, snap]
- [Jun-u groaning]

524
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,921
[classical waltz music playing]

525
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,061
[knock on door]

526
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,648
Guests outside.

527
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,781
[Chang-sik] Mm. Mm.

528
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,411
[Jong-heon] What is up
with this creepy house?

529
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,289
You gonna talk to all of them?

530
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,210
You know, it doesn't really seem like
a typical household.

531
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,003
- Mm?
- Mm. Don't be cowards.

532
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,130
- It's fine.
- [gasps]

533
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,381
- You chicken?
- Mm.

534
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,427
Well, what a ludicrously large family.
Are you all brothers?

535
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,679
Dad was very busy, eh?

536
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,349
- Anyway, can I speak to him?
- What can I do for you?

537
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,311
Ah. Sorry we didn't say hello sooner.

538
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,814
In any case, uh,
I'm the village chief of Cheongpung--

539
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,524
I said, what can I do for you?

540
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,150
[unsettling music plays]

541
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:23,488
Oh. Well, we heard you moved in,
but we hadn't heard from you yet.

542
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,865
You've to complete
the new resident intake,

543
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,700
but we didn't know
your family was so large.

544
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,327
I don't think we have enough forms.

545
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,621
Local news is broadcast
on the Band channel,

546
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,623
so make sure to subscribe to it, yeah?

547
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,626
Put your info in.

548
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,923
Goodness, I forgot.
I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached.

549
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,342
- Your name is?
- It's Jung Jun-u. Hey.

550
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,594
Put your contact info in here.

551
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,806
[unsettling music continues]

552
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,521
Oh, we still have other things to go over.

553
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,319
[gasps]

554
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,990
Damn, what the hell?

555
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,543
- What's up?
- I'm protecting Grandma.

556
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,172
Everything rides on this staying secret.
Check if the signal is coming through.

557
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,591
That your final wish?

558
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,010
If you're not going to help me, screw off.

559
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,303
Oh!

560
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,179
That your final wish?

561
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,058
Why're you going on about wishes again?

562
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,229
I grew up beautiful. Without scars either.

563
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,902
Isn't that what you said to me
when I was eight?

564
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,071
Ever heard of white lies?

565
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,366
All lies are bad.
They rob you of an opportunity to grow.

566
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,704
Oh! Is that why you're installing
spy cameras in the middle of the night?

567
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,623
Because you're so honest? Ha!

568
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,427
[both panting]

569
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,812
Hey. You stopped barking, huh?

570
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,362
[Mi-ju grunts] I know I buried it here.
Where is it?

571
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,614
[pants, grunts]

572
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,032
Come on, darn it!

573
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,576
[Ka-young] Hmm.

574
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,620
- There's no money there.
- [gasping]

575
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,205
Hasn't been for a decade.

576
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,332
Don't sneak around like that.

577
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,917
I nearly had a heart attack.

578
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,711
Your heart's too young now
to have a heart attack.

579
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,339
I dug up all the cash you buried,
gave it away.

580
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,052
But you… you… How did you know about it?

581
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,262
Wait, wait. It's all gone?

582
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,683
- Just the principal.
- Just the principal?

583
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,937
[gasping]

584
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:06,150
So, you're saying there's more.
Hand it over. We'll share the profit.

585
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,487
Grandparents are usually paid
for childcare these days, hmm?

586
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,407
I've made… too much to share.

587
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,494
- I've earned a fortune in stocks.
- Stocks?

588
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,540
That document you had me sign?

589
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,460
[Min-ji] I mean, what high schooler
thinks to do such aggressive investing?

590
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:30,174
[sighs] I saw all those stocks
you bought skyrocketing

591
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,301
and thought you were possessed
or whatever.

592
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,595
But, hey, then you paid
for my college tuition.

593
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,889
My mom thought you were amazing.

594
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,935
You made her wishes comes true.
You were like a god to her.

595
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,856
So incredible. I'm finally getting out
of this town! I can't wait!

596
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:45,940
You still eating?

597
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,485
Well, yeah. The food just came out,
so I'm still eating.

598
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,989
Uh, what are you looking at?

599
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,907
- Something going on?
- I need to get home now.

600
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,119
Why? Is it because of that jerk?

601
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,372
I told you not to get too serious
with some asshole you don't even know.

602
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,876
Hey. You still here?

603
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,296
Weren't you going to Hawaii
with your grandma? Are you still going?

604
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:13,509
Uh, I decided I was too busy to go,
but Grandma still went.

605
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:17,847
Uh, she wanted to try out her new
swimsuit, so we decided she'd go alone.

606
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,600
Alone? Oh. Hmm.

607
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,061
Why is it so hard then
to get her on the phone?

608
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,104
The flight is really long,

609
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,149
and she didn't wanna set up
international calling on her phone.

610
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,860
Your grandma is on her way
to Hawaii? Alone?

611
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,155
My goodness! You are always so selfish!

612
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,407
Why not give your spot to someone, huh?

613
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,703
You could have given your ticket to me.
Did it just go to waste? [tutting]

614
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,081
Hey, have my order boxed up to go.

615
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,917
This one is incapable
of ever thinking of others.

616
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,877
You need to watch your reputation.

617
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,380
Oh, a box to go.
I'll get the rest of this to go too.

618
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,675
- I'm gonna eat my meal at home.
- You're going?

619
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,761
But I'm still eating!

620
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,222

[scooter approaching]

623
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,521
- Move, move, move, move!
- [Min-ji] Watch out!

624
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,774
[Mi-ju gasping]

625
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,151
[intriguing music playing]

626
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,491
Hey, you brat!
You almost ran over this woman!

627
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,867
I saw your face!

628
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,202
[chuckles]

629
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,331
- You all right?
- Oh, thank you!

630
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,000
My darling Min-ji saved me!

631
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,585
[gasps, sighs]

632
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,713
Just wow.

633
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,299
- We know each other?
- Uh…

634
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:41,180
You own the dental clinic over there!
Of course I've heard of you!

635
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,016
Oh. Uh, Lee Mi-ju.

636
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,602
I've come to live in the country
for a spell.

637
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,064
Everyone said to visit Smile Dental Clinic
if I ended up in Cheongpung village.

638
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,024
I was wondering when to visit. [chuckles]

639
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,818
Is that so? [chuckles]

640
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,653
Well, please do come, whenever.

641
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,448
But I gotta say, there's not a lot
to fix. Your smile's great.

642
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:03,494
[gasps] Oh, my goodness,
my teeth got younger too!

643
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,164
Oh, you're from Gyeongsang-do, aren't you?

644
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,166
When did you move? Where are you staying?

645
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,585
Oh, well, I…

646
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:16,340
[chuckles] Well, we're bound
to cross paths like this again.

647
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,842
If fate allows it.

648
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,927
[laughs] Yeah, okay.

649
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,472
Oh, if you're thinking
of getting a new hairdo,

650
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,058
you have a great jaw,
keep the volume.

651
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,103
Don't cut it. Just get a blowout
if you want more character.

652
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,442
Oh. Oh.

653
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,613
[sighs in relief]

654
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,492
A hairdo?
In what world could I pay for that?

655
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,621
I can just straighten
my hair myself at home. [scoffs]

656
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,999
But you only live once.

657
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,752
[bell jingles]

658
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,135
I heard you have something to share.

659
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,720
Oh, nothing major.

660
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,514
You went to school
with that Ki Ka-young?

661
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,726
We weren't really close.

662
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,480
- [girl] What's for lunch today?
- [indistinct chatter]

663
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,107
[manager] <i>You may</i>
<i>not have been close,</i>

664
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,193
but you weren't strangers, right?

665
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,571
Do I have to spell it out for you?

666
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,865
Can't I just trust you
to take charge of anything?

667
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,202
All right, look. You know how we launched
a new pension product?

668
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,414
The only VIP we have who has the means
to quality for that pension product

669
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,499
is Miss Ki Ka-young.

670
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,503
You could go and see her
and do some, you know… Hmm?

671
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,089
Come on, be proactive, spearhead this!

672
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,091
I'll need time to think about it.

673
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,677
[slaps table] Jeez,
why waste time thinking about it?

674
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,638
I've already done all the thinking,
you just need to do it.

675
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,476
Figure out your strategy
over the weekend, all right? Hmm?

676
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,770
[clears throat]

00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,175
[huffs] What's this?

684
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,515
Who the hell makes tea
and doesn't even clean the kettle?

685
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,019
[chiming]

686
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,479
[yelping]

687
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,151
What the… [coughing] Is this asbestos?

688
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,486
[coughing]

689
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,406
[magical music playing]

690
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,332
[echoing] I am a genie of the lamp.

691
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,668
I shall grant you three wishes. Make them.

692
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,006
No reanimating the dead.
And no going to the future.

693
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,342
- Otherwise--
- A genie?

694
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:05,968
Mm?

695
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,348
- Um, I'm not quite done explaining.
- [chuckles]

696
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,059
- [laughing]
- Mm?

697
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:16,187
[Bo-gyeong laughing excitedly]

698
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,025
I am special! I knew it!

699
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,028
I knew a day like this would come
if I just held on!

700
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,199
- It normally takes a lot longer than this.
- I know my first wish!

701
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,283
Uh, my first wish…

702
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,745
There's a girl called Ki Ka-young.
She runs a garage.

703
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,955
[tense music builds]

704
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,958
Go on.

705
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,045
GU BO-GYEONG
JUNE 20, 2024

706
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,464
MADE HER FIRST WISH

707
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,592
Okay. Tell me what her first wish was.

708
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,179
Hurry up. I need to go demand a refund.

709
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,599
- Can't you see I'm in my refund outfit?
- "Refund outfit"?

710
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,685
I bought an eight-piece tool set,
and the fourth tool isn't there.

711
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,104
The fourth is my favorite.

712
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,022
Unacceptable.

713
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,985
Wouldn't blood red be nice
on a white outfit?

714
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,487
So hurry up already.

715
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,906
Tell me what Gu Bo-gyeong's wish was.

716
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:15,413
I want you to transfer every cent
Ki Ka-young has in her account over to me.

717
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,041
So you want lots of money
like Ki Ka-young has.

718
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,376
No, no.

719
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,255
I want her wealth, all of it.
Her money. Now!

720
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,258
I want what she has.

721
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,093
Huh.

722
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,053
Ah.

723
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,682
You want to bring her misfortune.

724
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,560
Hmm.

725
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,186
[inhales sharply]

726
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,897
What to do?

727
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,276
[energy hums]

728
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,867
It is done.

729
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,660
It-- It is?

730
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:56,829
[cell phone chimes]

731
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,541
DEPOSIT, KI KA-YOUNG
10,000,000 WON

732
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,835
[gasps, sobs in delight]

733
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,505
[squeals]

734
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,257
What would you like for your next wish?

735
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,217
Oh, oh, just a minute, just a minute.

736
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,387
I don't need to make
my next wish right away, do I?

737
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,307
[chuckles] Right now…

738
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,395
I would just like to indulge
in my new wealth.

739
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,821
[Iblis] Ki Ka-young,
who said all humans are kind,

740
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,448
has appeared in someone else's wish.

741
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,949
You sure about humans?

742
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,827
It is quite infuriating
that she went in that direction.

743
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,663
Still, you did win that one.

744
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,835
Kang Im-seon, Eom Sang-tae, Gu Bo-gyeong.

745
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,048
I will say, it's looking quite likely
that I'll be winning this bet.

746
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,759
WANTED EVERYTHING
IN KI KA-YOUNG'S ACCOUNT, EVERY LAST CENT

747
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:53,969
All right.

748
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,433
It does indeed look that way.

749
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:03,646
So don't move.

750
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,528
[gentle music plays]

751
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,445
Uh…

752
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,948
What are you doing?

753
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,619
You asked to be treated with care.
This is showing you care.

754
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,037
I can't do this if I lose.

755
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,127
Oh, my dear spirit of the lamp is warm.

756
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,422
Sweet little Satan is so brave.

757
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,718
My dear Iblis is so warm.

758
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,518
[energy chiming]

759
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,442
[gentle music continues]

760
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,371
Say, I've been wondering.

761
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,959
How come the hourglass doesn't flow?
How can you even tell time?

762
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,336
Because it's an urn, not a clock.

763
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,839
That's you in there.

764
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,717
I took a handful of you.

765
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,468
An urn?

766
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,387
[Iblis grunts]

767
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,312
[Ka-young sighs]

768
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,356
Never knew an urn
could be this scaled down.

769
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,274
[stomps]

770
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,027
I can't even get my coffin
any smaller than a mailbox.

771
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,696
Hey, we were so cozy just now.

772
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,449
Why you freezing me out like that?

773
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,248
[Ka-young] Did you hold
ancestral rites for me?

774
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,335
- [energy humming]
- [suspenseful music plays]

775
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,924
- [rapid ticking]
- Huh?

776
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,635
[music intensifies]

777
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,305
[gasps]

778
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,977
[indistinct shouting]

779
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,938
- Cast the Goryeo bitch aside too!
- Please.

780
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,568
[laughing]

781
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,906
[gasps]

782
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,452
What's wong?

783
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,456
I've dreamt of that girl.
She is me after all.

784
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,752
I've seen this place in my dreams too.

785
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,672
It's a bit different.

786
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,467
Yes, but still. [gasps]

787
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,011
I was laughing here.

788
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,805
Uh, what?

789
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,350
I've never had you here,
not once in any of your past lives.

790
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,186
It could be the future.

791
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,813
But I'm sure of it.

792
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,524
I was laughing, like…

793
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,362
In that creepy way?

794
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,411
Hey, where did you hide my toolbox?

795
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,337
Should've gone to a service center.

796
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,590
If I notice any issues,
I'm going to have to order the parts in,

797
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,925
so it'll be a while.

798
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,261
That's okay. Just do a standard once-over.

799
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,264
Wait here a sec,
I'm gonna dash to the bank real quick.

800
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,278
Stop watching me.
I don't like people staring.

801
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,697
[spray hisses]

802
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,705
Is it okay for an adult
to be so blunt to a child?

803
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,498
Think you're special 'cause you're young?

804
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,253
- Go sit over there and read.
- I've already finished my book.

805
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,212
HISTORY OF GORYEO

806
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,715
During the Goryeo dynasty,
they referred to Arabia as Saracen

807
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,258
and had prominent trade routes.

808
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,510
But the trade stopped after the year 1040.

809
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,472
They didn't say why.
I guess the path was blocked?

810
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,973
Well, I didn't do it.

811
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,184
You know "Double Flower Shop"?
That old song?

812
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:14,313
I heard some say that the "father" they
sing about is really an Arabian merchant,

813
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,356
who went all the way
to Goryeo from Arabia.

814
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,860
Surely there are merchants who went
to Arabia from Goryeo, don't you think?

815
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,029
Go ask the Internet about this,
not a repair shop.

816
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,113
[footsteps]

817
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,823
Oh, what now?

818
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,911
- Hey, apprentice!
- [panting]

819
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,955
- You rang, Ms. Ki?
- Watch the shop, okay?

820
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,082
Did she have to steal my favorite heels?

821
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,297
[suspenseful music plays]

822
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,723
[grunts] Wait.

823
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,226
[pants]

824
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,151
[pop music playing over speakers]

825
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,196
[exhales]

826
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,198
[Mi-ju] Mm, let's see.

827
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,411
Goodness, how does this work?

828
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,832
- Oh.
- You definitely should try this one.

829
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,127
So we meet again. Like fate.

830
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,755
[chuckles] This town is so small.

831
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,715
Please, you first.

832
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,385
Oh, so you're not getting coffee?

833
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,761
You never used a kiosk before?

834
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,346
Ah, well, uh…

835
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,682
Ah, someone always took care
of that for you.

836
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,850
What kind of guys did that?

837
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,479
- [giggles]
- This coffee is better with an extra shot.

838
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:39,731
[giggles]

839
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,775
You laugh a lot.

840
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,071
I'm grateful. And you're so sweet.

841
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,156
That's a pretty bold thing to throw out.

842
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,867
Did you get a blowout? Pretty.

843
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,787
Oh, this blowout isn't pretty.

844
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,872
It's-- Ah!

845
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,042
Ooh, I know. It's 'cause my clothes
are doing all the work. [chuckles]

846
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,127
Your clothes?

847
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:01,962
No.

848
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,133
Huh? [laughing]

849
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,179
- [chuckles]
- Oh, goodness.

850
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,348
[Iblis] Whatcha doing?

851
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,810
[Ka-young] Monitoring Grandma.

852
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,437
I see her smiling.

853
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,563
Look.

854
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,398
Real happiness.

855
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:23,483
Why?

856
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,445
She was her own person in her youth.

857
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,113
[laughing]

858
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:29,823
Shit.

859
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,160
Why doesn't she live with her, then? Huh?

860
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,120
[Ka-young scoffs]

861
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:37,080
[Iblis] Uh, by the way…

862
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,792
When you showed me care the other day…

863
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,420
so what are the rules with that?

864
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:48,884
Is it the time, or the location,
or the day, or the outfit?

865
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,012
[sighs] Is that really
what you're thinking about?

866
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,598
I feel like trash, so stop talking to me.

867
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,438
[scoffs]

868
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,741
[groans] I can't do it right! Ahh!

869
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:17,996
This isn't cool!

870
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,833
[whines] Iblis!

871
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,086

[Iblis groans]

873
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,551
- [Iblis] Why is nothing coming out?
- [whooshing]

874
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,808
[sighs] Come with me.

875
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,310
[Iblis] Whoa!

876
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,228
[grunts]

877
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,981
[rousing music playing]

878
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:57,619
You, you emptied out everything
in my safe,

879
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:01,248
and gave all that money
to that dirty mutt.

880
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,709
Just being practical.

881
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,796
It was the only money
that wouldn't get him flagged.

882
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,298
Oh, and he's not a mutt.

883
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:15,387
His father was a show dog
with a British pedigree. [laughs]

884
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,514
[sighs]

885
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,902
[sighs] Why did you carve out the eyes?

886
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:34,406
Oh… Well, that was
the original painting, right?

887
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,783
The original? [yells] The original?

888
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,119
You damn well know it wasn't!

889
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,874
[sighs] I'm at my wit's end.

Oh, dear.

[laughing]

895
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:03,602
[mockingly] Oh.

00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,179
- [strains]
- [Iblis] Game over.

900
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:43,517
Ten, nine… [laughs]

901
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,896
Iblis! [grunts]

902
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,494
[laughing]

903
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,059
Please.

904
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,728
[Ka-young] <i>Please, what? A sword?</i>

905
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,522
- Please.
<i>- A sickle?</i>

906
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,315
- Please.
<i>- An ax?</i>

907
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,358
Please.

908
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:40,824
[Ka-young] <i>I was probably asking for</i>
<i>a sword to cut someone's head off. Yeah.</i>

- [ominous music plays]

912
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,645
What are you doing at my house at night?

913
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,690
You better not be here for my grandma.

914
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,234
If you are, I'll kill you.

915
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,737
You may be Iblis' master,
but you cannot kill me.

916
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,448
And I'm here to see you, Ms. Ki Ka-young.

917
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,532
Me?

918
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,661
- Am I to die?
- [chuckles] No. Mm-mm.

919
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,331
That won't be happening just yet.

920
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,543
I know you've already made
your second wish.

921
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,173
[sighs] What exactly makes that
any of your concern?

922
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:45,347
I thought I could provide some assistance
on deciding your final wish.

[suspenseful music playing]

924
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:54,189
Do you know the exact reason
Iblis wants to kill you?

925
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:58,276
I trapped him for a thousand years.
I'm pretty sure that's why.

926
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,072
Precisely. And what was the reason
for your first death?

927
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,243
Don't you want to know?

928
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,874
Would you like to learn the truth?

929
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,669
To come with me…

930
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,965
to the moment of your death?
