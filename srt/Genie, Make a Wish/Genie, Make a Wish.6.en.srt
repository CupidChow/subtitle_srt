- [birds cawing]
- [tense music plays]

4
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:14,949
Would you like to come with me
to the moment of your death?

5
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,288
Why would I go with you?

6
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,460
I followed the Lord's orders
and bowed before the first human.

7
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,379
Iblis and I have been brothers
for a long time,

8
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,256
as well as each other's oldest enemies.

9
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,219
Now he wants to kill you, Ki Ka-young.

10
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,221
Your enemy's enemy…

11
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,891
has to be an ally, no?

12
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,601
[tense music continues]

13
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,826
Get lost.

14
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,452
Why?

15
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,622
I don't believe your lies.
Your face betrays you.

16
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,500
- Whoa!
- You okay?

17
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,168
Did you bite your tongue or something?

18
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,421
I felt somebody just beat up my master.

19
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,133
Oh, really? Your master's getting beat up?

20
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,926
Only two people would do that.

21
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,722
[yelling]

22
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,267
One of them is occupied, so that leaves…

23
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,476
[screaming]

24
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,397
Uh, I gotta get going now. Early morning.

25
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,944
Morning, Ms. Ki.

26
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,947
Everything all right?

27
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,158
Hello. We're the police.

28
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,910
Oh, gosh.
Did Ejllael report you for punching him?

29
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,662
He just had to get the police involved.

30
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,290
You're the one reporting me at the moment.

31
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,169
- There's a missing person.
- Ah.

32
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:53,590
Uh, yes. Do you happen to know this woman?
This village was her last known location.

33
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,842
[sniffing]

34
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,469
I usually use my nose
to find people. [sniffs]

35
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,387
[grunts]

36
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,973
We haven't seen her.

37
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,183
Would it be okay
to take a picture of that?

38
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,478
Of course. If you see anything at all
or remember something,

39
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,605
please give us a call.

40
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,733

[knocking]

44
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,724
That's very strange. I was here last week.

45
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,227
But why would they plan
another visit so soon?

46
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,024
Anyone there? Ms. Shin Suk-ja?
It's your water filter tech.

47
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,819
Whoa, so gross.
What's that horrible smell?

48
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,948
- [siren wails]
- [people murmuring]

49
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,538
Why do you always have
to overcomplicate things this way?

50
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,834
If I'm to escort those
who die bravely but alone,

51
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,878
I have to follow their playbook on death.

52
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,798
I even filed the reports myself
until 40 years ago.

53
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,175
<i>I was way busier back then.</i>

54
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,427
<i>I had to receive the complaints</i>
<i>of the dead,</i>

55
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,972
<i>file the reports,</i>
<i>all while wearing a heavy cloak. Ugh.</i>

56
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,515
[whimpering]

57
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,560
Please, no. I can't leave
when she's so sick, not yet.

58
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,605
[crying] Please, not until
my granddaughter has recovered.

59
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,275
I need more time. [sobs] Just a bit more.

60
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,193
Unfortunately, you're mistaken.

61
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:38,820
It's not you.

62
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:40,697
It's her.

63
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,658
[cries out] No, no, no! It can't--

64
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:47,912
But even then, the law had questions.
Because wherever I went, death followed.

65
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,873
Interpol may still have questions.

66
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,002
I get it. So why did you let
Ms. Ki Ka-young hit you?

67
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,213
Getting hit is part of the playbook too?

68
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,423
[sighs softly]

69
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,009
Mm.

70
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,554
If you know all this,
Iblis knows all this too.

71
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,307
- [scoffs]
- Of course.

72
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,143
I keep eyes on the day,
while Sade watches the night.

73
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,769
[huffs]

74
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,107
[Sang-hyeok] Wait,
you're hogging them both?

75
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,192
- I'm fighting against myself.
- Jeez.

76
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,653
You're an adult
and you spend all your hours here?

77
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,364
- Don't you have a job, mister?
- I work. I'm a genie, okay?

78
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,075
And since I live for eternity,
I'm still an infant.

79
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,661
Hmm. That means I'm older.

80
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,372
Hey, you squirt! Get lost!

81
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,751
No wonder Ka-young doesn't like
being around you.

82
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,672
What did you say?

83
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,883
Sorry for calling you squirt.

84
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,135
Ki Ka-young. What does she tell you?

85
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,930
I should be the one doing the disliking,
but you're saying she dislikes me?

86
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,767
Tell me what you know, Sang-hyeok.

87
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:52,935
[Sade] Master.

88
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,438
[punching keys]

89
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,982
Ejllael went to
the lump of clay's house? Why?

90
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,443
Apparently, he was acting all charming,

91
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,403
and offered to take her
to the moment she died.

92
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,529
To the moment she died?

93
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,160
[sighs] I feel bad.

94
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,161
Then what?

95
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:14,123
After he said that, Master's master
told Ejllael to get lost before she…

96
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,875
- gave it to him.
- [sighs]

97
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,544
When she's in a bad mood,
I don't get dinner.

98
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,922
I better go check on her.

99
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,257
Cover that man's eyes.

100
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,676
That "man"?

101
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,221
Ki Ka-young! [panting lightly]

102
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,139
[gasps]

103
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,059
Wait, that's my carpet…

104
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,353
Oh, she's using it to--

105
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,480
[sighs] Uh, wait.

106
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,482
[gasps] Huh?

107
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,276
You're wearing designer clothes.

108
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,822
You're doing chores dressed like that?

109
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,616
Ka-young isn't gonna be happy about that.

110
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,702
My fashion sense will only improve
if I keep wearing things like this.

111
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,247
All right. Hungry? I made some steaks.

112
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,333
Ka-young won't be home till late,
so leave her some.

113
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,627
Where is she? She wasn't at work.

114
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,464
Oh.

115
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,092
Today is the 4th.

116
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,304
[somber music plays]

117
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,907
Don't you want to know?
Would you like to learn the truth?

118
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,960
[soft rumbling]

119
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,559
[Iblis] You really are trying your best
to die, aren't you?

120
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,269
That's cheating.

121
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,564
So what was even the point
of bringing us back together again?

122
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,486
[Iblis] Based on how you've been,
it's not because He wanted me to be happy.

123
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,324
I don't know His intentions either.
But if you die, it'll be by my hands.

124
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,702
You could say that's the reason
we met again.

125
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,330
[rumbling, whooshing]

126
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,424
[somber music continues]

127
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,945
[woman] <i>Your daughter, Yoo Jeong-hwa,</i>

[cell phone vibrates]

130
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,330
Oh.

131
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,748
Shit!

132
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,920
Tell me where this is.

133
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,799
Don't you dare say anything about privacy!
I'll call the police, got that?

134
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,594
She's my daughter, and the boy she's with
is a minor. Understand?

135
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,764
- [Jeong-hwa] Cover the left.
- [unlocks]

136
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,353
- Fucking annoying. Damn it.
- We're dead again. We keep on dying.

137
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,397
If you just played decently!

138
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,651
- [boy] You're one to talk. You suck too.
- [Jeong-hwa speaks indistinctly]

139
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:35,032
How long do other people
generally wait before making it?

140
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,827
Their third and final wish?

141
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,208
One guy held onto that third wish
for 72 years.

142
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,960
[chuckles dryly] Oh, wow.

143
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,879
I get that, though.

144
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:54,135
I'm caught between a feeling of defeat,
because it's my last,

145
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,138
and a great hope
that it could repair everything.

146
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,390
So I don't want to let it go.

147
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,892
[breathes heavily]

148
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,605
So, then, what did that person wish for?

149
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,608
Humans tend to make
their first wish immediately

150
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,736
because they worry
that their luck will vanish.

151
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,782
They use their second wish to make up for
the first wish that they made in a hurry.

152
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,870
They blame themselves for not having
wished for something greater.

153
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,915
Then they torture themselves,
clutching onto their last wish.

154
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,294
They look and look and look
for that perfect wish.

155
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,548
So, after 72 years,
he made his final wish.

156
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,301
And he wished for me to forget that…

157
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,929
he'd already used two. [chuckles]

158
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,514
[soft suspenseful music plays]

159
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,725
He figured out the greatest thing of all.

160
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,146
Does that…

161
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:48,939
work?

162
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,110
Why don't you try it?

163
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,614
Wish for that if you're curious.

164
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,116
[chuckles smugly]

165
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,202
[music intensifies]

166
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,623
[music stops]

167
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,130
[chuckles softly] Hmm.

168
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,842
[gasps]

169
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,095
[gasps] Oh, my goodness.

170
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,392
[Ka-young] <i>Always store the purses</i>
<i>in their pouches.</i>

171
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,018

<i>for something chic.</i>

175
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,653
<i>No fruit knives in the purses.</i>

176
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,196
This girl is something.

177
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,241
I get it. This is how you do it.

178
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,326
What have we got here?

179
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,037
[inhales deeply] Hmm.

180
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,831
[takes off paper]

181
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,000
Today is your day.

182
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,087
[light peppy music plays]

183
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,046
[gasps]

184
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,593
[gasping excitedly]

185
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,728
Oh?

186
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,606
[chuckles]

187
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,026
How much? Just for one?

188
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,238
That's outrageous!
You get a loaf of bread for that.

189
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,118
You're wearing designer heels
and a blouse from the latest collection.

190
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,370
And macarons are too expensive?

191
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,166
You're a strange one.

192
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,919
[chuckles] Of course I am. Who isn't?

193
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:39,592
Next time, come to my place. I'll make you
a hotteok as big as your head. [chuckles]

194
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,929
It's on the house.
The owner here is a patient of mine

195
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,599
and they still need a few more implants.

196
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,729
Then we should pay for these. It's not
like their implants are free, right?

197
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,688
[chuckles softly]

198
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,773
Okay, what have we got here?

199
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,821
- [squeals] Too sweet.
- [chuckles]

200
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,239
Two would be too many.

201
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,825
An old-fashioned palate.

202
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,703
And an up-front and personal invite
to your home.

203
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,331
[inhales sharply]
What on earth could be your deal?

204
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,629
My deal?

205
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,965
Life has been a tiny bit difficult,

206
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,344
and now it's a tiny bit more fun. Mm?

207
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,596
[both laugh]

208
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,850
[Mi-ju] Have some, have some.
[chuckles]

209
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:30,768
Mm.

210
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,938
[Heung-rye] <i>It just doesn't</i>
<i>make any sense to me.</i>

211
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:38,067
Pan-geum, she-- Just because
she's all the way out in Hawaii,

212
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,986
it doesn't make any sense
that we haven't heard from her.

213
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,656
Some crazy crap is going on.

214
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,823
Mm, that's true.

215
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,119
It's one thing not to call us,
but she could still answer her phone.

216
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,706
Plus, that complete stranger moving
into her house the moment she leaves

217
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,416
makes you think something's off.

218
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,296
I know. I saw that young woman
and Dr. Choi eating macarons.

219
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,258
I also did see Ka-young and that girl.

220
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,219
They were digging up
Pan-geum's pepper field at nighttime.

221
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,304
Is that all connected?

222
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,682
The chili field? Oh, my, my goodness!

223
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,809
Ka-young did it! She finally snapped!

224
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:15,563
It all makes sense. She's a psychopath,
so she killed her grandma and buried her!

225
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,731
- That's too much. No.
- Come on.

226
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,276
She wouldn't? How can you be sure? Right?

227
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,069
That bitch has gotta be involved.

228
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,988
So please call Chang-sik, now!

229
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,282
[sighs]

230
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,119
She's staying here as a guest.
She wanted to experience the country.

231
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,330
Cut the crap.
If she's really here for half a year,

232
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,583
then why did she come out
of Pan-geum's room?

233
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,710
Okay, now everyone remain calm. Calm down.

234
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,170
These elders have
reasonable concerns and suspicions.

235
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,007
I propose you answer all questions
with the utmost sincerity.

236
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,427
Now tell us, where is your grandmother?

237
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,681
Hawaii.
She's always dreamed of going there.

238
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,851
She wanted to go when she was younger,
but never did and regretted it.

239
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,771
Hawaii? As in "Hawaii" Hawaii?

240
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,567
- She went all alone?
- Will you stop going on about the past?

241
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,028
- Huh?
- She flew to Hawaii!

242
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,654
- Yes?
- She's not answering her phone!

243
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,031
- No one can reach her!
- Oh.

244
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,699
All you need to know
is that she's gone.

245
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,535
There. There. What did I tell you?
She said she's gone.

246
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,203
What did I tell you? She killed her!

247
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,539
- [women gasp]
- This one must be an accomplice.

248
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,292
Seongnim! Why would you
suggest something so--

249
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,293
"Seongnim"?

250
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,757
Oh…

251
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:29,637
Isn't that what you call each other
out here in the countryside?

252
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,222
That's what I've seen on TV.
[chuckles nervously]

253
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,643
Oh, oh, look at that weasel
squinting her eyes with that phony smile.

254
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,062
Look at that!
You're not fooling anyone, wench!

255
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,149
You, call your grandma right now!
I want to see her with my own eyes!

256
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,152
She's right.
None of us can get ahold of her.

257
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,570
Aren't you worried at all?

258
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,240
What did I tell you?
Of course she can't call her.

259
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,951
You, spit it out!

260
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,119
Your grandma,
you murdered her, didn't you?

261
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,245
Hey, what did you--

262
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,581
You can't. Mm.

263
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,334
[line connects, rings]

264
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,251
[Chang-sik] Hey.

265
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,712
Oh, I think it's going through!

266
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,840
We've called, but she never
answers or returns our call.

267
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:07,967
MS. OH PAN-GEUM
CONNECTING

268
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,302
[line continues ringing]

269
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,679
- [call connects]
- Huh?

270
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,057
<i>Oh, hey. What? Did something happen?</i>

271
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,476
<i>I'm having a great time in Hawaii.</i>

272
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,646
[Chang-sik] Good, great!
You're doing fine. It's Chang-sik!

273
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,232
- Everyone, say hello.
- [Bok-ja laughing]

274
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,694
[Chang-sik] Is it nighttime there?
Whoa, isn't that neat!

275
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,572
[Pan-geum] <i>Look over, there's the ocean.</i>
<i>Can you see it? Amazing, isn't it?</i>

276
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,117
<i>- </i>Hand the phone over! Give it!
- Okay. It's a video call--

277
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,452
- You're really something, you know that?
- [Bok-ja] Hello.

278
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,497
You went all the way there by yourself?
I heard you had a extra ticket.

279
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,541
[Chang-sik] All right,
let's all take turns.

280
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,669
Oh, my, look at all those flowers.
[laughs]

281
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,214
Heavens, you look wonderful. [laughing]

282
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,801
Hey, why didn't you answer your phone?
When are you coming back?

283
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,471
<i>Uh, I'm thinking of staying</i>
<i>for a few more months.</i>

284
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,599
<i>Ka-young is grown up</i>
<i>and can take care of herself.</i>

285
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,102
<i>My eldest daughter asked me</i>
<i>to live with her.</i>

286
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,604
<i>- Oh, anyone there? Hello?</i>
- [Ok-nam] Uh, what?

287
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,815
Huh? Something's wrong
with the connection.

288
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,567
<i>My phone doesn't get good reception here.</i>

289
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,861
- Can you bring back some jojoba oil?
<i>- You're all frozen.</i>

290
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:09,903
Oh, the call dropped.

291
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:15,451
Anyway, you all saw that she's alive.
And you suspected Ms. Ki for nothing!

292
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,703
Enough, enough.
Clear out, everyone. Clear out.

293
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,040
- All right, we have strawberries to pick.
- [Heung-rye grumbles]

294
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,291
Let's go!

295
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,253
You could've just called her when
we asked. Instead of acting suspiciously,

296
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,255
you know, as if you were
hiding something fishy.

297
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,883
Who wouldn't suspect you?
Act normal for once.

298
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,221
[somber music plays]

299
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,934
[Ka-young sighs]

300
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,395
Uh…

301
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,607
Sorry, I was planning
to drop by city hall.

302
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,942
From now on, I'll stay here.

303
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,280
I'm sorry. I cause you
such a headache. Gosh.

304
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,408
[sighs]

305
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:01,872
[sighs]

306
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:11,131
You believed you were gonna be great
at creating wishes without any flaws? Ha!

307
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:12,925
What, no thank you?

308
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,385
So this is what it's like

309
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,554
to get what I deserve…

310
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,475
in exchange for wishes from Satan.

311
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,321
[sighs]

312
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,916
Hello there.

313
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,795
I'm a student researching facial features.

314
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,256
[gasps] Your soul is very pure indeed.

315
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,674
[scoffs]

316
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,512
Of course it is. I am of the genie.

317
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,013
But something's wrong, isn't it?

318
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,474
How do you know?

319
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,104
I should be happy to see
my enemy in pain, but I'm not.

320
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,400
- What's going on?
- Yes. I see unhappiness inside of you.

321
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,153
An ancestor of yours died
far from home on the street.

322
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,031
My ancestors are immortal.
It's my brothers who died.

323
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,952
Most were killed
in the war against the angels.

324
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,873
I'm just helping you
get your facts straight.

325
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,374
[pats]

326
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,127
Ah. I understand.

327
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,462
Then, best wishes to you.

328
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,633
Where are you going?
I barely made it past the introduction.

329
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,219
That war went on for 300 years.

330
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,763
[music playing faintly over speakers]

331
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,562
Heading home for the night?

332
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,565
Hey, Ms. Lee.

333
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,694
[gasps] I'm sorry,
would you mind repeating that?

334
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,991
I can't hear things at all. I need to look
at your face to comfortably read lips.

335
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,244
- [woman] Your latte, miss. It's ready.
- I didn't know. I'm sorry.

336
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,704
[louder] Your latte is ready.

337
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,795
I was born this way.
I've been practicing since I was young.

338
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,007
But I remain deaf to heaven's secrets.

339
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,008
Good night.

340
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,179
What was that?

341
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,683
Was she just going off about the reckoning
or something like that?

342
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,812
[Irem] <i>I was born</i>
<i>from a single wisp of white smoke,</i>

343
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,107
<i>exhaled from the hookah pipe</i>
<i>of the angel, Ejllael.</i>

344
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,238
<i>When my master created me,</i>
<i>he blocked my ears so I would never hear</i>

345
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,948
<i>- any secrets from heaven.</i>
<i>- </i>[girl screams]

346
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,492
You're the only one
who's been nice to me all day!

347
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,952
- [horn honking]
- [tires screeching]

348
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,955
- [crashing]
- [Iblis groans] Bad luck.

349
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,542
- [chiming and whooshing]
- [indistinct chatter]

350
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,005
[Iblis] Huh?

351
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,174
[chatter and laughter]

352
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,801
Hmm?

353
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,388
Hmm?

354
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,017
[clamoring]

355
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,646
[cheering]

356
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,069
This your first time here, Unc?

357
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,573
Hey, Auntie. That's not the restroom.
Go outside. Go.

358
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,659
You must all be related.

359
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,120
What's going on? You want to play or not?

360
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,706
I don't even know what's going on.

361
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,584
And, most importantly,
I have no money. [giggling]

362
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,086
Don't worry about things like that.

363
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,630
Learn the game as you play,
that's what you do.

364
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,299
And I can just lend you the money.

365
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,427
How about one million to start?
10% paid in advance.

366
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,556
Wait, you're just giving me this?

367
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,766
[gasps] Thank you.

368
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,853
Are you the boss
in this group?

369
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,024
Don't worry. I'll do this very slowly.

370
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,110
- [sirens approaching]
- [amusing music plays]

371
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,617
We've decided to drop
the sexual assault charges.

372
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,162
Turns out, people over there
rub noses as a greeting.

373
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,122
- [both laugh]
- Okay.

374
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,333
Once your guardian arrives, you may leave.

375
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,084
M-- My guardian?

376
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:20,589
Hey, is it-- Can I just go?
Didn't you see my beating the other day?

377
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,179
[Ka-young sighs]

378
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,558
Sexual assault?
First, you dine and dash, and now this?

379
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,643
[cracking knuckles]

380
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,687
- Put the clip in your hair.
- [sighs]

381
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,730
Put it there now!

382
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,318
- At least let me explain.
- [cracking knuckles]

383
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,029
Seriously, this is just unfair.

384
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,991
[Ka-young grunts] Come over here.

385
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:52,120
[grunting] You say unfair? This unfair?

386
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,790
- [Iblis grunts]
- Get over here!

387
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,167
[grunting]

388
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,507
Come here! [grunting]

389
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,388
Two left.

390
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,016
Two of them left now.

391
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,018
Two left.

392
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,728
Two left.

393
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,438
Two left.

394
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,273
Two left.

[people cheering, chattering]

397
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,073
Sh… Shit.

398
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,659
DEPOSIT, KI KA-YOUNG
10,000,000 WON

399
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,744
[breathing heavily]

400
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,287
How is this real?

401
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,708
CHEONGPUNGHO BANK

402
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,878
That bitch has so much money, but
her daily transfer limit is just 10,000!

403
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,006
[breathes heavily] This just won't work.

404
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,843
Once her money's transferred,
it's an immediate investigation.

405
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,137
I'll figure out the rest myself.

406
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,721
But here's my second wish.

407
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,266
Increase Ki Ka-young's transfer limits
to the max.

408
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,684
[rumbling]

409
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,191
[knock on door]

410
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,949
Why did you lock the break room?

411
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,368
Well, hurry and get out.
Ki Ka-young would like to see you.

412
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,174
Increase my daily transfer limit
to the max.

413
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,302
[sighs in delight]

414
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,053
Sure.

415
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,556
The limit's 50,000.

416
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,103
Fill these out here and here.

417
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,355
And down here too.

418
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,441
[suspenseful music playing]

419
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,776
[laughs maniacally]

420
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,619
[printer whirring]

GU BO-GYEONG, JULY 12, 2024
MADE HER SECOND WISH

425
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,600
INCREASE KI KA-YOUNG'S TRANSFER LIMIT

426
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,814
All of the humans I've seen
love getting money, but hate losing it.

427
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,900
Where do you stand?
Don't you hate losing it?

428
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,445
I'm using it quickly to avoid losing it.

429
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,073
It's meaningful to lose money

430
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,659
if it's in exchange
for another type of validation.

431
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,786
It just validates that I was arrogant.

432
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,246
[chuckles softly]

433
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,416
So you can stop giggling.
I know I'm losing.

434
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,965
- Why were you there in the water?
- Hmm?

435
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,342
You were making the bubbles, weren't you?

436
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,928
I can go wherever I wanna go.

437
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,807
It's not like you own the ocean.

438
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,813
Do you happen to hate something?
Anything in particular?

439
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,564
I'm thinking garlic?

440
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,525
- [gasps]
- Or a wooden stake?

441
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,651
Perhaps a cross?

442
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,486
[laughing]

443
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,574
I particularly hate you.

444
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,285
Get out!

445
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,620
[upbeat music playing over speakers]

446
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,090
Oh, you're here. You found your way.

447
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:36,386
I'm here, yes. Although a newbie like me
can't really do anything.

448
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,763
I was a complete mess
when I first started too.

449
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,892
- But you've tried other sports, right?
- In the past, I did some yoga.

450
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,687
I could put my foot behind my neck,
you know? That kind of thing.

451
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,897
- [chuckles]
- But I can't do that anymore.

452
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,108
I made my way here to learn.

453
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,445
I wanna know how to defend myself
and how to protect someone too.

454
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,156
Okay. Hit this.
Punch it as hard as you can.

455
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,532
- [grunts]
- Whoa!

456
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,493
- Whoa! That's shocking. My goodness.
- Whoa, what was that?

457
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,038
- [gasps]
- Whoa. You could get us into trouble.

458
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,748
You make a lot of money?

459
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,500
You might have to get them a new one.

460
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,045
Oh, really? Can we fix it?

461
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,755
I'm just teasing.

462
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,092
- You were joking?
- [laughing]

463
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,844
Come fight me, then. Come on.

464
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:20,972
Whoa!

465
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,933
Did you see the mansion?

466
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,312
[blows] You think the all folks
in the front yard are related? [slurps]

467
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,773
They looked like guards to me.
Not relatives at all.

468
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,650
Nope. Can't fool me.

469
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,570
They're not related nor guards either.

470
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,574
There's something happening
in our little village.

471
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,409
They are…

472
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,371
soldiers.

473
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,622
- Soldiers, really?
- An army?

474
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,248
Yes. Military.

475
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,377
GOBLIN STATIONERY

476
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,754
[joystick clicking]

477
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,807
Mister, how did you get that money?

478
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,810
- You were always broke until now.
- [chuckles]

479
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,812
- [Ka-young] That's it, stop.
- But why?

480
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,147
Empty your pockets.

481
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,690
Really?

482
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,952
[laughing]

483
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,579
Dark methods were involved.

484
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,958
[music playing over game]

485
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,584
Game's on me.

486
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,547
- For real? You're serious?
- [chuckles]

487
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,638
What happened to your arms?

488
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,307
Dark family matters were involved.

489
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,645
Hey, um, want me to tell you a secret?

490
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,190
This is a very important secret.

491
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,986
- [woman] Run quickly! Run away quickly!
- [man] You piece of shit, get back here!

492
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,321
[woman] Why take it out on the kid
when it's your fault?

493
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,949
[man] I told you to get
an overdraft account, you bitch!

494
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,702
[woman] You took all my money, asshole!

495
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,663
[Sang-hyeok] <i>That was when I saw an angel.</i>

496
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,293
You did? I see them once in a while.

497
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,294
Are you ready?

498
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,129
I'm telling you what I saw.

499
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,175
So I prayed to the angel. I begged him
to make Mom's friend go away.

500
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,677
That stupid jerk you saw
doesn't grant wishes.

501
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,972
- He's basically in it for himself.
- You don't have to believe me.

502
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:30,101
As soon as I'm a little bit bigger,
I'm planning to beat up that man.

503
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,188
But it takes a long time to grow up.

504
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,114
- All right, give me a quarter.
- You have so much right now.

505
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,993
I can grant you the wish you want.
However, it's not free.

506
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,662
You won't know this,
but the wish specialist--

507
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,624
Oh, I just won! [laughing]

508
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,504
I'm willing to believe you once,
because I deliberately just lost to you.

509
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,089
Hey. Wow.

510
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,425
[laughs] You're worse than Satan.

511
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,136

00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,130
Throw the boy to them. Feed the dogs!

683
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,093
- No, don't! You can't! You can't!
- Hey!

684
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,180
[both scream]

685
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:19,477

- [growling]

[gasping]

687
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,900
- [whimpers]
- [man 2] Let's go, now!

688
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,110
- [cries]
- While the dogs feast,

689
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,361
we can escape and live.

690
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,449
[growling]

691
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,869
- [gasping, screaming]
- [man 2] Go! Go! Let's go!

692
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,457
[Hunbish screams]

693
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,168
The time has come to grant your wishes.

694
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,754
[chuckles softly]

695
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,465

- [Hunbish screaming]

697
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,012
[screaming]

698
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,180
[man 2] Don't look.

699
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,098
[soft chiming]

700
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,230
[gusting]

701
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,439
[man 3] Iblis is here!

702
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,525
- [man 4] Oh, God! [yelps]
- [man 3] It's Satan!

703
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,693
- [men screaming]
- [man 4] Oh, God!

704
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,614
Stop! Throw the girl! Throw her too!

705
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,617
[man 2] Let's go now! Hurry! Come on!

706
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,119
- Gather everything and go!
- [man 4] Leave her! Let's go!

707
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,372
- [rumbling]
- [men screaming]

708
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,458
Hurry! Keep moving!

[gasping]

711
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,349
[echoing] I am a genie,
a spirit of the lamp.

712
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,228
I'll grant you three wishes. Make them.

713
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,647
Wishes?

714
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,399
Really?

715
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,361
No bringing back the dead
or traveling to the future.

716
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:56,407
Anything other than that, your wish…

717
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,493
is my command.

718
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,038
Where are you from?

719
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,291
[gasps] Are you from Goryeo too?

720
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,255
If that would bring you comfort,
let's say I am.

721
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,549
Now make your first wish.

722
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,010
- [Hunbish screaming]
- [dogs growling]

723
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,806
Would you please save Hunbish
from the wolves?

724
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,684
Oh, please!
Let him live a long, long life!

725
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,646
Please let him live!
He can't die like this!

726
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,565
That's right.

727
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,069
Follow me…

728
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,530
to your corruption.

729
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,494

[wind gusting]

732
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,341
[screaming stops]

733
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,594
[rumbling]

734
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,598
- [blood splatters]
- [groans]

735
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,934
[man 1] Satan's found us!

736
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,980
- [Iblis] <i>Don't blame me.</i>
- [man 2] Run! Satan's gonna kill us!

737
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:14,026
[Iblis] <i>My young master has wished</i>
<i>for someone to live a long life.</i>

[rumbling]

[flesh squelching]

740
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:27,289
<i>A long, lengthy life</i>
<i>is bound to require blood sacrifices.</i>

741
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,712
<i>This blood will taint the desert.</i>

742
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,882
[dramatic orchestral music plays]

743
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,425
<i>The boy will live,</i>

744
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,387
<i>but the pack of wild dogs will starve.</i>

745
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,305
[music intensifies]

746
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,897
[breathes heavily]

747
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,815
[music fades]

748
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,739
Shall we hear what your second wish is?

749
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,366
[gasping]

750
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,578
Will you make it so that…

751
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:13,001
children won't be sold
to be fed to animals like I was?

752
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,881
I shall block the path that brought you.

753
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,051
I'll return soon.

754
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,596
[dramatic music plays]

755
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,268
[birds cawing]

756
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,069
[music stops]

757
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,655
This is around 1041 AD.

758
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,492
You're sure it was the year 1041?

759
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,286
I'm sure.

760
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:52,416
This period was when he was at his peak
of corrupting humans. [inhales sharply]

761
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,919
There was a very large
number of deaths that year.

762
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:57,880
Including yours.

763
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,384
[birds cawing]

764
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,429
That's his handiwork, all those deaths.

765
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,349
All that blood on Iblis' hands.

766
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,315
[groans, pants]

767
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,738
[growling]

768
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,074

00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,789
[child Ka-young gasping]

771
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:36,877
Oh, they're there.

772
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,338
You see me standing with the scythe?

773
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,926
I haven't seen my original face
in a long time.

774
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,886
I'll change it,

775
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,763
so it's easier to recognize.
[snaps fingers]

776
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,605
Your second wish has also been fulfilled.

777
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,566
The path between the desert
and Goryeo has been blocked.

778
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,860
Because of tsunamis and earthquakes.

779
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,989
Your first wish caused
the death of 15 merchants.

780
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,535
And your second wish
ended hundreds of lives.

781
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,833
I didn't want that.
I didn't make those kinds of wishes.

782
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,294
[man panting] Please, help us--

783
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:20,629
[man grunts]

784
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:25,300
Mm. The number has increased to 16.

785
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,104
[Iblis] Now, you have
your final wish remaining.

786
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,773
Girl from Goryeo, make it.

787
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:46,488
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
Please, what can I do to fix this?

788
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:53,161
I didn't mean-- [sobbing]
I made the wrong kinds of wishes.

789
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,623
Foolish child.

790
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,835
Do you truly believe
there's a right kind of wish?

791
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,297
To gain something, one has to lose.

792
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,091
For one to live, someone's life
must come to an end.

793
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,135
Sade!

794
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,679

[child Ka-young panting]

800
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,789
No matter what you say, I know
your last wish will be to save yourself.

801
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,958
- [breath shuddering]
- Now make it.

802
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,635
[child Ka-young] No.

803
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,387
I accept…

804
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,140
punishment.

805
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,518
So… [pants]

806
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,145
make sure…

807
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,024
we are punished right…

808
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,111
you and me, please.

809
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,240
What?

810
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,826
This is the only way it's fair.

811
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,203
[breathes laboriously]

812
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,329
That's my…

813
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,290
That's my final wish.

814
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,709
[tense music playing]

815
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:29,800
[huffs]

816
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,469
You petty little human…

817
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,516
How dare you do this,
you pathetic lump of clay!

818
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,268

819
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,063
[Ejllael laughs]

820
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,734
Behold. His creations do know
right from wrong. They're righteous.

821
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,944
You've lost, Iblis.

822
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,571
You remember what He said?

823
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,158
If you meet even one human who's pure,
you will be trapped.

824
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,868
- Wait, just wait.
- For eternity!

825
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,412
You need to wait and hear me out!

826
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,416
Ri-- Righteous?

827
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,711
[scoffs] Really? There's…

828
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:10,465
[pants] Well, there's always…
there's room for interpretation.

829
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,428
Please put in a good word,
won't you? Brother?

830
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:16,722
[scoffs]

831
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,809
Cut the bullshit.

[laughs]

834
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,152
Is this really the end?

835
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,070
Because of her?

836
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,823
We need to talk.

837
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,034
Ejllael. You need to come back!

You small lump of clay.

841
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,548
You lowly being created on Friday.

842
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,925
A mere human
who doesn't live past a hundred years!

[Ejllael] Hmm.

849
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,832
Do you see?
You died in this way so tragically.

850
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,085
No matter what you wished for,

851
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,754
Iblis always heard it the way
he wanted to hear it,

852
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,172
to lead you to corruption.

00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,648

rage.

00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:43,743
This is…

859
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,122
the face…

860
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,668
of remorse.

861
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,212
True sorrow.

862
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,049
[sighs softly]

863
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,976
[Iblis inhales sharply]

864
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,487
[chiming]

865
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,198
[suspenseful music intensifies]

866
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,082
[strained grunting]

867
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,923
[gasping]

868
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,634
How funny it is.

869
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,010
[panting]

870
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,094
[screams]

871
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:46,848
A mere thousand years
is nothing relative to eternity.

872
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,183
A drop in the bucket.

873
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,060
[sizzling]

874
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,856
[dramatic choral music plays]

875
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,775
[groaning, gasping]

876
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,904
[strained groaning]

877
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,494
[gasping]

878
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,497
- [music stops]
- [gasps deeply]

879
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,875
[gentle music plays]
