GENIE, MAKE A WISH

3
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,528
If that's your plan,

4
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,156
then forget the wishes.

5
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,784
Just throw me off right now.

6
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,410
I'm… [laughing]

7
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,874
having such fun! [cackling]

[choking]

9
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,253
- You're having fun?
- Oh, yes.

10
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,506
My life is so boring,

11
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,926
and, oh, my heart's racing,
it feels so good. [chokes]

12
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,720
[inhales heavily, chokes]

13
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,679
This is fun?

00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,265
[laughing]

15
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,645
Good. Then I'll make it
even more fun for you.

It's the same scent.

24
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,931
I'd know that clay anywhere.

25
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,142
It's definitely you.

00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,105
[tense music continues]

27
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,816
This tells me I've grown lazy.

28
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,486
Is this how corrupt humans have grown?

29
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,865
Is there nothing
I can offer to tempt you with?

30
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,910
What was it like when you fell?
Can you feel anything?

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,997
I could join you in your ways.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,167
Can I try to kill you before you kill me?
Let's see who's the better killer.

I am warning you.

- if you ever put a hand on me again…
- [Ka-young coughs]

37
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,930
…then all humans except you

38
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,852
will be torn limb from limb and crushed
from the oldest to the youngest.

39
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,856
I'll put to death and butcher
every last bit of life,

40
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,816
sparing no soul.

41
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,029
I'll go to those extremes
to make you suffer.

42
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,493
I already put you in my plans
983 years ago.

[whooshing]

44
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,623
[Ka-young] Wait.

45
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,917
You're leaving me like this?

46
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,544

59
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,269
[Sayyid] Oh! My master!
How long have you been out for?

60
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,020
Get out.

61
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,856
[Sayyid] I would love to,
but I'm being watched right now.

62
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,776
I'll meet you at the oasis
as soon as I'm able to.

63
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,944
I'll be there soon.

64
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,905
I've changed a lot,
so don't be too surprised, okay?

65
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,407
Get over here now. [echoes]

66
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,078
[Sade] I was born
from a single tear that glistened

67
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:51,958
as it was shed on a strand
of my master's jet-black hair.

68
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,629
If you understand what I'm saying,
that's because…

69
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,048
What are you going on about?
Get over here.

70
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,425
[roars]

71
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,469
It's been so long.
I've missed you, Master.

72
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,055
[sniffing] Oh. Oh, your scent… [roars]

73
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,351
[groans] Cut it out. You served
other masters happily, didn't you?

74
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,312
I only did it to survive.

75
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,731
Take a look. Things now have become fancy.

76
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,733
The oasis is even a hotel.

[whimsical music plays]

78
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,862
New laws like animal protection
have prohibited hunting,

79
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,572
so I'm basically an herbivore.

80
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,198
[Sade sighs]

81
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,583
Anyway, did you get hurt?

82
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,044
It kind of felt like
my head was splitting earlier.

83
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,088
There kind of was an incident.

84
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,969
Could my head injury
be the reason you look so…

85
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:45,970
What's wrong?

86
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,556
Oh, right, this is the first time
you're seeing it.

87
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,641
This is the special face I told you about.

88
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,269
What?

89
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,980
Ah, I need to get you up to speed
on the latest trends.

90
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,858
Hey, a new master
has released you from the lamp.

91
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,942
How are they?

92
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,779
- They the type who'll want extra wishes?
- Not at all.

93
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,614
Actually, they've not made any.

94
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,075
I don't know. It's bizarre.

95
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,628

Mmm.

102
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,668
What are you doing here?

103
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,585
Mmm.

104
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,922
This is the first ride
on this type of carpet for me.

105
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,841
The food, oh, it's scrumptious.

106
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,134
[Iblis chuckles]

107
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,594
So you abandoned your genie this morning.

108
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,388
I only left you at the hotel.

109
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,514
That's abandonment.

110
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,932
No, I just left you there.

111
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,937
I see we'll never engage
in a proper discussion.

112
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,605
But you can't get rid of me.

113
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,773
[Iblis gulps water]

114
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,900
So don't waste your energy.

[yawns loudly]

116
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,158
I've had enough to eat. I need a nap.
See you in Goryeo.

117
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,120

[amusing music plays]

119
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,582
This is beyond annoying.

120
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,042
All right then. Okay.

121
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,713
Stop wearing your hair up
in a bun like mine, all right?

122
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,716
It's too similar to my hairstyle,
so you might as well cut it.

123
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,594
I spend so much energy on it.
I use daily hair mask.

124
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,554
I demand you change it. You hear me?

125
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,645
- [Pan-geum] Mmm.
- [Ok-nam] Wait until it gets crispy.

126
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,022
[Ka-young] I'm back.

127
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,773
[Heung-rye] Oh, my.

128
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,068
- What now?
- Ah.

129
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,697
I thought Ka-young seemed prettier lately.
Now I see you're dating.

130
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,449
- [Bok-ja] Makes sense.
- Who's dating?

131
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,909
I'm always very pretty, Grandma.

132
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,329
Okay, but who's this
lanky fellow with you?

133
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:18,956
Hi.

134
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,291
[amusing music plays]

135
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,963
Not a single word from you.
And I'm serious.

136
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,799
He's a memento, a keepsake.

137
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:33,304
That's Grandma An,
Grandma Park, Grandma Sa,

138
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,722
and my grandma.

139
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,517
[Heung-rye] How incredible.
What great news. That's wonderful.

140
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,520
She went overseas and brought home
a potential husband. Hmm?

141
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,438
He's not a potential anything.

142
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,439
We're just…

143
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,233
rooming together.

144
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,400
Huh?

145
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,237
Once you share a room,
it can only lead to, well…

146
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,322
You need Granny to tell you.

147
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,907
Who knows what could happen?

148
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,701
Pan-geum. Great-grandbabies are in your--

149
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,286
[Pan-geum] That's enough. Stop.

150
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,580
[grandmas chuckling]

151
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,665
Are you hungry?

152
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,460
- I'm An Bok-ja. We're glad you're here.
- Yes, thanks.

153
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,003
I'm Lee Beu-li.

154
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,464
- A good name, don't you think?
- "Lee Beu-li"?

155
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,423
[chuckles awkwardly]

156
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,800
- Lee Beu-li?
- Lee Beu-li?

157
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,387
[Ka-young] Come with me.

158
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,473
Why would they go to the shed?
The bedroom is further down.

159
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,141
[Heung-rye and Ok-nam chuckle]

160
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,685
Oh, stop that right now.

161
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,437
What has gotten into you?
The food will burn. Flip it.

162
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,022
[Ok-nam] It's perfect. Extra crispy.

163
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:27,984
"Lee Beu-li"?

164
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,154
My research showed me

165
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,490
that all the names here
have three syllables.

166
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,951
An Bok-ja, Ki Ka-young,

167
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,661
Lee Beu-li.

168
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,455
All right, you figured that out.

169
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,165
Congrats, but…

170
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,336
Forget it. Keep it. It's your name. Okay.

171
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,838
Let's go over the rules.

172
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,258
All grandmas, you stay away from.
Stay out of sight of the locals too.

173
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,759
No magic around anyone.

174
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,094
No mention of me making wishes.

175
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,347
And don't even think about
going into town for any business.

176
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,765
Okay?

177
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,684
What am I supposed to do?

178
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,353
I've come all this way to do what?

179
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,107
You say you want to try killing me,
then make a wish to do it.

180
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,818
- That's your hope, right?
- Using a wish for that would be a waste.

181
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,736
I could just do it.

182
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,743
What are you muttering?

183
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,536
[amusing music plays]

184
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,371
Where did the lanky fellow go?

185
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,375
- Why are you holding a pickaxe?
- [chuckles softly]

186
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,631
- You're only visible to me now?
- You told me to stay away from grandmas.

187
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,842
What's going on? What is it?
Are you seeing things, Ka-young?

188
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,344
You taking your meds?

189
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,971
- [breathes heavily]
- [chuckles softly]

190
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,098
Grandma, cover both ears.

191
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,893
- This thing has to die right now.
- [Pan-geum] Die? What?

192
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,728
Who do you want to kill?

193
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,855
Ka-young,
remember your promise to me, okay?

194
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,607
The rules still stand.

195
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,861

196
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,909

199
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,809
Ka-young. Your mom, dad,
and older sisters…

200
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,270
They aren't returning. They've all died.

201
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,314
Why did they all die?

202
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,982
I only killed my mom's parrot.

203
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:37,113
Mom, Dad, and my older sisters,
I never killed them.

204
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,030
I know.

205
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,366
Grandma understands.

206
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,161
You won't kill anyone or anything at all
from now on.

207
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,997
Not birds or other animals, okay?

208
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,084
We must live a long life together.
Understand?

209
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,712
But they said they'd come back.

210
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,297
They promised they would!

212
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,137
I didn't give them permission!
Why did they die?

[watch ticking]

215
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,737
Listen. From now on,
when you get angry, you do this.

216
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,866
Close your eyes
and listen to grandma's watch.

217
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,367
It's saying "ticktock," right?

218
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,955
Listen to that sound for a minute.
Sixty ticks. Sixty ticks make one minute.

219
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,168
Get off! No way!
I'm still angry. It hurts inside.

220
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:36,464
Then you must listen for two minutes.
Keep your focus on it, okay?

221
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,674
I hate this!

222
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,468
Put it away! Stop it now!

223
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,431
I hate your stupid watch!
I don't want this!

224
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,226
KA-YOUNG'S STUDY COMPILATION 1

225
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,352
[young Ka-young] 728…

226
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,812
Mr. Chang-sik made this.

227
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,274
Let's watch this special video.
Let's watch it together.

228
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,027
- My goodness. This is so fun, right?
- [young Ka-young counting]

229
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,070
[nurse] Congratulations. It's a baby girl.

230
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,864
- Here you go.
- Oh, Chae-a.

231
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,033
- [young Ka-young] 757. 758.
- [grandma] Sweet girl.

232
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,076
- You see that, Ka-young?
- [grandma cries] Oh, yes.

233
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,580
That grandma and father are happy.
Look how proud and happy they are.

234
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,749
That is happiness.

235
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,294
- 765, 766, 767…
- [grandma on video] I love you so much.

236
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,130
…768, 769…

237
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,673
[doctor] We did everything we could,

238
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,093
but unfortunately,
the mother has passed away in childbirth.

239
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,803
- [melancholy music plays]
- What?

240
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,014
Oh, my. How very sad.

241
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,849
That's real despair.

242
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,267
They've lost a mother.

243
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,937
Such a dear person they love.

244
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,439
…779, 780…

245
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,944
[Chae-a] Dad, you can't let go, okay?
You just can't. Hold on tight.

246
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,987
[dad] I am, of course.
Daddy's holding on tight.

247
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,989
- Dad, you didn't let go, right?
- No, I haven't.

248
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,909
- You're still holding on?
- [dad chuckles] Why, you did it!

249
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,827
- Yay, Chae-a!
- Hurray!

250
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,789
That right there is real happiness.

251
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,499
[dad] Slow down. Go slow.

252
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,669
You want to ride a bike?
You might like it if you try it.

253

…797, 798…

254
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,384
In Ka-young's case, ma'am,

00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,469
trying to teach her
how to regulate herself

256
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,679
would waste your time.

257
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,974

affection.

261
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,566
Nice and cozy, right?

…815, 816…

263

[teacher] She doesn't have
a sense of guilt,

264
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,822
and she's unable to control
her deep rage at the world.

Oh. Ka-young is so warm.

You can't take it out until tomorrow
even if the sky falls.

276
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,578
Good.

277
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,624
- [grunts, sighs]
- Why should I? Why do I have to?

278
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,750
It's uncomfortable.

279
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,921
It should be. That's right.
That's exactly what discomfort is.

280
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,299
When other people look at you
with their eyes all narrow,

281
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,134
it's because they're uncomfortable.

282
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,303
It's not because they don't like you.

283
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,555
It's because they don't get you.
All right?

284
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,808
Stop talking so much, Grandma.
You're so annoying.

285
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,519
What do I have to do
to stop living with you?

286
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,067
If you study really hard
and attend college,

287
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,652
you won't have to live with me.

288
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,739
You need to practice and study.
It takes hard work to be good.

289
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,824
You have to be the top of the class.

We didn't even discuss college at all.

I can't really freely go around anywhere.

to talk about certain franchises.

00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,771
Nice to meet you.

515
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,357
So you're the big chief
of this amazing village.

516
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,777
It's good to meet the big fish here,
Park Chang-sik.

522
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,002
- [yells]
- [Min-jae] What happened?

523
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,628
What's the meaning of this?

524
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,923
Calm down, please.
Relax, or you could end up dead.

525
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,051
What did you do? Why is my nose buzzing?

526
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,969
[Chang-sik yells]

527
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,722
What made you do that?
Why do you find me so tempting?

528
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,434
- Use your words. Relax. Keep it calm--
- Let go of me! I told you to let go!

529
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,643
[Jong-heon] Oh, damn it!

530
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,228
Goddammit!

531
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,146
What the…

532
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,273
- Hmm?
- Where did he go?

[amusing music plays]

534
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,610
[Chang-sik] Did he already run off?

Oh, what just happened?

539
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,788
Where is he?

540
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,790
Oh, no, where did he go?

541
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,041
[Chang-sik] Huh?

542
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,335
Oh, where could he have gone?

543
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,128
Tsk.

CHEONGPUNGHO MART

545
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,884
How many times do you need to hear that
the display at the entrance is important?

546
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,845
Why is it important?
It's the main face of our store.

547
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,055
Don't keep it so bare.

548
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,681
Understand?

549
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,226
Are you even listening?

550
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,603
I apologize.

00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,404
Our building has many stairs.
Don't your feet work?

00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,532
Oh. I'm very sorry. I'll get on it.

[groans]

556
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,584
Men don't rub noses like that
in this country. That's another rule.

557
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,170
Huh? What is this place?

558
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,923
What is all this?

00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,347
Stop running around.

Do you see him? Sorry.
Can you tell me if there's a man there?

563

- Oh, yes, he's quite handsome. Why?
- [Iblis gasps excitedly]

564
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,859
Uh, I just wondered
if he's handsome to others.

565
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:56,943
Thank you so much.

566
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,365
Chief Park's macho.

567

He's a former Marine

You're now his target.

569
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,080
What are you going to do
about being wanted?

570
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,500
Did I hear you right?
You think I look good?

571
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,919
I don't feel emotions, but I have eyes.

572
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,506
What do you mean? No emotions?

573
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,551
Don't let Min-ji catch you.
You need to be careful around her.

574
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,261
Her rules are much harsher.

575
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,597
Huh? Min-ji? Who's that?

576
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,732
[staff] Excuse me, sir.
That's the ladies' restroom, please.

00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,152
- Yes, I know.
- [gasps] I'm so very sorry.

Don't worry, I'm female.

When I signed the lease.
You work for Ryu Su-hyeon.

590
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,151
Did you play today?
The golf's great, don't you think?

591
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,779
I'll tell that to the owner.

592
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,240
You've met him.
Mr. Ryu bought this golf course.

593
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,201
This one as well? Whoa.

594
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,913
He's successful, but he still finds time
to volunteer at food banks.

595
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,416

was just finished recently, right?

- That's good news.
- I'm relieved to hear that you agree.

I'm having a hard time
with the amount of paperwork,

so it's good that you approve.

Although, I wonder
what makes you buy more stuff

603
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,359
when you already have so much.

604
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,739
Living this way as a human is like

setting foot in a living hell
even if it isn't hell itself.

606

If you got no money, that's extra hellish.

Uh… I'll come back when I'm done
with my after-school job.

Hey, why do you go around helping others?

You're the mythical beast of Satan.
Be the destroyer.

Wait here and stop spouting nonsense.
It's infuriating.

Step back. It's dangerous there.

- Yes, I know.
- [man] Just let her be.

666

She's an experienced hiker like we are.

- Oh!

Yes, I know.

[Iblis] You took so long to get down!

What are you doing? You knew I was here?

I'm begging you. One buck.
This is the last time, I swear.

You ran all this way for one buck?
You're a genie, aren't you?

Just make some of your own money.

- You came for short change?

683

Wait. You said it's the last time.

684
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,627
That means there was a first.
How did you--

685
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,629
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it from Pan-geum.

00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,257
stealing from an old lady is okay?

688
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,803
Why does she always have a weapon?
Be civil! Use words!

689
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,180
Come here, you dirty thief!

690
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,183
Give it back!
Give back my grandma's money!

691
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,269
[engine revving]

692
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,730
[breathing heavily]

693
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:15,321
JUST ONE BUCK!

694
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,701
- [steps on gas]
- [engine roaring]

695
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,710
[tires screeching]

696
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,171
[sighs]

697
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,051
Hand it over!

698
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,679
You're being unreasonable!

699
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,055
And you're roadkill.

700
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,515
[gear shift clicks]

701
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,226
- [engine revving]
- [Iblis] Wait. Where are you going?

702
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,312
Hey! Fine. I'll just take some change.
I'm only asking for a little, okay?

703
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,480
- [engine quiets down]
- Huh?

704
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,859
- [engine roaring]
- [tires screeching]

705
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,610
- Oh!
- [comical music plays]

706
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,449
- [crashes]
- [Iblis] You crazy lump of clay!

707
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,828
Why on earth
would your master do this to you?

708
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,830
- [neck cracks]
- [both groaning]

709
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,291
I asked her for two bucks. [sighs]

710
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,084
I'd forgive it all if she gave it now.

711
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,087
- Oh, what, money? That's what you want?
- [exhales]

712
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,798
- It's a thing now.
- Yes, it's become a thing.

713
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,509
- This money really adds up.
- Huh?

714
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,636
You have…

715
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,723
- How do you have all that?
- I work part-time here and there.

716
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,059
Since your master
doesn't give you any money

717
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:30,646
and ran you over with her car,
then it must be true.

718
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,273
She's nothing but a psychopath.

719
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,651
Oh, interesting. People keep saying
she's on a "path."

720
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,612
What kind of path is it? Do you know?

721
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,197
PSYCHOPATH

722
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,449
"Psychopath" is not a path
you can walk on.

723
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,118
Don't be concerned
with any results that come up.

724
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,330
- Are you prepared for this?
- Not at all.

725
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,958
It feels like they're about
to level up again.

726
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,419
[keyboard and mouse clacking]

727
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,254
If they knew it was me-- [yelps]

728
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,091
[sighs, chuckles] It's just you.

729
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,470
Your jokes are getting better, okay.
But why is the monitor off?

730
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,596
Oh. Look here.

731
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,809
Hmm?

732
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,896
- [whimsical music plays]
- Huh?

733
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,029
[shouts]

734
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,073
[high-pitched whirring]

735
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,532
[gasps loudly]

736
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,868
[whirring continues]

737
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,083
Would you like to hear
how disappointed I am

738
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,001
with my good friend Ki Ka-young?

739
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,213
How did I become the last person to know

740
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,007
that you returned from overseas
with a strange guy?

741
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,926
What does this idiot do?

742
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,971
Does he come from money
with a silver spoon in his mouth?

743
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,808
What does he do for a living?
I'm not quite sure yet.

744
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,771
He did tilt the earth to give me a hug.

745
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,525
It's strange he's always asked me
what my wish is.

746
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,403
What kind of wish?
Could he be a cult leader?

747
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:04,073
Does he mention the rapture often?
Did he ask you for money?

748
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,493
- Yes.
- I knew it. Tell me. How much?

749
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,746
- Just change.
- That's all?

750
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,041
[scoffs] He's that broke? What did you do?

751
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,003
I had to push him off a platform.
Punched him a few times.

752
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,088
I even ran him over with my car.

753
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,758
[machine beeps]

754
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,011
[assistant] We're all done for today.

755
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,721
[mellow music plays]

756
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,598
Sounds reasonable. What a broke asshole.

757
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,476
[Min-ji] We're all finished. You can go.

758
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,649
I'm just gonna wash my hands
and start with the afternoon appointments.

759
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,817
- Okay.
- All right.

760
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,323
Have you noticed? That person comes here
and lies down to talk.

761
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,949
No work's ever done on her.

762
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,453
I've heard she enjoys
the sound of drilling.

763
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,371
Hmm? So creepy.

764
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,333
[Iblis] I should've guessed.

765
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,960
She had the time of her life
when I took her on a roof

766
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,503
and turned to throw her over.

767
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,048
I didn't stand a chance, did I? [scoffs]

768
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,134
There's nothing to corrupt her with
because she's not like the others.

769
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,596
She was so righteous in her
previous lives. What to do, Master?

770
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,390
I'll just try one more thing.

771
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,937
Let's see if she values
the lives of others.

772
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,067
Next time we drink these aluminum kettles,

773
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,902
we'll be celebrating.

774
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,153
[ominous music plays]

775
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,158
[breathing heavily]

776
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,665
[watch ticking]

777
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,920
- [door bangs]
- [wind blowing]

778
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,755
[music intensifies]

779
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,595
[scoffs]

780
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,475
What? That your lighter?

781
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,436
Put that out. We don't want
the whole place to catch fire.

782
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,188
That is your decision.

783
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,486
This fire can't be extinguished
by anyone else.

784
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,072
- [music stops]
- And I have no interest in putting it out.

785
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,782
[music resumes]

786
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,700
Only you can wish for it to stop.

787
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,593
[dramatic music plays]

788
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,976
[door rattling]

789
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,320
[music fades]

790
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,488
[water splattering]

791
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,827
- [music continues]
- [gasps] Oh, no! There's a fire!

792
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,663
- A fire!
- [man] Oh! Call 911! Oh, no!

793
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,956
[people clamoring]

794
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,294
Flames spread quickly.

795
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,590
Are you filming an ad for fire insurance?
Unlock it.

796
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:11,510
Blaze could engulf the major parts
of the village or much of the city.

797
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,930
Even the entire country, right?

798
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,228
[sighs]

799
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,481
I'm gonna kill you, you idiot.

800
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,942
When I finally come out,
you just blew your only chance.

801
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,281
[music intensifies]

802
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,199
[door opens]

803
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,825
[music fades]

804
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,035
[door slams]

805
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,077
[gasps]

806
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,955
- [upbeat music plays]
- Wait… What?

807
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,499
What-- Was there another door?

808
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,001
If you had bothered doing your research.

809
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,586
Oh, no, don't. No, no, no.

810
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,004
- No!
- Die!

811
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,881
- [groaning]
- I kill all jerks who think

812
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,007
they can kill me first!

813
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,051
- [screaming in pain]
- Why won't you die?

814
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,845
I won't stop until you're dead.

815
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,515
- [Ka-young screaming]
- [Iblis groaning]

816
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,225
[Iblis] No! Please!

817
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,561
- [Iblis screaming in pain]
- Die!

818
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,480
Ugh! You maniac!

819
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,941
- [groaning]
- Ow, my butt!

820
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,444
You can wish for the flames to be stopped.
Wish! Wish!

821
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,238
[pants] Why would I?

822
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,198
Let it burn to the ground!

823
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,909
I don't care if you want the whole world
to go off in flames.

824
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,787
Ah! Then why do you keep hitting me?

825
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,956
You've ruined my strict nighttime routine.

826
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,541
It's Wednesday today.

827
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,251
Meaning what?

828
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:29,421
- [Ka-young grunting]
- [screaming in pain] Please stop!

829
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,048
[siren wailing]

830
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,806
Where are the flames coming from?

831
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,809
I think it started over there.

832
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,227
It couldn't have gone out

833
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,062
- on its own, could it?
- Huh?

834
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,898
- You see the burn marks, don't you?
- [man] I saw the fire too.

835
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,609
- Now the flames have all gone out.
- [objects clattering]

836
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,654
While you're here, maybe you could do
something about the assault?

837
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,614
- Right there.
- Whoa! Miss Ki Ka-young!

838
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,741
- [woman 1] Whoa.
- [woman 2] She's not stopping.

839
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,413
[officer] Miss Ki Ka-young!

840
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,707
Stop! Police! Drop it!

841
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,168
What's going on? This is so wrong!
You can't beat him like that.

842
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,255
- [inhales sharply]
- [gasps] It's no biggie.

843
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,257
I'm not a person at all.

844
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,093
I'm fine, really. I'm fine. [sighs]

845
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,304
And believe me, I deserve that.
[chuckles awkwardly]

846
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,889
Oh! Your skull! It's been dented.

847
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,308
[all exclaiming]

848
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,977
This is all fine. I feel no pain.

849
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,688
It'll get back once I pull it out.
[chuckles]

850
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,315
Your arm is twisted too!

851
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,899
[all exclaiming]

852
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,109
[Iblis] Is it?

853
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,863
Don't worry. It's always like this.
[laughs nervously]

854
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,157
And no need to worry.
Go on your way. I'm fine. Please.

855
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,200
- Thank you.
- With them, you're being polite?

856
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,787
But with me, you're a dick from day one.

- [all clamoring]
- [Iblis] Ahhh!

859
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,337
Everyone, leave us. Get out! Let her hit!

860
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,505
[comical music plays]

861
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,634
It's good for her.
We get along perfectly well.

862
00:43:56,717 --> 00:44:00,429
- We didn't ask anyone to get involved!
- Yup. [groans]

863
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,931
- [metal rod clatters]
- This is how it is in today's world.

864
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,768
I'm not going full force
'cause I need to eat gamja-tang now.

865
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,020
If everything
isn't back to normal when I return,

866
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,355
I'll cut you into four pieces

867
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,690
and send them to your maker
at the slowest rate.

868
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,108
Let's start cleaning.

869
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,653
- Today, I lost, but I'll do--
- [firefighter exclaims]

870
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,612
[body thuds]

871
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,821
- [music stops]
- [sighs]

872
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,827
As I thought, she doesn't care
about other people's lives.

873
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,039
This was a highly successful effort.

874
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:31,335
You can't call that a success.
Look at your bruises, Master.

875
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,379
- [whimsical music plays]
- That's fine.

876
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,714
Let's call it "occupational hazard."

877
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,383
[Iblis] I'm warning you.

878
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,176
- [sniffs]
- You lay another hand on me…

879
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,762
- and all people will never--
- All those threats

880
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,597
made no difference to her. [scoffs]

881
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,518
It's not as easy as I thought it would be.
It's been tricky.

882
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,146
I just need to take
a few more punches, that's all.

883
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,525
I think you took a few too many
to the head already.

884
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,945
[chuckles softly]

SA FAMILY GAMJA-TANG

886
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:05,702
You had a traumatic fire-and-water fight,
yet you can still somehow eat gamja-tang?

887
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,955
- It's Wednesday.
- Yes, it is.

888
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,374
And while we're talking
about the restaurant,

889
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,751
maybe we can eat somewhere else next time.

890
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,295
It's Wednesday night. This is how it is.

891
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:19,007
- This routine is our friendship.
- Not really. Listen up, all right?

892
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,760
All throughout our years in school,
you took on anyone who hurt me.

893
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,887
- Yes.
- You also cared about my grades

894
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,722
- in literature, languages, and math.
- Yes.

895
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,266
If your grandma passes,

896
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,393
- who's gonna be your first call?
- The village chief.

897
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,480
- That's right. And after him?
- 911.

898
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,315
Of course you would.

899
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,235
- And then who?
- You.

900
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,612
That's right. Our friendship works.

901
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,989
Seafood stew next week?

902
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,786
I need gamja-tang every Wednesday!
I follow all of the routines to a tee.

903
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,372
Grandma sets the rules,
this is my routine.

904
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,916
Things go wrong
if one piece falls out of line.

905
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,295
[chuckles] Oh, no. We're not fighting.
Please don't mind us and enjoy.

906
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,884
That's not true, though.
You won't hurt anybody.

907
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,636
You've already proven yourself
in many ways.

908
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,014
That's now, but things change.

909
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,600
And when Grandma does pass on?

910
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,934
Then my rules go away.

911
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,979
And if they go away,
then I could commit murder.

912
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,147
You're not going to.

913
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,483
- You wouldn't do that.
- Do not cut me off!

914
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,027
[sighs]

915
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,863
- I haven't told you the coffin story.
- Okay. Tell me.

916
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,741
How does it start? "A coffin?"

917
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,951
- [quirky music plays]
- You wanna make a coffin?

918
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,163
Well, I've never made one before, but…

919
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:34,374
Can we start trying then?
Two coffins with Paulownia wood.

920
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,877
Oh, you wanna build coffins?

921
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,214
For dogs? So how big are they?

922
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,799
Very large, or smaller ones?

923
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:46,845
How big are you?

924
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,723
She's about your size.

925
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,683
- It's not for a dog, for my grandma.
- [hiccups]

926
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,269
I want a second one for myself.
I'm planning to die

927
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,146
- after Grandma passes away.
- [hiccups]

928
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,648
- [hiccups]
- Mmm.

929
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,816
It'll be as close
to a natural death as possible.

930
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,860
Like some equipment malfunction at sea,

931
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,321
or stumble off
the edge of a trail somewhere.

932
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,865
Those are some options. Do you understand?

933
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,700
I get what you're saying.

934
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:12,162
But do you have
to tell me about it every time?

935
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,499
- You know I'll be a mess when you die.
- I don't have other friends.

936
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,335
You're the person I tell my secrets to.
You need to keep it together.

937
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,629
Ka-young. Seriously?

938
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,965
- [somber music plays]
- [sighs] Fine.

939
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,758
I'll try to get used to it then.

940
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:29,012
But you would never, ever murder anyone.

941
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,934
Friends have blind belief in each other.

942
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,603
Is that what you're saying?
I can't do that. Sorry.

943
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,146
I don't care if you can.

944
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,108
Even if you can't do it,
I'll still love you.

945
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,903
So from now on, please, stop it.

946
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,699
- I know.
- What do you know?

947
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:52,035
I may not know feelings,
but statistics, I do know.

948
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,413
Every Wednesday, I must eat gamja-tang.

949
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,872
Over these last five years,

950
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,208
you've eaten gamja-tang with me
twice a month.

951
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,753
You often don't want to. Yet you always
show up, so I don't eat alone.

952
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,381
You come and sit with me
so others would see that

953
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,883
I'm kind of ordinary,
no different from them.

954
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,135
[Ka-young] Mmm.

955
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,345
That's how I know you love me.

956
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,140
[sighs]

957
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,812
I'm gonna get us some water.
Be right back.

- [grunts]
- [Min-ji] What's wrong with this?

964
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,041
- What were you doing in there?
- Huh?

965
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,753
Don't tell me… Were you watching us
from the water filter?

966
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:46,214
I cleaned the repair store.
I came by to give you the good news.

967
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,091
Oh, you…

[whimsical music plays]

969
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,845
Who are you talking to?
Is someone talking to you?

970
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,806
Once again, we're not fighting. We're not.

971
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,225
Keep eating. Keep eating.

972
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,436

00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,858
- [Iblis] Hmm?
- That's three bucks.

975
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:05,817
You like that thing?

976
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,945
I thought it would look good on you.

977
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:10,822
Let's go.

978
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,492
- Here's your change.
- Oh, I'll take that. Thank you.

979
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,416
It's yours.

980
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,213
Every time you put this on,
I'll know I'm the only one

981
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,422
- who can see you.
- [scoffs]

982
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,550
Everyone already thinks I'm strange.
I don't need to be even stranger.

983
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,803
It works in my favor if you are.

984
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,597
You have to give me
some incentive to wear this.

985
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,475
The least you could do is make a wish.

986
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,189
Why are you so hung up
on those damn wishes?

987
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,817
Why do you wanna kill me so badly?

988
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:51,988
[sighs] What's the point
when you don't remember any of it?

989
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:55,701
I was stuck in a lamp
for a millennium because of you.

990
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,245
Are you certain it was me?

991
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:01,665
It was.

[Iblis] Your flesh decayed
and your bones became dust as I watched.

994
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,715
I kept a handful of that dirt, too.

995
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,802
It was difficult to tempt you then,
I'll admit that.

996
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,846
But once you make a wish,
you'll be corrupted,

997
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,889
just like everyone else. [scoffs]

998
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,600
If that's true for all humans,

999
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,310
then people wouldn't call me

1000
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,604
a complete psychopath
or anything like that.

1001
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:28,442
I've never even jaywalked
or dumped my trash on the street.

My grandma says folks are generally good,

1003
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,864
I've learned I'm what's evil in the world.

1004
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,284
You're mistaken.

I've granted wishes
for thousands of years.

1008
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,545
They've all ended up corrupted
in one way or another.

1009
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,213
Then prove it to me.

1010
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:55,177
How in the world can I prove that
when we're in the middle of a road?

Best three of five.

1014
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:06,062
You'll give the first five people
we meet on this road their wishes.

1015
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,981
If three of those individuals

1016

are corrupted,

1017
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,903
then I'll make all of my wishes
and die at your hands.

- You're not afraid at all?
- Sorry, I don't know how to be afraid.

Take this and hold up
your end of the bargain.

1024
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,674
In the meantime,
I intend to be meticulous.

1025
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,552
I'll come up with two perfect wishes
that don't have any flaws.

1026
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,804
Why would you only make two?

1027
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,891
Because I'm making this one.
This is my first wish.

1028
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,185
Which is?

1029
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,230
I want you to prove it to me.

1030
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,941
That all humans are corrupt at heart.

1031
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,568
That's my first wish.

1032
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:55,946
[scoffs]

1033
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,906
[music intensifies]

1034
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,993
You've tempted me, well done.

1035
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,411
[music fades]

1036
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,540
[dramatic rock fusion music plays]

1037
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,383
[music ends]
