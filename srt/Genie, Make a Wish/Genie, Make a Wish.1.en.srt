1
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:13,680
[male voice] I am of the genie,
a spirit created from a smokeless fire.

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:19,102
We were created on Thursday,
the day after the angels were made.

3
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,358
[magical music playing]

4
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:31,030
If you can hear me
speaking in your language,

5
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,490
that is because

6
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,118
I am a genie.

7
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,911
[alarm chiming]

8
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,499
Genie, shut off the alarm.

9
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,087
[male Genie] With our supernatural
strength and magical powers,

10
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,839
we genies grew arrogant.

11
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,843
We aspired to become
the greatest of all beings.

12
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,387
But I had no interest in that.

13
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,515
Becoming greater than him.

14
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,310
[scoffs] That would be such a hassle.

15
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,191
Even so, the angels were sent down

16
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,985
with orders to decimate the haughty Genie.

17
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,823
After 300 long years,
the war finally ended.

18
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,620
And so did the lives of all genies,
save a few,

19
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,038
including my own.

20
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,167
I took refuge in a lamp.

21
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,545
Once the world was purified,

22
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,798
the very next day, Friday,

23
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,467
he created a new species to replace us.

24
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:38,097
None other than you, humans,
molded out of clay.

25
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,603
And then,
he presented to us his first human,

26
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,563
and commanded us to bow our heads.

27
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,734
All the angels and surviving genies
bowed before his creation,

28
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,071
but I refused.

29
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,030
[water trickles]

30
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,244

31
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,495
- [cup thuds]
- Ah.

00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:02,705
APRIL 5TH
FLYING OUT

33
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,834
I, created from ancient fire,

34
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,670
refused to bow my head

35
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,880
to a mortal built from clay.

36
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,801
Enraged, he threw me from heaven.

37
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,636
[thunder rumbling]

38
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,306
I fell downwards to hell
and made just one request.

39
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,601
I would accept my fate

40
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,564
on the condition that I'd be given
the task of corrupting humans

41
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,692
and landing them in hell.

42
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:38,700
I swore to show him once and for all
how pathetic his beloved mortals were.

43
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,161
He granted my request.

44
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,746
Yet, there was a catch.

45
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,081
[whimpers]

46
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,626
- You got all that?
- [barking]

47
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,172
[AI Genie] He said,
"I shall approve your request."

48
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,923
"But if you happen to meet

49
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,676
[over speaker] even one pure human soul,

50
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,387
you will fall to even greater depths
of isolation and despair…"

51
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,016
- Why is it rambling like that? What now?
- [distorted] …than hell itself.

52
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,145
[male Genie] Thus, the legend
of the three wishes was born.

53
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,647
That famous story you humans all know of.

54
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:15,445
I left hell, inhabiting vessels
like lamps, rings, and jars.

55
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,536
Those who summoned me
were granted three wishes.

56
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,998
Humans are lazy, selfish, arrogant.

57
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:30,835
Never satisfied with their lot
and eager to betray each other.

58
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,464
And so they corrupted themselves,
while I was vindicated.

59
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,343
I saw the fall of mortals.

60
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,637
But you…

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,348
you, from that small land in the East,

62
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,266
even as you drew your final breaths,

63
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,644
you spent your three wishes on others.

64
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,938
[scoffs] This cannot stand.

65
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,775
You little girl.
Little girl molded from clay.

66
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,902
You small, dying human.

67
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,113
I shall observe your death.

68
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,450
I shall take up a handful of dirt,

69
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,786
dirt made from your flesh and bones.

70
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,455
My lamp may be buried even deeper

71
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,166
than the depths of darkness
because of you.

72
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,962
But even so, I will not bow my head
to one so lowly as you,

73
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,755
who was molded from clay.

74
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,174
I shall remember your gaze.

75
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,969
I shall remember the smell of your clay.

76
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,888
If a new master should summon me

77
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,892
so that I am able to be
of this world again, then…

78
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,605
I will search every corner
until I find your soul.

79
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,942
I shall do whatever it takes
to corrupt you,

80
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,986
and kill you.

81
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,821
Remember this,

82
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,031
for I will seek you out.

83
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,409
- [wind gusting]
- My name…

84
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,496
is Iblis.

Gogung set. Thank you.

88
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,523
Just a few minutes.

89
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,706
[sighs] I need you to stop.
Stop doing this.

90
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,458
Every year, you come here.

91
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,793
You think I didn't notice?

92
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,630
The same table on the same day,
every year for ten years.

93
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,882
Enough already.

94
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,383
I've been aware of you.

95
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,718
Of course you're aware.

96
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:30,014
After all, those bags of cash dropped off
by my aunt these last ten years

97
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,141
have given her the chance
to take pictures of me.

98
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,602
Right, Mother?

99
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,229

My sister says not to worry about money.

101
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,071
- Just look after of Ka-young.
- Look after her?

102
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,115
Am I to be her mother now?
Is that it?

103
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,200
Just make sure
she doesn't look for her real mother.

104
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,744
- For God's sake! That wretched bitch!
- [gasps]

105
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,205
So her mother's dead. Is that it?

106
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,998
What person does that?

107
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,876
Good God! She's a little girl.

108
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,422
She just abandoned her baby girl
for being difficult!

[Ka-young] That's when
Grandma started her chili garden.

113
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,289
Each year, it grew more and more,
her chilies taking over…

114
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,623
Just stop this.

115
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,542
Say what you mean.

116
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,253
- Don't be so mysterious about it.
- Stop interrupting.

Are you kidding?

You must be glad to get your ID.

Yeah, thrilled.

I did some research.

132

My mother bought this building
and gave it to you to manage for her.

133

Where have they gone?

You know as well as I do why I left you.

142
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,342
I see the money I sent wasn't wasted.

143
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:15,471
I paid for that. Full price too.
Earned entirely on my own.

144
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,849
Your contributions
were all given to charity.

These hands?

146
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:27,316
You must not have bothered
to even ask my aunt what I do for work.

147
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,320
My work involves cuts, scratches, burns.

148
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,405
Now you're wondering

149
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,157
if you have a murderer for a daughter.

I know that look.

153
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,880
You're so afraid.

How about fear? Do you feel that?

00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,849
You know I abandoned you
because you can't.

[woman] The thing is, ma'am,

162
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,320
someone like Ka-young
cannot be taught these things.

163
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,654
But why?

164
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,157
We have a duty to try, don't we?

165
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,492
I don't care what everyone says.

Please, at least tell me about the class.

during with the frog dissection?

Did she not do it properly?

No. She actually did it perfectly.

Forgive me… why am I here, then?

172
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,678
That class was over
two months ago, in April.

All Ka-young wants to do is dissect frogs.

why we don't do it more.

00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,456
Grandma! Grandma, that hurts!

181
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,583
- The frog is in pain too.
- [whimpers]

182
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,127
The frog can't even tell you
how much it hurts!

183
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,629
Damn you!

184
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,257
[young Ka-young gasping and whimpering]

185
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,803
[suffocates]
I can't breathe! Let go!

186
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,055
- [wheezing]
- Grandma can't breathe either.

187
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,265
[grunting] Let me go!

188
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,935
I'll kill you, Grandma!
I'm gonna kill you!

189
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,728
- [wheezing]
- Let me go, okay?

190
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,855
If you let me go, I'll let you go.

191
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,898
[grunting]

192
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,233
[bones crunching softly]

193
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,859
[grunts and gasps]

194
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,945
[sentimental music plays]

195
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,699
[grunting]

196
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,831
Grandma, that hurts!

197
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,041
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

198
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,460
[gasping heavily]

199
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,172
If you hug someone, I will hug you too.

200
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,590
[whimpers]

201
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:00,010
But if you cut someone,
then I will cut you too.

202
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:00,928
[whimpers]

203
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,638
And if you kill someone,

204
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,808
I will kill you too.

205
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,062
These are our rules, Ka-young. Got it?

206
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,357
[whimpers] It hurts! Let me go!

207
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,109
Remember the pain.

208
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,111
The pain will help you learn.

209
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,822
You must memorize it.

210
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,115
[cries]

211
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,199
Ka-young.

212
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,453
Memorize my face, okay?

213
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,620
This is sorrow.

214
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,747
When I'm like this,

215
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,793
when I have this look, it means that

216
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,961
you'll die,

217
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,047
and I die along with you. Understand?

218
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,883
[crying]

219
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,511
[sobs]

220
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,722
I forgot it!

221
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,809
I forgot the face! Do it again!

222
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,437
[continues sobbing]

223
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,606
[both sobbing]

224
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,983
[sentimental music continues]

225
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,211
[sobbing continues]

226
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,926
[sniffles]

227
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,096
I'm better now. I'm not sad.

228
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,807
This face is hopeful.

229
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,018
A hopeful face.

230
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,563
[laughing]

231
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,067
[Ka-young] So after that,

232
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,861
I never hurt anything. I had rules.

233
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,821
But, you know,

234
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,950
life after that stopped being fun.

235
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,660
I'm so bored, Mom.

236
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,119
So what are you saying--

237
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,704
Don't interrupt me. Got it?

238
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,373
[breathes shakily]

239
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,667
I dramas, they cry.

240
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,628
Those soap operas,
they just sob their eyes out.

241
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,839
I've always wondered, would Mom cry?

242
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,509
I suppose I was… curious.

243
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,887
Alas, neither of us is crying.

244
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,307
Grandma sometimes cries in secret.

245
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,059
I assume that…

246
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,185
it's because of me.

247
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,228
[breath shudders]

248
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,312
It would make sense.

249
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,774
But if Grandma ever cries again
because of you…

250
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,445
then I will wrap my hands
around your neck.

251
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,783
Until you can't make
any expression at all.

252
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,701
Until the end.

253
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,703
[tense music plays]

254
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,916
I came to tell you this
in case you finally talk to me.

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,501
Now that you have…

256
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,462
I won't return.

257
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,009
Farewell, Mom.

258
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,768
[watch ticking]

259
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,956
[breathes heavily]

260
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,637
[cell phone vibrates]

261
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,222
THIS IS DUBI-DUBAI TOURS
PLEASE BRING AN EXTRA LAYER

262
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,439
[camel snorts]

263
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,398
[both] Yeah!

264
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,862
- [laughter]
- [woman] Oh, my goodness! It's so amazing!

265
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,030
Say "Dubai!"

266
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,365
Dubai!

267
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,993
[imitates in dull tone] Dubai!

268
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,995
[woman] Dubai!

269
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,372
[woman chuckles]

270
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,540
Do you see that dust cloud there?

271
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,792
In Arabic culture,

272
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:04,213
they refer to that phenomenon
as the "waltzing genie."

273
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,923
- [woman gasps]
- [girl] No way. The Genie?

274
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,633
You mean like a lamp genie? [gasps]

275
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,093
Wow, incredible!

276
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,929
[guide] All right, everyone.
It looks like a sandstorm could form soon.

277
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,847
Are you all set to continue onwards?

278
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,849
[laughs] You forgot we're Korean!

279
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,019
Right, masks on, everyone. Let's go!

280
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,313
[guide] We still have about an hour,

281
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,399
- so feel free to keep taking photos.
- Whoo-hoo!

282
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,317
- [tourists] Okay.
- A waltz is a duo.

283
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,195
That cloud is all alone. Ridiculous.

284
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,322
Oh, you're right. That's really strange.

285
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,282
Wow, you're right!

286
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,661
My goodness, dear. You're hilarious!

287
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,704
[laughing]

288
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,664
Gosh. Honestly. So--

289
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,416
Which resort are you staying at?

290
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,502
Whoa! Look at the genie! [exclaims]

291
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,504
[girl] Mom. Mom, wait for me.

292
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,632
[woman] Waltz! Waltz!

293
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,384

294
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,985
[cell phone vibrates]

295
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,321
[Min-ji] How's the desert?

296
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,534
CHOI MIN-JI

297
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,370
[Ka-young] Vast, hot, and windy.

298
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,290
Perfect for burying a family of four.

299
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,792
[Min-ji] Stop that!
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock

300
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,257
- [exhales deeply]
- [watch ticking]

[grunts]

303
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,351
[mysterious music plays]

304
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,284
[shouting] Why are you in my way?

305
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,410
[lamp thuds]

306
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,954
You abandoned your daughter.

307
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,456
[lamp thuds]

308
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,459
What pain did I cause you?
Your damn face of fear!

309
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:09,129
You didn't even pretend.
Rubbing your amazing skin in my face!

310
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,298
Your life was so…

311
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,133
[grunts, pants]

312
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,218
easy.

313
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,846
That Gogung meal isn't even good.

314
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,973
And you overcharge!

315
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:20,891
[lamp thuds]

316
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,893
[panting]

317
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,365
[gasps] Huh?

318
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,701
How'd that lamp get back here?

319
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,164
Who did that?

320
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,625
Show yourself, you coward!

321
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,419
[wind rumbling]

322
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,588
[breathing heavily]

323
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,137
Hmm.

324
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,556
[rattling]

325
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,558
[muffled male voice] Whoa!
Why are we shaking?

326
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,475
[rattling]

327
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,726
What's going on?

328
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,937
What's all this noise?

329
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,605
- [rattling]
- [groans loudly]

330
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,149
Ejllael! Stop that!

331
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,317
[wind blowing]

332
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,156
[captivating music plays]

[wind gusting]

334
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,456
[woman] Whoa!
Now that's what I call the waltz!

335
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,666
[woman laughs excitedly]

336
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,210
[girl] Wow, amazing. It's incredible!

337
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,296
[wind continues gusting]

338
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,102
[captivating music continues]

339
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,496
[Iblis scoffs]

340
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,835
One move and I kill you.

341
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:13,962
[scoffs softly]

342
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,966
Your hair…

343
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,678
Who are you? You followed me?

344
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,433
[sniffing]

345
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,230
I said don't move.

346
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,858
That smell,

347
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,152
it's the clay.

348
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,278
The same one.

349
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,072
It's you…

350
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,783
all those years ago.

351
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,660
[chuckles softly]

352
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,120
It's been almost a millennium.

353
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,414
[grunts]

354
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,541
Yikes, I almost got stabbed. [grunting]

355
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,796
[panting]

356
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,134
Huh?

357
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,011
[Ka-young] Who is this moron?

358
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,847
WHO IS THIS MORON?
[Iblis] "Who is this moron?"

359
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,602
I am an ancient spirit. Older than time.

360
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,770
[Iblis clears throat]

361
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,897
All right. Listen, young girl.

362
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,566
My name… [grunts]

363
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,943
is Iblis.

364
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,737
I was created from smokeless… [gags]

365
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,532
Did you have to shake the lamp that hard?

366
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,700
[sniffs]

367
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,742
[clears throat]

368
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,955
People know me as… [gags]

369
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,456
as…

370
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,791
[retching]

371
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,669
You shook it too much.

372
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,587
[retching]

373
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,965
Hey, wait.

374
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,342
My lamp.

375
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,469
I told you to wait. I know you're her.

376
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,846
[grunts]

377
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,806
I am the Genie!

378
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,433
[Iblis pants]

379
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,144
The spirit of the lamp,
the Genie, you know!

380
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,944
[mysterious music plays]

381
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:08,910
This is its real length, but I usually
wear it nice and short like earlier.

382
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,247
[chuckles softly]

383
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,498
Okay.

384
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,501
This is…

385
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,337
unexpected.

386
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,671
How'd you get in here?

387
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,215
Well, I did say quite loudly earlier.

388
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,134
I am the Genie of the lamp.

389
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,184
I can go anywhere I desire, "Ki Ka-young."

390
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,562
You speak my language
but you butcher my name?

391
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,189
[laughing]

392
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,441
It appears you don't yet grasp
what's happening.

393
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,609
So listen carefully.

394
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,612
I never listen to anyone.
I only listen to my grandmother.

395
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,447
Then consider me
your grandmother of the lamp.

396
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,075
Just by being here, I'm going against her.
So screw off!

397
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,535
That's the opposite of what you just said.

398
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,205
983 years ago, remember?

399
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,540
Do you not remember at all?

400
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,250
You forgot already?

401
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,003
Well, 983 years ago…

402
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,422
Goryeo dynasty?

403
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,633
Choi Soo-jong was playing
the army general,

404
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,010
- was going on about some king or another…
- [groaning]

405
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,221
…before the whole thing fell.
You realize I wasn't there!

406
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,764
You sure we go that far back?

407
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,600
Yes, we go that far back!
Look how long my hair has grown.

408
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,520
[sighs] Wow. It takes time, you know.

409
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,646
Sure.

410
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,565
You're telling me,
during all that time, your hair grew,

411
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,984
- but your beard didn't?
- [gasps]

412
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,072
Of course…

413
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,076
I can see why you ask that, but…

414
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,454
Well, I'm very self-conscious
and I like to change the subject.

415
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,580
So just cooperate.

416
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,834
You know how bad it was
living in that lamp for 983 years?

417
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,751
I'll cooperate.

418
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,212
Just how bad was it?

419
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,174
[sighs] It took away my dignity.
[chuckles dryly]

420
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,429
Goryeo. Goryeo. Where's Goryeo?

421
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,724
Once I get out,
I'll obliterate it! [pants]

422
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,686
[animal growling] The thing is, Master,
the land called "Goryeo"

423
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:04,192
no longer exists as it was overthrown
by someone called "Yi Seong-gye."

424
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,487
They also believe
in the cycle of death and rebirth.

425
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,740
Something "carnage," was it?

426
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,285
Reincarnation.

427
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,537
[chuckles softly]

428
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,122
There is reincarnation.

429
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,040
[sighs]

430
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,251
Sade, you need to go
to that country this instant.

431
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,587
Search it.

432
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,006
Don't stop until
you've scoured every corner.

433
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,135
See if that girl lives again.

434
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,432
- [growling]
- [suspenseful music plays]

435
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,948
Oh. Excuse me. Uh…

436
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,993
[sighs]

437
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,828
- Oh, excuse me.
- [man grunts softly]

438
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,790
Oh. Oh. Ah.

439
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,043
- Uh, have you…
- Hmm?

440
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,003
Have you seen a woman like this?

441
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,257
[man 2] I'm not sure. I don't think
I've seen her around these parts.

442
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,720
[pillar crumbling]

443
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,727
[grunting]

444
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,437
[screaming]

445
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,066
[Iblis] Even after 600 years had passed,
I upheld my dignity.

446
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,609
Though…
F U

447
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,278
…the lamp took a bit of a beating.

448
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,529
- [grunts]
- [rumbling]

449
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,656
[panting]

450
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,617
[sighs]

451
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,661
Being here is getting old.

452
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,748
Why do I only get one piece of furniture?
I can't even lie down on it.

453
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,334
I know you're listening!

454
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,254
Hello?

455
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,296
F U

456
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,381
Huh?

457
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,883
F U

458
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,805
[breathes heavily]

459
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,099
That girl.

460
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,811
I'm coming for you, lump of clay!

461
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:07,774
[Sade] Something called an automobile
has been invented, Master!

462
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:11,403
They're big things with wheels
that roll around on their own.

463
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:15,115
I'm telling you so you're not alarmed
or act too old-fashioned when you're out.

464
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,866
[Iblis] Sade would come by
from time to time

465
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,743
to let me know how the world had changed.

466
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,579
Oh, also, when I visited the East,

467
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,541
I took on a new local body and face,

468
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,043
and it's my favorite one.

469
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,753
It's got perks, like,

470
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,882
my lady of the household
keeps giving me food.

471
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,970
Then, at year 800,

472
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,098
I was becoming frustrated, you know.

473
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,101
I had sent so many humans to hell.

474
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:47,230
And out of all those humans,
only one had a pure soul.

475
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,898
So why was I getting the blame?

476
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,942
Am I right? Huh?

477
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,989
It's strange.
I was actually missing you so much.

478
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:59,117
I yearned for your reincarnation, hoping…

479
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,496
that you yearned to meet
a spirit like me as well.

480
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,291
I dreamt of so many ways to ruin you

481
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,960
and so many ways to cause you pain.

482
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,462
And then,

483
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,630
when the 900th year grew near, I prayed.

484
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,507
I called out.

485
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,844
Please give me one more…

486
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,304
[snoring]

487
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,515
Hey.

488
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,062
You're sleeping before a genie?
Wait, when did you stop listening?

489
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,147
Did you make it to the 600th year?

490
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,108
Do I have to start over?

491
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,736
Seriously?

492
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,780
[sighs]

493
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,033
[rattling]

494
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,512
What the hell does that say?

495
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,640
[Iblis] It says you shouldn't shake it,

496
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,975
or an ill-tempered genie might get angry.

497
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,353
[chuckles]

498
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,189
But you were actually decent at first.
Even alluring.

499
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,316
I really appreciate that.

500
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,611
- So you were listening.
- Only because it finally got interesting.

501
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:17,654
Hmm?

502
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,950
I mean, less boring in general.

503
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,287
So after you prayed, then what?
He responded?

504
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,247
[huffs]

505
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:28,957
Oh, yes.

506
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,670
[fireworks crackling and booming]

507
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,214
[upbeat music playing]

508
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,467
[God] Dear Iblis,

509
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,096
I shall fulfill your requests.

510
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:51,396
Yet, should the day come
when you prostrate to my creations again,

511
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,276
you will be beheaded.

512
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,404
What did you pray for?

513
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,656
"Please, give me one more."

514
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,782
"One more…"

515
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,783
[sighs]

516
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,910
Chance.

517
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,038
Please…

518
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,002
I beg you. One more chance.

519
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,422
If a creation of yours summons me

520
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,133
and becomes my new master,

521
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,179
if they are a truly righteous human,

522
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,015
I will banish myself to hell forevermore.

523
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:29,976
[sighs]

524
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,229
But if I am able to corrupt them…

525
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,944
then I will be freed!

526
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:44,157
I ask you, then, grant me the freedom
to move as I wish between heaven and hell.

527
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,369
Sure. Things wouldn't be that different,

528
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,705
but it's in the details. Yeah?

529
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,999
Yeah?

530
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,252
- [sighs]
- [rumbling]

531
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,172
- [grunting and groaning]
- [comical music plays]

532
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,386
And at long last…

533
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:06,846
[gasps]

534
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,556
…a new master appeared.

535
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,474
[gasps]

536
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,062
But after all that, it's you again?

537
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,731
- [smooth jazz plays]
- I thought it'd be good.

538
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,733
But you haven't exactly been playing fair.

539
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,859
Not fair how?

540
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,278
Well, you clearly do not fear
or respect me.

541
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,781
But you are just a human.

542
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,616
This time, I shall prove him wrong.

543
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,701
I'll show how corruptible humans are.

544
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,621
How terrible his creation really is.

545
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,539
Ha!

546
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,249
Huh?

547
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,292
Why are you bothering me
with all this nonsense?

548
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,044
- I'm eating.
- Hmm?

549
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,507
- Hmm?
- So, what do you want from me?

550
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,508
Oh.

551
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,719
Have we not discussed that yet?

552
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,139
Oh, that's right.

553
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,184
I want all your wishes.

554
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,520
Not one, not two, but all three.

555
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,063
Few ground rules.

556
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,482
No bringing back the dead.

557
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,860
No traveling to the future.

558
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,404
Otherwise, anything you want,

559
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,739
your wish…

560
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,450
is my command.

561
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,451
[ting]

562
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,495

[chuckles]

564
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,833
Your look is alluring…

565
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,293
to tempt me.

566
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,463
That's right. Any sin you desire.

567
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,965
You're evil.

568
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,259
Huh? It's that obvious?

569
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,679
You're right, I suppose.

570
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,891
- I've been evil since before Christ.
- We're done.

571
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,435
Or my first wish will be for you to die.

572
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,978
Hey, hey. [laughs]

573
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,439
It's strange that you were born like this.

574
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,400
Was that version of you
all those years ago just pulling my leg?

575
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,111
Or were you not actually virtuous,
just inarticulate?

576
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,782
I was virtuous?

577
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,244
Me?

578
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:58,374
Master! The girl was finally reincarnated!

579
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:04,797
But a war broke out and she died valiantly
fighting alongside a certain admiral!

580
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,635
Well, it was Yi Sun-sin!

581
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,930
I have located the girl once more!

582
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,973
But she has already died!

583
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,143
This time, she was helping
another soul again.

584
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,146
Ah, it was Ahn Jung-geun!

585
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,274
You were selfless and noble
for three of your lives,

586
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,068
but I guess this one is different.

587
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,278
Given how much
you like brandishing knifes.

588
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,781
[grunts] It's actually great.

589
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,909
Yes, let's corrupt you properly this time.

590
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:36,287
Now, at its core,
corruption requires pleasure. Hmm.

591
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:41,209
Master, I shall bestow
the greatest pleasures upon you today.

592
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,086
- Bring me a camel!
- [gong rings]

593
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,879
I've called an Uber.

594
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,591
Hmm? What is an "Uber"?

595
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,802
We don't ride camels now, only Ubers.

596
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,846
Right. And an Uber is?

597
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,848
[amusing music plays]

598
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,266
And why should I tell you?

599
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,519
Stop talking in circles.

600
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,312
[Iblis groans]

601
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,357
Actually… [chuckles]

602
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,693
I admire your propensity for rudeness.

603
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,821
Uber? Right,
it's been almost a millennium.

604
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,572
The world has surely evolved quite a bit.

605
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,076
So it's obvious
that I would be a smitch confused.

606
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,661
I shall remain calm.

607
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,162

My servant didn't say there were
two-wheeled things as well as four!

- Whoopsie.

- What is that?

619
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,861
It's making an evil sound.

620
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,071
- Ugh.

Right now? Just sightseeing.

624
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,622
[grandma] All right. Good.

625
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,499
You're taking your medication?

626

who speak out of line.

And forget any men who call you beautiful.

631
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:18,723
If any men won't let you in peace,
you just let me handle it. All right?

632
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,224
[Ka-young] She says to put you on.

633
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,976
[Iblis] Put what on? A new face?

634
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,562
But this face is designed
to be attracted to anyone

635
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,856
- for the next thousand years.
- I'm-- I'm not understanding.

636
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,608
Was that a man with her?

637
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,985
Who's speaking?

638
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,279
Ka-young? Hel-- [blows]

Um, hello?

640
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,618
[Ka-young] The reason I haven't killed
anyone was because of my grandma's rule.

641
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,456
I dealt with the urge in other ways.
Nothing beats fatigue.

642
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,373
[man] Uh, beating?

643
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,292
Oh, wait. Oh… [chuckles]

644
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,547
- Nothing beats fatigue. Got it. [laughs]
- [Ka-young] Yeah.

645

Every day from when I was eight
until I went to college, my grandma and I

would plant sesame, harvest sesame,
plant chilies, harvest chilies.

that I just wanted to…

- [ominous music plays]
- …murder something.

- Don't call me that.
- Uh-huh.

THEN WHAT'S WITH THE ATTITUDE?

659
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,084

- Yes.

Um, you're just so scary
and still funny. [chuckling]

664
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,309
By the way, I'm just so curious.

665
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,437
Do psychopaths
really not know what love is?

666
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,232
Like, being willing to sacrifice yourself
for another? [chuckles]

667
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,608
I think I could kill…

668
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,069
for another person.

669
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,655
Does that count as love?

- Right.

00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,685
I'll buy them that.

00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,230
I suppose there's a mall around?

Ah. I was just making a joke.

[girl] What in the world?
She's so strange.

717
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:17,044
Oh. I'm only visible to you.
One of my magical quirks.

718
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,630
Oh, you asshole.

719
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,882
You son of a bitch
that can't even grow a beard.

720
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,551
You and your stupidly long hair.

721
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,512
Why can't you pester someone else?
I told you to piss off!

722
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,307
Why the fuck can't anyone else see you?
I look crazy!

723
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,476
Well, you're corrupt already.

724
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,021
Amazingly corrupt.

725
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,939
All right. That means we're almost there.

726
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,190
Hmm?

Hi. How are you?

733
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,753
Ooh, that's salty.

734
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,630
Wow.

One dirham.

741

One dirham.

742
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,112
- [man] One dirham? Just one?
- Yes. One dirham.

743
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,697

This is insanity.

750
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,128
Just try and throw me out again.

751
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,840
I can't leave your side.
We're tied together.

[coin clinks]

753
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,513
Maybe I could swap you out.

754
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,433
- Are you the only genie?
- No.

755
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,602
But I'm the most famous genie.

761
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,972
What? Do all genies look the same?

762
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,310
Are you familiar
with a genie with long hair?

763
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,603
Yes, I am.

764
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,566
I can just tell you're looking for a way
to defeat or eliminate him.

765
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,777
And you are perhaps
thinking of fighting magic with magic?

766
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,406
[chuckles] I've never thought of that.
A very refreshing approach.

767
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:54,493
But this spirit, he's the only genie
in this world who grants wishes.

768
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,372
If you've seen him, you'd know.

769
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,876
There's no space he can't inhabit,
and he's perfect from head to toe.

770
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,836
The walking epitome of dignity.

771
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,380
Weaknesses? Drawbacks? What even are they?

772
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,965
But getting rid of him is easy.

773
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:08,883
He will leave

774
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,969
once your wishes
have been made. [chuckles]

775
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,721

Stop tricking me.

778
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,810
[chuckles] That was pretty painful.

779
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,396
You've been anything but fair
and righteous and dignified yourself.

780
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,939
You rubbed every lamp you could find.

781
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,358
That's from The Art of War. Fantastic.

782
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,276
Hmm.

783
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:32,156
If you lose the upper hand,
just change the subject.

784
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,618
You pinned your hair. It's pretty.

786
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,038
I have far too much of it to carry around.

787
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,706
But it's obvious that you're lying.

788

If the conversation gets awkward,
just make it even more awkward.

How is it you know my language?

[smacks lips]

792
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:57,806
Oh, I'm not speaking in your language,
I'm speaking in Arabic.

793
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,225
Being a Genie means

794
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,269
it always sounds like
I'm speaking the local tongue.

795
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,563
- So speak in Arabic.
- What?

796
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,941
Well, you're not Arabic. It's impossible.

797
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,026
Well, I'm not a person either.

798
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,905
[in Arabic] How much is this?
Where is the toilet?

- Terrible Arabic.

00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,497
That's subjective.

804
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,332
Have you always been so aggressive?

805
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,292
If so, that's pretty good news.

Do you remember nothing?

- I see you give as well as you take.
- Hmm.

Did that answer it?
What was it you said? Vampire?

00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,900
Wow.

824
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:14,610
Wow.

- Wow.

You really are a genie.

Allow me to scream now from sheer joy.

I'm familiar with that reaction.

Wait, what's that look?

834
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,114
I've never seen that expression.

835
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,491
This is real happiness.

836
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,618
Happiness?

837
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,286
Hmm…

838
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,831
- Does that mean you have a wish?
- No.

839
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,042
I finally have a chance.

840
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,336
The perfect location.

Hmm?

Don't tell my grandma, okay?

[disquieting music fading in]

Unexpected. You startled me.

You startled me.

854
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,092
Most would be alarmed
after they've killed someone,

855

[bones shuffling]

857
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,724
I should have slowed down.
Don't you think?

858
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,394
Your arm broke first? Not your skull?

859
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,273
Depends on the rotations.

860
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,319
Also if it's a straight drop
or if you hit the side of the building.

861
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,864
I hit the building,
so I flew back a little sooner.

862
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,285
My skull was indeed broken,
but I repaired myself on my way back up.

Uh-huh?

864
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,541

If you know this look,

- Make it.
- [grunts]

None of my wishes

won't benefit in any way, I see that now.

889
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,110
Clever.

That's right.
