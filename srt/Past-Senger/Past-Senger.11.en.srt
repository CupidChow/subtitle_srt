(Previous Episode)
The more I see you,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,402
the more I get confused.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,258
It's like…

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,915
I like you.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,375
Bamee!

6
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:17,448
Ouch!

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,837
How could you do this to me?

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,700
Taking him to places
he's been to doesn't work.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,624
Giving him things he's been impressed with,
he can't remember.

10
00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:27,922
I think we have to use
the maximum level

11
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:29,194
to make him remember.

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,357
What is the maximum level?

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,384
Depends on how intimate
the two of you got.

14
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:41,732
I'm sorry for being mean to you.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,562
Can you remember now?

<i>I will not cross the line.</i>

40
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:05,872
Hey, Bamee.

41
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:06,985
Yes?

42
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:09,835
I'll bring the apron
and put it on for you.

43
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:10,598
Just wait a second.

44
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:13,151
I can do it myself.

45
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:14,667
Why?

46
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:15,720
Normally,

47
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:17,731
you'll sweetly ask me
to do it for you.

48
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,965
Why do you want to wear it
by yourself this time?

49
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:25,624
Did I do something to make you mad?

50
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:27,581
No,

51
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,496
I just saw that you were
into doing the puzzle.

52
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:31,571
I don't want to interrupt.

53
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:48,320
Bamee,

54
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:49,979
let's do the puzzle together.

55
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,976
Are you smiling at me?

56
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:04,256
I was smiling at Soda,

57
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:06,287
but then you came
and I turned to look at you.

58
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:18,359
An iced Americano, please.

59
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,671
I see you at the campus.

60
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:24,143
I see you at home.

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,940
And now you'll following me here!

62
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,611
Won't you give me some private space?

63
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:30,405
You can have your private space.

64
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,434
I won't interfere.

65
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:36,325
You are the burden
I have to take home every day.

66
00:04:36,445 --> 00:04:37,926
How could you say
that you don't interfere?

67
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:41,076
Aunt Pim told me to go home with Bamee.

68
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:44,246
If you don't want to have a burden,
don't take us home.

69
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:46,766
You mess with me.

70
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:07,246
- What would you like?
- Green tea please.

71
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:08,302
Okay.

72
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:17,123
I'll definitely do it for you.

73
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:22,399
What did the customer order?

74
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:26,952
Come read closer.

75
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:43,085
Ouch.

76
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:45,811
You can do it gently.

77
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:09,324
Bamee,

78
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:11,466
I'm hungry.

79
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,192
Let's find some delicious food to eat.

80
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:18,274
If I go,

81
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:20,671
that crazy man will go with us.

82
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:23,393
Let's sneak out together next time.

83
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:30,098
Okay.

84
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:47,489
We're home!

85
00:06:48,426 --> 00:06:49,274
Is this your home?

86
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,630
Aunt Pim told me
to make myself at home.

87
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:56,671
The food is ready just in time.

88
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:01,826
Wow, they look so yummy, aunt Pim.

89
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:05,739
Err…

90
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,726
it's you!

91
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:10,497
You keep calling mommy as aunt Pim.

92
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:12,464
I get confused now.

93
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:14,448
Now you blamed me!

94
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:19,241
I miss you so much, mommy.

95
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,679
You're being too sweet.

96
00:07:23,316 --> 00:07:25,040
Let me wash my hands first.

97
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:32,174
Hey, don't you wash your hands
before eating?

98
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:34,625
I have a sincere heart and clean hands.

99
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:35,618
I don't have to wash them.

100
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:37,176
You're disgusting!

101
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:39,635
Come, let's eat.

102
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:44,542
Shit,

103
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:46,814
if I keep calling her as aunt Pim,
I'll get caught.

104
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:51,265
You have to be more careful, Bamee!

105
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:13,146
Stop doing things for me.

106
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:14,993
I can't remember you anyway.

107
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:17,710
If I don't do it,
your memories will be even worse.

108
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:19,297
I'll do it.

109
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,035
Plawan told me
you had a severe headache today.

110
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:26,357
Are you feeling alright now?

111
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:28,794
I'm feeling alright now.

112
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:32,986
Are you a reporter?

113
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,968
Why did you have to report to my mom
and made her worried?

114
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,125
I didn't make her worried,

115
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:38,356
I just informed her.

116
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:41,089
Well, you just had
a motorcycle accident.

117
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:42,968
In case your symptoms get worse,

118
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:44,970
we can take you to the doctor in time.

119
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:49,310
If you have any symptoms,
you must tell me right away.

120
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,773
Don't hide it from me.

121
00:08:51,256 --> 00:08:52,456
Yes, mommy.

122
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:01,135
Mommy, do you want some shrimps?

123
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:02,562
Yeah, sure.

124
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:11,645
Come in. I didn't lock the door.

125
00:09:18,428 --> 00:09:19,197
Bamee,

126
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,685
you haven't come to my room for ages.

127
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,285
Is there anything I can do for you?

128
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,445
But if you ask me to push Kiew away,

129
00:09:25,446 --> 00:09:26,526
I won't help you.

130
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:36,376
I just want to talk to you.

131
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:39,731
I'm sorry

132
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:40,965
about Plawan.

133
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:51,491
Are you fully conscious now?

134
00:09:53,565 --> 00:09:54,084
Yeah.

135
00:09:57,486 --> 00:09:58,935
So, can you remember Kiew now?

136
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:04,098
Not yet.

137
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:08,967
You're conscious now,

138
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:10,443
your brain will function well soon.

139
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:11,092
Good luck!

140
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:46,846
Wait!

141
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:53,186
We haven't talked lately like we used to.

142
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,826
You'd better spend your time for work.

143
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:58,858
I get used to talking to myself
and being by myself.

144
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:02,151
You know that I have to work.

145
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:05,066
Then you'd better
spend your time for work.

146
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,280
I'm fine being by myself.

147
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:08,597
It's fine.

148
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:12,118
Wait for me a little bit, mommy.

149
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:19,482
<i>I want you to know.</i>

150
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:21,525
What's up?

151
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:33,064
Bamee called to apologize to you
and apologized to Moodaeng?

152
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:36,075
Yeah, that's why I called
to let you know first.

153
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:38,376
Bamee's being more sensible now.

154
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:40,436
He'll remember you soon.

155
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:42,393
I'm starting to
see the light at the tunnel.

156
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:44,893
Thank you for telling me.

157
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:12,466
Oops!

158
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:15,615
Apologize to me too!

159
00:12:16,658 --> 00:12:17,083
About what?

160
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,049
For being mean to me.

161
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,934
If you don't stop monitoring me,

162
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:24,754
I will be even meaner.

163
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:30,700
I like you.

164
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:38,607
Are you drunk?

165
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:02,046
Wow, they look so yummy, aunt Pim.

166
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:05,949
Err…

167
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,073
it's you!

168
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:13,791
Bamee called to apologize to you
and apologized to Moodaeng?

169
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:44,694
Bamee,

170
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,365
we still have some time
before class starts.

171
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:47,333
Do you wanna have some coffee?

172
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:51,139
Err, I'm meeting with Baiwan.

173
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:52,552
Maybe next time.

174
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:53,556
I gotta go now.

175
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:08,965
Come talk to me.

176
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:16,288
Ouch, it hurts.

177
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:18,228
Ouch.

178
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,151
What's wrong now?

179
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,094
Since when you could remember me?

180
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:28,673
I can't remember you even for a bit.

181
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:30,509
You are dreaming.

182
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:35,071
You called aunt Pim as mommy,

183
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:37,547
but the other day you called her
as Aunt Pim.

184
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:39,777
You apologized to Moodaeng and Plawan.

185
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:41,641
You keep your distance with Soda.

186
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,241
And last night when I was asleep,
you touched my face.

187
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,157
I told you all the reasons I have.

188
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:53,947
Soda and I...

189
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:55,683
are still very close.

190
00:16:57,054 --> 00:16:58,271
Last night you said you were asleep.

191
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:00,796
How did you know I touched your face?

192
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:05,862
You're imagining
these all by yourself.

193
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:14,455
<i>It's the bond
that shouldn't cross the line.</i>

194
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:19,945
<i>My right is to just be your friend only.</i>

195
00:17:19,946 --> 00:17:22,985
<i>I want you to know.</i>

196
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:25,695
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

197
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:31,425
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

198
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,235
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

199
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:37,095
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

200
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:39,275
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

201
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:42,715
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

202
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:47,926
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>

203
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:24,813
Bamee loves you very much.

204
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:27,289
If his memories are restored,

205
00:18:27,736 --> 00:18:29,383
there's no reason
that he doesn't tell you.

206
00:18:33,056 --> 00:18:35,433
If Kiew's remarks are true,

207
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:38,301
it's possible that.

208
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,067
Bamee's memories are restored.

209
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:45,313
Or partially restored,

210
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,539
but not your part yet.

211
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:51,246
I'm confident that
he can remember me now.

212
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:55,459
But I have no idea
why he didn't accept it.

213
00:18:58,486 --> 00:18:59,996
If you're confident,

214
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,008
you have to find a way for him
to confess by himself.

215
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:18,573
Will you ever learn your lesson?

216
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:22,675
He came to see me.

217
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:27,804
I asked him to go on a date.

218
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:31,600
You, and Kiew?

219
00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:52,202
I'm so touched

220
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,446
that he protected me.

221
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,681
Franc got rejected from Baiwan,

222
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:00,415
and Kiew is single.

223
00:20:01,756 --> 00:20:03,386
It's not a surprise that
they're gonna be together.

224
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,652
I don't care what others think.

225
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,844
- What do you want to eat?
- Up to you.

226
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:41,446
Are you looking for Kiew?

227
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:44,435
I'm afraid that he'll come.

228
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:48,538
Shit!

229
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:49,913
Speak of the devil!

230
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:00,957
- 2 iced Americanos, please.
- 2 iced Americanos, please.

231
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,820
You read my mind.

232
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,366
Can you make it less sweet, like

233
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,923
a lot less sweet?

234
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:19,565
Since we're already so sweet,

235
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:21,366
I'm afraid that
my sugar level will rise.

236
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:24,131
Let's find a place to sit.

237
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:28,033
We can sit here.

238
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,161
- They are…
- Yes.

239
00:21:45,188 --> 00:21:47,283
Bamee and Franc have been friends
since high school.

240
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:49,717
Will he believe that Franc likes Kiew?

241
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:51,657
Is Franc willing to play the part?

242
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:55,804
Oh, he'll need to win an Oscar award.

243
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:57,525
Then Bamee must be jealous for sure.

244
00:21:59,772 --> 00:22:01,054
I totally don't understand

245
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:03,685
why Bamee and Kiew
are competing with each other.

246
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:06,862
I don't understand either.

247
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:10,141
Hey, how about this?

248
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,280
We can show them

249
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:15,413
how to live simply

250
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:17,449
and happily together.

251
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:18,395
How?

252
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:20,096
Here,

253
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:23,522
eat this.

254
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:28,020
Is it good?

255
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,472
Let me feed you too.

256
00:22:32,236 --> 00:22:33,365
Open your mouth.

257
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:34,910
Om nom nom.

258
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:38,383
Om nom nom.

259
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:40,126
Moodaeng!

260
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,534
Now I'll feed you for real.

261
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:43,091
Om nom nom.

262
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:47,006
Can I eat now?

263
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:49,313
Yeah, you can.

264
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:50,809
Eat it now.

265
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:00,980
Franc is so good at caring.

266
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:03,937
I didn't ask.

267
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:07,054
You've never felt it?

268
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:09,891
The feeling when you feel so happy
that you want to speak it out?

269
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:11,981
He can't beat my Soda.

270
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:15,313
Don't devalue the person I like.

271
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:16,913
He's handsome,

272
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:18,336
rich,

273
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:20,002
and a hardworking man.

274
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:22,412
Franc can't beat him in any way.

275
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,912
You couldn't accept the truth
and blamed me that I devalued him.

276
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:28,032
Franc is rich, too.

277
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:29,925
He isn't less handsome than Soda.

278
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:32,192
He's a hardworking man too
but he never brags about it.

279
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:34,861
He takes care all
of his father's business.

280
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:37,122
Franc can't beat Soda

281
00:23:37,972 --> 00:23:39,705
in terms of cooking.

282
00:23:39,706 --> 00:23:40,616
No, you're wrong.

283
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:43,209
Franc is so good at cooking.

284
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:46,266
If you ever try his food,

285
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:48,226
you wouldn't bear
Soda's food anymore.

286
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:49,321
Don't brag here.

287
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:52,111
I don't believe that a guy like Franc
knows how to cook.

288
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:54,301
Do you want him
to compete with Soda?

289
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,185
So we'll know who is more awesome?

290
00:23:56,646 --> 00:23:57,316
Deal.

291
00:23:59,076 --> 00:24:00,317
Deal.

292
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:06,122
I have to compete in cooking with Soda?

293
00:24:08,676 --> 00:24:10,965
Shit, you tried his food before.

294
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:12,625
Soda is so good at cooking.

295
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:13,883
Why did you challenge him?

296
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:17,241
Bamee irritated me.

297
00:24:18,046 --> 00:24:19,114
But you caused me trouble!

298
00:24:21,264 --> 00:24:22,491
Do you know anything about cooking?

299
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:25,891
A little bit.

300
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:27,508
Easy dishes.

301
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,914
We'll lose before
the competition starts.

302
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,735
You should cancel the challenge.

303
00:24:36,718 --> 00:24:39,292
I'd rather die than lose my dignity.

304
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:46,107
Hey, you need to start watching cooking
videos and practice cooking something.

305
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:49,191
The competition happens tomorrow.

306
00:24:49,676 --> 00:24:50,791
There's no time for practicing.

307
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:53,866
Well,

308
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:56,317
you can cook the dish
you're most confident with.

309
00:24:58,036 --> 00:24:59,129
It has to be that way.

310
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:05,358
Come on,

311
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,334
I'm sure you can beat him.

312
00:25:08,856 --> 00:25:09,935
I can beat him?

313
00:25:10,266 --> 00:25:11,923
Where can I beat him?
Can you circle for me?

314
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:13,398
Damn it, Kiew!

315
00:25:14,616 --> 00:25:15,586
Damn it.

316
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:25,534
It's because of you, Kiew.

317
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:47,967
Sigh,

318
00:25:48,456 --> 00:25:50,424
even the outfits are totally different.

319
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:53,850
No need to talk about skills.

320
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:57,648
The taste doesn't depend on the outfit.

321
00:26:02,998 --> 00:26:05,596
I don't want to imagine
when the competition is over.

322
00:26:06,236 --> 00:26:08,485
Soda and Bamee

323
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:11,169
are going to trample us into the ground.

324
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:13,945
We're going to trample them!

325
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:15,605
Franc is going to win for sure.

326
00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:18,711
Did you have any plan in mind?

327
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,043
You have 1 hour to cook
the dish you have prepared.

328
00:26:33,046 --> 00:26:34,410
The judges are all Kiew's friends.

329
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:37,421
Are you sure it'll be fair for me?

330
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:39,135
Don't worry.

331
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:41,596
We're very sportsmanlike.

332
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:46,862
I'm going to start the time now.

333
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:48,825
Ready?

334
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:49,805
I'm ready.

335
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:50,835
Ready?

336
00:26:50,836 --> 00:26:52,321
I'm ready.

337
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:56,363
Start now!

338
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:12,363
You're so afraid of Soda that
your hands are shaking, Chef Franc.

339
00:27:17,286 --> 00:27:18,112
What is it?

340
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:19,746
Keep fighting!

341
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,251
I'm not a boxer.

342
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:23,785
Yeah, whatever.

343
00:27:23,786 --> 00:27:25,114
Okay.

344
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,138
You have 15 minutes left.

345
00:28:13,706 --> 00:28:14,477
Oh dear…

346
00:28:35,026 --> 00:28:42,923
5…4…3…2…1 Time's up!

347
00:28:44,492 --> 00:28:45,147
Serve the food.

348
00:28:56,116 --> 00:28:57,568
Wow!

349
00:29:00,396 --> 00:29:02,859
Did you graduate from a
Japanese cooking course?

350
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:04,637
You have such sharp eyes.

351
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:07,829
I learned to cook there when I
took a summer course in Japan.

352
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,667
Awesome!

353
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:12,093
It could just look nice!

354
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:15,054
I can't resist any longer.

355
00:29:15,326 --> 00:29:16,357
Can I try now?

356
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:17,097
Of course.

357
00:29:18,776 --> 00:29:20,156
Let me get this piece.

358
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,830
It's so good!

359
00:29:30,406 --> 00:29:31,443
Soda's dishes

360
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:33,238
never disappoint anyone.

361
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:37,001
It's your turn now.

362
00:29:40,526 --> 00:29:41,895
Can I open it now?

363
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:43,255
What are you waiting for?

364
00:29:43,256 --> 00:29:44,679
I've been waiting to witness your skill.

365
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:55,413
Hey! Whoa!

366
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:57,200
Shit!

367
00:30:02,776 --> 00:30:03,612
Let's try it now.

368
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:05,007
So, we can decide the winner.

369
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:35,440
So tender.

370
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:41,960
It isn't smelly.

371
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:45,730
It's very difficult to cook lamb.

372
00:30:48,876 --> 00:30:49,513
You cheated!

373
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:51,207
What the hell are you talking about?

374
00:30:51,876 --> 00:30:53,198
You ordered the food from the hotel.

375
00:30:54,176 --> 00:30:55,071
How did you know?

376
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,794
Is it true, Plawan?

377
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:36,479
I wanted Franc to win.

378
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:41,633
Winning or losing,

379
00:31:42,046 --> 00:31:43,768
we have to play a fair game.

380
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,360
Don't tell me you didn't know about it.

381
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:49,740
Only Pong and I knew about this.

382
00:31:52,505 --> 00:31:53,161
Hold up,

383
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:57,156
I really made this dish by myself.

384
00:31:57,956 --> 00:31:59,128
You're still refusing?

385
00:32:04,492 --> 00:32:04,909
Wait a minute.

386
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:14,934
Here,

387
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:17,402
this is the dish from the hotel.

388
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:21,828
I don't want to cheat.

389
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:24,335
So, I decided to do it by myself.

390
00:32:30,806 --> 00:32:33,556
Why did you tell me
that you only cook easy dishes?

391
00:32:33,936 --> 00:32:35,505
I thought you can only cook fried eggs.

392
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:39,305
Well, I think this is
the easiest dish for me.

393
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:39,874
What?

394
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,172
Is this the easiest one?

395
00:32:44,426 --> 00:32:45,789
I've learned from many places,

396
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,820
but I can't do it like you do.

397
00:32:51,576 --> 00:32:52,687
I surrender.

398
00:32:54,712 --> 00:32:55,317
Yes!

399
00:32:56,426 --> 00:32:57,685
Why are you surprised?

400
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:59,923
Let's give him a round of applause!

401
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:08,974
Now you know that my man is better.

402
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:24,216
You have outstanding skill.

403
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,337
Have you learned it before?

404
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:28,221
I learned with Chef Tom.

405
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:30,421
What? Chef Tom?

406
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:32,668
Who is it?

407
00:33:33,784 --> 00:33:34,337
Again!

408
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:35,954
You don't know
anything about the world!

409
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:38,205
She is the legendary chef.

410
00:33:38,206 --> 00:33:39,852
She's famous on a national level.

411
00:33:43,506 --> 00:33:44,688
My dad knows her.

412
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:47,480
Plus, I like cooking, too.

413
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,199
My dad took me to learn cooking.

414
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:51,024
Whoa,

415
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,288
your skill is superb.

416
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:56,182
Why did you make us so worried by being humble?

417
00:33:58,256 --> 00:33:59,564
I didn't know that

418
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,547
this is called brilliant.

419
00:34:25,753 --> 00:34:26,451
I'm sorry

420
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:29,132
that I couldn't beat Franc.

421
00:34:30,056 --> 00:34:30,757
Just forget it.

422
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,509
I didn't know that
a silly person like Franc

423
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:34,572
can cook very well.

424
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:37,193
Let's compete in different fields.

425
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,963
I will beat him for you.

426
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:48,414
You've done a lot for me.

427
00:34:49,078 --> 00:34:49,631
That's enough.

428
00:34:56,705 --> 00:34:57,514
Somehow,

429
00:34:58,169 --> 00:35:00,169
I don't know what I'm doing now.

430
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:32,565
Come lie down here, Bamee.

431
00:35:33,426 --> 00:35:34,557
It's okay, mommy.

432
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:35,924
I'm afraid that you'll feel heavy.

433
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,860
Whoa, your words make me feel guilty.

434
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:46,857
Kiew is back to stay
with uncle Prach now?

435
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:51,033
He's at Franc's house.

436
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:55,829
He's learning cooking there.

437
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,364
I just knew too that Franc
is good at cooking.

438
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:01,425
I was happy for a second,

439
00:36:01,886 --> 00:36:03,447
assuming that
he won't come back here again.

440
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,714
He has a poker face, he doesn't
look like someone who is happy.

441
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:15,745
I think

442
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:18,145
he misses Kiew for sure.

443
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:20,376
Misses Kiew?

444
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:23,193
Does it mean Bamee
can remember Kiew now?

445
00:36:24,146 --> 00:36:25,442
I think so.

446
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:34,099
When he knew that
Kiew slept over at Franc's,

447
00:36:34,786 --> 00:36:36,055
he was moody,

448
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:37,062
but pretended like he wasn't.

449
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,147
He got jealous.

450
00:36:39,566 --> 00:36:40,645
I think Kiew is right.

451
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:43,246
I think his memories are back now.

452
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,805
If we keep provoking him,

453
00:36:45,296 --> 00:36:46,441
he'll confess for sure.

454
00:36:47,618 --> 00:36:48,340
Right.

455
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:52,560
But my time is running out.

456
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:54,538
If he still doesn't admit,

457
00:36:54,786 --> 00:36:55,777
I have to find a different way.

458
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,277
Ah-ham,

459
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,921
the other day you said you liked it.

460
00:37:10,676 --> 00:37:11,902
So, I cooked for you again.

461
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:17,542
Ah-ham,

462
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:22,005
this is the black spaghetti
with giant shrimps.

463
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,241
It's my outstanding dish.

464
00:37:25,606 --> 00:37:26,733
I didn't know that you can cook.

465
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:30,055
These days we can learn
from video clips.

466
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,219
Everyone can do it.

467
00:37:49,326 --> 00:37:50,426
Ouch!

468
00:37:50,806 --> 00:37:51,803
What happened? Did something bite you?

469
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:55,178
He has thick skin.
Nothing can bite him.

470
00:37:55,226 --> 00:37:57,056
But he's sick of the romance around here.

471
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,023
Sick of the romance.

472
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,331
Have you decided yet?

473
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:10,937
Nope.

474
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:13,520
Is it so difficult to choose?

475
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,805
I just found out many
cute things about Franc.

476
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:20,791
For Pong,

477
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:23,710
He's a nice guy
who always understands me.

478
00:38:24,156 --> 00:38:24,970
Ouch!

479
00:38:25,496 --> 00:38:27,465
Hey, guys!

480
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:30,489
Can you line up for me to choose?
Please?

481
00:38:58,376 --> 00:38:59,693
You said you wanna have a talk with me?

482
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:02,450
Why are you lying still
and looking at the stars?

483
00:39:07,876 --> 00:39:09,499
You really can't remember me?

484
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:13,132
No, I can't.

485
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:25,418
Then,

486
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:28,601
let Moodaeng do
that mission instead of you.

487
00:39:32,028 --> 00:39:33,381
Can I replace Bamee?

488
00:39:34,828 --> 00:39:35,389
Yeah.

489
00:39:38,106 --> 00:39:40,042
At first, I wanted to wait
until his memories are back.

490
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:44,831
But my time is up now.

491
00:39:49,446 --> 00:39:50,860
I'll call uncle Prach.

492
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:53,150
Then,

493
00:39:53,626 --> 00:39:55,082
I'll get ready in my room.

494
00:39:55,366 --> 00:39:56,869
When you are leaving, just call me.

495
00:40:38,953 --> 00:40:39,933
Can you please not go?

496
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:58,761
If I didn't pretend to ask Moodaeng, you wouldn't
admit that you can remember me now, right?

497
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:03,185
Why did you fool me?

498
00:42:08,496 --> 00:42:10,000
The day you went with uncle Prach

499
00:42:10,856 --> 00:42:12,218
and would never come back here again,

500
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:16,075
my heart broke like
I couldn't live anymore.

501
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,578
You didn't tell me
that you can remember me,

502
00:42:22,906 --> 00:42:24,323
because you were afraid
that I have to go back, right?

503
00:42:32,596 --> 00:42:33,586
I admit to it.

504
00:42:34,256 --> 00:42:35,352
I was selfish

505
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:37,682
to get to stay with you longer.

506
00:42:50,126 --> 00:42:51,159
But your happiness

507
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:56,708
involves my mom's life
and your dad's life.

508
00:43:01,986 --> 00:43:03,357
I might be stupid to think

509
00:43:04,266 --> 00:43:05,623
that there's still some time left.

510
00:43:10,436 --> 00:43:12,656
A second with you

511
00:43:14,246 --> 00:43:15,773
means so much to me.

512
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:27,519
Though you joined the mission,

513
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:29,934
I still don't know
whether it'll work or not.

514
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:32,886
Maybe I need some more time
to find different ways.

515
00:43:37,386 --> 00:43:38,779
You said that
the time-machine door was open,

516
00:43:41,137 --> 00:43:43,017
but you couldn't go back
because my dad wasn't in the mission.

517
00:43:46,006 --> 00:43:47,298
If I replace my dad,

518
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,736
I'm sure you can go back.

519
00:43:53,837 --> 00:43:54,477
I'm sorry.

520
00:44:06,575 --> 00:44:07,235
I understand.

521
00:44:11,246 --> 00:44:12,156
The longer we resist,

522
00:44:13,406 --> 00:44:15,077
the more pain we feel.

523
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,309
Do what we have to do now, Bamee.

524
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,096
(Past Senger)

525
00:44:57,222 --> 00:44:58,852
(Next Episode)
This is really the last day, right?

526
00:45:02,854 --> 00:45:03,620
My love.

527
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:13,830
I'll miss you every second.

528
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:17,729
I'll miss you every second, too.

529
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:26,034
Good luck, Kiew!

530
00:45:26,631 --> 00:45:28,381
- See you!
- Good luck, Kiew!

531
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:31,469
Have a safe trip!

532
00:45:32,456 --> 00:45:32,981
Go!

533
00:45:33,101 --> 00:45:34,362
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

534
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:37,129
Good luck, Kiew!

535
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:42,892
<i>I want you to know.</i>

536
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:45,490
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

537

00:46:16,863 --> 00:46:19,689
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

547
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:21,900
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

548
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,838
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

549
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:30,536
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>
