(Previous Episode)
From what Kiew did

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,820
and from what you told me,

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,126
I think it's for sure.
No need to investigate.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,640
But Kiew confirms confidently to me

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,130
that he's not this type.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,882
Maybe he doesn't realize
who he really is.

7
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,483
Kiew!

8
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,599
Arghhhh!

9
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:35,752
Hey! I'm finally back! Yayyy!

10
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:37,353
- I'm finally back!
- Kiew!

20
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:32,013
that I might lose everything.

21
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:35,076
I just tell you in my heart

22
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,951
and hug you in my dream.

23
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:40,044
That's enough for me.

24
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:42,904
How much you allow me to be,

25
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:46,467
In my heart, I just want you to know.

26
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:49,289
I want to tell you that I love you.

27
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:54,922
But I'm still afraid that
I might lose you.

28
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:57,969
I just tell you in my heart

29
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:00,680
and hug you in my dream.

30
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,992
That's enough for me.

31
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:05,789
How much you allow me to be,

32
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,594
I will not cross the line.

33
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:32,609
Wait,

34
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:36,761
you look like you're not talkative.

35
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,029
Drink a little,

36
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:43,429
maybe you can be more talkative.

37
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,569
Give it to me.

38
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:51,199
Give it to me.

39
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,909
You said you don't have a boyfriend?

40
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,829
He's not my boyfriend.

41
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,589
I'm his parent.

42
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,969
What is it?

43
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,599
You have worked for a few days only
and you have problems now?

44
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,189
What is it?

45
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:15,739
Who has a problem?

46
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,823
Who has a problem?

47
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,829
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,829
Come with me.

49
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,239
What the hell are you doing?

50
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,019
That's the manager!

51
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:36,109
You want me to get fired?

52
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,289
Yeah.

53
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,299
You're causing me troubles.

54
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:42,259
You are putting yourself into troubles.

55
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:44,319
Why did you have to do this?

56
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:45,639
Let's go home.

57
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,079
Leave me alone.

58
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:48,929
I'm working to earn money.

59
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,209
Aunt Pim didn't give you
a monthly allowance?

60
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,079
I'm going to call her now.

61
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:56,009
If she believed you,

62
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,449
I wouldn't have to move out like this.

63
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:01,999
You're just a friend,

64
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:03,549
don't interfere too much.

65
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,669
The more you help me,
the more I get into trouble.

66
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:08,509
Just stop it.

67
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,969
Go back home.

68
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,109
Good job!

69
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:36,029
Hey!

70
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:38,809
What are you trying to do now?

71
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:41,499
I'm finding a happiness for myself.

72
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:43,719
If you wanna get a drink,

73
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,609
come sit next to me.

74
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:48,139
I'm busy!

75
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:51,089
Hey!

76
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,479
Working like this,
you have to sacrifice your body.

77
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:59,419
If you want to continue working here,
you have to accept it.

78
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:02,459
Hey! You pervert!

79
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:21,409
Oho! Oho!

80
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,159
Hey!

81
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:41,669
How was my cheek?

82
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:44,989
Ew!

83
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,999
Apart from Bamee and Kiew,

84
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,479
you call me every day.

85
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,779
Do you have any feelings for me?

86
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,579
You are always hungry.

87
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:17,779
Do you want anything else?

88
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:26,169
Oh,

89
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,699
you act like you never
get a kiss on the cheek before.

90
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:30,879
You like teasing people.

91
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,139
How was it?

92
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:37,829
Do you do this often?

93
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:46,429
Don't tell me that…

94
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:50,039
you've never done this before?

95
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:55,549
Anyway,

96
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,689
do you like...

97
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:24,359
Let's go.

98
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:27,499
I don't know whether Bamee and Kiew
have met each other yet.

99
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,259
Let's go.

100
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:47,929
Woohoo!

101
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,249
Woohoo!

102
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,259
Wooo!

103
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,269
Wait!

104
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:33,149
Do I look handsome?

105
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,459
Don't mess with me.

106
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,059
I wanna dress like you.

107
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,629
Am I handsome?

108
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:45,979
Hey! Don't take it off here.

109
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,159
You can't take it off here.

110
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,059
I will do it.

111
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:52,829
Don't be stupid when you get drunk.

112
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:54,749
Hey!

113
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,049
I will take you
to take it off somewhere else.

114
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,339
Kiew!

115
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:02,589
Don't stop me.

116
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,989
Don't act like you're my wife.

117
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,819
So, who is the husband and who is the wife?

118
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,629
These people…

119
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:38,749
You fell asleep so peacefully, huh?

120
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:44,829
Bamee.

121
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,939
Shit, now you are in bed and suddenly awake.

122
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,519
I'm so glad

123
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:56,829
that I open my eyes
and see you right in front of me.

124
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,619
Go to sleep if you're drunk.

125
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:00,879
Don't be dreamy.

126
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,049
I'm not drunk.

127
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:19,759
I like you.

128
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,979
Sweet dream.

129
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,029
Anyway,

130
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:44,959
do you like...

131
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,009
He's crazy!

132
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,429
Arghhh!

133
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,559
Your lips are so…

134
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,259
awwww!

135
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:40,549
I'm shy.

136
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:44,949
I'm shy.

137
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,489
I'm not drunk.

138
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:10,019
I like you.

139
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,769
Whoa!

140
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,759
What a disaster!

141
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,789
You cook so early in the morning.

142
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,179
Why do you say this?
Don't you want to eat?

143
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,449
Of course, I want to eat, Mr. Bamee.

144
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:18,559
I drank too heavily last night.

145
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:21,239
I woke up feeling thirsty and hungry.

146
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,109
I have a headache too.

147
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,519
I think I need some black coffee.

148
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:29,519
Hey, stop it!

149
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,039
These days we don't drink black coffee
to cure the hangover symptoms.

150
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,229
Here,

151
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,059
take this.

152
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:50,099
Let's have breakfast.
You're hungry now.

153
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:57,149
How did I get home last night?

154
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:03,019
What could you remember?

155
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:05,999
Well,

156
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:09,039
I was drinking at the bar.

157
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,649
I was dancing.

158
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:13,359
And everything shut down.

159
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:15,589
Then I woke up here.

160
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:23,889
That's all?

161
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:26,019
Yeah.

162
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:28,329
Why?

163
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:30,219
Did I do some crazy things to anyone?

164
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,209
No, you didn't.

165
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:37,229
What a relieve.

166
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:39,599
Let me take a shower
and brush my teeth first.

167
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:40,589
I'll be right back.

168
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:06,929
Please stop working
at that place. Please,

169
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:08,479
please.

170
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,749
Can you stop talking about something
we already finished talking?

171
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,559
Won't you listen to me at all?

172
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,619
You are not listening to me.

173
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:17,849
You keep repeating the same thing.
It's boring!

174
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:20,689
Yes, I'm a boring person.

175
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:23,219
If you like that stripper job,
go for it.

176
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,629
From now on,
I'm not going to care for you anymore.

177
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:46,479
See! I'm louder.

178
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:48,359
I'm not giving up.

179
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:49,639
Try again.

180
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,299
This time,
I'm going to be louder for sure.

181
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:53,369
Let's do it, 1, 2, 3!

182
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,469
Where's Bamee?

183
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,049
I don't know.

184
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,649
Hey, are you having a fight with Kiew?

185
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:12,829
Go ask him yourself.

186
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:18,939
Damn, they're fighting again.

187
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,349
Come in.

188
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:29,059
Hi, Kiew.

189
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,969
I want to go home.

190
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:51,249
I, Ann, and Keng

191
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:53,439
discuss about this every day.

192
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:56,009
We still don't know what to do.

193
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:00,139
The other day, I read
one of the books you gave me.

194
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:02,669
I think there should be some way.

195
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,509
Yeah? How?

196
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:10,369
Thunder happens
from the merge of electric charges.

197
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:14,769
If we use the generator to release
the electric charges inside of me

198
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,839
in the same amount of the thunder,

199
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:19,549
I think it could be possible.

200
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:27,269
Electric power in the same
amount of the thunder?

201
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:29,059
Then you're gonna get
electric shock to death.

202
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:32,029
When I travelled through time
previously,

203
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,229
I could bear the strong power
of the electric charges.

204
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,149
This time,
I think my body can bear this.

205
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:40,589
What if you can't?

206
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:42,319
I'm ready to take a risk.

207
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:45,169
Prach,

208
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:48,349
I'm afraid too. I've been thinking
about it for many days

209
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:50,139
before talking to you today.

210
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:56,179
But I can't take being in the wrong place
at the wrong time like this anymore.

211
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:00,499
Besides,

212
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,919
without mom,

213
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:07,559
my life is meaningless.

214
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,389
If I'm going to die,

215
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,299
just let me go to reunite with my mom.

216
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:26,509
You lost.

217
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:29,029
- I didn't lose.
- I beat you up.

218
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:30,499
- Really?
- Really.

219
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:32,799
Really? You lost already.

220
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,629
It's just for that round.
We haven't finalized.

221
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:38,669
Wanna fight!

222
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:43,009
Call Kiew if you're worried about him.

223
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:44,849
Why do I have to?

224
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:46,709
If you want to, you call him yourself.

225
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:55,159
- What's wrong with them this time?
- Umm.

226
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,039
Do you wanna talk about it?

227
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,039
What's wrong with you and Kiew?

228
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,889
He interferes with my life too much.

229
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:11,679
He wants me to live my life
the way he wants.

230
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:17,469
I think...

231
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,399
he's just worried about you too much.

232
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:23,859
No matter how worried you feel
about someone,

233
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,489
you shouldn't interfere
with their personal life.

234
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,189
Friends don't interfere
with personal life.

235
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:31,709
Only lovers care
for each other's personal life.

236
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:36,309
I think...

237
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:39,769
Kiew

238
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:42,609
has a feeling for you.

239
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:44,609
Oh,

240
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,489
he didn't think of me that way.

241
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:47,759
He stays with me every day.

242
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:50,789
Your assumption is wrong.

243
00:20:57,819 --> 00:20:59,679
When will you two make peace
with each other?

244
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:01,749
I didn't do anything wrong.

245
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,579
I don't have to do anything.

246
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:21,729
Hi, there.

247
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:30,739
It's too soon.

248
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,499
Are you reserved?

249
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:36,349
I'm still young.

250
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:38,739
You're not so young at all.

251
00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:41,709
Why do you want to study here today?

252
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:44,909
Bamee is not at the condo.

253
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:46,289
Why would I go there?

254
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:48,299
Do you know

255
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:52,079
what happened between Kiew and Bamee?

256
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:56,109
You don't know. How would I know?

257
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,449
What's wrong with them?

258
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:04,029
Sometimes you can just let them be.

259
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:08,199
Let's do something fun together.

260
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:15,829
You want me to do chores?

261
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:19,389
Did you forget that you're my slave?

262
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:20,539
You are…

263
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:23,129
You lost the gamble, remember?

264
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:27,069
Alright.

265
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:29,389
Don't you wanna study today?

266
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:32,509
I will try to solve problems
by myself first.

267
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:34,629
If I don't get it, I'll ask you.

268
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:35,959
Okay?

269
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,969
Just do as you wish, master.

270
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:41,129
Kiew,

271
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:44,909
you can still change your mind.

272
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:46,629
No, I won't.

273
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,119
What is this?

274
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:57,569
Letter of consent to participate
in this experiment.

275
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,429
If something happens to me,

276
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:02,339
everyone won't be in trouble.

277
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,109
Take this, then. When you're ready,

278
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:20,669
you hold these up when I tell you to.

279
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,339
I'm ready.

280
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:41,719
If you're ready,

281
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,279
I'm going to count down

282
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:45,039
for 5 seconds.

283
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:49,529
5,

284
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:51,529
4,

285
00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:53,869
3,

286
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:55,689
2,

287
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:56,979
1,

288
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:58,109
Go!

289
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:02,979
Hey!

290
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:07,549
Kiew, bear it a little more.

291
00:25:09,949 --> 00:25:12,129
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

292
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,469
Don't get home late.

293
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:33,349
I love you.

294
00:26:35,209 --> 00:26:36,519
A message from mom.

295
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:38,079
My pager works again.

296
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,269
I'm finally home!

297
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,809
Yay!

298
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,269
I'm finally home!

299
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,589
Yay! Yay!

300
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:49,009
He's conscious now!

301
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,859
Kiew, how are you?

302
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:57,749
Kiew!

303
00:26:58,289 --> 00:26:59,309
Kiew!

304
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:05,429
It didn't work?

305
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:10,089
It's lucky
that you were just unconscious.

306
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,689
Did you set the electric power right?

307
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,079
I set it in the same amount
as the thunder.

308
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,519
Please tell me what I have to do.

309
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:29,349
I want to go home.

310
00:27:56,829 --> 00:27:57,669
Here.

311
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,699
Whoa, the taste!

312
00:28:05,189 --> 00:28:06,529
Not delicious?

313
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,529
Super delicious!

314
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,529
I was stunned with fear.

315
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,869
Why do I have to think of him?

316
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:33,389
I can't go home.

317
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:35,169
I'm not happy here.

318
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:37,789
Argh, I'm so upset!

319
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,309
Let's find something to eat.

320
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:55,979
- No!
- No!

321
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:15,669
(Food Hall 2 Open:
Monday – Friday 07.00 – 16.00 )

322
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:11,669
If you're not happy being mad at him,

323
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:12,959
why don't you get back together?

324
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,349
I'm fine.

325
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,909
Yeah, it's good if you're really happy.

326
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:24,559
Then, can you help me with something?

327
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:34,949
(Dimensional)

328
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:05,329
Wake up now! Wake up!

329
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,059
I can't find his pulse.

330
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:10,239
Help please! Somebody gets drown.

331
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:11,479
Please send the ambulance.

332
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,359
Wake up now!

333
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:16,039
Wake up!

334
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:37,219
Kiew!

335
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:40,389
You're awake now! He's awake now!

336
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,559
What the hell did you do?

337
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:47,069
I safe your life!

338
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:48,939
Without me, you would be dead.

339
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:50,709
Who's gonna be dead?

340
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:52,299
I just helped Baiwan in her acting class.

341
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:54,479
She asked me to be the main character
that felt in the water.

342
00:32:57,649 --> 00:32:58,669
You tricked me!

343
00:32:59,389 --> 00:33:00,609
I didn't.

344
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:02,799
I texted you
that Bamee felt in the water.

345
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:04,609
He really did!

346
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:07,389
If you didn't come,

347
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,929
you wouldn't know

348
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:10,319
how much you care for Bamee.

349
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:12,059
Right, Bamee?

350
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:16,429
Do you have so much fun tricking me?

351
00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:19,309
He was tricked into this just like you.

352
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:23,029
I didn't get to play
the school drama, Bamee.

353
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:24,319
Huh?

354
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:26,319
This is your plan?

355
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:28,149
I can't help it.

356
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:29,919
Why have you been mad
at each other for a long time?

357
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:33,119
Please get back together.

358
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:35,779
- No!
- No!

359
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,059
You don't love each other?

360
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:40,549
What happened just a minute ago?

361
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,609
Mission failed.

362
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,419
Use plan B now, Plawan.

363
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:54,579
Okay.

364
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,669
I got wet too.

365
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:12,579
Don't you dry your hair? Hey!

366
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,699
It's up to you!

367
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:21,309
All I did was just giving him a CPR,

368
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,999
why did my heart skip a beat?

369
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:26,529
Do I have a heart disease?

370
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,969
Bamee,

371
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:44,189
let's watch a movie!

372
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,389
I already have a plan.

373
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:01,229
He asked his customer
to pick him up here.

374
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,079
Doesn't he feel ashamed?

375
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,789
That guy is handsome.

376
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:06,009
Nice car.

377
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:07,389
He looks like a rich guy.

378
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:08,989
He takes a good care of him too.

379
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:19,929
Hey, Kiew, where are you going?

380
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:25,049
Hey, Kiew! Kiew!

381
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:26,009
Kiew!

382
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,409
- Hey, Kiew!
- Kiew!

383
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:34,579
Get out! Come with me!

384
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:37,549
Hey! You said you won't mess with me?

385
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:39,749
I changed my mind!

386
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:41,749
I will do it for your dad.

387
00:35:41,979 --> 00:35:43,869
I won't let you live like this anymore.

388
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,509
What's wrong
with Bamee living like this?

389
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:49,509
I asked Bamee to hang out
with my friends.

390
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:51,489
So, I asked my friend's brother
to pick him up at the campus.

391
00:35:52,669 --> 00:35:55,849
This is Chokun, my cousin.

392
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:00,089
Oh, yeah?

393
00:36:31,229 --> 00:36:34,299
Kiew, why did you have to do that?

394
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:36,439
I didn't think that he…

395
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:39,169
You thought that he's going on
a date with that guy, right?

396
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:40,669
So, you get jealous, right?

397
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:43,629
Yea… hey! No!

398
00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:48,279
Let's be frank, Kiew.

399
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:51,809
I noticed many times

400
00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:52,959
that...

401
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:56,799
you don't think of Bamee as a friend.

402
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,719
What made you think so?

403
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,129
The first time was that day.

404
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:07,669
I don't know where Bamee is.

405
00:37:07,779 --> 00:37:09,439
He didn't pick up anyone's call.

406
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:10,939
Can you call him?

407
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:13,949
Okay.

408
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:20,779
You waited for me
in front of my faculty,

409
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:22,469
but you didn't ask anything about me.

410
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:24,859
You asked about Bamee right
when you saw my face.

411
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:27,479
There's more.

412
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:34,729
- I'll do it!
- Why?

413
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:36,759
You're not fluent enough.

414
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,759
I don't like to see it.

415
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:39,829
I'll feed him myself.

416
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:44,069
Eat it.

417
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:46,519
Don't forget to chew a lot.

418
00:37:47,169 --> 00:37:48,469
Don't hurry to swallow.

419
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:50,769
You didn't realize

420
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:53,229
that you didn't want anyone
to take care of Bamee,

421
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,769
because you wanted to be
the only one doing it, right?

422
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:00,709
There are many more evidences.

423
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:04,199
I think you can look back
and realize it by yourself.

424
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,189
I think

425
00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:10,349
it's time for you to ask yourself

426
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:12,039
how do you feel for Bamee.

427
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:34,929
Kiew likes Bamee.

428
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:37,979
I should be happy.

429
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:45,409
I shouldn't be sad.

430
00:39:14,669 --> 00:39:16,209
- Booya!
- Arghhh!

431
00:39:17,739 --> 00:39:18,709
Franc!

432
00:39:18,709 --> 00:39:20,189
Yes, it's me.

433
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:22,629
Why did you trick me?

434
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:24,089
I almost got a heart attack.

435
00:39:24,939 --> 00:39:26,149
I didn't trick you.

436
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,019
I just wanted to surprise you.

437
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:30,589
Didn't know that when you are shocked,

438
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,319
you can be quite violent.

439
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:34,169
I thought you were a thief!

440
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:35,409
Why are you here?

441
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:38,999
You didn't see me for the whole day.

442
00:39:40,259 --> 00:39:41,279
Do you miss me?

443
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:43,149
No,

444
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:45,709
I don't. I'm very happy

445
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:46,939
that I didn't see you.

446
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,139
It's okay.

447
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,589
I can be the only one missing you.

448
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:56,739
If you're gonna talk nonsense, go home.

449
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:58,279
Oh, wait!

450
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,559
I didn't talk nonsense.

451
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:02,749
My dad asked me
to bring something for you.

452
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:05,899
Just wait for a moment.

453
00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:15,139
Here it is.

454
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:23,659
Take it as my apology.

455
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:27,009
I made you feel uncomfortable
for many times.

456
00:40:28,149 --> 00:40:29,999
Why did you say it's from your dad?

457
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:31,999
If I say that it's mine,

458
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:34,269
I'm afraid you won't take it.

459
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:39,569
- You like it, right?
- No!

460
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:44,069
But I saw that you were smiling.

461
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:46,069
I didn't.

462
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:47,599
You can take it back.

463
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,439
No, no, no.

464
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:52,509
Please take it. Please.

465
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:54,169
I'm sorry.

466
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:56,289
Please take my apology.

467
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:57,949
I'm so sorry.

468
00:40:58,269 --> 00:40:59,799
I accepted my mistakes.

469
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:12,669
Please take it.

470
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:14,999
I really repented.

471
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:28,749
The Neon fish is beautiful,

472
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:30,779
lively,

473
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:32,629
and strong,

474
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:34,509
just like you.

475
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,069
The Neon fish is luminous in the dark,

476
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:39,869
just like you

477
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:41,559
who are my light for me, too.

478
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:48,639
Which book did he copy
the good words from?

479
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:51,699
But sorry,

480
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:52,849
I'm not into it.

481
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:56,369
Right, fishie?

482
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:12,669
- Hi!
- Yeah.

483
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:18,749
Bamee!

484
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:21,789
Yes?

485
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,399
Can you take this to the customer?

486
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:26,339
Err… I…

487
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,509
It's not something illegal.

488
00:42:30,729 --> 00:42:32,829
The customer came here
and forgot it last night.

489
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:35,579
He can come here again in a few days.

490
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:37,759
He asked us to bring it to him today.

491
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:40,439
Alright.

492
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:41,699
The address is in there.

493
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:42,719
Yes, sir.

494
00:43:29,629 --> 00:43:31,369
The customer asked me
to bring his belonging here?

495
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:37,749
Kiew.

496
00:43:43,529 --> 00:43:44,969
It's my belonging.

497
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:52,349
Wait.

498
00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:54,269
What?

499
00:43:57,209 --> 00:43:59,379
You had good memories here.

500
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:04,009
I want to make good memory
with you here.

501
00:44:05,529 --> 00:44:07,399
I'm sorry that I'm headstrong.

502
00:44:20,739 --> 00:44:22,209
I folded them by myself.

503
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:25,839
Can you take my heart?

504
00:44:29,129 --> 00:44:30,599
What are you playing here?

505
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:34,879
I'm serious.

506
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:40,469
I like you.

507
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:48,249
Are you drunk?

508
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:24,879
There's no alcohol smell.

509
00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:27,949
Now you know that I'm not drunk.

510
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:30,660
I want to tell you that I love you.

511
00:45:30,671 --> 00:45:35,938
But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.

512
00:45:36,335 --> 00:45:39,308
I just tell you in my heart

513
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,121
and hug you in my dream.

514
00:45:42,132 --> 00:45:44,097
That's enough for me.

515
00:45:44,107 --> 00:45:47,378
How much you allow me to be.

516
00:45:47,388 --> 00:45:52,035
I will not cross the line.

517
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:31,187
(Past Senger)

518
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:36,969
(Next Episode)
Shit, don't tell me that…

519
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:48,199
Can I sleep with you?

520
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:06,399
What's wrong with you?

521
00:47:07,189 --> 00:47:08,639
I'm gonna teach you
how to wash veggies.

522
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:12,159
Hey!

523
00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:15,519
Kiew looks exactly like his dad.

524
00:47:16,589 --> 00:47:18,439
Kitti Tirakan.

525
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:20,809
Hey!

526
00:47:21,953 --> 00:47:23,652
I want you to know.

527
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:26,362
I want to tell you that I love you.

528
00:47:26,373 --> 00:47:31,640
But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.

529
00:47:32,037 --> 00:47:35,010
I just tell you in my heart

530
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:37,823
and hug you in my dream.

531
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:39,799
That's enough for me.

532
00:47:39,809 --> 00:47:42,652
How much you allow me to be.

533
00:47:42,663 --> 00:47:46,402
In my heart, I just want you to know.

534
00:47:46,412 --> 00:47:49,146
I want to tell you that I love you.

535
00:47:49,156 --> 00:47:54,818
But I'm still afraid
that I might lose you.

536
00:47:54,828 --> 00:47:57,708
I just tell you in my heart

537
00:47:57,718 --> 00:48:00,544
and hug you in my dream.

538
00:48:00,554 --> 00:48:02,755
That's enough for me.

539
00:48:02,765 --> 00:48:05,693
How much you allow me to be,

540
00:48:05,704 --> 00:48:11,391
I will not cross the line.
