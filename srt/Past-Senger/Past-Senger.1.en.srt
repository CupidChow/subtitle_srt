00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:03,197

<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

17
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:09,620

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,239
Ann, faster!

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,650
The turtle can bite your shoes now.

33
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,930
I’m afraid I’ll fall.

34
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,020
Come with me,
I’ll show you how to run.

35
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,130
Come with me.

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,479
You’ll be safer.

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,229
A good girl should
not easily hold hand with boys.

38
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,990
I’ll go by myself.

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,720
You both failed.

40
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,880
She’s too naïve.

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,570
How could you fall for her?

42
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,719
I like her just the way she is.

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,860
Right.

44
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,560
She’s so cute.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,470
Piya, Anek, Somchai, go faster!

46
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,439
Damn!

47
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,830
You bully our dads’ names.

48
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,300
Go get him! Now!

49
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,210
Catch me if you can.

50
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,420
Hey!

51
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,159
Piya, Anek, Somchai!

52
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,680
Piya, Anek, Somchai!

53
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,129
Catch me if you can!

54
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,160
I’ll kick your ass today, Suwit!

55
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,550
Arghhhh!

56
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,740
Arghhhh!

57
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,313
A dream?

58
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,010
I kissed a man!

59
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,660
Goosebumps!

60
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,599
Oops!

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,050
I have an appointment with them.

62
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,840
It’s late at night.
Where are you going?

63
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,050
Wait!

64
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,050
We haven’t talked lately like we used to.

65
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,060
You’d better spend your time for work.

66
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,780
I get used to talking to myself
and being by myself.

67
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,100
You know that I have to work.

68
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,190
Then you’d better
spend your time for work.

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,370
I’m fine being by myself.

70
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,930
It’s fine.

71
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,500
Chittiphon,

72
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,479
- Pirat
- I haven’t found my name.

73
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,080
Nawaphon,

74
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,629
- Mongkon
- I haven’t found it.

75
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,220
Where’s my name?

76
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,200
Nawaphon,

77
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,509
Mongkol.

78
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,610
- Ouch!
- Oops!

79
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,859
Sorry. I’m focusing only on the board.

80
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,110
Be careful, you clumsy!

81
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,760
I apologized already.
Why do you have to call me like that?

82
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,289
So, you’ll be aware of yourself,

83
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,160
and stop being clumsy!

84
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,330
You have such a bad mouth!

85
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,430
You said I have a bad mouth?

86
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,000
- Hey! How come there’s no my name here?
- Damn, Art!

87
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,029
Look carefully!

88
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,970
Your candle’s gonna burn my face!

89
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,160
Yay! I got Architecture!
Art! I got Architecture!

90
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,760
What about you?

91
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,789
Yay! Me too! Yayyyy!

92
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,409
Architecture!
Architecture! Architecture!

93
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,660
Argh!

94
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,010
Oh! That’s my name!
That’s my name!

95
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,370
- I got Accountancy!
- I got Law!

96
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,949
What about me?

97
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,579
You and me got Architecture!

98
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,389
- Yay!
- Yay!

99
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,280
- Yay!
- Woo!

100
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,910
Hey, it’s okay!

101
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,920
There are many private universities.

102
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,350
You can study in a private university.

103
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,740
Don’t try to comfort me.

104
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,820
Don’t think too much.

105
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,830
Many people didn’t succeed either.

106
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,630
- Who said I didn’t succeed?
- Huh?

107
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,980
I got Architecture just like you guys!

108
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,419
Priest Phuang Ngern is super sacred!

109
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,939
It’s awesome!

110
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,589
He’s so sacred!

111
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,490
We have to repay soon!

112
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,900
- Amen!
- Amen!

113
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,880
Let's hurry!

114
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,540
Thank you for helping us.

115
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,610
Today we come as promised.

116
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,560
Stay out of my way!

117
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,730
Out of my way!
The main character is here!

118
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,390
Oh,

119
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,280
you guys are very extreme!

120
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,030
Like coming out of the Music Video.

121
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,660
What about your outfit?

122
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,640
We’re super extreme here!

123
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,130
- Why didn’t your outfit match with us?
- Right.

124
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,400
You didn’t pray for yourself?

125
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,429
If I can pass the entrance examination
to the faculty of Architecture,

126
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,710
I will dress like a woman to repay
for your help.

127
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,070
No,

128
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,220
I didn’t.
I don’t believe in invisible things.

129
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,439
Come on, I wanna see the show now!

130
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,160
Do it quickly! Get up quickly!

131
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,300
I wanna see the show!

132
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,920
Come on quick! Hey! Quick!

133
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,750
Haha!

134
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,480
You’re so into this. All of you.

135
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,459
If we don’t do it to the fullest,

136
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,589
next time the priest won’t help us.

137
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,149
Do you really think that
you succeed because of the priest,

138
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,510
not your own ability?

139
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,540
I believe it with my whole heart.

140
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,569
If you’re smart but not lucky,
you can’t succeed.

141
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,070
There are a lot of competitors.

142
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Then,

143
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,859
people who’ve prayed with the priest
don’t have to read at all.

144
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,420
Don’t insult the priest here.

145
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,300
Can you just watch quietly?

146
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,700
Hey!

147
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,380
Let’s take a break for a sec.

148
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,430
I wanna see the priest.

149
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,189
If he shows up when I call him,

150
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,109
it means he’s for real.

151
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,109
- Hey!
- Hey,

152
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,479
why do you behave like this?

153
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,140
If you don’t believe in him,
you don’t have to insult him.

154
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,470
He can get angry.

155
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,990
What can a tree do to me?

156
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,129
Priest! Priest Phuang Ngern!

157
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,859
- Kiew!
- Priest! Come out now!

158
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,440
Let us see you! Priest! Come out now!

159
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,740
- Kiew!
- Priest! Please show up!

160
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,810
- Don’t insult him.
- Priest, show up!

161
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,459
Priest, show up!

162
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,039
See! He’s angry now!

163
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,379
You must apologize now!

164
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,239
Quick! Apologize now!

165
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,630
Argh!

166
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,309
Your success comes from the priest?

167
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,539
The rain is falling
because of the priest?

168
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,739
You are too obsessive.

169
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,320
Kiew! I apologize for my friend.

170
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,250
Priest, please forgive my friend.

171
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,940
Hey!

172
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,100
Let’s go to my car!

173
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,024
Hey!

174
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:53,681
How come I’m here?

175
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:10,488
- Hey!

176
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:12,969
I’m back here again!

177
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,269
Prach! Prach!

178
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,950
I’m here. Come pick me up!

179
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,020
Prach! Hey!

180
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,710
Prach!

181
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,360
(Your favorite sugar palm cake
is in the fridge. Don’t forget to eat it. Love you.)

182
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,400
Arghhhh.

183
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,140
Hey!

184
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,560
It’s you again!

185
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,600
You enjoy my kiss or what?

186
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,830
What’s wrong with you? Who kissed you?

187
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,219
Oh, this must be my dream.

188
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,620
That’s why you can’t remember anything.

189
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,180
You dreamed of me?

190
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,230
I must be asleep.

191
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,550
That’s why I see you again.

192
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,870
Get out of my dream now. Go away!

193
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,470
Can I have a glass of water, please?

194
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,630
Ouch!

195
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,300
Wash your face.

196
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,870
So freaking cold!

197
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,460
Wake up now!
So, you know it’s not a dream.

198
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,320
Hey!

199
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,099
Hey! You bullied me and walked away?

200
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,240
Apologize to me first!

201
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,370
I just woke you up.

202
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,690
But if it made you mad,

203
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,890
then it’s equal to
when you bumped into me.

204
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,050
If you’re high on drugs,
just go to sleep!

205
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,070
Does this bastard really exist?

206
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,680
I was at the big tree.

207
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,160
How come I’m standing here?

208
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,260
And when did the rain stop?

209
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,890
<i>Hip hippo, oh, it's so big.</i>

210
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,589
<i>It walks slowly. It walks slowly.</i>

211
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,340
<i>Talala~ Talala~</i>

212
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,200
<i>Hippo...</i>

213
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,850
Why these buildings are not like
what I saw this morning?

214
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,520
Something went missing here.

215
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,040
Excuse me,

216
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,240
where is a phone booth?

217
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
A phone booth?

218
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,760
You mean the public phone?

219
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,890
Yes.

220
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,850
We don’t have it here.

221
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,660
Nobody uses it now.

222
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,600
There are plenty of them
in the university.

223
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,080
I just used it this morning.

224
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,840
I think you remembered it wrongly.

225
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,469
I come for tutoring here very often,

226
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,880
but I haven’t seen
a phone booth for so long.

227
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,610
How come?

228
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,080
If you don’t have a mobile phone,

229
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,560
you can use mine.

230
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,300
Here’s your mobile phone?

231
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,450
It must be crazy to believe you.

232
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,970
This is not a space era

233
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,180
to have a buttonless
mobile phone like this.

234
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,280
What is this machine you gave me?

235
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,549
Where did he come from?

236
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,800
Still asking for a phone with buttons?

237
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,689
Don’t you know

238
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,220
that now we use touchscreen phones?

239
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,950
Whoa!

240
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,740
Whoa!

241
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,790
You must be super rich

242
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,520
to own this high-tech mobile phone.

243
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,480
I don’t dare to press on
anything randomly.

244
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,800
If it’s broken,
I can’t buy you a new one.

245
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,449
Then I can make a call for you.

246
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,600
Tell me the number.

247
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,490
- 1...
- Hey!

248
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,280
Leave my friend alone.

249
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,400
It’s you again!

250
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,600
Let’s go Baiwan.

251
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,230
He’s like this. Scary.

252
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,830
High on drugs.

253
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,620
- That’s why he said strange things.
- Hey!

254
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,400
My sinful enemy!

255
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,920
I’m not high on drugs.

256
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,239
I just asked her to call my friend

257
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,180
to pick me up.

258
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,389
I see. You just want to go home.

259
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,069
It’s good, so you don’t
cause anyone troubles.

260
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,080
Fine.

261
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,280
I’ll call your friend for you.
Give me his number.

262
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,000
152.

263
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,180
When someone picks up,
repeat after me.

264
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,500
Sure.

265
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,630
That number is not registered.

266
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,120
Who did you call to?

267
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,360
Wait and see.

268
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,440
Hey! What are you doing?

269
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,160
Nothing.

270
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,150
Give me your phone.

271
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,040
Give it to me. I wanna see it.

272
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,080
Whoa!

273
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,560
Your phone can take pictures!

274
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,260
Super wonderful!

275
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,590
Super wonderful?

276
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,120
Drunk people say confusing things.

277
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,800
Why did you take pictures of me?

278
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,950
In case you
cause troubles somewhere else,

279
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,790
I can show them to the police.

280
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,210
I’m not a gangster.

281
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,679
If I’m gonna cause troubles to anyone,

282
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,160
you must be the first one on the list.

283
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,860
There! Your friends are here.

284
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,030
It’s him!

285
00:19:44,928 --> 00:19:45,929
- Let’s go.
- Hey!

286
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,980
Don’t make a mess here.

287
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,040
Wait! I don’t take drugs.
I don’t sell them.

288
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,090
You said you’re gonna call
my friend for me.

289
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,709
You fooled Dao!

290
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,420
- Go now.
- Let’s go.

291
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,620
You fooled Dao?

292
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,820
Dao is a strange name for men.

293
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,680
Ouch!

294
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,340
- Come here.
- Let me go.

295
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,620
I never get involved with drugs.
I’m a good guy.

296
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,629
Everyone who says this,

297
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,960
their drug results are always positive.
Purple urine.

298
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,590
But mine is totally yellow. I confirm.

299
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,300
What happened here?

300
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,239
They accused me
of getting high on drugs.

301
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,840
I’m not. Really.

302
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,140
I have to thank you a lot, professor.

303
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,730
Without you,
I would be in a big trouble.

304
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,620
What’s your name?

305
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,510
Kitti. It’s Kitti Tirakan.

306
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Hey,

307
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,540
it’s impossible.

308
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,010
Kitti Tirakan.

309
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,919
Architecture, freshmen year.

310
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,969
Yes. I passed the entrance examination
to get into this university.

311
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,830
What is the entrance examination?

312
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,840
Now they call it a T-CAS system.

313
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,780
What is a T-CAS?

314
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,140
It’s an entrance examination.

315
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,060
- Kiew!
- Hey!

316
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,799
How come you know my nickname?

317
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,880
Hey!

318
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,740
It’s impossible!

319
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,760
- Suwit!
- Hey!

320
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,990
You know my dad’s name, too?

321
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,700
Are you a friend of my dad?

322
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,690
Kiew! Kiew!

323
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,540
Kiew, it’s really you!

324
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,210
Kiew!

325
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,820
Hey, Kiew!

326
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,520
Can you remember me?

327
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,560
Prach! It’s you? Prach!

328
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,089
- Hey!
- Kiew!

329
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,570
Kiew!

330
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,930
Kiew!

331
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,430
Then why are you so old?

332
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,539
What? I disappeared for 27 years?

333
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,999
Since the day
we went to repay to the priest,

334
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,740
nobody has ever seen you again.

335
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,369
Where have you been?

336
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,540
What?

337
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,240
I was at the Pho tree,

338
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,679
and then I appeared here out of nowhere.

339
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,360
Hey! Are you saying that
You’ve vanished from 1995

340
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,140
and appear in 2022?

341
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,349
Vanish?

342
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,720
Moving to the future in a sudden.

343
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,020
If it’s true, I think that’s how it is.

344
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,739
But how can it be possible?

345
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,450
It’s only in movies.

346
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,230
I must be dreaming.

347
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:52,295
Ouch!

348
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,299
Are you dreaming?

349
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,240
- This is real.
- Yeah,

350
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,859
it is! The priest must punish you.

351
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,959
You have to apologize to him now.

352
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,219
So, you can go back to your normal time.

353
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,939
You’re this old and still obsessed
about this thing?

354
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,269
Until now,

355
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,379
you still don’t believe in his power?

356
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,789
If it’s not because of him,

357
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,510
how could you travel to
the future like this?

358
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,000
There was a thunder when my pager rang.

359
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,000
The electric charge

360
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,239
and my pager’s signal might crash
at that time.

361
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,710
Then there’s a time-machine door.

362
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,770
Aren’t you too complicated?

363
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,669
It’s a complicated thing
to travel through time!

364
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,919
I can’t be shallow like you
to think that

365
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,440
it’s because of the priest’s power.

366
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,360
- I will go home.
- Hey!

367
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,140
How could you do that?

368
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,770
Kiew!

369
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,950
Kiew!

370
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,120
What are you doing, Kiew?

371
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,060
Thunder, crash on me!

372
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,640
Thunder, crash on me now!

373
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,950
We’re doing scientific experiment.

374
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
You can go to your class.

375
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,370
Thunder, please crash on me now.

376
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,610
Please. Crash on me!

377
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,489
Oh, Kiew!

378
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,190
You shout like a crazy man.

379
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,590
The sky is so bright.
How can it be a thunder?

380
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,900
You’re right.

381
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,059
Then, I’ll try again when it rains.

382
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,040
Oh, there are many more months
before the rainy season.

383
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,030
You wanna try my way? It might work.

384
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,890
Dear priest,

385
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,770
I have such...

386
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,130
a bad mouth.

387
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,570
I was wrong.

388
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,480
Please forgive me

389
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,480
and take me back to the past.

390
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,840
When I get back to the past,

391
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,780
I will repay for
the entrance examination right away.

392
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,840
You said you didn’t pray
for the exam result?

393
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,170
I did. But I didn’t believe it.

394
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,110
I was confident that
I passed the exam because of myself.

395
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,009
Please forgive me.

396
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,859
I apologize to you. Amen.

397
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,130
Amen.

398
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,490
Oh, everything is quiet and still.

399
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,360
No miracle at all.

400
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,680
I told you it’s not
because of the priest.

401
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,800
I followed along your way because
I wanted you to stop asking me to do it.

402
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,980
Or do you have to repay first before

403
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,850
you can travel back in time?

404
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,299
Come on, Kiew.

405
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,489
You’ve already tried.

406
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,820
Maybe try one more thing. Please.

407
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,479
I didn’t bring a radio.

408
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,800
I forgot to tell you that
I need a music too.

409
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,250
Don’t worry, Kiew.

410
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,420
I have all the songs you want.

411
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,030
I even have the Gogowa song.

412
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,030
You’ve brought a radio with you?

413
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,960
Oh, poor Kiew!

414
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,320
One mobile phone contains a radio
and a television.

415
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,440
Really?

416
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,989
27 years

417
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,760
and everything is so modernized
like in space movies.

418
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,220
Hey,

419
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,690
do you want the same old song?

420
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,310
Nope.

421
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,830
I’m ready now.

422
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,590
Kiew!

423
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,290
This is why I didn’t tell you.

424
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,160
I knew that you’re gonna laugh
your ass off at me.

425
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,440
This is more beautiful
than my dancing outfit.

426
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,620
Okay,

427
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,210
now do it intentionally
so you can go home.

428
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,040
Here,

429
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,830
let’s turn the music on.

430
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,450
Hi, Dao.

431
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,050
Are you home now?

432
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,680
The thunder didn’t crash.

433
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,600
Your way didn’t work.

434
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,240
How can I go home?

435
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,320
I don’t know either.

436
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,080
Take it easy.

437
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,420
You’ll know one day.

438
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,030
Hey,

439
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,200
automatic fence door.

440
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,560
Mom and dad haven’t raised me
for 27 years,

441
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,190
and they have a lot of money
to buy such a big house like this?

442
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,470
This is my house!

443
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,830
Why don’t you take me home?

444
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,630
You’ve been gone for 4 months.

445
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,230
Madam Pong, your mother,

446
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,130
was very sad that she got sick

447
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,830
and went to heaven.

448
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,120
I miss you, mom.

449
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,770
I will hurriedly get back,

450
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,540
so that you won’t die.

451
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,550
I’ll comfort you.

452
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,850
Damn, a man!

453
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,340
I’m Plawan.

454
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,960
Oh, Prach’s son.

455
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,420
Why did you call my dad like that?

456
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,949
I mean, professor Prach.

457
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,090
You misheard.

458
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,370
Alright, that’s alright.

459
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,879
My dad said you must be homesick.

460
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,240
So, he asked me to take care of you.

461
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,299
You can take care of me,
but no need to hug me.

462
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,020
I got goosebumps on my arms.

463
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,319
Your language is so strange.

464
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,550
I’ve never heard it before.

465
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,610
Welcome to my home.

466
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,580
(Welcome Architecture Freshmen)

467
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,150
Plawan!

468
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,260
Hey, Bamee!

469
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,740
I’m so glad that we’re in the same faculty.

470
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,960
- Are you fine?
- Yeah, I am.

471
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,120
Hey!

472
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,180
It’s you who called the guards
to catch me.

473
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,220
Oh, it’s you who did it?

474
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,379
He wasn’t high on drugs.

475
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,419
He just came from another province,

476
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,640
that’s why he said
some confusing things.

477
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,270
How would I know?

478
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,000
He talked nonsense
so, I have to be cautious.

479
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,510
Now that you knew it. Apologize to me then.

480
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,290
I wasted my time waiting
for the guards.

481
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,240
It’s you who have to apologize to me.

482
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,589
Hey, you wanna have a problem?

483
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,089
Hey, Kiew! Calm down. Don’t do this.

484
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,869
- You want a problem?
- Hey, please don’t.

485
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,049
- Wanna try?
- Try it!

486
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,090
Hey!

487
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,839
This is the first day only

488
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,010
and you already started a fight.

489
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,359
You are in the same faculty.

490
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,800
You have to be in harmony!

491
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,800
Now, you two pair up as a buddy
for doing activities.

492
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,770
- No!
- No!

493
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,579
Pong! Hurry!

494
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,670
I’m here!

495
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,740
- Are you okay?
- Go!

496
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,500
Kiew,

497
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,410
stop hesitating!

498
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:47,990
Go!

499
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,790
Go!

500
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,330
Oops! Sorry.

501
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,860
Did you intend to do it?

502
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,860
I don’t want to be in the last place.

503
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,550
I don’t want to do another round.
Let’s do it quickly!

504
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,359
If you don’t want to do another round,

505
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,560
do it quickly.

506
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,640
Run! Go!

507
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,680
Oh, it's slippery

508
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,570
Do it fast! Do it fast!

509
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,210
Look!

510
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,940
Do it fast!

511
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,080
Do it fast!

512
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,780
You acted like a pro, but failed.

513
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,150
You’re too slow for me.

514
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,510
We were at a good pace
in the beginning.

515
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,890
Why did you speed it up?

516
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,490
Stop arguing!

517
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,080
I will make you two in harmony now.

518
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,030
- Shit!
- Shit!

519
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,000
- It’s Plawan!
- It’s Plawan!

520
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,329
Kiew and Bamee,

521
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:47,150
- their names are yummy.
- I agree. Can I have one bowl please?

522
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,710
Oh, you two are walking together.

523
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,840
Suddenly you’re in harmony?

524
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Everyone in the campus knows
my name already!

525
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,710
Give me the cleanser now!

526
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,530
You two need to hug each other first.

527
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,810
I hate him.

528
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,860
I have the same feeling towards you.

529
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,760
You’re friends.

530
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,400
Don’t hate each other.

531
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,090
You should love each other.

532
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,119
The ink I used on your faces,

533
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,509
I bought it from Japan.

534
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,749
The cleansers aren’t available
in Thailand.

535
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,649
It takes weeks if you order it online.

536
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,089
If you want the name of
someone you hate

537
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,960
to stick on your faces for weeks,
then it’s up to you.

538
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,420
- Let’s go.
- Hey, Plawan!

539
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,670
Bamee, don’t you love Kiew?

540
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,360
- Give me the cleanser now.
- Don’t fight again.

541
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,310
If that bastard joins us, I can’t eat.

542
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,850
He just misunderstood.

543
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,750
Don’t mind him.

544
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,870
If he misunderstands,
he has to apologize to me.

545
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,500
His parents have
never taught him manners?

546
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,430
Bamee doesn’t have a father.

547
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,730
He only has a stepmother
who doesn’t really love him.

548
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,840
Such a sad story.

549
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,350
I feel sorry for him.

550
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,260
He used to be lively,

551
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,820
but once his father died,

552
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,770
he totally changed to be
a different person.

553
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,290
He’s reserved and quiet.

554
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,100
He doesn’t look happy at all.

555
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,249
You’ve known him for a long time?

556
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,340
Yes,

557
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,230
his dad is my dad’s best friend.

558
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,740
He’s uncle Art.

559
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,830
Which Art?

560
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,690
Art Artnarong?

561
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,640
- Yeah.
- Hey!

562
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,120
Uncle Art is dead?

563
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,350
Yes.

564
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,539
Let’s check out this restaurant.

565
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,480
Yeah.

566
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,340
We are studying
at the same institute again,

567
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,460
Miss soulmate.

568
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,439
You don’t understand human’s language.

569
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,770
Can’t believe you are smart enough
to get in.

570
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,449
I told you since grade 10 to grade 12
that I don’t like you.

571
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,790
You still keep chasing after me.

572
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,420
Love takes time.

573
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,770
I can wait.

574
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,020
You can wait for her in the next life,

575
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,020
so, in this life she can be at peace.

576
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,540
You’ve been nosy for many years.

577
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,970
Don’t you get tired?

578
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,390
Why can’t you just let me flirt
with her happily?

579
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,390
Can you stop being happy
from someone’s suffering?

580
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,150
Hey, take it first.

581
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,820
This is too much.

582
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,570
This is my boy.

583
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,520
If you mess with him, you die.

584
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,990
We’ll see!

585
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,399
You can order what you want.

586
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,520
It’s my treat because you protected us
from Franc.

587
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,930
1 cup of iced coffee, please.

588
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,970
Iced coffee?

589
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,700
Which one do you mean?

590
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,930
Americano, Cappuccino, Mocha, or Latte?

591
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,180
Hey,

592
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,799
are these coffee
or mineral water from France?

593
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,989
It’s a hundred Baht per cup.

594
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,440
Why are they so expensive?

595
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,340
And what are the -no,
-no names you said?

596
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,260
You don’t know a mobile phone,

597
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,350
you don’t know coffee names?

598
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,280
Seriously, where is your hometown?

599
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,610
In Bangkok, but

600
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,140
I don’t get to drink coffee that much.

601
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,599
So, I don’t know how to order.

602
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,150
Then you can have the same menu as mine.

603
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,279
It’s a hundred Baht per cup,

604
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
but it’s so bitter like a herbal drink.

605
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,070
Did you trick me?

606
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,320
What kind of trick?

607
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,510
You agreed to have
the same menu as mine.

608
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,729
Is your life so bitter?

609
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,320
Why do you drink such bitter coffee?

610
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,820
I don’t like to drink something sweet.

611
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,100
I can buy you a new one.

612
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,850
Hey, it’s okay. I don’t drink any more.

613
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,900
If that guy annoys you again, tell me.

614
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,510
Annoy?

615
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,650
This word is only for
our parents’ generation.

616
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,420
Oh, really?

617
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,190
How do people say it these days?

618
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,850
Mess with my feet.

619
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,880
Oh,

620
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,930
why are teenagers these days so rude?

621
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,490
You said like you are a senior.

622
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,600
You think that I will be friend with you
just because you helped me?

623
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,110
I hope so.

624
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,590
Then you’re going to be disappointed.

625
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,130
I’ll try again.

626
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,070
Shit!

627
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,970
Is this your attempt to be my friend?

628
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,720
If you refuse, you’ll get dirtier.

629
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,340
Nonsense!

630
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,320
Bamee!

631
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,970
Bamee!

632
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:35,870
Kiew!

633
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,230
Hey!

634
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,020
Check these out.

635
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,620
We might find a way
to bring you back to the past.

636
00:40:55,404 --> 00:40:57,800
I have 4 months before my mom dies.

637
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,200
If I can go back,

638
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,640
another person that
I won’t let him die is Art.

639
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,640
I will tell him
to stop drinking liquors.

640
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,790
We can succeed.

641
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,350
Here, I bought this for you.

642
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,425
- Hey
- While you’re here,

643
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,190
you have to behave like modern people.

644
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,370
Hey,

645
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,190
thank you so much my friend.

646
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,130
Whoa!

647
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,110
Here, press it here.

648
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,780
Hey! I can do it now.

649
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,290
Oh, kindergarteners can do it too.

650
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,507
I taught you how to use a mobile phone.

651
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,860
Now can you do me a favor?

652
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,210
Can you be my cupid?

653
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,910
Which faculty? Just tell me bro!

654
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,220
- Bamee
- Hey!

655
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,070
Are you a ladyboy?

656
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,420
A ladyboy? What do you mean?

657
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,420
A man who likes a man.

658
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,309
Your word is so strange
and out of date.

659
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,419
I’ve never heard it before.

660
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,110
Right now,
we call it a gender diversity.

661
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,010
I can’t do it.
It’s against the natural law.

662
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,589
Just be ourselves,

663
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,070
it’s the most natural thing.

664
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,710
Why?

665
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,760
Or do you want to keep him for yourself?

666
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,729
Are you out of your mind?

667
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,970
I like girls.

668
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,670
Then you can help me.

669
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,440
Please.

670
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,290
Alright. Okay.

671
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,870
Yes!

672
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,390
If I have to be a cupid,

673
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,990
I have to get close to him first.

674
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,590
He doesn’t pick up.

675
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,830
Is he already asleep?

676
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,910
Do it quickly!

677
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,900
It’s almost time for class.
Why is he not here yet?

678
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,200
Hey!

679
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,760
It’s him who caused trouble for me.

680
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:52,760
You messed with my boss?

681
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,280
We’ll see!

682
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,500
Where are you going?

683
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:55,150
- Hey!
- Arghhh!

684
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,520
Hey!

685
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,100
Kiew!

686
00:46:29,261 --> 00:46:36,822
Translated by 9 Days team.

687
00:46:37,254 --> 00:46:39,696
(Past-senger the series.)

688
00:46:40,355 --> 00:46:41,716
Mr. Bad mouth and Miss Clumsy!

689
00:46:41,836 --> 00:46:42,348
- Hey!
- Hey!

690
00:46:43,337 --> 00:46:45,150
Thunder, crash on me!

691
00:46:45,426 --> 00:46:46,369
You asked for a thunder crash?

692
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,497
Is this your experiment?

693
00:46:48,047 --> 00:46:49,622
You’ll be dead before finishing
the experiment!

694
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,388
I won’t die easily.

695
00:46:51,755 --> 00:46:53,514
Thunder, crash on me!

696
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:55,763
Hey!

697
00:46:56,604 --> 00:46:58,244
Thunders now are stronger than
when we were young.

698
00:46:58,704 --> 00:46:59,774
This is too dangerous.

699
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:01,319
- Let me go.
- Come here!

700
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,969
I created a chat group

701
00:47:03,355 --> 00:47:05,339
since our dads are friends.

702
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:08,640
What should be the name of the group?

703
00:47:10,178 --> 00:47:11,351
How about “Dad’s friends”?

704
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:12,763
Cool!

705
00:47:13,281 --> 00:47:15,688
<i>I want you to know.</i>

706
00:47:15,705 --> 00:47:18,243
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

707
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:23,594
<i>But I’m still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

708
00:47:23,852 --> 00:47:26,839
<i>I just tell you in my heart</i>

709
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:29,746
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

710
00:47:29,757 --> 00:47:31,722
<i>That’s enough for me.</i>

711
00:47:31,732 --> 00:47:34,575
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

712
00:47:34,586 --> 00:47:38,325
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

713
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:41,069
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

714
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:46,741
<i>But I’m still afraid
that I might lose you.</i>

715
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:49,631
<i>I just tell you in my heart</i>

716
00:47:49,641 --> 00:47:52,467
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

717
00:47:52,477 --> 00:47:54,678
<i>That’s enough for me.</i>

718
00:47:54,688 --> 00:47:57,616
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

719
00:47:57,627 --> 00:48:03,314
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>
