Shit, don't tell me that…

2
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,710
Can I sleep with you?

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,260
Hey.

4
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,980
What's wrong with you?

5
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:37,445
I'm gonna teach you how to wash veggies.

6
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,780
Hey!

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,290
Kiew looks exactly like his dad.

8
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,130
Kitti Tirakan.

9
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:49,507

<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

23
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:51,718

24

26
00:01:56,682 --> 00:02:00,234
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

27

I might lose you.</i>

<i>I will not cross the line.</i>

34
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:45,876
Surprise!

35
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:47,425
Damn it!

36
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:49,555
It's a piggie for hugging,

37
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:51,726
so, you will dream of me only.

38
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,905
We share the same thought!

39
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:56,815
Hey, it's so cute!

40
00:02:56,816 --> 00:02:58,915
- Let's exchange!
- Yeah.

41
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,196
So cute!

42
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:02,145
So cute!

43
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:03,316
It really is.

44
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:05,757
We haven't seen each other for a
day and you've rushed to see me.

45
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:07,236
You can't take it, right?

46
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:11,846
Where are you taking me to?

47
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:12,836
Hurry up!

48
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,316
Why did you take me here?

49
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,276
Don't tell me that…

50
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:38,946
Oh, no!

51
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,376
Who are you?

52
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:43,796
Your boyfriend.

53
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,816
What's wrong with you?
I'm hurt.

54
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:52,196
Tell me who you are.

55
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:55,915
What's wrong with you?

56
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,076
I'm so confused.

57
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:06,416
You know that uncle Kiew
has disappeared for a long time.

58
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:09,736
You know you look like him,

59
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:11,976
so, you claimed his full name.

60
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:16,626
Why are you fooling uncle Prach and us?

61
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:20,116
I've never fooled anyone.

62
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,166
Why did you claim his name as yours?

63
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:25,856
This is my name.

64
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:28,326
This is my picture.

65
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:30,946
I'm your dad's friend.

66
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,396
You're not making any sense.

67
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,326
Don't you think that
if you're my dad's friend,

68
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,416
you should be the same age
as uncle Prach?

69
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:46,536
I travelled in time from the 90s.

70
00:05:47,176 --> 00:05:48,366
Do you think I'm stupid?

71
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:49,936
Why do you keep fooling me?

72
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,186
I almost told you the truth,

73
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:55,846
but you scolded me.

74
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,146
What are you experimenting
that you have to risk your life?

75
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:05,526
A time-machine door.

76
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:07,316
Did you watch too many movies?

77
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:10,446
I witnessed it with my own eyes, it's real.

78
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:13,106
You might be dreaming or drunk.

79
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,706
This is a message from my mom.

80
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:25,006
A message from your dad.

81
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,686
From Prach, Ann, Keng,

82
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,346
I have messages from all of them.

83
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:40,966
In 1995!

84
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:54,856
Shit!

85
00:06:57,136 --> 00:06:58,916
Bamee! Bamee!

86
00:07:01,396 --> 00:07:02,436
Bamee!

87
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:08,146
Bamee!

88
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,196
Bamee, where are you going?

89
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:11,476
Bamee!

90
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:13,856
Bamee!

91
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,140
Bamee, where are you going?

92
00:07:16,326 --> 00:07:17,326
Bamee!

93
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:31,236
Why did you run away?

94
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:33,816
I just need some fresh air.

95
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:36,046
Take the elevator then!

96
00:07:38,786 --> 00:07:40,036
When I'm shocked,

97
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:41,336
I need to run to get tired

98
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:42,716
and I'll be mindful.

99
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:45,146
Why the hell are you shocked?

100
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:50,036
If you just met someone who
time-travelled, won't you feel shocked?

101
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:52,116
No, I wouldn't feel shocked.

102
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:53,466
I would pass out first.

103
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:03,086
Your dad was funny.

104
00:08:03,746 --> 00:08:06,056
He liked to make silly jokes
to make us laugh.

105
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,026
When he was sick, he
didn't like to take pills.

106
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:11,026
Uncle Kiew…

107
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:15,116
If you're mindful and call me this old,

108
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:16,836
then go back to being crazy.

109
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,026
So, you knew that
I don't like taking pills.

110
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:28,516
Yeah.

111
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,376
You travelled here from the past.

112
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:36,046
Why is your name
on the freshmen's list?

113
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,180
Prach and I tried to figure this out.

114
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:41,896
But we don't know yet.

115
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:44,726
Ann said it's destiny.

116
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:49,806
If one day destiny
takes you back to the past,

117
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:51,862
what will I do?

118
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:06,446
This photo was taken when everybody
helped me to get back home.

119
00:09:07,576 --> 00:09:09,626
We tried many times but failed.

120
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:14,616
So, I stopped thinking about the past.

121
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:17,807
I live in the present,
and try to be as happy as possible.

122
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:23,846
What if you have a chance to go back?

123
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:28,856
I'll let you decide again.

124
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:53,176
I'll sleepover at your house tonight.

125
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,006
Can you tell me about my dad?

126
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:26,716
About your dad?

127
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,756
Yayyy!

128
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:48,216
Whoooo!

129
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:04,606
He didn't like taking pills.

130
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:06,176
He liked drawing.

131
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:07,876
He liked sports.

132
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:10,116
I'm like him in many ways.

133
00:11:10,556 --> 00:11:11,986
I want you to be like
him in one more way.

134
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:13,346
What is it?

135
00:11:13,676 --> 00:11:14,756
Be lively.

136
00:11:15,796 --> 00:11:16,896
Be happy.

137
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:19,256
I laugh a lot lately.

138
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,756
I'm a lot happier than before.

139
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:25,296
I'm taking myself out
of the old, dark world.

140
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:35,056
Art must be so glad to see
that you are happy.

141
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,316
Smells so good.

142
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,619
I was about to call you down.

143
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:22,316
Aunt Pim went to deliver baked
goods, so Ioffered to make breakfast.

144
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:24,105
He's so nice.

145
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,580
Mom will be less tired. Kiew,

146
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,440
do you want to move in with us?

147
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,116
Do you want me to be one of your slaves?

148
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:38,386
He got me.

149
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:39,936
Ouch, it hurts.

150
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:44,766
Here, let me do it for you.

151
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:47,926
Stop it!

152
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:50,946
I'll do it. Give it to me.

153
00:12:51,126 --> 00:12:53,226
You can look into Kiew's eyes
while waiting.

154
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:56,786
Come here, sit down.

155
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:11,045
He slept over at Bamee's
without telling me.

156
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:12,876
I didn't get to sleep with Moodaeng.

157
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:15,395
I'll scold him when I see him.

158
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:16,855
Scold me?

159
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:17,845
Yeah.

160
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:20,056
Ah, then I'm gonna kick you.

161
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:23,926
Now you're protecting him.

162
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,541
The shy Bamee is gone.

163
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:28,846
Now you express yourself freely!

164
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:30,746
Every minute is precious.

165
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,076
I have to make it worthwhile.

166
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:34,796
It's true.

167
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:36,896
Kiew is going to study abroad.

168
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:41,066
It won't be long till you're away.

169
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,059
I wont scold you now.

170
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,826
Just tell me that you're afraid
to get kicked.

171
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,505
Hello, what's up?

172
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:57,686
Yes, sir.

173
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:01,476
Oh,

174
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:04,856
yes, sir. I'm going to see you now.

175
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,536
Uncle Prach wants to see me now.

176
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:12,546
Hey, but it's almost time for class.

177
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,045
Your dad asked you to take notes,

178
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,370
take pictures, record a voice memo,
and send them to me.

179
00:14:34,196 --> 00:14:36,275
This fortune-teller is always fully booked.

180
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,805
She's more precise than
anyone else in this world.

181
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:40,535
- Yeah.
- Is that so?

182
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:41,495
Yeah.

183
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,445
She knows even our parents' names.

184
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:45,395
She's precise even with phone numbers.

185
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:48,926
Let's say she's so precise
I don't dare to use her service.

186
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:52,295
Are you afraid that
I'll know that you have a fling?

187
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:53,805
Don't let me know!

188
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:56,245
If I do, I won't let you know.

189
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:57,355
I don't dare to use her service because

190
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,695
if she mentions bad incidents,

191
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:00,886
I'll be worried.

192
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:05,986
When you were young,
you talked harshly to Ann.

193
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:09,285
But now that you are her lover,

194
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:11,626
oh, you're so afraid of her.

195
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:15,216
Karma serves me right.

196
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:19,205
- Hello there.
- Hello.

197
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:21,586
Chill. Let's relax.
Don't be stressed.

198
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:25,316
Since I'm here,
I want to see my fortune too.

199
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:26,795
I want to know

200
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:28,455
if I have another soulmate.

201
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:29,636
Is it a good idea?

202
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,065
- She's precise, right?
- Very precise.

203
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,630
Hello everyone.

204
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,386
You're here!

205
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:48,356
I've found my soulmate.

206
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:51,256
This is Winny,

207
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:53,816
the magic fortune-teller
from Vientiane.

208
00:15:54,306 --> 00:15:57,076
These days, the fortune-teller
has to be this beautiful?

209
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,656
Hello. My name's Prach.

210
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,035
Uncle, you are unlucky in love.

211
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:06,735
You have to be a widow
for the rest of your life.

212
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:07,676
Hey!

213
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:10,106
You knew what I wanted to ask
just by seeing my face.

214
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:11,435
Super precise!

215
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:12,205
Of course, she is.

216
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:14,396
If she wasn't, I wouldn't take
you here to have your fourtunes read.

217
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,366
Here, he is the one I've talked about.

218
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:31,836
Oops!

219
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:35,585
Hey, Prach!

220
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:38,046
- What?
- If you fall for her, be brave.

221
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:40,451
I'm gonna throw my drink at you.

222
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:42,066
Haha, you're shy.

223
00:16:47,476 --> 00:16:49,286
Who is Phongsee?

224
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,176
Who is Phongsee?

225
00:16:53,776 --> 00:16:55,236
She's my mom.

226
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:58,536
She's waiting for you.

227
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,246
She's waiting for you.

228
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,245
I've never met someone
with such a strange fate.

229
00:17:09,246 --> 00:17:11,235
It's like he was lost from afar.

230
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:13,276
He wants to go back but he can't.

231
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:16,601
Winny has never…

232
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:17,946
I can understand her.

233
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,316
Is there a way for him to go back?

234
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:32,096
- The priest Pho Ngoen.
- Hey!

235
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:37,755
I'm here because of him?

236
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,206
Don't disrespect him again!

237
00:17:39,486 --> 00:17:42,436
Complete your unfinished task for him.

238
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:46,816
But we redeemed all vows already.

239
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:48,986
Not yet!

240
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:51,395
You haven't completed all
that you promised to do.

241
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:52,736
Think about it carefully.

242
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:06,851
Call him if you want to know.

243
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,966
What are you waiting for?

244
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:10,636
Hi there,

245
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:12,776
Kitti isn't here today?

246
00:18:13,286 --> 00:18:14,516
Err…

247
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,126
He has diarrhea.

248
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:22,011
Please tell him
to submit all assignments to me.

249
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:23,016
Yes, professor.

250
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:28,586
You can call him now.

251
00:18:28,994 --> 00:18:30,934
Your dad must've taken Kiew
for serious business,

252
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,826
or he wouldn't let him miss class.

253
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:36,786
Sometimes I feel like

254
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:39,606
uncle Prach and Kiew have some secrets.

255
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:42,196
I feel the same.

256
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:44,406
When Kiew was dismissed from the hospital,

257
00:18:44,532 --> 00:18:46,502
uncle Prach took him to do something.

258
00:18:49,106 --> 00:18:50,816
Has he told you anything?

259
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:54,706
Oh,

260
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:57,046
you all are here.

261
00:18:57,316 --> 00:19:00,446
Can we join you too?

262
00:19:01,414 --> 00:19:03,136
- Can we?
- Sure, you can.

263
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,521
Which table do you like?

264
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:15,261
Where is Kiew, by the way?

265
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:16,596
He has something to do.

266
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:19,235
You and Kiew are together?

267
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:20,136
Yeah.

268
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:22,775
What about Baiwan being Kiew's girlfriend?

269
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:24,526
You all fooled me!

270
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:28,796
Who told you?

271
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:33,225
They stuck together like a glue.
It's obvious.

272
00:19:33,226 --> 00:19:34,396
Right!

273
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:37,636
It doesn't matter who Kiew is with.

274
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:39,805
But if you still flirt with Baiwan,

275
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:41,376
it's gonna be a problem.

276
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:46,215
I won't cause troubles for Baiwan.

277
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:47,766
You can get over her now?

278
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:49,656
I love you.

279
00:19:53,516 --> 00:19:54,946
Is this how you confess to her?

280
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:56,676
I'm straightforward.

281
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,216
If I love her, I tell her.

282
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:02,976
I'll keep loving you,

283
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:05,796
even if you'll love me

284
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,736
or not.

285
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:12,602
Friends, we don't have to eat anymore.

286
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:14,366
I'm thirsty now.

287
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:22,126
Winny mentioned the priest.

288
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:27,296
I think you're here
because of the priest for sure!

289
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,836
I shouldn't say something disrespectful.

290
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:37,345
Hey, we all can make mistakes.

291
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:39,416
- Don't think too much.
- Yeah.

292
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:42,115
Come here. I'm gonna slap you.

293
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,066
- You did it too softly.
- Prach!

294
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,146
Can you remember now?

295
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:48,606
Apart from doing the Thai dance,
what did you promise to him?

296
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,676
Think carefully.

297
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:00,926
I don't believe in invisible things.

298
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:05,725
Come on, I wanna see the show now!
Do it quickly!

299
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:08,345
<i>If you don't mind,</i>

300
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,645
<i>I'll ask you to be in love with me.</i>

301
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,316
<i>I've been interested in you for a long time.</i>

302
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:13,966
That's right!

303
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:16,566
We prayed together.

304
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:21,315
The priest might want you to dance with us.

305
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:23,716
Hey, how about we take Kiew there and dance?

306
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:25,645
We have nothing to lose.

307
00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:26,946
Let's do it tonight.

308
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:30,448
Winny mentioned everything so precisely.

309
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:32,515
If this works,

310
00:21:32,516 --> 00:21:34,205
Kiew can go home.

311
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:35,336
Yeah!

312
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:37,565
Let's do it tomorrow.

313
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:39,976
Oh, you said that you wanted to go home.

314
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:43,816
I want to.

315
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:46,936
But I have to say goodbye to someone.

316
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:56,486
Hey!

317
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,216
Thank you.

318
00:22:23,986 --> 00:22:25,086
We need to talk.

319
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:28,376
Kiew!

320
00:22:29,336 --> 00:22:30,676
I won't do anything to him.

321
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:32,746
You can wait here.

322
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:54,416
Do you really like Bamee?

323
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:56,395
Why?

324
00:22:56,396 --> 00:22:57,876
Will you get out of my way?

325
00:22:58,386 --> 00:22:59,805
Answer the question.

326
00:22:59,806 --> 00:23:02,246
I've never played with anyone's feelings.

327
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:04,466
If I'm not here,

328
00:23:04,996 --> 00:23:06,396
please take care of Bamee.

329
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:08,326
Where are you going?

330
00:23:09,226 --> 00:23:10,326
Just in case.

331
00:23:11,846 --> 00:23:13,056
Can you promise me?

332
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:15,056
Yes.

333
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:18,536
But if you're gone and
want to take him back,

334
00:23:19,196 --> 00:23:20,456
I won't return him to you.

335
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:22,536
If that day comes,

336
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:25,246
and you can make him happier,

337
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,920
I'll be glad for you.

338
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:41,926
Is everything okay?

339
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,356
I just asked for a leave.

340
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:45,796
Let's hang out somewhere.

341
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:49,076
Is there something wrong?

342
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:54,824
You can finally find a way back home?

343
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:59,046
I'm not sure if it'll work or not.

344
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:01,875
But this fortune-teller is very precise.

345
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:03,716
I think it's likely to work.

346
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:05,942
Then,

347
00:24:06,756 --> 00:24:08,996
today's going to be our last day together?

348
00:24:24,886 --> 00:24:27,496
You said we're gonna be
happy together until the last minute?

349
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,336
Is there anything else
you want to do with me?

350
00:24:36,656 --> 00:24:38,136
There are many things.

351
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:41,555
Let's do them now.

352
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:42,666
Time is running out.

353
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:18,966
Hahaha.

354
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:29,056
I'll be right back.

355
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:30,876
Yeah.

356
00:25:34,846 --> 00:25:36,695
- Brother,
- Yes, what's up?

357
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:38,915
- Today is my friend's special day.
- Yes.

358
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,665
Can you play guitar for me?

359
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,296
You're welcome.

360
00:25:43,356 --> 00:25:48,375
<i>I have something in my heart that feels</i>

361
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:53,436
<i>deeper than just being friends.</i>

362
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:57,125
<i>I want you to know.</i>

363
00:25:57,126 --> 00:25:59,805
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

364
00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:01,875
<i>But I'm still afraid</i>

365
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:05,295
<i>that I might lose everything.</i>

366
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:08,275
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

367
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,835
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

368
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,335
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

369
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:16,595
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

370
00:26:16,596 --> 00:26:21,946
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>

371
00:26:41,787 --> 00:26:45,977
<i>I have something in my heart that feels</i>

372
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:51,175
<i>deeper than just being friends.</i>

373
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,195
<i>I want you to know.</i>

374
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,745
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

375
00:26:56,746 --> 00:27:02,235
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

376
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:05,395
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

377
00:27:05,396 --> 00:27:08,355
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

378
00:27:08,356 --> 00:27:10,565
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

379
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:13,075
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

380
00:27:13,076 --> 00:27:16,976
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

381
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:19,795
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

382
00:27:19,796 --> 00:27:25,325
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose you.</i>

383
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:28,005
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

384
00:27:28,006 --> 00:27:31,075
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

385
00:27:31,076 --> 00:27:33,015
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

386
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:36,255
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

387
00:27:36,256 --> 00:27:41,986
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>

388
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:45,125
You sing quite okay.

389
00:27:45,126 --> 00:27:46,196
Okay for what?

390
00:27:46,356 --> 00:27:47,655
For getting a cup of coffee, maybe.

391
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:48,806
- Hey!
- Hey!

392
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:53,796
Wait,

393
00:27:54,316 --> 00:27:55,396
here it is.

394
00:27:56,546 --> 00:27:57,626
What are you doing?

395
00:27:58,446 --> 00:27:59,356
Huh?

396
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,186
Here.

397
00:28:11,096 --> 00:28:12,346
Do you want me to draw?

398
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,636
I want to take your drawing back home.

399
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:22,936
Won't you leave anything for me?

400
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:24,956
I'm not taking advantage of you.

401
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,145
I used to imagine that

402
00:28:37,146 --> 00:28:39,636
if I have a lover, I want to sit
and draw together like this.

403
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:42,161
Me too.

404
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:47,216
You really were born to be my soulmate.

405
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:52,026
Draw it now.

406
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:53,465
You can start drawing too.

407
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:54,516
Do it quickly.

408
00:28:57,092 --> 00:28:58,182
Hey!

409
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,640
Turn away.

410
00:29:25,226 --> 00:29:27,246
Are you gonna use me forever?

411
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,816
Will you let me?

412
00:29:31,092 --> 00:29:32,392
Can I say no?

413
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:38,912
Can you help me with this question?

414
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:55,626
Look at the question.

415
00:29:57,513 --> 00:29:58,833
I want to look at you first.

416
00:30:01,826 --> 00:30:03,296
That's enough.

417
00:30:03,826 --> 00:30:06,186
Let's take a look.

418
00:30:06,196 --> 00:30:07,606
Here, this one.

419
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:11,086
It's the same.

420
00:30:11,396 --> 00:30:14,366
Replace Function with this one.

421
00:30:14,836 --> 00:30:15,945
Where?

422
00:30:15,946 --> 00:30:17,346
Below here, you see.

423
00:30:22,996 --> 00:30:24,486
Oh, so beautiful.

424
00:30:26,106 --> 00:30:29,006
I'm going to show it to your dad
and tell him that you drew it.

425
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,336
My dad will say that you're crazy!

426
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:39,506
Can I see your drawing too?

427
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:53,406
Whoa,

428
00:30:54,196 --> 00:30:56,026
you can do it without a model?

429
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:58,486
I'm good at imagining.

430
00:31:00,036 --> 00:31:01,216
Do you like it?

431
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:03,666
Very much.

432
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:09,586
Let's go for dinner.

433
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:30,476
I want to do this with you,

434
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,029
my special one.

435
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:57,506
What do you want to do after this?

436
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:01,036
Whatever

437
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:03,236
is the most fun.

438
00:32:11,456 --> 00:32:13,006
Hey, hey, hey.

439
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:19,086
Argh!

440
00:32:30,186 --> 00:32:33,846
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

441
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:37,436
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

442
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,756
Turn around.

443
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:47,241
Whoo!

444
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:55,186
Let's do it. Go! Go! Go!

445
00:32:59,106 --> 00:33:00,706
<i>Let's be in love.</i>

446
00:33:02,196 --> 00:33:06,156
<i>I want to belong to someone.</i>

447
00:33:06,696 --> 00:33:08,996
<i>I've been interested in you.</i>

448
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:13,116
Shit, choose the ones
that I can sing along.

449
00:33:14,656 --> 00:33:16,966
I can't sing any songs
from your generation.

450
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:19,179
You can sing the songs
you know in my time.

451
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:25,675
<i>If you don't mind,</i>

452
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:28,496
<i>I'll ask you to be in love with me.</i>

453
00:33:28,646 --> 00:33:32,086
<i>I've been interested
in you for a long time.</i>

454
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:36,446
Hey, this is the same song.

455
00:33:36,726 --> 00:33:37,696
Oh, yeah?

456
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:35,466
I'll remember the happiness
I've shared with you forever.

457
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:18,836
Before you go,
try the food from your student.

458
00:36:25,926 --> 00:36:28,696
Thank you for making me happy.

459
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,910
From today on,

460
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:39,486
we might never see each other again.

461
00:36:40,376 --> 00:36:42,346
Don't you have something else
to tell me?

462
00:36:43,156 --> 00:36:44,346
Something that I would like to hear.

463
00:36:48,586 --> 00:36:49,776
I love you.

464
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:53,736
I love you, too.

465
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:13,408
- Bamee turned off his phone.
- Same as Kiew.

466
00:37:14,196 --> 00:37:15,076
Yes.

467
00:37:15,596 --> 00:37:16,536
Thank you very much.

468
00:37:19,646 --> 00:37:21,315
The guard at the condo said that

469
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:23,436
they were totally drunk last night.

470
00:37:24,966 --> 00:37:26,296
Then, they might be asleep now.

471
00:37:26,886 --> 00:37:28,605
These two are causing troubles.

472
00:37:28,606 --> 00:37:30,835
I guess we have to ask
uncle Prach to warn them.

473
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:32,815
Well, you're like a class leader.

474
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:34,576
Always tell on the teacher
with everything.

475
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:40,116
I'm worried. But if I warn them myself,
I'm afraid that Bamee will get mad at me.

476
00:37:43,786 --> 00:37:44,835
Let's go.

477
00:37:44,836 --> 00:37:46,486
I'm going to walk you to the building.

478
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:48,306
Let's go.

479
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:00,705
Franc doesn't mess with me now.

480
00:38:00,706 --> 00:38:02,696
You don't have to walk
with me all the time.

481
00:38:03,476 --> 00:38:05,416
I didn't take care of you
just because of Franc.

482
00:38:09,886 --> 00:38:11,096
Well,

483
00:38:12,536 --> 00:38:13,576
I…,

484
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,036
I…,

485
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:21,026
I like you, Baiwan.

486
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,185
You can think about it first

487
00:38:26,186 --> 00:38:27,886
and give me the answer later.

488
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,916
Do you remember that night
we stargazed at your house?

489
00:39:02,026 --> 00:39:03,666
That I told you about your dad.

490
00:39:06,516 --> 00:39:08,195
I still remember his face

491
00:39:08,196 --> 00:39:10,366
while he was looking at the stars
and smiled to himself.

492
00:39:12,126 --> 00:39:13,336
We miss him, right?

493
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:15,506
Yeah.

494
00:39:15,726 --> 00:39:17,086
If it's possible,

495
00:39:17,436 --> 00:39:19,226
I'll take your dad back to you.

496
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:24,566
Yeah.

497
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,176
I'll do as I say.

498
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,496
I wish you can go home to see your mom.

499
00:39:34,812 --> 00:39:36,272
And I wish my dad will come back to me.

500
00:39:39,516 --> 00:39:40,536
I'll wait for you.

501
00:39:45,156 --> 00:39:46,696
I have to go now.

502
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:53,266
Can I see you off?

503
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,676
We don't allow anyone
who isn't related to this.

504
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:02,346
I will miss you.

505
00:40:03,906 --> 00:40:05,396
I'll miss you too.

506
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:33,958
The priest,

507
00:40:34,136 --> 00:40:35,186
I'm sorry.

508
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,300
I won't disrespect you again.

509
00:40:37,886 --> 00:40:40,456
This time, please let me go home.

510
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:43,566
Amen.

511
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:39,315
Will you get to eat?

512
00:42:39,316 --> 00:42:41,316
It's all dirty now.

513
00:43:04,446 --> 00:43:05,966
Slowly open your eyes.

514
00:43:14,306 --> 00:43:16,036
I want to stargaze with you.

515
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:12,036
Now, go!

516
00:44:24,766 --> 00:44:26,666
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

517
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:32,545
Whoa, the priest forgives you!

518
00:44:32,546 --> 00:44:33,715
You can go home now!

519
00:44:33,716 --> 00:44:37,205
Hey! Whoooo!

520
00:44:37,206 --> 00:44:39,226
- Yayyy!
- Yay, I'm so glad!

521
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,335
Oho, wow!

522
00:44:42,336 --> 00:44:43,876
Hey, hey!

523
00:44:44,246 --> 00:44:45,656
- Hey!
- It rains so hard like this?

524
00:44:45,706 --> 00:44:46,526
Oho!

525
00:44:48,546 --> 00:44:50,445
- Kiew!
- The time-machine door!

526
00:44:50,446 --> 00:44:52,426
The time-machine door!
The time-machine door!

527
00:44:53,996 --> 00:44:55,125
When I got here,

528
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:56,596
there was a lot of fog like this.

529
00:44:56,686 --> 00:44:57,546
Hey!

530
00:44:59,536 --> 00:45:00,856
I'm going now.

531
00:45:01,426 --> 00:45:02,665
Good luck, Kiew!

532
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,185
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

533
00:45:04,186 --> 00:45:05,785
- Kiew, good luck!
- Ann!

534
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,155
- Thank you so much.
- Good luck, Kiew.

535
00:45:07,156 --> 00:45:08,976
- Keng! Thank you so much.
- Good luck, my friend.

536
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:11,576
I'm going now.

537
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:20,226
Kiew!

538
00:45:35,436 --> 00:45:37,916
(Past Senger)

539
00:45:39,476 --> 00:45:41,636
(Next Episode)
If Soda was sitting next to me right now,

540
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:43,316
it would be nice.

541
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:49,676
Hey!

542
00:45:53,496 --> 00:45:54,885
Why did you push Kiew?

543
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:56,396
He's trying to touch my cheek.

544
00:45:56,596 --> 00:45:59,536
My arm is hurt.
It takes ages to finish cleaning.

545
00:46:00,736 --> 00:46:01,916
I can do it for you.

546
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:03,685
But I don't want you to.

547
00:46:03,686 --> 00:46:04,765
You said you want to recover soon,

548
00:46:04,766 --> 00:46:06,016
so, you can separate from me?

549
00:46:09,396 --> 00:46:10,316
(Emergency Room)

550
00:46:12,046 --> 00:46:13,636
How is Ekkawee?

551
00:46:16,346 --> 00:46:17,316
Bamee!

552
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:21,615
- Bamee!
- Bamee!

553
00:46:21,616 --> 00:46:23,615
- Bamee!
- Bamee!

554
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:25,415
Bamee! Bamee!

555
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:26,836
- Bamee!
- Bamee!

556
00:46:27,336 --> 00:46:28,356
Bamee!

557
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:30,491
<i>I want you to know.</i>

558
00:46:30,578 --> 00:46:33,145
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

559
00:46:33,156 --> 00:46:38,423
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

560
00:46:38,806 --> 00:46:41,779
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

561
00:46:41,804 --> 00:46:44,606
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

562
00:46:44,617 --> 00:46:46,582
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

563
00:46:46,592 --> 00:46:49,435
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

564
00:46:49,446 --> 00:46:53,185
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

565
00:46:53,195 --> 00:46:55,929
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

566
00:46:55,939 --> 00:47:01,601
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose you.</i>

567
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:04,491
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

568
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:07,327
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

569
00:47:07,337 --> 00:47:09,538
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

570
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:12,476
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

571
00:47:12,487 --> 00:47:18,174
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>
