(Previous Episode)
I wanna see the priest.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,250
If he shows up when I call him,

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,250
it means he's for real.

4
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,390
Priest! Come out now!

5
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,200
Let us see you! Priest!

6
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,780
- Come out now!
- Kiew!

7
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,260
- Don't insult him.
- Let us see you! Priest!

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,350
Hey!

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,240
Are you saying that
you vanished from 1995

10
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:19,015
and appeared in 2022?

11
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,300
Vanish?

12
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,430
Time travel!

13
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,425
That's only in the movies.

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,930
I must be dreaming.

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Ouch!

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,200
Are you dreaming?

17
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,960
- This is real.
- Yeah, it is!

18
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,120
- Arghhhhh.
- Arghhhhh.

<i>I will not cross the line.</i>

43
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:06,384
Ouch.

44
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,214
You passed out for hours.

45
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,754
Thought you'd never come back to life.

46
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:17,024
You cursed me just right
after I opened my eyes.

47
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:20,054
Who are you by the way?

48
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:25,544
Am I so far away,

49
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:27,114
that you can't recognize me?

50
00:03:28,654 --> 00:03:29,876
Can you recognize me now?

51
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:35,045
Why do you have to trick me?

52
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:44,734
That's right.
Why do I have to trick you?

53
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:48,144
Who are you?

54
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:50,374
I'll be back.

55
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:10,124
What can you remember about me?

56
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:15,324
What about yourself?

57
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:18,934
My name's Kiew.

58
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:20,114
I study Architecture.

59
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:21,684
That's all I know.

60
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:27,124
I asked the doctor to do
a CT scan all over your body.

61
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:30,184
Everything is normal.

62
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:32,054
Why can't you remember anything?

63
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:34,374
You asked me, but who will I ask?

64
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:37,154
Can you tell me who you are now?

65
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:40,304
I'm Bamee.

66
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:42,634
You're my friend?

67
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:44,854
Nope,

68
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:46,864
I rode a motorcycle and hit you.

69
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:49,194
You! Ouch.

70
00:04:54,324 --> 00:04:56,254
It's you who caused me this trouble.

71
00:04:57,844 --> 00:04:59,484
You ran in front of me
while I was riding.

72
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:03,274
You can say anything. I have amnesia.

73
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:05,284
Take me back to my room now.

74
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:07,454
Well,

75
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:09,734
you said you felt uncomfortable
in the room

76
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:11,494
and asked me to take you for a walk.

77
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:13,604
Now that we're here, you asked me
to take you back to your room.

78
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:15,164
What is wrong with you?

79
00:05:15,394 --> 00:05:16,384
I'm not in the mood now.

80
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:17,744
Take me back to my room right away.

81
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,944
You go sit over there.

82
00:05:35,024 --> 00:05:36,304
Now you think I'm disgusting?

83
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:38,714
You might wanna kill me.

84
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:41,464
You make no sense.

85
00:05:42,044 --> 00:05:43,264
If I wanted to kill you,

86
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:44,664
why did I take you to the hospital?

87
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:46,664
You're right.

88
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:49,024
Then could you take me to the rooftop?

89
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:51,890
I see.

90
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:53,504
You're afraid that I'll
throw you off the building.

91
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:55,314
so, you asked me to take
you back to your room?

92
00:05:57,154 --> 00:05:58,414
Well, you hit me,

93
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,689
so I'm allowed to think that way.

94
00:06:00,584 --> 00:06:01,764
Now take me to the rooftop quickly!

95
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:04,064
I feel uncomfortable here.
I can't breathe now.

96
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:17,524
No, I'm tired.

97
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:21,024
You hurt me so
I can't go there by myself.

98
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:23,174
Don't you wanna take
any responsibility?

99
00:06:35,924 --> 00:06:37,184
I wanna see the view over there.

100
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:42,824
Too much.

101
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:44,184
What is too much?

102
00:06:46,804 --> 00:06:47,824
You're too much!

103
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:50,624
I'm too much?

104
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:52,674
What does that mean?

105
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:55,004
I think your brain
is all messed up.

106
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:57,624
It's so messed up that it's too picky.

107
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:01,354
Let's make it easy.

108
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:03,344
Are you gonna take me there or not?

109
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:08,784
Hey!

110
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:43,484
Bangkok has changed so much
in the past 27 years.

111
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:47,264
It's beautiful, isn't it?

112
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:01,324
Don't look at your
phone, look at the view!

113
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:07,754
I saw it.

114
00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:10,084
What did you see?

115
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:13,774
You only see buildings so far away,

116
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:17,714
or you see the beauty
of the architecture

117
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,854
under the light and shadow of the sun?

118
00:08:20,494 --> 00:08:22,484
Try to see the beauty of this world,

119
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:24,684
so, your life will be happy.

120
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:35,134
The world is not beautiful
for everyone.

121
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:37,884
Your world and my world

122
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:39,814
are not the same planet.

123
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:44,634
I can take you out of that dark world.

124
00:08:58,624 --> 00:08:59,484
Ouch!

125
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:04,254
Why didn't you tell me
that you got hurt?

126
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:08,084
Why should I?

127
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:11,254
So, I wouldn't ask you
to take me to the rooftop.

128
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:15,114
Do you like to keep your pain
to yourself?

129
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:16,854
My pain doesn't go away
even though I tell you.

130
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:18,854
But you can feel less pain.

131
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:21,134
Bamee,

132
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,294
I'm not trying to preach to you.

133
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,544
But human beings are social creatures.

134
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:30,134
Friends will help you
to feel less pain.

135
00:09:32,424 --> 00:09:33,874
You seem like you want to be my friend.

136
00:09:34,644 --> 00:09:36,134
You said you have amnesia?

137
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:38,134
Why can you remember this topic?

138
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:42,544
You fooled me, right?

139
00:09:48,984 --> 00:09:49,904
Hey,

140
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,634
- Hello.
- How are you, Kiew?

141
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:57,524
I'm hurting a bit.

142
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:00,614
- Hello, professor.
- Hello.

143
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,494
Wow, so cute, I can't.

144
00:10:04,014 --> 00:10:05,674
Make a move. I'll help.

145
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:10,514
There's a lot of people here.
Can you remember anyone?

146
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:12,824
I can remember everyone.

147
00:10:13,224 --> 00:10:15,264
Bamee said you have amnesia?

148
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:16,994
He fooled me!

149
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:21,224
You fooled me
to drink such bitter coffee.

150
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:23,374
Why couldn't I fool you
to take me for a walk?

151
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:27,394
Whoa, you're so mean.

152
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:31,724
Well, it's lucky
that you're just joking.

153
00:10:32,244 --> 00:10:33,264
- Plawan,
- Yes.

154
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:35,324
Go ask the doctor
whether Kiew can be dismissed now.

155
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:37,104
- Alright, dad.
- Please go.

156
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:42,804
You can sit down here.

157
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:53,294
Plawan, take your friends
to have some snacks.

158
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:55,304
Take my money.

159
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,424
Will this be enough, dad?

160
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:04,134
Kids today spend a lot of money.

161
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:06,504
Whoa, you put it in my hand so hard.

162
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:08,304
Thank you, dad.

163
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:11,314
There's a café near this area
that has super delicious cakes.

164
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:13,504
Wait for Kiew to get changed
and we'll go there.

165
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:18,144
I'm craving some desserts!

166
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:20,174
No, you can't go with them.

167
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:21,524
You have to come with me.

168
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:24,594
Your dad called me to take you
to do some errands.

169
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:31,054
Yes, sir.

170
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:33,768
Too bad! You f*cking miss your chance!

171
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:38,294
You just said impolite word
in front of the dean!

172
00:11:38,524 --> 00:11:39,834
I'm sorry, sir.

173
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:46,024
It's my dad's treat.
Let's fully enjoy it!

174
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:49,824
Baiwan, you haven't known my friend.

175
00:11:50,164 --> 00:11:52,404
He is Pokpong. This is Baiwan.

176
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:53,404
She studies Humanities.

177
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:58,484
Well, I created the group chat

178
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,834
since our fathers are friends.

179
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,494
And we are friends
who study at the same university.

180
00:12:03,404 --> 00:12:04,454
I already sent an invitation to Kiew.

181
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:08,094
My dad and mom
aren't your dad's friends.

182
00:12:09,944 --> 00:12:11,614
But you're my friend,

183
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:12,984
so, you can join the group.

184
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:18,464
What should be the group's name?

185
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:23,674
We become friends because of our dads.

186
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:27,724
How about “Dad's Friends”?

187
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:30,214
Cool!

188
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:36,844
He takes care of us like
we're his real children.

189
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:39,424
Your dad is awesome!

190
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:41,404
Of course!

191
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:44,824
You're lucky to have a dad like yours.

192
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:47,546
You're the luckiest

193
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:49,544
because he's still alive.

194
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:54,034
If you feel like having a dad someday,

195
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:55,684
you can sleepover at my house.

196
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:57,784
My dad is everyone's dad.

197
00:12:58,014 --> 00:13:00,084
He is ready to be everyone's dad.

198
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:16,524
- Where are you taking me to?
- Home.

199
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:18,444
What's the secret there?

200
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,184
Why did you have to pay Plawan
a thousand Baht to treat his friends?

201
00:13:22,864 --> 00:13:24,364
I have no idea

202
00:13:24,364 --> 00:13:26,264
of how to take you back to the past.

203
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:28,274
I found someone to help.

204
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:46,764
- Oops!
- Hey!

205
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:49,444
You're always this clumsy!

206
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:51,724
Here you go again.

207
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:54,249
You're always running
that mouth of yours too.

208
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:57,104
Sit nicely and drink properly.
Why do you have to walk and drink?

209
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,804
I can't sit. I'm excited.

210
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:01,084
I want to know
who we are going to meet.

211
00:14:04,014 --> 00:14:06,164
Or Prach is having
a new mom for Plawan?

212
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:09,652
I totally forgot!

213
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:16,784
They're coming.

214
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:17,954
Come sit now!

215
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,074
Plawan's new mom

216
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:21,274
could say that we don't have good manners.

217
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:22,314
Sit nicely.

218
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:24,904
Bring your cup too. Oh, please.

219
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:33,814
Here they are.

220
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:35,794
People I brought to help you.

221
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:38,294
Hello. Hello.

222
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:46,064
It's Kiew.

223
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:50,354
He looks like Kiew's twin.

224
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:52,714
Yeah, he's so alike.

225
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:56,214
Mr. Bad Mouth and Miss Clumsy!

226
00:14:56,214 --> 00:14:57,184
- Hey!
- Hey!

227
00:14:57,494 --> 00:14:58,964
Be careful, you clumsy!

228
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,214
I said sorry.
Why do you have to call me that?

229
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:02,514
So, you know who you are

230
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:04,504
and stop being clumsy.

231
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:06,594
You have such a bad mouth!

232
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:09,804
- He knows our nicknames!
- That's right.

233
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:11,664
I even know your parents' names.

234
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:14,044
Ann, it's me, Kiew.

235
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:17,414
Hey, no way.

236
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:18,814
It's impossible.
No, it can't be. Impossible.

237
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:21,214
It's impossible.
No, it can't be. Impossible.

238
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:22,144
Prach,

239
00:15:24,044 --> 00:15:26,884
you brought this boy who looks like
Kiew to make fun of us, right?

240
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:29,454
He's the real Kiew.
I'll explain to you.

241
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:35,024
Don't waste your time to explain.
I won't believe you.

242
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:40,194
You told him our nicknames, right?

243
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:43,534
I'm here for real
and you don't believe me.

244
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:45,714
But as for priest Phuang Ngoen,
why do you believe in him so much?

245
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:47,754
Wait,

246
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:49,494
wait a sec.

247
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:54,454
This is my pager

248
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,394
and this is the last message my mom sent to me.

249
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:03,154
Is it clear now?

250
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:07,344
(Your favorite sugar palm cake is in the fridge.
Don't forget to eat it. Love you. 19/07/95)

251
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:14,334
This can't be possible.

252
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:16,874
You've travelled from the past!

253
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:20,744
I can't believe it either,
but it is real.

254
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:23,164
Can you swear to priest Phuang Ngoen?

255
00:16:23,164 --> 00:16:24,374
I swear!

256
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:27,944
You mentioned the priest,

257
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:29,494
so, this isn't a joke.

258
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:37,724
Kiew, is this really you?

259
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:46,384
Kiew!

260
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:49,024
I'm so glad that you're not dead yet!

261
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,544
You're my friend
and you can be this emotional.

262
00:16:55,894 --> 00:16:57,874
My mom only has me in her life.

263
00:16:57,874 --> 00:16:59,484
She thought I'm dead.

264
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,484
How painful it would be for her.

265
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:07,344
We tried to do our best
to take care of your mom,

266
00:17:08,714 --> 00:17:10,224
but it might not be good enough.

267
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:13,844
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:17,864
Hey, it's not your fault.

269
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:24,824
I asked you all to be here

270
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,524
to help brainstorm a way

271
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:28,474
to take Kiew back to the past

272
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:29,834
before his mom goes to heaven.

273
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:33,080
If he can travel here, he must be
able to travel back to the past too.

274
00:17:34,224 --> 00:17:35,404
I promise

275
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:37,684
that I will find a way to take you back
to your mom, Kiew.

276
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:40,114
I'll do my best.

277
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:42,574
I'll do my best too.

278
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:03,444
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

279
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:06,244
Hey,

280
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:09,184
what are you doing with my bag?

281
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:12,264
Are you taking revenge
that you got hit by Bamee?

282
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:14,474
Of course, Kiew is a villain.

283
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:16,504
You said we're friends.

284
00:18:16,504 --> 00:18:18,074
Why did you hurt your friend like this?

285
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,804
- Let go of Bamee, now!
- Baiwan!

286
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:22,754
Take this medicine!

287
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:29,884
Kiew said that Bamee will
for sure not take his medicine.

288
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:31,344
So, he tried to search in Bamee's bag.

289
00:18:39,974 --> 00:18:42,394
You haven't taken any medicine
since yesterday?

290
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:45,784
No, he doesn't like to take pills.

291
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:47,844
Really?

292
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,084
I've been his best friend
since we were young.

293
00:18:50,124 --> 00:18:50,994
I didn't know this.

294
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:52,704
How did you know?

295
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,354
- Sir! He's…
- Kiew!

296
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:03,144
Kiew!

297
00:19:04,254 --> 00:19:05,924
I'll get punished.

298
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:08,174
You know I don't like taking pills.

299
00:19:10,544 --> 00:19:12,554
But you have a fever.
Your body is very hot now.

300
00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:14,524
How can you recover
if you don't take a pill?

301
00:19:15,674 --> 00:19:17,104
Bring it back and take it.

302
00:19:19,714 --> 00:19:21,044
From the bin?

303
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:23,644
Sir!

304
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:25,834
Okay, I'll do it.

305
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:34,714
I just guessed.

306
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:36,474
You guess well.

307
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:37,594
Because I'm smart.

308
00:19:38,664 --> 00:19:40,164
Here, take it, Bamee.

309
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,254
You'll recover soon.

310
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:43,374
It doesn't matter
if I take it or not.

311
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:44,554
Are you being naughty?

312
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:47,744
Hey!

313
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:50,404
What the hell are you doing to me again?

314
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:07,784
Good job! A good boy takes his pills.

315
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:09,434
Good job!

316
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:15,131
It's all over now, good boy!

317
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:17,064
Now I have something
else I need to do.

318
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:24,494
Where is Baiwan?

319
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:27,974
You think you're cool?

320
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:29,534
Why do you like to mess
with other people?

321
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:31,134
You don't know me, right?

322
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:33,134
That's why you dare to do this to me.

323
00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:35,834
My dad is a president.

324
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:38,634
If that fist touches my face,

325
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:41,944
the whole university will be in trouble!

326
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:46,294
You're like a 3-year-old boy

327
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:48,524
having a fight with friends
and you have no way to fight back.

328
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,964
My dad will make trouble for you.

329
00:20:53,944 --> 00:20:55,314
Who said he can stop me?

330
00:20:56,514 --> 00:20:57,584
I let you go

331
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,614
because I changed my
mind to kick you instead!

332
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:03,094
- Stop it!
- Where are you going?

333
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,914
Aren't you afraid of my dad at all?

334
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:07,794
Hold on!

335
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,881
If my dad knows hears
about this, you're dead!

336
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:12,174
Come on,

337
00:21:12,774 --> 00:21:13,954
let's try.

338
00:21:15,726 --> 00:21:18,476
You'll get into trouble with my dad.

339
00:21:18,804 --> 00:21:20,864
You'll know it. Wait and see!

340
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:49,439
Where are you going?

341
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,384
<i>If you keep messing with my gang,</i>

342
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:56,768
<i>this clip of you will be
on the university official page.</i>

343
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:58,174
<i>From me.</i>

344
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:02,944
Kiew!

345
00:22:06,444 --> 00:22:07,504
Dean,

346
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:11,214
how could you let this awful
situation happen in this university?

347
00:22:12,674 --> 00:22:14,244
What happened, president?

348
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:18,084
I'm the president of the Thailand
ornamental fish association.

349
00:22:18,084 --> 00:22:19,804
Please get it right.

350
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:23,934
My child got hurt.

351
00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:26,464
Somebody harmed him?

352
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:27,694
That's right.

353
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:29,684
Who dared to do so?

354
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,584
A boy from hell, it's Kiew!

355
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:49,174
Do you want to lose your future?

356
00:22:49,174 --> 00:22:51,144
How could you kick my son?

357
00:22:52,784 --> 00:22:53,834
So childish!

358
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:57,184
Dad, he insulted me!

359
00:22:59,764 --> 00:23:02,184
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

360
00:23:05,294 --> 00:23:06,784
I'm here in person,

361
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:09,404
and you don't have any manners.

362
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:11,554
Behind my back,

363
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:14,154
you would harm my son even worse.

364
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:18,254
Dean,

365
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:21,264
you must expel him!

366
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:23,964
Then Franc must be fired too,

367
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,084
because he and his friends
harmed me first.

368
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:32,264
My baby boy doesn't like violence.

369
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:34,764
Don't blame it on him.

370
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,464
Here's the evidence.

371
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:49,704
<i>You hurt my boss?</i>

372
00:23:57,634 --> 00:23:59,054
Franc, you harmed him first.

373
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:02,864
Why didn't you tell me this?

374
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:06,764
I didn't know that he has evidence.

375
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:10,384
If I punish Kiew,

376
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:12,384
your son will be punished too.

377
00:24:13,434 --> 00:24:14,944
Oh, dean.

378
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:19,284
They're teenagers.

379
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:21,584
It's normal to have a fight sometimes.

380
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:24,304
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

381
00:24:25,934 --> 00:24:31,254
Here is the compensation
to comfort you.

382
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:35,344
Let's get over with this issue
and delete the clip, okay?

383
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:42,814
This amount of money

384
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:45,224
is enough for the compensation.

385
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:49,794
But if you want me to delete the clip,
you need to pay more.

386
00:24:50,034 --> 00:24:51,734
Are you trying to blackmail my dad?

387
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:53,454
Or do you want me to post on
social media with the caption.

388
00:24:53,684 --> 00:24:58,044
“The son of the president of the Thailand
ornamental fish association swaggers…”.

389
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:01,304
Okay, okay. You know, son,

390
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:03,244
I have tons of money.

391
00:25:03,244 --> 00:25:05,904
This amount of money doesn't bother me.

392
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:09,714
If you want it, then take it.

393
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:12,104
And then

394
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:15,404
it's over!

395
00:25:17,524 --> 00:25:18,464
Yes, sir.

396
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,174
Delete the clip too!

397
00:25:26,864 --> 00:25:30,064
Dean, everything is alright now.

398
00:25:31,314 --> 00:25:32,824
- Okay, sir.
- Let's go.

399
00:25:41,864 --> 00:25:42,784
Whoa,

400
00:25:44,154 --> 00:25:46,344
you knew how to get the CCTV footage.

401
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:48,484
You're a high-tech person, Kiew.

402
00:25:50,564 --> 00:25:51,904
Your son taught me.

403
00:25:52,994 --> 00:25:54,084
I'm rich now.

404
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:56,424
I'm gonna treat my children
and nephews.

405
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:58,424
Next time,

406
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,124
make sure you don't leave
any evidence, okay?

407
00:26:01,454 --> 00:26:03,654
From now on, if anyone messes with you,

408
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:06,084
tell me. I'll take care of it. Okay?

409
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:07,354
Sure, dad.

410
00:26:09,474 --> 00:26:11,834
Oh, Baiwan.

411
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:13,414
Hello.

412
00:26:13,764 --> 00:26:14,964
Are you doing well?

413
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:16,524
I'm doing well.

414
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:19,434
What about your parents?

415
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:20,994
Are they doing well?

416
00:26:22,344 --> 00:26:26,174
Please tell the judge that

417
00:26:26,464 --> 00:26:30,304
I will find some time
to visit him at his house.

418
00:26:31,984 --> 00:26:34,394
Yes, but you'd better not do that.

419
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:40,274
What did you say?

420
00:26:40,504 --> 00:26:42,524
I can't hear it clearly.

421
00:26:43,444 --> 00:26:46,624
I said don't forget to tell me in
advance when you are coming over.

422
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:49,394
I'll go with my dad too.

423
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:55,644
Baiwan is getting
more beautiful and prettier.

424
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:58,764
My baby boy has such sharp eyes.

425
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:00,104
Right, dad?

426
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:02,354
It's good that we're just friends.

427
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:06,174
Nope, it's not good.

428
00:27:06,714 --> 00:27:09,894
If you become my daughter-in-law,

429
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:15,205
you'll have a lot of money to spend
for the rest of your life.

430
00:27:18,108 --> 00:27:19,298
Well, if she doesn't like you,

431
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:21,014
she doesn't like you.

432
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:23,124
The dad doesn't make any sense,

433
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:25,091
that's why the son
doesn't make any sense.

434
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,544
This kid,

435
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:29,984
you looking for a problem?

436
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,884
You're aggressive
and don't have manners.

437
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:33,994
You wanna get hurt?

438
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,024
Even though I may look young,

439
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:39,424
but I'm as mature as you are.

440
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:43,124
For some people who don't
respect others' decisions,

441
00:27:43,354 --> 00:27:44,653
there's no point
in talking to them.

442
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:47,644
Let's go, Baiwan.

443
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,024
This kid

444
00:27:55,594 --> 00:27:56,644
wants to mess with me!

445
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:03,344
The restaurant that you wanna go
been closed down since I was young.

446
00:28:03,664 --> 00:28:05,294
The waiting queue was super long.

447
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:07,444
I can't believe it's closed down.

448
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:08,724
Well,

449
00:28:08,724 --> 00:28:11,814
there are lots of newer and more
modern restaurants these days.

450
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:13,469
The old ones had trouble surviving.

451
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,714
Which restaurant do you want us to try?

452
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:17,964
You can choose now.

453
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,384
This place is so gigantic.

454
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:22,804
This city is so civilized.

455
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:26,844
Hey, those are the lyrics from the song
my dad listened to when I was young.

456
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:29,664
You always talk like old people.

457
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:31,944
It's called being classic.

458
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:35,724
There's a thin line between
‘classic' and ‘out-of-date'.

459
00:28:37,544 --> 00:28:39,304
You're not classy, don't say anything.

460
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:42,824
I got the compensation
because of Baiwan,

461
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:44,864
so, I'll let Baiwan choose
where she wants to eat.

462
00:29:01,844 --> 00:29:03,704
Here they have
the lamp-grilling system?

463
00:29:03,704 --> 00:29:07,154
Gosh, this is not a lamp.
It's a cooker hood.

464
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:09,304
Hey, lower your voice.

465
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:11,084
I'm embarrassed now.

466
00:29:12,194 --> 00:29:13,484
I'm sorry then.

467
00:29:14,964 --> 00:29:17,374
Franc's dad

468
00:29:17,574 --> 00:29:19,104
always takes his son's side.

469
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:21,214
If it goes on like this,

470
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:23,394
I think Franc won't stop chasing
after Baiwan.

471
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:27,119
I'm so annoyed by him.

472
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:30,594
What can I do to stop him
from chasing after me?

473
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,594
You must have a boyfriend.

474
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:34,814
Yes.

475
00:29:36,054 --> 00:29:37,754
Nobody shows interest in me.

476
00:29:39,684 --> 00:29:40,874
You can try the fake-boyfriend.

477
00:29:42,294 --> 00:29:43,114
Well,

478
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,694
is it okay that we borrow
a boyfriend from someone else?

479
00:29:50,704 --> 00:29:51,854
Why are you guys laughing?

480
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:55,704
We have to translate Thai to Thai
for you all the time.

481
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:58,254
Fake-boyfriend is
an imaginary boyfriend.

482
00:29:58,444 --> 00:29:59,824
It's not like someone's boyfriend.

483
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:00,844
Yes.

484
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:03,744
Why didn't you tell me
that it's not for real?

485
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:05,504
I thought it's someone's name.

486
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:13,181
Pong is very suitable for this.

487
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:14,894
He can be your fake boyfriend
to fool Franc.

488
00:30:16,894 --> 00:30:18,394
Franc isn't afraid of Pong,

489
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:20,764
but he's afraid of Kiew.

490
00:30:22,774 --> 00:30:24,644
Can you be my fake boyfriend?

491
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:26,934
Are you sure?

492
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:28,754
If I'm your fake boyfriend,

493
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:30,784
then I can't flirt with someone else.

494
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:33,724
Do you understand the word ‘fake'?

495
00:30:34,194 --> 00:30:37,474
Once Franc stops chasing after Baiwan,
you can flirt with anybody.

496
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:41,614
Help me please.

497
00:30:58,114 --> 00:31:00,174
Oh, this sweet love.

498
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:03,624
Baiwan and Kiew are together?

499
00:31:11,974 --> 00:31:13,314
Have you watched this movie, Kiew?

500
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:17,314
Nope.

501
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:18,864
It's so much fun.

502
00:31:18,864 --> 00:31:20,464
I've watched it many times.

503
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:22,914
Let's watch it together some day.

504
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:27,954
Korean series,

505
00:31:28,384 --> 00:31:29,834
Korean food,

506
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:31,954
I can't believe that

507
00:31:31,954 --> 00:31:34,304
Thai people have preferred Korean
culture to western countries.

508
00:31:35,404 --> 00:31:36,804
You say that like
you just found out.

509
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:39,624
Korean stuff has been
trendy since I was 10 years old.

510
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,364
Have you not noticed it at all?

511
00:31:45,264 --> 00:31:47,824
My family only talks about the 90's,

512
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,984
so, I don't know much about
things that happened later.

513
00:31:51,454 --> 00:31:55,344
You both chat like a real couple.

514
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,384
Well, we have to make it
very realistic.

515
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,304
Franc has many minions on campus,

516
00:32:00,304 --> 00:32:02,204
if he knows that we are a fake couple,

517
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:03,694
he will chase after me again.

518
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:14,216
Dad, Mom!

519
00:32:17,684 --> 00:32:18,654
Hello.

520
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:23,244
Dad, Mom?

521
00:32:27,824 --> 00:32:29,324
Are you Baiwan's boyfriend?

522
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:33,444
You told your parents?

523
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:35,734
They saw it from my post.

524
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:42,114
On social media

525
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:43,679
everyone can see it...?

526
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:47,852
The same social media that Plawan said he would put Franc's clip on?

527
00:32:51,584 --> 00:32:53,184
Whoa,

528
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:54,784
you're like teenagers.

529
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,324
You know these social media platforms.

530
00:32:58,024 --> 00:32:59,734
80-year-old people use
the social media too.

531
00:33:01,394 --> 00:33:02,464
Come here, let's have a talk.

532
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:07,454
Stop!

533
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:10,644
Your dad and I will talk
with Kiew privately.

534
00:33:10,874 --> 00:33:11,934
Don't follow us.

535
00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:19,159
Aunt Ann and uncle Keng

536
00:33:19,184 --> 00:33:20,384
are very protective of you.

537
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,834
Kiew is in trouble now.

538
00:33:28,284 --> 00:33:29,184
When we were at Prach's house,

539
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:30,544
you didn't tell me that
you got married to Ann.

540
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,904
I thought Prach told you already.

541
00:33:35,904 --> 00:33:36,804
In the past,

542
00:33:36,804 --> 00:33:38,804
you two didn't like each other at all.

543
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:40,864
You get what you hate, right?

544
00:33:41,414 --> 00:33:42,404
You deserve it!

545
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:45,374
I don't think it's funny.

546
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,054
Kiew,

547
00:33:47,504 --> 00:33:50,034
you can't be with my daughter.

548
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:52,974
But it's nothing wrong with having
your friend as a son-in-law.

549
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:54,074
Kiew,

550
00:33:55,104 --> 00:33:56,704
if you don't have to go back
to the past,

551
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,494
I don't mind that you are
with my daughter.

552
00:34:00,684 --> 00:34:02,724
Baiwan is serious in love and she loves deeply.

553
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,044
When you have to go back to the past,

554
00:34:05,464 --> 00:34:06,884
she will suffer a lot from it.

555
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,947
Don't put my daughter
through that kind of pain.

556
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:11,884
This is not a big deal.

557
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,554
You don't have to see me
in person like this.

558
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:14,784
You can call me and talk on the phone.

559
00:34:16,064 --> 00:34:17,904
This is something serious.

560
00:34:17,904 --> 00:34:20,074
We have to talk in person to be clear.

561
00:34:21,774 --> 00:34:23,614
Ah, don't be stressed.
Don't be stressed!

562
00:34:24,144 --> 00:34:25,284
It's just a show.

563
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,344
Baiwan and I aren't
really together.

564
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:30,204
Why did you announce that
you're together?

565
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:32,414
It's about teenagers' stuff,

566
00:34:32,414 --> 00:34:33,744
old people shouldn't mind it.

567
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:36,124
Kiew,

568
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:38,694
if you didn't travel from the past,

569
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:41,164
you'd be the same age as me!
Damn, Kiew.

570
00:34:43,024 --> 00:34:43,904
You fight back? Huh?

571
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:45,144
Catch him! Catch him!

572
00:34:45,144 --> 00:34:49,704
- Ann, punish him now!
- Don't, Ann! I'm your son-in-law. Ann!

573
00:34:49,904 --> 00:34:51,714
No, you're not my son-in-law!

574
00:34:52,814 --> 00:34:53,934
I know you miss me, right?

575
00:34:56,424 --> 00:34:57,474
You miss me.

576
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:04,424
Baiwan, don't worry.

577
00:35:04,424 --> 00:35:07,284
I've talked with K…uncle.

578
00:35:07,434 --> 00:35:08,374
He says okay.

579
00:35:09,504 --> 00:35:11,664
Whoa, you're so protective of Baiwan.

580
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:12,934
How could you let her be with Kiew?

581
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:15,324
From what we talked about,

582
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:16,674
he seems to be a nice guy.

583
00:35:17,104 --> 00:35:18,094
But

584
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:21,024
if he hurts my daughter
and makes her cry,

585
00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:22,564
I won't let him stay alive!

586
00:35:23,194 --> 00:35:25,224
There will be no tears being with me,

587
00:35:25,394 --> 00:35:27,344
only laughter!

588
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:30,184
<i>If it's not too much,</i>

589
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:32,424
<i>I would like to ask you to be with me.</i>

590
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:35,874
<i>Don't you know
I've fallen for you for a long time.</i>

591
00:35:35,874 --> 00:35:36,984
What song is that?

592
00:35:37,264 --> 00:35:38,964
What?

593
00:35:39,044 --> 00:35:41,674
See! There's only laughter
being with me.

594
00:35:42,054 --> 00:35:43,664
Baiwan, take a look.
I'll show you the dance.

595
00:35:43,664 --> 00:35:45,984
<i>If it's not too much,</i>

596
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:48,264
<i>I would like to ask you to be with me.</i>

597
00:35:48,264 --> 00:35:51,394
<i>Don't you know
I've fallen for you for a long time.</i>

598
00:35:51,394 --> 00:35:52,184
Try the dance, now.

599
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:56,784
<i>If you're willing to, I'll ask you
to blend our hearts together.</i>

600
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:06,421
Take a pill!

601
00:36:07,464 --> 00:36:10,414
(Take a pill!)

602
00:36:14,354 --> 00:36:15,534
He didn't read it!

603
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:24,244
An out-of-season rainfall!

604
00:36:36,464 --> 00:36:38,454
I've been waiting for hours, Mr. Sky!

605
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:41,284
Don't just threaten!

606
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:42,504
Let the rain fall now.

607
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:44,774
Quiet.

608
00:36:45,488 --> 00:36:47,418
If you're this quiet,
the rain won't fall, right?

609
00:37:31,774 --> 00:37:32,724
Hey!

610
00:37:33,254 --> 00:37:34,394
You think I'm a ghost?

611
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:36,084
How come you're here?

612
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,174
I'm doing a scientific experiment.

613
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,704
I saw you so I came to say hi.

614
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:42,094
I want to be alone.

615
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:44,144
But I want to be with you.

616
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:47,844
I need to concentrate.

617
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:50,204
You can do whatever you want to.

618
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,444
I will be here and stay very quietly.

619
00:38:11,304 --> 00:38:13,624
How about this spot?

620
00:38:14,954 --> 00:38:16,304
You said that you'll be very quiet?

621
00:38:42,274 --> 00:38:43,184
Hey!

622
00:38:59,634 --> 00:39:00,844
Is your painting still okay?

623
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,734
It is.

624
00:39:09,064 --> 00:39:10,524
Hey! Where are you going?

625
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:16,156
Lightning! Strike me!

626
00:39:16,304 --> 00:39:17,794
Hit me now, quickly!

627
00:39:17,794 --> 00:39:20,544
Please strike me with your lightning!

628
00:39:20,544 --> 00:39:22,074
Please! Strike me!

629
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:23,109
Hey!

630
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,664
You came to get hit by lightning?
Is this your experiment?

631
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:27,864
You'll be dead
before finishing the experiment.

632
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:29,664
I won't die so easily.

633
00:39:29,664 --> 00:39:32,154
- Lightning, please strike me!
- Whoa!

634
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:36,404
Lightning strikes are stronger
now than when we were kids.

635
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,154
It's too dangerous!

636
00:39:38,324 --> 00:39:41,314
Let go of me! Let go of me!

637
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,234
Let me go!

638
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:53,144
This experiment involves
someone's life.

639
00:39:53,444 --> 00:39:55,004
Please let me go. I beg you.

640
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,744
If this experiment is so important

641
00:39:56,944 --> 00:39:59,364
that you'll trade your
life for it, then go ahead!

642
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:13,151
The rain is showering like this,
there's no more lightning.

643
00:40:15,494 --> 00:40:16,884
It isn't your fate
to die right now.

644
00:40:20,204 --> 00:40:21,754
What are you experimenting

645
00:40:22,164 --> 00:40:23,494
that you have to risk your life for it?

646
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:25,744
A time-machine door.

647
00:40:27,484 --> 00:40:28,994
Did you watch too many movies?

648
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:33,104
I witnessed it with my own eyes, it's real.

649
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:35,594
You might be dreaming or getting drunk.

650
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:41,014
If you don't believe me,

651
00:40:41,014 --> 00:40:42,414
I won't waste time explaining.

652
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:47,304
The rain is showering. I think
it's going to rain for quite some time.

653
00:40:48,554 --> 00:40:49,984
Wait till the rain stops
before we go home.

654
00:41:15,884 --> 00:41:17,604
You only look at the sky and the rain.

655
00:41:17,794 --> 00:41:19,834
I'm sitting here with you.
Don't you wanna talk to me?

656
00:41:20,404 --> 00:41:21,744
I don't have anything
to say to you.

657
00:41:24,058 --> 00:41:25,636
I'll find something to talk to you about.

658
00:41:34,084 --> 00:41:35,744
Your watch is awesome.

659
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:39,054
What is this human symbol?

660
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:41,664
It tells us how many steps
we walk for a day.

661
00:41:42,304 --> 00:41:44,944
Hey! It's so high-tech.

662
00:41:46,544 --> 00:41:48,694
And what about the heart symbol?

663
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:52,374
It shows the heart rate
per a minute.

664
00:41:53,164 --> 00:41:54,714
Hey! And what about…

665
00:41:54,714 --> 00:41:56,884
Hey! You asked too many questions!

666
00:41:59,404 --> 00:42:03,034
Ugh, a friend wont talk to me.

667
00:42:04,244 --> 00:42:05,904
The rain wont stop.

668
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,794
It's super cold!

669
00:42:13,794 --> 00:42:14,884
Follow me.

670
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:23,737
These are my spare clothes
to change into after I exercise.

671
00:42:31,164 --> 00:42:32,424
Shit!

672
00:42:32,734 --> 00:42:35,374
You have a flat stomach with muscles!

673
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:38,584
They're called 6-packs.

674
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:41,924
Yeah, that's it.

675
00:42:42,284 --> 00:42:43,614
I wanna have them too.

676
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:45,664
You can hire a trainer.

677
00:42:46,114 --> 00:42:47,464
What is a trainer?

678
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,344
You don't know what a trainer is?

679
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:53,134
Oh, I forgot that your family only talks
about old-fashioned stuff.

680
00:42:53,276 --> 00:42:55,584
A trainer is a teacher who teaches us
how to do the exercise.

681
00:42:55,584 --> 00:42:57,064
You can find them in every fitness center.

682
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,264
It means I have to pay for it.

683
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,074
Can you teach me?

684
00:43:01,074 --> 00:43:02,084
Nope.

685
00:43:06,444 --> 00:43:08,464
Bamee, a guy who is never friendly.

686
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,384
(Take a pill!)

687
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,994
I took a pill already.

688
00:43:26,544 --> 00:43:28,304
I asked you for so long,
and only now do you answer!

689
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,194
I was painting, so I turned
put my phone on silent mode.

690
00:43:31,824 --> 00:43:33,104
Do you mess with other people's lives

691
00:43:33,104 --> 00:43:34,824
like you're doing to mine?

692
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:40,284
I care for all of my friends.

693
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,614
Why don't you dry your hair?

694
00:43:46,664 --> 00:43:47,774
It will be dry on its own.

695
00:43:48,314 --> 00:43:50,204
You'll get a fever before it is dry.

696
00:43:51,114 --> 00:43:53,084
You don't take care of yourself,
just like your dad.

697
00:43:56,864 --> 00:43:58,924
How did you know I have
the same habits as my dad?

698
00:44:02,284 --> 00:44:03,934
Because my dad knows your dad.

699
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,686
He used to tell me about your dad.

700
00:44:07,894 --> 00:44:09,511
It's okay that
you don't take care of yourself.

701
00:44:09,854 --> 00:44:11,274
I'll take care of you.

702
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:43,734
Hey, the heart symbol shows
the heart rate, right?

703
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,984
Why the number is rising like this?

704
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,464
Are you alright? Hey!

705
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:50,064
It's nothing.

706
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:52,669
The watch got wet, so it might be an error.

707
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:08,384
Please take me home.

708
00:45:10,764 --> 00:45:12,063
We're going in different directions.

709
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:13,504
You can go home the way you got here.

710
00:45:14,384 --> 00:45:16,244
It's late at night.
It's difficult to find a taxi.

711
00:45:17,354 --> 00:45:19,258
You can use an app.
There's loads of them.

712
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:21,314
You know that I'm a low-tech person.

713
00:45:21,314 --> 00:45:22,883
I don't know how to use them.

714
00:45:24,204 --> 00:45:26,094
You insisted that
I have to take you home, right?

715
00:45:26,544 --> 00:45:27,922
Can you help me out?

716
00:45:35,044 --> 00:45:36,704
You're very helpful.

717
00:46:03,754 --> 00:46:06,644
When you are kind, you're so sweet.

718
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:08,384
Are you ready to go or not?

719
00:46:08,464 --> 00:46:09,574
Go go go!

720
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:26,384
The weather after the rain
smells so nice.

721
00:46:27,294 --> 00:46:28,284
Ouch!

722
00:46:33,994 --> 00:46:35,924
Why the hell are you standing?
The motorcycle can crash!

723
00:46:36,304 --> 00:46:38,184
No, it won't.
I know you're good at riding.

724
00:46:38,554 --> 00:46:40,434
You assume everything by yourself.
We'll die here.

725
00:46:40,594 --> 00:46:41,694
Sit down!

726
00:46:42,144 --> 00:46:44,184
No, I wanna stand up
and feel the wind here.

727
00:46:44,184 --> 00:46:46,004
It's so comfy!

728
00:46:47,024 --> 00:46:48,294
Then you get down on the street

729
00:46:48,294 --> 00:46:49,774
and find a taxi to get home by yourself.

730
00:46:50,514 --> 00:46:51,764
I'm just kidding.

731
00:46:51,764 --> 00:46:53,691
You don't have to be upset.

732
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:02,818
Can you sit properly?

733
00:47:03,224 --> 00:47:04,524
This is the most proper posture.

734
00:47:05,044 --> 00:47:06,875
I hug you, so I won't fall,

735
00:47:07,084 --> 00:47:08,414
and you'll know that

736
00:47:08,414 --> 00:47:10,154
I sit very still.

737
00:47:12,974 --> 00:47:14,144
Now you can go.

738
00:47:45,898 --> 00:47:48,541
(Past Senger)

739
00:47:52,004 --> 00:47:53,679
(Next Episode)
You look so awesome!

740
00:47:54,254 --> 00:47:55,804
I've come to see you here,

741
00:47:55,804 --> 00:47:57,014
I can't look too basic!

742
00:47:57,484 --> 00:47:58,494
Go!

743
00:47:58,504 --> 00:47:59,641
Let's go!

744
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:05,564
Oh, he helps him to wear shoes!

745
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:07,504
They must be so in love.

746
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:10,544
Oh, what I see now is already painful,

747
00:48:11,164 --> 00:48:13,204
and your words make my heart hurt!

748
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:15,168
What's wrong with that boy?

749
00:48:17,344 --> 00:48:18,884
You don't have to call him.

750
00:48:19,704 --> 00:48:21,274
Give me back my phone!

751
00:48:22,714 --> 00:48:25,304
You guys' concerns
don't make me feel any better.

752
00:48:26,289 --> 00:48:27,704
It's better to not worry
about me at all.

753
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:32,407
<i>I have something in my heart</i>

754
00:48:32,426 --> 00:48:37,479
<i>that feels deeper
than just being friends.</i>

755
00:48:37,903 --> 00:48:40,587
<i>I want you to know.</i>

756
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:43,160
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

757
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,540
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

758
00:48:48,783 --> 00:48:51,770
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

759
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:54,692
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

760
00:48:54,703 --> 00:48:56,668
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

761
00:48:56,678 --> 00:48:59,521
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

762
00:48:59,532 --> 00:49:03,271
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

763
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:06,015
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

764
00:49:06,025 --> 00:49:11,687
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose you.</i>

765
00:49:11,697 --> 00:49:14,577
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

766
00:49:14,587 --> 00:49:17,413
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

767
00:49:17,423 --> 00:49:19,624
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

768
00:49:19,634 --> 00:49:22,562
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

769
00:49:22,573 --> 00:49:28,260
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>
