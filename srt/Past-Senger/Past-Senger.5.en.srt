He's gonna sleep here tonight.

2
00:00:02,114 --> 00:00:04,295
I'm not OK to have a stranger
to sleep over at my house.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,209
Argh!

4
00:00:06,764 --> 00:00:08,070
I'm screaming now!

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:08,865
Argh!

6
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:10,285
I'm screaming too!

7
00:00:10,697 --> 00:00:11,773
Do I have to scream too?

8
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:13,502
Argh!

9
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,228
They even did it on campus.

10
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:17,244
That's right.

11
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,043
Baiwan, you need to
have a talk with him.

28

29

<i>I will not cross the line.</i>

36
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,935
Plawan, you go this way.

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,517
I'll go that way.

38
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:21,129
Okay.

39
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:26,164
Bamee! Bamee!

40
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:31,491
Oh, I thought it's Bamee.

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,578
Why are you following me?

42
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,693
I'm afraid of ghosts.

43
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,481
Coward! If we search together,
we're wasting time!

44
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,682
It's still better than seeing ghosts.

45
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,834
Whoa!

46
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,895
Let's check it out
and see what it is.

47
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,066
What if it's a ghost?

48
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:56,313
I'm gonna kick it away.

49
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,438
- Arghhhh.
- Arghhhh.

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,560
Ohhhh,

51
00:03:11,718 --> 00:03:13,085
you freaked me out!

52
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,674
I'm gonna keep
searching for Bamee.

53
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:20,391
So, what?

54
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:30,922
No matter what happens,

55
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,290
I'll stay beside you.

56
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,109
How come you came here?

57
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,620
Moodaeng is so worried about you,

58
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,091
so, he called Plawan
to help find you.

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,286
But I guessed that nobody knows
that I'm here.

60
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,293
We keep important pictures
in our bedroom.

61
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,470
You took a picture with your dad here.

62
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,129
So, it means that this place
must be very meaningful to you.

63
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,246
This place is filled
with my joy for me,

64
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:13,111
and for my dad.

65
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,316
When I'm out of energy,

66
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,239
I like to come here.

67
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,950
Are you full of energy now?

68
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,264
Yeah, but I don't wanna go home.

69
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:31,203
I won't let aunt Pim hurt
my feelings any more.

70
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:35,115
Then, let's go to Plawan's house first.

71
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,854
I don't want others to know
that my family has issues.

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,672
They already knew anyway.

73
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,742
All families have problems.

74
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:48,825
What matter is how
you deal with them.

75
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:05,809
- Boo!
- Argh!

76
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:24,317
Hello.

77
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,381
Yeah?

78
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,939
I'm hungry.

79
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:46,714
Can you find some snack for me please?

80
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,879
First water,
and now a snack?

81
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,246
Am I your slave?

82
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,072
Oh,

83
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,218
did you forget?

84
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,268
Oh, right. I'm your slave for now.

85
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,327
Bamee!

86
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,661
Don't ever leave me again!

87
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,729
I'm gonna move out of the house.

88
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,585
No, you can't.

89
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,921
I don't want you to go.

90
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,010
But I'm not happy staying home.

91
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:36,117
You can sleep over with me
during weekends.

92
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,501
Let's help find a place
to stay for Bamee at.

93
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:44,910
I have a place for rent.

94
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,204
Whoa,

95
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,790
you're so rich.

96
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,939
It's my dad's.
The place is available.

97
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,107
You can stay there for now.

98
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,716
How much is the rental rate?

99
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,640
You just need to pay utilities.

100
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,369
My dad is so kind, like a priest.

101
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,444
I will tell him when he comes back
from his seminar.

102
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,303
Wow,

103
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,926
so gorgeous and luxurious.

104
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,535
Whoa,

105
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,459
if you let others rent this room,

106
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,468
you can get like 10,000 Baht per month.

107
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,504
I'd better find somewhere else.

108
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,227
My dad requested you to stay here.

109
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,155
Do you wanna have a problem
with the dean?

110
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,266
Please say thank you to him for me.

111
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,311
Yeah, here's the key.

112
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,124
Wait,

113
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,118
where are you going?
Help set up the room first.

114
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,049
I know what I have to do.

115
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,738
Take a look!
We haven't brought everything here.

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,114
I'm gonna bring some more from the car.

117
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:03,155
Okay, now you can go.

118
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,220
This room is so cool!

119
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,628
I think when Kiew finishes
his errands he'll join us.

120
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,101
Slave,

121
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:28,556
open the door.

122
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,722
Whoa, it looks so comfy!

123
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,467
This is you room.

124
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,305
Then this is my room.

125
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,413
Are you gonna stay here?

126
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,414
Yeah,

127
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:53,338
I don't want you to be alone.

128
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:55,916
I told your dad already.

129
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:57,274
He said it's up to me.

130
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,250
Have you brought your belongings?

131
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,553
They're at the
front door.

132
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:01,953
Hey, no need to move.

133
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:06,930
Hey!

134
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:12,302
Whoa!

135
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,266
- Awesome!
- You badass!

136
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,640
It's so good to have a slave.

137
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,699
Whatever you want to eat,
you can get delivery.

138
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,599
These days, things are so convenient.

139
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,890
Why do you always talk like
you travelled from the ancient past?

140
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,293
The 90s isn't that ancient!

141
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,792
Your parents only talk about the 90s?

142
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,543
They don't talk about today at all?

143
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,631
Something like that.

144
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,254
When I have a school break,

145
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,459
can I visit your home?

146
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,679
I wanna try living in the 90s.

147
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,240
I wasn't born in that era. Please?

148
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:55,669
Yeah, yeah.

149
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,221
Okay!

150
00:10:01,505 --> 00:10:01,897
No.

151
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:09,759
Again?

152
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,259
You know your duty, right?

153
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,314
I don't have to say much, right?

154
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,179
Whoa!

155
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:19,237
Okay fine!

156
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,699
It's so nice to have a slave.

157
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,135
Hey,

158
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,817
do we want to do something fun?

159
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,187
Oh my gosh!

160
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,118
Do you dare?

161
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,817
Same rules. But now,

162
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:01,261
the loser has to be
a slave for a month.

163
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,749
You wanna get yourself
into trouble again!

164
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,106
You should beat me first.

165
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,443
We'll see.

166
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:33,883
Kiew!

167
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,782
Arghhhh!

168
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:46,865
Hey!

169
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,940
I'm finally back! Yayyy!

170
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,141
- I'm finally back!
- Kiew!

171
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,620
Hey!

172
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,236
What's wrong?

173
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,700
We got separated for
just less than 10 minutes

174
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,665
but you hug us like
we haven't met for 20 years.

175
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,851
You must stop drinking alcohol
from now on!

176
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,577
Hey, I'm going home first.

177
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,344
Yay, going home, Arghhh!

178
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,259
- Kiew!
- Can you hear me, Kiew?

179
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,216
- Kiew! Kiew!
- Kiew!

180
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,438
- Kiew!
- Mom!

181
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,023
Are you okay?

182
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:32,119
I'm okay!

183
00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:37,448
Are you alright?

184
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:40,469
I'm okay.

185
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,323
Okay, then.

186
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,570
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

187
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:13,491
Ouch!

188
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,215
What's wrong?

189
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,897
Shit!

190
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,860
Don't let your dirty hand touch my face.

191
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,322
I'm still in the same place.

192
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:57,106
What did you say?

193
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,635
Nothing.

194
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,970
Yayyy!

195
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,499
Awesome!

196
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,394
- Yayyy!
- Whoa!

197
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,449
Wanna do it one more time?

198
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,409
One more round?

199
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,000
No, actually the wheel was about to hit
the side of the race track.

200
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:35,466
No theory stated that

201
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:38,280
getting hit hard can make
you travel back in time.

202
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:41,973
Or was I in shock,

203
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,622
and hallucinated?

204
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:05,373
You can't sleep?

205
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,726
Yeah, I feel strange in this new place.

206
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,365
I can sleep anywhere.

207
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,186
You're so lucky.

208
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,441
Kiew!

209
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:38,271
Kiew!

210
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,378
Kiew!

211
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:42,261
Kiew!

212
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,795
You left me sleeping on the sofa
and didn't wake me up.

213
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,084
I did, but you didn't get up.

214
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:12,125
So, I left first. I was afraid that
I would be late for class.

215
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,549
What are you drawing?

216
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,724
Why did you have to hide?

217
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:21,280
Can I see?

218
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:40,658
What are you two doing?

219
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,921
We haven't drunk
coffee this morning.

220
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,235
Let's get some coffee?

221
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:49,214
Your treat, okay?

222
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,407
My treat, but Plawan pays.

223
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,318
Okay, it's my treat then.

224
00:18:55,346 --> 00:18:55,632
Let's go.

225
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:57,566
Yeah, let's go.

226
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,363
Bamee, let's go.

227
00:18:59,261 --> 00:18:59,840
Okay.

228
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,640
Let's go.

229
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,606
- You have to treat us this time.
- Sure.

230
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,120
- We go ahead!
- I can treat you all.

231
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,779
Because it's me! Right?

232
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,886
That's right.

233
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,878
You bastard!

234
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,955
You have a handsome face.
People still recognize you.

235
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,919
A bastard is scarier than a coward.

236
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:29,893
So, people recognize your face.

237
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,359
You bullied me!

238
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,480
- Hey!
- Hey!

239
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,427
You mess with a lot of people.

240
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:41,358
I'm not your only enemy.

241
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,874
My dad knows that you posted that clip.

242
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:47,460
He will take the money back.

243
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:49,092
It's good that your dad will come here.

244
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:50,622
So, he knows that
you didn't keep your word.

245
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,613
You're still chasing after Baiwan.

246
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,084
‘Cause I really love her.

247
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,293
You only talk the talk!

248
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,185
We have 4 people.

249
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:00,879
You only have 3.

250
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:02,380
Wanna start now?

251
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:03,980
Guys!

252
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,153
He's not brave but he
still wants to mess around.

253
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,530
These guys!

254
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,913
It's true that

255
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,088
people recognize bad guys
easier than cowards, like he said.

256
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,681
Will I be blamed
for the rest of my life?

257
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,471
I won't let that happen.

258
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:33,957
I will let the world know
that he's bullying you.

259
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,352
Trust me.

260
00:20:40,423 --> 00:20:42,469
I didn't see who I want to see.

261
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,950
I saw who I didn't want to see.

262
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,297
How I miss Baiwan!

263
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,152
She might be absent today?

264
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,154
She's very diligent.
She wouldn't miss a class.

265
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:55,904
But you didn't see her

266
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:57,347
because…

267
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,144
she wanted to avoid you.

268
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,920
Ouch!

269
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,092
If the truth hurts me,

270
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,989
don't say it.

271
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,244
- Don't have to say it.
- Franc!

272
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:09,485
Baiwan!

273
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:13,053
Am I dreaming?

274
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:15,525
Ouch!

275
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,965
It's true, you're not dreaming!

276
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:19,557
You!

277
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,405
You came to see me by yourself today?

278
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,512
You know how Kiew's like, right?

279
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,480
Then you miss me, right?

280
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:31,454
Yes, you're missed.

281
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,659
Baiwan misses me.

282
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:37,570
But,

283
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,770
not by me,

284
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:41,086
it's her.

285
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:50,516
Why are you here?

286
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,829
Stay still!

287
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,698
What are you doing?
Let me go! Let me go!

288
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,379
- Hi!
- Hi!

289
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:02,855
Let me go. What are you doing?

290
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,718
Let me go.

291
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,283
I'm Lukpear,

292
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,462
the girl who kissed Kiew the other day.

293
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,601
I was hired by someone to do this.

294
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,529
- Chin up!
- Don't be shy.

295
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,995
Look at the camera.

296
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,442
What's your name? Tell people.

297
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:53,664
There are so many people.

298
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:55,114
Damn.

299
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,225
You're very bad!

300
00:22:57,688 --> 00:22:58,892
Keep going, keep going.

301
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,490
Whoa! Look here!

302
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,609
Everybody come here!

303
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,839
You can see good-looking people
but they are so mean.

304
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,649
You must be so mean

305
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,412
to bully Kiew
to destroy his relationship.

306
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:13,380
No matter how good looking you are,
you're so mean.

307
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,792
We can't take it!

308
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:15,929
Damn!

309
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,447
I wish he will stay alone forever
and never find his soulmate.

310
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,479
Hey, that's enough!

311
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,110
- Argh!
- So bad!

312
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,287
How did you find Lukpear?

313
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:31,962
Social media makes
the world super small.

314
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,437
I checked Franc's friends' profiles,

315
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,533
so, I found out that Lukpear
is their friend from high-school.

316
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,675
So, I sent her a message.

317
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,613
The secret is revealed!

318
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,469
If you don't confess,

319
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,963
prepare 300,000 in cash to apologize.

320
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:45,999
In less than 5 minutes,

321
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,157
she called back right away.

322
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:49,006
Whoa,

323
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,099
you're the real Conan!

324
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,266
Of course, I am!

325
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:54,969
What does this have to do
with Conanthavisan?

326
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,362
No, they mean Conan, the detective!

327
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,889
It's easier to buy something to eat.

328
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:19,311
You eat only noodles
and pad-ka-pow for every meal.

329
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:21,115
You won't get enough nutrition.

330
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,248
Ouch! Ouch!

331
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,452
Ouch! Ouch!

332
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,065
Ouch!

333
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,367
Hey!

334
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,694
This is 2022!

335
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,661
We don't use toothpaste with scald wound!

336
00:24:43,954 --> 00:24:44,841
What do they do then?

337
00:24:46,662 --> 00:24:47,320
Watch me.

338
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:52,567
Ouch!

339
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,589
It's getting worse.

340
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,351
Let's see the doctor.

341
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,846
Come here, quick!

342
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,273
You can sit and wait on the sofa.

343
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,116
Finally, we ended up
with pad-ka-pow and fried egg.

344
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,809
If I wasn't clumsy,

345
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,935
I would get to eat the food you cook.

346
00:25:56,143 --> 00:25:57,207
I'll cook for you tomorrow.

347
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,366
Next time, you should be very careful.

348
00:26:01,087 --> 00:26:02,742
There are sharp tools
and hot things in the kitchen.

349
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,023
You look like an expert in the kitchen.

350
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,227
I think you are good at cooking.

351
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,977
My mom works hard,

352
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,421
so, I have to cook
for myself almost every meal.

353
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,013
Totally different from me.

354
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,349
This is my first time being
in the kitchen.

355
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,855
You've never cooked before?

356
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,656
I've never fried an egg.

357
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,414
Aunt Pim takes over the kitchen area.

358
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,354
She doesn't let anyone in.

359
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:29,423
Never mind,

360
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,023
I'll teach you.

361
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,877
Will you get to eat today?

362
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,110
It's all dirty now.

363
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:46,985
Let me do it.

364
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,955
You're annoying again.

365
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,599
You don't have Pong
and Plawan to lock me up.

366
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,553
You can do nothing to force me.

367
00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:41,515
Hey!

368
00:27:53,527 --> 00:27:54,541
I'm better than you thought.

369
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,443
I knew it's you guys.

370
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,015
Hi,

371
00:28:18,235 --> 00:28:19,033
how's your wound?

372
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,989
It still kind of hurts.

373
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:26,258
Ouch!

374
00:28:30,707 --> 00:28:31,101
Boo!

375
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,518
Get well soon!

376
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,690
I'm not a child!

377
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,237
Why are you here?

378
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,993
I'm lonely,

379
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,053
so, I asked my slave to pick me up.

380
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,877
I told mom

381
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:46,507
that I will read books
at a friend's place.

382
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,656
You started lying now? Huh?

383
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,454
No, I didn't.

384
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,454
I asked the slave to lecture me here.

385
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,774
It's almost exam time.

386
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,990
And I get to be with you here too.

387
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,730
Does it still hurt?

388
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,862
A bit.

389
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,853
Slave! Slave!

390
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,027
My name is Plawan.

391
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,650
Who is currently my slave.

392
00:29:26,662 --> 00:29:27,471
I don't know how to solve this one.

393
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:32,033
Let me see.

394
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:36,155
This one.

395
00:29:50,116 --> 00:29:51,134
Can you teach him?

396
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,801
I didn't hear you explain anything.

397
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:55,305
F is for fusion.

398
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,878
N is the mean value.

399
00:29:58,135 --> 00:29:59,340
Another one is 0.5.

400
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,230
That's good.

401
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:05,181
Why are you listening to me?

402
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,486
You can watch TV with Bamee.

403
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,039
Why?

404
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,272
Are you afraid that I'll know
if you teach him wrong?

405
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:16,672
Where are you going?

406
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,160
I'm thirsty.

407
00:30:18,598 --> 00:30:19,850
Sit here. I'll get it for you.

408
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,030
Bamee just got a small
injury, he can still do things.

409
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:30,582
Why is he doting on him so much?

410
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,698
Are you jealous?

411
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,520
No, I'm not!

412
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,140
I just think that Kiew is strange.

413
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,409
Okay.

414
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,590
You just keep working.

415
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,419
Thank you, slave.

416
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,346
You're too much now!

417
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,960
Haven't you watched a drama?

418
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,007
The boss calls the driver like this.

419
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,465
Don't let it be my turn.

420
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,332
I will not make a mistake
and become your slave.

421
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,607
Goodbye for now.

422
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,458
Drive safely.

423
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,434
A badass boy!

424
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,456
- Shit!
- Hey!

425
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,568
Why didn't you lock the door?

426
00:32:03,351 --> 00:32:04,604
There's only two of us.
Why do I have to lock?

427
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,206
Hey, I can take it off by myself.

428
00:32:14,354 --> 00:32:15,269
Can you?

429
00:32:33,486 --> 00:32:35,810
Hey! I can take it off by myself.

430
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:42,035
Hey, don't you listen to me? Hey!

431
00:32:43,113 --> 00:32:44,209
You keep complaining.

432
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,015
Lift your legs up.

433
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:46,654
I'm gonna take your clothes
to the basket.

434
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:49,720
Quick!

435
00:33:04,172 --> 00:33:05,716
Hey! Don't tell me

436
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,389
that you're gonna take a shower for me.

437
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,209
No, I don't want you to do that.

438
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:15,398
What now?

439
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,653
I'll just wash your hair for you.

440
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,466
Then you can take a shower.

441
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:24,183
Don't think that I'm a pervert
wanting to see your eggplant.

442
00:33:25,256 --> 00:33:25,988
Put your arm up.

443
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,310
Riding a motorcycle in Bangkok

444
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,889
is tougher than in your hometown.

445
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,000
- Can you handle it?
- Trust me.

446
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,696
Let's go or we'll be late.

447
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:15,974
Hold me tight.

448
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,768
I'll help.

449
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,324
So nice.

450
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,142
You have someone to feed you
when your hand is hurt.

451
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,027
Put your hand in a boiling water then.

452
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:42,446
You can try.

453
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,046
If a girl feeds a boy,

454
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,012
it doesn't look proper, Baiwan.

455
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,757
Let me do it.

456
00:35:51,195 --> 00:35:52,929
This is 2022!

457
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,379
Boys and girls can be best friends.

458
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,451
Nobody minds it.

459
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,014
But there should be some people
who still mind it.

460
00:35:59,805 --> 00:36:01,584
There's only you, dinosaur!

461
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,520
It's better than
letting it become a rumor.

462
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,259
You take care of Bamee
a lot already at the condo.

463
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,060
I'll help lighten your burden.

464
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:12,860
I'll do it!

465
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:13,797
Why?

466
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,673
You're not capable enough.

467
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,652
I don't like seeing it.
I'll do it myself.

468
00:36:24,636 --> 00:36:25,699
Chew a lot too.

469
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,511
Don't swallow too fast.

470
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:30,354
You have to eat veggies too.

471
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:32,930
So, you can get well soon.

472
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:33,659
They look good.

473
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,265
They taste really good too.

474
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,819
You're boasting.

475
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,064
Try them first and you'll know.

476
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:48,676
My hand is so much better now.

477
00:37:50,176 --> 00:37:51,282
But still not fully recovered.

478
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,551
Once you're fully recovered,
I'll stop feeding you.

479
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:55,572
Here.

480
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,138
Whoa, the taste!

481
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,568
Not delicious?

482
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,097
Super delicious!

483
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,230
I was so scared.

484
00:38:15,604 --> 00:38:16,274
What's next?

485
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,030
I wanna try the egg.

486
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,454
From what Kiew did

487
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,437
and from what you told me,

488
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,007
I think it's for sure.
No need to investigate.

489
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,319
But Kiew told me for sure,

490
00:38:53,804 --> 00:38:54,961
that he's not his type.

491
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:58,161
Maybe he doesn't realize
who he really is.

492
00:39:00,874 --> 00:39:01,793
Possibly.

493
00:39:05,631 --> 00:39:07,789
What if Bamee and Kiew
are in love with each other,

494
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,401
will you be sad?

495
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,462
Why should I be?

496
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:16,619
Emm.

497
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,777
Someone I love is happy.

498
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:23,746
I should be glad for him.

499
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:26,588
So,

500
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,346
do you like Kiew or Bamee?

501
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,001
Confess it now.

502
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,784
I'm not sure.

503
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,567
When I'm sure, I'll tell you.

504
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:38,899
Okay,

505
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,552
you are a handsome boy
who can choose anyone!

506
00:39:41,241 --> 00:39:42,628
You're so flirtatious!

507
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:43,453
You sassy!

508
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:15,207
Sigh,

509
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,193
Everyone is staring
at their phones...

510
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:19,562
This kind of a classroom
isn't fun at all.

511
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:31,544
You've been looking at your phone
and been stressed since last night.

512
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:33,560
What happened?

513
00:40:35,272 --> 00:40:35,892
Nothing.

514
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:37,840
Really?

515
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:38,950
Yeah.

516
00:40:39,754 --> 00:40:41,551
(Total balance: 846)

517
00:41:08,672 --> 00:41:10,386
You check your watch too often today.

518
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,238
What are you waiting for?

519
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:13,642
Nothing.

520
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,442
I'm finally done!

521
00:41:17,754 --> 00:41:18,984
Let’s go home.

522
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:20,601
Let's pack up.

523
00:41:27,243 --> 00:41:28,069
I'm leaving now.

524
00:41:28,545 --> 00:41:30,401
- See you!
- I'm leaving. Bye!

525
00:41:33,631 --> 00:41:34,585
See ya. Bye bye.

526
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:48,487
Where are you going?

527
00:41:50,502 --> 00:41:51,187
I have something to do.

528
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:43,346
He doesn't pick up.

529
00:42:46,255 --> 00:42:48,965
The number you have dialed
is not available at this time.

530
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:55,282
If I call Plawan,
he'll tell Moodaeng.

531
00:42:56,418 --> 00:42:57,189
It's gonna be a big issue.

532
00:43:53,174 --> 00:43:54,005
Where have you been?

533
00:43:54,691 --> 00:43:55,647
You didn't pick up my call.

534
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:57,538
I did some errands.

535
00:43:58,161 --> 00:43:59,720
Why so late?

536
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:01,847
Can I tell you later?

537
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:02,521
I'm tired.

538
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:04,894
You should clean up
the room sometimes.

539
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:21,546
Where did Calculus develop from?

540
00:44:21,808 --> 00:44:24,814
It's developed
from problems in algebra,

541
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:27,031
geometry, and physics.

542
00:44:27,214 --> 00:44:27,614
Hey!

543
00:44:27,938 --> 00:44:28,754
- Listen to the professor!
- And...

544
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:29,941
- You won't understand the lesson.
- There are 2 main

545
00:44:29,941 --> 00:44:33,225
concepts of Calculus,

546
00:44:33,572 --> 00:44:38,412
which are differential and quantitative.

547
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:50,507
You have gone out early at night

548
00:44:50,507 --> 00:44:51,955
and came back
at 3 o'clock for a week now.

549
00:44:52,892 --> 00:44:54,425
Can you tell me now
what you are doing?

550
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:56,086
Can I tell you later?

551
00:44:56,274 --> 00:44:56,765
I'm tired.

552
00:44:58,257 --> 00:44:59,524
You always say this.

553
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:01,867
What are you hiding from me?

554
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:03,931
Nothing.

555
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:05,683
I'm just not in the
mood to tell you.

556
00:45:06,569 --> 00:45:07,782
Don't tell anyone about this,

557
00:45:08,377 --> 00:45:09,482
or I'll move somewhere else.

558
00:45:29,621 --> 00:45:30,621
Mister,

559
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,000
Follow that bike, please.

560
00:45:59,295 --> 00:46:01,700
(Please close the door behind you.)

561
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,445
Excuse me, the shop is closed.

562
00:46:10,805 --> 00:46:11,588
We open at 8 P.M.

563
00:46:15,215 --> 00:46:15,692
And...

564
00:46:16,237 --> 00:46:17,498
this is the staff entrance.

565
00:46:17,915 --> 00:46:18,928
Customers can use the front door.

566
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:46,586
Hello, welcome here.

567
00:46:46,892 --> 00:46:48,545
Feel free to choose
who you want to talk to.

568
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:54,165
Is this a gay bar?

569
00:46:54,617 --> 00:46:56,149
We open for all genders
who want to find happiness.

570
00:46:56,185 --> 00:46:57,045
Which one would you like to talk to?

571
00:47:21,385 --> 00:47:25,114
(Past Senger)

572
00:47:25,215 --> 00:47:26,961
(Next Episode)

573
00:47:26,986 --> 00:47:27,665
Hey!

574
00:47:29,401 --> 00:47:30,407
What are you trying to do now?

575
00:47:32,132 --> 00:47:33,316
I'm finding happiness for myself.

576
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,338
If you wanna get a drink,

577
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:37,389
come sit next to me.

578
00:47:38,598 --> 00:47:39,418
I wanna go home.

579
00:47:40,843 --> 00:47:42,324
I, Ann, and Keng

580
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:44,317
talk about this every day.

581
00:47:45,913 --> 00:47:47,087
We still don't know what to do.

582
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:48,530
I think there should be some way.

583
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:50,364
Yeah? How?

584
00:47:50,726 --> 00:47:51,416
Lightning happens from...

585
00:47:52,176 --> 00:47:53,726
the merge of electric charges.

586
00:47:54,286 --> 00:47:56,128
If we use the generator
to release an electric charges

587
00:47:56,132 --> 00:47:56,964
inside of me

588
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,112
for the same amount
of time as lightning...

589
00:48:00,725 --> 00:48:01,713
I think it could be possible.

590
00:48:02,832 --> 00:48:04,137
<i>I want you to know.</i>

591
00:48:04,137 --> 00:48:06,704
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

592
00:48:06,715 --> 00:48:11,771
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

593
00:48:12,379 --> 00:48:15,352
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

594
00:48:15,363 --> 00:48:18,165
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

595
00:48:18,176 --> 00:48:20,141
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

596
00:48:20,151 --> 00:48:22,994
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

597
00:48:23,005 --> 00:48:26,744
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

598
00:48:26,754 --> 00:48:29,488
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

599
00:48:29,498 --> 00:48:35,160
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose you.</i>

600
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,050
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

601
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,886
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

602
00:48:40,896 --> 00:48:43,097
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

603
00:48:43,107 --> 00:48:46,035
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

604
00:48:46,046 --> 00:48:51,733
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>
