The food is ready just in time.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,093
Wow, they look so yummy, aunt Pim.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,923
Err…

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,638
it's you!

5
00:00:11,104 --> 00:00:13,744
You keep calling mommy as aunt Pim.

6
00:00:13,953 --> 00:00:15,633
I get confused now.

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,600
Now you blamed me!

8
00:00:18,428 --> 00:00:19,852
You said you wanna have a talk with me?

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,623
Why are you lying still
and looking at the stars?

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,320
You really can't remember me?

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,719
No, I can't.

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,200
At first, I want to wait
until his memories are back.

13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,699
But my time is up now.

14
00:00:32,724 --> 00:00:34,267
I'll call uncle Prach.

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,709
Then, I'll get ready in my room.

16
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,640
When you're leaving, just call me.

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,170
Can you please not go?

18
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:52,718
If I didn't pretend to ask Moodaeng,

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,465
you won't admit that
you can remember me now, right?

I might lose you.</i>

Bamee finally confessed to Kiew.

45
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,829
I really want to know

46
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,922
what their important mission is.

47
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,681
How about we secretly follow them?

48
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:56,540
You told me to not
follow them all the time.

49
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,860
It's none of our business.

50
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,729
You can tell me nicely.

51
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,180
You don't have to be harsh.

52
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,909
Now I'm sulking.

53
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,760
Okay.

54
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,060
Alright!

55
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,400
Hey!

56
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,290
Don't sulk now.

57
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,671
I was testing you to see if you
would try to make it up to me.

58
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,360
Who else would I want to make it up for?

59
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,630
I don't know.

60
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,991
You keep pedaling. I won't pedal now.

61
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,943
This really is the last day

62
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,614
that we are together.

63
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,204
Don't forget me.

64
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,340
I can't forget you.

65
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:09,362
My love.

66
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,345
I'll miss you every second.

67
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:44,250
I'll miss you every second, too.

68
00:04:56,484 --> 00:04:59,699
Thank you for making
Bamee remember me.

69
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:14,975
I will look at photos in
the phone when I miss you.

70
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:22,959
I will look at our photos every day.

71
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,712
I'm glad that you're
seeing me off.

72
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,303
Yeah.

73
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,087
Kiew, I hope this time you
can travel back to the past.

74
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,212
- Let's do it.
- Go!

75
00:05:57,195 --> 00:05:57,827
Come on.

76
00:05:58,671 --> 00:05:59,074
Go!

77
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,445
Come on, do it quick!

78
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,259
Hey!

79
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,118
You go first!

80
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,653
Hey, what are you doing?

81
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,899
Whoa!

82
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,040
Wow!

83
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,094
Hey, Kiew!

84
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:58,916
It worked!

85
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,120
Yay!

86
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,416
Whooo!

87
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,422
It's raining even harder!

88
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,839
Hey, just like the last time.

89
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,571
Hey!

90
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,820
Yay!

91
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,189
Kiew!

92
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,288
Good luck, Kiew!

93
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,480
- See you!
- Good luck, Kiew!

94
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,575
Have a safe trip!

95
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:08,527
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

96
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,304
Good luck, Kiew!

97
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,959
- Oh!
- He's gone!

98
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,390
Yay!

99
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,020
- He's finally gone!
- We did it!

100
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,500
- Yay!
- We did it! It works!

101
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,159
Argh!

102
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,970
Prach,

103
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:56,523
Keng, Ann,

104
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:57,991
Bamee!

105
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,149
Art! Art!

106
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,660
- Oh!
- Hey!

107
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,949
It's really you! Art!

108
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,069
Hey! What is wrong with you?

109
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,916
We haven't seen each other for 30 minutes!
You're acting like we haven't met for ages.

110
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,608
Well, who is Bamee?

111
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,831
You'll find out one day.

112
00:09:20,987 --> 00:09:21,594
Prach,

113
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:23,459
Ann, Keng!

114
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,900
Argh! Yay!

115
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,594
Hold up, hold up.

116
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,232
Where did you go?

117
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,140
You just got dressed up? We've
been searching for you for so long.

118
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:39,166
Now you're gonna redeem
the vow with us, right?

119
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,959
I'll tell you later.

120
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,544
It's raining now.
Let's redeem the vow later.

121
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,619
I'll see my mom first.

122
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,309
Mommy, I'm back!

123
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,310
Whooo! Mommy, I'm back!

124
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,109
He acted like he hasn't
been home in forever.

125
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,258
What is wrong with him?

126
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:38,219
Hey!

127
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:38,995
Prach!

128
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:39,676
Keng!

129
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:41,140
Why are you here?

130
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:42,297
I don't know.

131
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:48,947
Ann, hey!

132
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:51,009
Ann, are you alright?

133
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:56,304
Hey!

134
00:10:58,001 --> 00:10:59,806
Bamee! Bamee!

135
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:09,504
Why are we here?

136
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:11,184
That's right.

137
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:13,399
What were we doing here?

138
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:18,018
Bamee,

139
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:19,694
why are you here?

140
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,754
I can't remember either.

141
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,026
We're in strange costumes.

142
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,916
Hey! Whoa!

143
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,060
- Whoa!
- That's right.

144
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,830
Why did we dress up like this?

145
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,569
Hey! Keng!

146
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,756
What is wrong with you?

147
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:47,727
Why can't we remember anything?

148
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,274
Hey,

149
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,736
I think we should get out of here.

150
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,076
Hey, where are you going?

151
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:55,407
Stay here.

152
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:56,823
There's a sacred priest.

153
00:11:57,898 --> 00:11:58,879
Stay here.

154
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,049
Think it through. Figure it out here.

155
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,697
Kiew!

156
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:24,500
From now on,

157
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,042
I'll take care of you.

158
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:50,671
Hey, my watch!

159
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,253
My phone!

160
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:07,476
Where did they go?

161
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:16,641
Or future items can't be here
because they haven't produced them yet?

162
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:27,289
But this pager

163
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,356
can be in the future
because it already existed.

164
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:43,320
I have many of Bamee's photos
in that phone.

165
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,490
How is he now?

166
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:54,745
We were eating at home.

167
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,936
What? Don't do this. I'm scared.

168
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:01,812
My last memory,

169
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,197
I was laying down in my house.

170
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,636
I was reading at home.

171
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,266
I remembered that

172
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:14,135
we were eating at home.

173
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:17,175
I was eating with you at home.

174
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:18,370
Yeah.

175
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,509
- What is this?
- Why did we get here?

176
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,144
Nobody can remember anything.

177
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:24,422
What did we do at this Pho tree?

178
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,265
What happened here?

179
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,383
Hey!

180
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,029
- What?
- Just stay here.

181
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,069
- No! Go home!
- Figure it out here, Ann.

182
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,799
- Hey, Keng! Wait for me.
- I'm going now.

183
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,440
- Keng!
- Let's go home!

184
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,931
Bamee, come here quickly!

185
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,260
Bamee!

186
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:46,032
Yes, sir.

187
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,293
I miss you so much.

188
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:26,045
You hugged me
and said you missed me so much.

189
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:27,803
Who is So Much?

190
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,780
Are you in a good mood today?

191
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,765
You're joking.

192
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,889
I'm happy

193
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,935
because my son picked me up
in the rain.

194
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:50,570
I'm sorry

195
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:52,982
that I've always been naughty to you.

196
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:00,063
I'll be a good boy from now on.

197
00:17:02,348 --> 00:17:03,820
I won't make you suffer anymore.

198
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:37,338
Kiew!

199
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:42,320
Hey!

200
00:17:58,047 --> 00:17:59,081
Good night.

201
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,248
I'll count down to the
day that I'll see you.

202
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:36,748
Aunt Pim,

203
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,503
is this yours?

204
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:42,494
No, it's not.

205
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,368
Moodaeng.

206
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:52,733
Nope,

207
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:55,272
it's too old-fashioned,
I wouldn't have one.

208
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,035
This one is from 20 years ago.

209
00:19:00,504 --> 00:19:02,335
Can you remember who gave it to you?

210
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,660
Whose watch did I wear?

211
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:41,206
Eh?

212
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:43,626
What's this?

213
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:50,761
Why can't I remember who gave it to me?

214
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,393
Or do I have amnesia?

215
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:16,570
Let's watch this movie today.

216
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:18,846
Let's go.

217
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:21,218
Let Moodaeng go with us.

218
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,584
He's coming.

219
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:25,730
Otherwise you'll be lonely.

220
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:33,953
There's only 4
of us in the gang?

221
00:20:35,738 --> 00:20:36,515
What do you mean?

222
00:20:39,843 --> 00:20:42,017
Why do I feel like someone is missing?

223
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,495
Am I that someone?

224
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:48,318
Were you in my gang?

225
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:52,831
I'm having a party at home.

226
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,201
I want to ask Baiwan to join.

227
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,159
Are you cooking for it?

228
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,159
Of course.

229
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,232
If he doesn't cook,
he's afraid that you won't go.

230
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,620
Ah-ham!

231
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,057
Is someone's foot stuck in your throat?

232
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,987
Hey, if you're saying this,

233
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,706
I'll kick your throat.

234
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,759
Hahaha.

235
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,759
You fight back now.

236
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,819
He knows how to talk back now.

237
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,519
You're trying to be mean now.

238
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,468
I can't mess with you anymore, right?

239
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:29,594
It smells so good.

240
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:32,860
I can smell it all over the house.

241
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:34,591
It's delicious too.

242
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:37,146
I can't believe

243
00:21:37,605 --> 00:21:39,855
you've been a university student
for a few days.

244
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,407
You're very mature now.

245
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:44,989
It's not about the university.

246
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:48,038
But I just realized

247
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:50,326
that the time we spend
with our loved ones

248
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,768
is the most precious time.

249
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,625
I love you mommy.

250
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:02,507
I love you very much, too.

251
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:13,642
Tell me now.

252
00:22:14,438 --> 00:22:15,808
You just challenged the priest.

253
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:18,419
Why suddenly do you believe in him?

254
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,543
Is it because you were punished?

255
00:22:24,197 --> 00:22:25,560
Or the priest revealed
himself to you?

256
00:22:29,336 --> 00:22:30,794
The priest took me to the future.

257
00:22:33,765 --> 00:22:35,025
Did you watch too many movies?

258
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:41,277
What are you trying to prove
that you have to risk your life for it?

259
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,683
A time-machine portal.

260
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:46,783
Did you watch too many movies?

261
00:22:47,963 --> 00:22:48,849
You two are so alike.

262
00:22:50,506 --> 00:22:50,812
Who?

263
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:51,869
Who is so alike?

264
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:53,931
Forget it.

265
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:57,316
Let's say I believe now
that the priest is real.

266
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:04,570
You must quit drinking alcohol.

267
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,254
What's wrong with you?

268
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:08,787
You usually drink with me.

269
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:10,729
Why did you tell me to quit?

270
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:12,883
It's unhealthy.

271
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,314
I agree.

272
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:16,410
Everybody should quit drinking.

273
00:23:17,135 --> 00:23:17,876
Why do I have to believe you?

274
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:21,839
If you want to die from cirrhosis,
then go ahead.

275
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:27,540
The slap-and-kiss romance of the Thai film industry.

276
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:29,429
Dubbed in Thai by Panthamitr.

277
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,252
It's not a romance!

278
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,321
How can I quit?

279
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,728
It's so satisfying.

280
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:10,660
Do you have other staff apart from me?

281
00:24:11,469 --> 00:24:13,152
Only in the morning shift.

282
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,281
But you know everyone, don't you?

283
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,344
Why do I feel like there's someone else...

284
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:21,513
For the afternoon shift,

285
00:24:22,382 --> 00:24:23,762
there's only you and me.

286
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,457
Did you see someone else?

287
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,674
You're giving me goosebumps.

288
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,800
I didn't see ghosts in your café.

289
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,858
I might be sleep-deprived
and not fully focused.

290
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,856
It's only in my head.

291
00:24:40,597 --> 00:24:41,960
You can lose focus about anything.

292
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,166
But don't forget

293
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:49,823
what we have between us.

294
00:25:43,855 --> 00:25:45,440
You don't seem lively lately.

295
00:25:46,577 --> 00:25:47,838
Anything on your mind?

296
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:49,942
I don't know.

297
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,119
I feel lonely and empty.

298
00:25:54,338 --> 00:25:55,462
I can't describe it.

299
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:57,745
Or.

300
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,190
I didn't give enough time for you?

301
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:02,326
No, it's not like that.

302
00:26:03,084 --> 00:26:05,170
You take a very good
care of me as always.

303
00:26:08,962 --> 00:26:10,232
Is it too boring?

304
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,835
I think I'll take you
out to change the mood.

305
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:28,689
Last time, it was raining hardly.

306
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,099
We haven't performed for you.

307
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,265
Today we're back to perform for you.

308
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:37,420
Thank you for forgiving me.

309
00:26:40,242 --> 00:26:42,490
How did you know he'll forgive you?

310
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:44,780
Well,

311
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:48,542
if he didn't forgive me, I would be
dead because I disrespected him.

312
00:26:49,001 --> 00:26:51,811
I think you must've experienced something,

313
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,684
but didn't tell us.

314
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,533
Are you hiding a secret from us?

315
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,024
Yeah.

316
00:27:00,657 --> 00:27:02,136
Come on, let's do it.
The priest is waiting.

317
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,559
<i>I want to belong to someone.</i>

318
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,799
<i>Let's be in love.</i>

319
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,192
<i>I've been interested in you
for a long time.</i>

320
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,591
<i>Let's be in love.</i>

321
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,930
<i>I want to have
a nice person to be with.</i>

322
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:34,689
<i>I've been alone for a long time.
I'm afraid of being single.</i>

323
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,789
<i>Will you be okay?</i>

324
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,319
<i>What shall I do
when I get lost if I'm alone?</i>

325
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,489
<i>Will you be okay?</i>

326
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,989
<i>It's difficult to have a dream
when I'm alone.</i>

327
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,989
<i>Will you be okay?</i>

328
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,699
<i>When I feel down, who will I turn to?</i>

329
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,820
<i>It's a big deal for me.</i>

330
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,060
<i>If you don't mind,</i>

331
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,399
<i>I want you to be in love with me.</i>

332
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,661
<i>I've been interested in you
for a long time.</i>

333
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:05,489
<i>If you don't mind,</i>

334
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,079
<i>I want you
to blend our hearts together.</i>

335
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,160
<i>Just help me a little bit.</i>

336
00:28:19,563 --> 00:28:21,919
It's done. We've completed the mission.

337
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,529
Yayyy!

338
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,657
It's so good!

339
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:28,562
I still have one more show.

340
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:29,516
Huh?

341
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,040
Apart from the examination,

342
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:34,999
what did you pray for?

343
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,341
I prayed to be home.

344
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:39,629
You go back home every day.

345
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,669
Yeah.

346
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,678
Why are you talking strangely lately.

347
00:28:43,503 --> 00:28:44,541
Do you have a secret?

348
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:47,629
Reveal it now.

349
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,449
The priest won't let me tell anyone.

350
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,339
Huh?

351
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,785
Did he really show up?

352
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,821
Hey, let's say no more.

353
00:28:56,886 --> 00:28:58,223
I don't want to disobey the priest.

354
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,336
Perform your special show now.

355
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,817
You wore a Thai dancing costume to dance?

356
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:18,343
Wicked. You're so brave, Kiew.

357
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,740
You look beautiful in this costume.

358
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,579
Kiew, you should be a woman!

359
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:28,194
Shut up!

360
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:15,873
What's wrong?

361
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:24,311
Have we been here before?

362
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:27,786
This is the first time.

363
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,022
Why do I feel like
I've been here before?

364
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,801
But I couldn't remember who I was with.

365
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,817
Do you secretly have a fling?

366
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:42,741
If I do, I wouldn't be lonely like this.

367
00:30:44,232 --> 00:30:44,948
Or...

368
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:48,363
I'm not that someone
who can fulfill you anymore?

369
00:30:58,364 --> 00:31:00,009
If I ask to stay away
from you for a while,

370
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,765
will you be mad at me?

371
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,341
Do as you like.

372
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,520
I want you...

373
00:31:27,598 --> 00:31:28,383
to be happy.

374
00:31:49,593 --> 00:31:50,658
Please tell me,

375
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,174
who is my heart waiting for?

376
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,952
Who's this?

377
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:12,669
I've never seen him before.

378
00:33:14,532 --> 00:33:15,830
You took a lot of photos with him.

379
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,433
Can't you remember who he is?

380
00:33:19,776 --> 00:33:20,787
You two look so close.

381
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:22,940
If you can't remember him,

382
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,197
you should check your brain.

383
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:24,755
Right.

384
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:28,778
Take it.

385
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:50,562
I don't know who you are.

386
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,743
I'm happy just seeing your face.

387
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,140
I hope that you and I will meet again.

388
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:17,809
I'm so ready.

389
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,076
I'm leaving the house now.

390
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:21,056
Alright.

391
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,970
Am I handsome enough
to take you to the party?

392
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,635
You're more handsome
than Korean actors.

393
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,439
This is what I want to hear.

394
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,179
- Let's go now.
- Okay, mom.

395
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,248
Mommy.

396
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,709
Whoa!

397
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,120
Let's go.

398
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,269
She's so beautiful.

399
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,026
She's a working woman.

400
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,429
She can sing so well, too.

401
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,240
I really chose the right one.

402
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,779
Art and I were interested in her for a long
time. But it's you who took home the bone.

403
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,399
Hey, I'm not a dog.

404
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,330
Woof, woof.

405
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,503
Cheers! Cheers!

406
00:35:49,352 --> 00:35:50,391
Let's welcome

407
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,699
Madam Phongsee!

408
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:54,449
Mommy!

409
00:35:56,162 --> 00:35:57,610
Please join us.

410
00:36:01,352 --> 00:36:03,239
Everyone, please greet her.

411
00:36:03,472 --> 00:36:04,953
- Hello.
- Hello.

412
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:11,371
You all are good-looking as always.

413
00:36:11,372 --> 00:36:12,448
Yes, we are.

414
00:36:13,192 --> 00:36:15,781
Who are these teenagers?

415
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,784
Hello, I'm Moodaeng. I'm Pim's son.

416
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:24,334
Hello, I'm Plawan. I'm Prach's son.

417
00:36:24,622 --> 00:36:26,362
That's right.

418
00:36:26,822 --> 00:36:29,702
Hello, I'm Pokpong.
I'm a friend of Plawan.

419
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:31,162
That's right.

420
00:36:31,562 --> 00:36:34,502
Hello. I'm Baiwan.
I'm a daughter of Ann and Keng.

421
00:36:36,758 --> 00:36:38,793
You really take after them.

422
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:43,897
Hello. I'm Franc. I'm a friend
of Baiwan, Pokpong, and Plawan.

423
00:36:53,102 --> 00:36:54,902
(For uncle Kiew.)

424
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,526
We've finally met.

425
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:34,338
Do you know me?

426
00:37:35,602 --> 00:37:36,247
Can't you remember me?

427
00:37:37,142 --> 00:37:38,387
Do you know someone
who's called Kiew?

428
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,520
Dad's friend who's been to America
since they graduated.

429
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:46,206
Hello.

430
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:49,390
We've met before. A long time ago.

431
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:52,989
I can't remember.

432
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:56,553
Let's get to know
each other once again.

433
00:37:58,671 --> 00:37:59,012
Okay.

434
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:11,405
- If a sister like me…
- Huh?

435
00:38:12,694 --> 00:38:14,016
Well, I'm a funny person.

436
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:19,006
Is it wrong that I
don't want to get old?

437
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,993
Then you can do it as you like.

438
00:38:23,474 --> 00:38:24,539
And where is Kiew?

439
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:26,989
He went to get some medicine for me.

440
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:29,928
Where is Bamee?

441
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:31,393
I'm here, dad.

442
00:38:33,035 --> 00:38:34,021
Come join us.

443
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:37,124
Please welcome
the world-famous architect, Mr. Kiew.

444
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:40,232
Yay!

445
00:38:40,992 --> 00:38:42,532
Why is he so handsome?

446
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:43,790
He's so handsome.

447
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:46,030
Calm down, my friend.

448
00:38:47,564 --> 00:38:49,047
I saw in the card that it's for me.

449
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:50,461
Will you hold it like that?

450
00:38:54,286 --> 00:38:55,652
Welcome back to Thailand.

451
00:38:57,704 --> 00:39:00,811
Whoa!

452
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:07,267
<i> Just be your friend. </i>

453
00:39:07,382 --> 00:39:10,351
<i>I want you to know.</i>

454
00:39:10,352 --> 00:39:13,001
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

455
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:18,421
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

456
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,481
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

457
00:39:21,482 --> 00:39:24,141
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

458
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:26,591
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

459
00:39:26,592 --> 00:39:29,841
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

460
00:39:29,842 --> 00:39:34,945
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>

461
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:39,761
Whoa! Whoa!

462
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:41,011
Hey! I'm jealous now.

463
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:43,324
- We're friends.
- Oh, we're friends.

464
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:46,072
I was shocked.

465
00:39:48,197 --> 00:39:49,441
I've never hurt my wife.

466
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:52,232
- That's good.
- Don't let mom know.

467
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:53,573
He's the coolest!

468
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:55,675
I will get into
the faculty of architecture

469
00:39:56,622 --> 00:39:59,582
and become
a famous architect like uncle Kiew.

470
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:03,277
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

471
00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:09,218
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>

472
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,668
Let's celebrate
that we're all together.

473
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:19,117
Okay!

474
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:22,056
Mommy, let's try a bit. Not that one.

475
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:24,366
Please join us a little.

476
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:27,311
Cheers!

477
00:40:27,312 --> 00:40:28,718
Let's be happy.

478
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:30,205
Cheers to all.

479
00:40:34,189 --> 00:40:35,043
We're all here.

480
00:40:36,298 --> 00:40:37,226
- This is good.
- It's good.

481
00:40:37,675 --> 00:40:40,827
Hey, I'm happy
that you just drink for a party.

482
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:46,629
How can I quit? It's so satisfying.

483
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:57,545
You quit drinking now. It's unhealthy.

484
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:04,253
I believe you,

485
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:06,481
Kiew, my dear friend.

486
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:20,039
Back then,

487
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,490
you kept repeating to me that

488
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:23,894
I would die soon if I drank a lot.

489
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:25,139
It made me scared.

490
00:41:26,815 --> 00:41:29,297
Unlike Keng, do you know
why he quit drinking?

491
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:30,257
- It's because…
- Hey!

492
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:31,986
Stop it, Prach.

493
00:41:33,372 --> 00:41:35,489
Let me explain.

494
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:38,802
I quit drinking

495
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:41,892
because…

496
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:49,501
I'm scared of my wife.

497
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:52,596
I feel uncomfortable to tell you this.

498
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:54,330
You're actually afraid of your wife.

499
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:55,960
It's hard for me to accept.

500
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:57,840
Let's drink a little more.

501
00:41:57,841 --> 00:41:58,889
You too are so sweet like always.

502
00:42:00,971 --> 00:42:03,234
Did my dad gossip about us?

503
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:04,827
You now know about us.

504
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:09,282
Can you choose now?

505
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:13,292
My mom told you about me, too?

506
00:42:17,005 --> 00:42:19,098
So, it means
I still have a chance, right?

507
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:21,881
I will eat it myself.
You sit still here.

508
00:42:21,993 --> 00:42:23,204
- I can't really trust you.
- Go back to your seat.

509
00:42:27,901 --> 00:42:28,619
Are you single?

510
00:42:29,731 --> 00:42:30,417
Yes, I am.

511
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:32,367
Ah-ham,

512
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:36,780
mommy Phongsee, please get on the stage.

513
00:42:36,781 --> 00:42:38,640
- Me?
- It's you. Please get on the stage.

514
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,110
- It's only you, mommy.
- Sure.

515
00:42:40,111 --> 00:42:41,951
Let's give her a round of applause.

516
00:42:43,872 --> 00:42:45,652
It's our honor that you're here.

517
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:48,543
If I don't stop singing,
I hope you don't mind.

518
00:42:50,231 --> 00:42:52,027
Keep going, mommy.

519
00:42:52,921 --> 00:42:54,321
You can choose a song.

520
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:57,946
<i> Just be your friend. </i>

521
00:42:57,971 --> 00:43:00,960
<i>I want you to know.</i>

522
00:43:00,961 --> 00:43:03,690
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

523
00:43:03,691 --> 00:43:09,051
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

524
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:12,241
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

525
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:15,050
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

526
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,270
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

527
00:43:17,271 --> 00:43:20,460
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

528
00:43:20,461 --> 00:43:24,310
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>

529
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:25,044
Come away with me.

530
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:47,497
Do you remember?

531
00:44:01,442 --> 00:44:02,038
How about this guy?

532
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,776
He's the same person
as this one in the photo?

533
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:08,127
I folded them by myself.

534
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:11,968
Will you take my heart?

535
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:13,979
What are you playing at here?

536
00:45:14,992 --> 00:45:15,885
I'm serious.

537
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:19,437
I like you.

538
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:50,748
It's you, Kiew!

539
00:45:55,551 --> 00:45:59,200
<i>I still have you to always look at me</i>

540
00:45:59,201 --> 00:46:01,210
<i>and smile to me.</i>

541
00:46:01,211 --> 00:46:04,945
<i>You make my heart feel warm.</i>

542
00:46:06,939 --> 00:46:10,183
<i>You are willing to listen</i>

543
00:46:10,881 --> 00:46:12,610
<i>to all of my stories</i>

544
00:46:12,611 --> 00:46:16,271
<i>whether they're good or bad.</i>

545
00:46:17,711 --> 00:46:18,827
You've met me again, finally.

546
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:23,523
Are you still waiting for me?

547
00:46:29,811 --> 00:46:32,290
This time, you are not here
as a freshmen Kiew,

548
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:33,035
a friend of mine.

549
00:46:34,009 --> 00:46:35,631
But you are my dad's friend.

550
00:46:37,408 --> 00:46:38,178
I'm your dad's friend, so what?

551
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:46,186
<i>I have something in my heart that feels</i>

552
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:51,231
<i>deeper than just being friends.</i>

553
00:46:51,581 --> 00:46:54,470
<i>I want you to know.</i>

554
00:46:54,471 --> 00:46:57,170
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

555
00:46:57,171 --> 00:47:02,770
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

556
00:47:02,771 --> 00:47:05,660
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

557
00:47:05,661 --> 00:47:08,520
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

558
00:47:08,521 --> 00:47:10,710
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

559
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:13,530
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

560
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:17,110
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

561
00:47:17,111 --> 00:47:20,550
<i>I have something in my heart that feels</i>

562
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:25,760
<i>deeper than just being friends.</i>

563
00:47:25,761 --> 00:47:28,950
<i>I want you to know.</i>

564
00:47:28,951 --> 00:47:31,590
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

565
00:47:31,591 --> 00:47:37,160
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose everything.</i>

566
00:47:37,161 --> 00:47:40,140
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

567
00:47:40,141 --> 00:47:42,950
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

568
00:47:42,951 --> 00:47:45,120
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

569
00:47:45,121 --> 00:47:47,830
<i>How much you allow me to be.</i>

570
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:51,630
<i>In my heart, I just want you to know.</i>

571
00:47:51,631 --> 00:47:54,490
<i>I want to tell you that I love you.</i>

572
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:59,930
<i>But I'm still afraid
that I might lose you.</i>

573
00:47:59,931 --> 00:48:02,890
<i>I just tell you what's in my heart</i>

574
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:05,411
<i>and hug you in my dream.</i>

575
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:07,730
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

576
00:48:07,731 --> 00:48:10,870
<i>How much you allow me to be,</i>

577
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:16,601
<i>I will not cross the line.</i>
